We present a method to distinguish the high harmonics generated in individual
half-cycle of the driving laser pulse by mixing a weak ultraviolet pulse,
enabling one to observe the cutoff of each half-cycle harmonic. We show that
the detail information of the driving laser pulse, including the laser
intensity, pulse duration and carrier-envelope phase, can be {\it in situ}
retrieved from the harmonic spectrogram. In addition, our results show that
this method also distinguishes the half-cycle high harmonics for a pulse longer
than 10 fs, suggesting a potential to extend the CEP measurement to the
multi-cycle regime.
