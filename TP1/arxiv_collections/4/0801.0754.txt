Strong correlation effects in classical and quantum plasmas are discussed. In
particular, Coulomb (Wigner) crystallization phenomena are reviewed focusing on
one-component non-neutral plasmas in traps and on macroscopic two-component
neutral plasmas. The conditions for crystal formation in terms of critical
values of the coupling parameters and the distance fluctuations and the phase
diagram of Coulomb crystals are discussed.
