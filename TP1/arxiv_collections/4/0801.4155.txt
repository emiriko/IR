We report the exact solution of spectral problem for a graphene sheet framed
by two armchair- and two zigzag-shaped boundaries. The solution is found for
the $\pi$ electron Hamiltonian and gives, in particular, a closed analytic
expression of edge-state energies in graphene. It is shown that the lower
symmetry of graphene, in comparison with $C_{6h}$ of 2D graphite, has a
profound effect on the graphene band structure. This and other obtained results
have far going implications for the understanding of graphene electronics. Some
of them are briefly discussed.
