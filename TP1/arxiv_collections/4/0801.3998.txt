Using the equation of state of the string model with linear strings comes
close to describing the lattice QCD results and offers an explanation for the
E/N = 1 GeV hadronization condition found in phenomenological statistical
model. The E/N = 6T relation is derived from the zero pressure condition and is
a fairly general result. The baryochemical potential dependence of the hadron
gas can be met if it is re-interpreted in the framework of an additive quark
model.
