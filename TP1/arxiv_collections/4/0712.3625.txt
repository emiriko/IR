We use the low energy effective $U(1)^r$ action on the Coulomb branch of
${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory to construct approximate field
configurations for solitonic dyons in these theories, building on the brane
prong description developed in hep-th/0101114. This dovetails closely with the
corresponding description of these dyons as string webs stretched between
D-branes in the transverse space. The resulting picture within these
approximations shows the internal structure of these dyons (for fixed
asymptotic charges) to be molecule-like, with multiple charge cores held
together at equilibrium separations, which grow large near lines of marginal
stability. Although these techniques do not yield a complete solution for the
spatial structure (i.e. all core sizes and separations) of large charge
multicenter dyons in high rank gauge theories, approximate configurations can
be found in specific regions of moduli space, which become increasingly
accurate near lines of marginal stability. We also discuss string webs with
internal faces from this point of view.
