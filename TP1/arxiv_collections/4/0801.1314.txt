In the first part of this series of two papers, we proposed a theoretical
formalism that enables one to model and categorize heterogeneous materials
(media) via two-point correlation functions S2 and introduced an efficient
heterogeneous-medium (re)construction algorithm called the "lattice-point"
algorithm. Here we discuss the algorithmic details of the lattice-point
procedure and an algorithm modification using surface optimization to further
speed up the (re)construction process. The importance of the error tolerance,
which indicates to what accuracy the media are (re)constructed, is also
emphasized and discussed. We apply the algorithm to generate three-dimensional
digitized realizations of a Fontainebleau sandstone and a boron
carbide/aluminum composite from the two- dimensional tomographic images of
their slices through the materials. To ascertain whether the information
contained in S2 is sufficient to capture the salient structural features, we
compute the two-point cluster functions of the media, which are superior
signatures of the micro-structure because they incorporate the connectedness
information. We also study the reconstruction of a binary laser-speckle pattern
in two dimensions, in which the algorithm fails to reproduce the pattern
accurately. We conclude that in general reconstructions using S2 only work well
for heterogeneous materials with single-scale structures. However, two-point
information via S2 is not sufficient to accurately model multi-scale media.
Moreover, we construct realizations of hypothetical materials with desired
structural characteristics obtained by manipulating their two-point correlation
functions.
