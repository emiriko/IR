This report concerns the energy of a zero-temperature many-body system of
spin 1/2 fermions in the unitary limit. In a previous report (arXiv:0705.0944)
this energy was determined to be xi~0.24 in units of the free gas kinetic
energy, appreciably lower than most reports giving ~0.45$. In our calculation
the 2-body interaction satisfied exactly the unitary limit i.e. infinite
scattering length and effective range r_0=0. In the present report results with
r_0>0are shown. A strong dependence on the effective range is found. It is for
example found that an increase to r_0=1 fm increases xi to ~ 0.4 close to other
reports of xi in the unitary limit. It is concluded that because of the
singular character of the unitary limit it is necessary to verify that the
interaction actually satisfies unitarity.
  The calculations done here in a pp-ladder approximation show a resonance in
the in-medium interaction close to (and in) the unitary limit. This was already
found in the previous work.
