Global gauge symmetry becomes more intricate in low dimensional QFT. We
survey the mathematical concepts leading to the relevant analogues of the (D=4)
Doplicher-Haag-Roberts theory of superselection sectors and internal symmetry.
We also review a recently uncovered duality between braid and quantum group
representations in an extension of the chiral su(2)_k WZNW model for
nonnegative integer level k.
