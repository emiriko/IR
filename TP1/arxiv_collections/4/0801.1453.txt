The zero-temperature phase diagram of binary mixtures of particles
interacting via a screened Coulomb pair potential is calculated as a function
of composition and charge ratio. The potential energy obtained by a Lekner
summation is minimized among a variety of candidate two-dimensional crystals. A
wealth of different stable crystal structures is identified including
$A,B,AB_2, A_2B, AB_4$ structures [$A$ $(B)$ particles correspond to large
(small) charge.] Their elementary cells consist of triangular, square or
rhombic lattices of the $A$ particles with a basis comprising various
structures of $A$ and $B$ particles. For small charge asymmetry there are no
intermediate crystals besides the pure $A$ and $B$ triangular crystals.
