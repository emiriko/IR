The propagation of a domain wall in a submicron ferromagnetic spin-valve
stripe is investigated using giant magnetoresistance. A notch in the stripe
efficiently traps an injected wall stopping the domain propagation. The authors
show that the magnetic field at which the wall is depinned displays a
stochastic nature. Moreover, the depinning statistics are significantly
different for head to head and tail-to-tail domain walls. This is attributed to
the dipolar field generated in the vicinity of the notch by the pinned layer of
the spin-valve.
