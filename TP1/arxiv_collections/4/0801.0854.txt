Localized charged states and phase segregation are described in the framework
of the phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory of phase transitions. The
Coulomb interactions determines the charge distribution and the characteristic
length of the phase separated states. The phase separation with charge
segregation becomes possible because of the large dielectric constant and the
small density of extra charge in the range of charge localization. The phase
diagram is calculated and the energy gain of the phase separated state is
estimated. The role of the Coulomb interaction is elucidated.
