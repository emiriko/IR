This paper proposes new symmetries (the body-centred cubic periodic
symmetries) beyond the standard model. Using a free particle expanded
Schrodinger equation with the body-centred cubic periodic symmetry condition,
the paper deduces a full baryon spectrum (including mass M, I, S, C, B, Q, J
and P) of all 116 observed baryons. All quantum numbers of all deduced baryons
are completely consistent with the corresponding experimental results. The
deduced masses of all 116 baryons agree with (more than average 98 percent) the
experimental baryon masses using only four constant parameters. The
body-centred cubic periodic symmetries with a periodic constant ``a'' about
$10^{-23}$m play a crucial rule. The results strongly suggest that the new
symmetries really exist. This paper predicts some kind of ``Zeeman effect'' of
baryons, for example: one experimental baryon N(1720)${3/2}^{+}$ with $ \Gamma$
= 200 Mev is composed of two N baryons [(N(1659)${3/2}^{+}$ +
N(1839)${3/2}^{+}$] = $\bar{N(1749)}$${3/2}^{+}$ with $\Gamma$ = 1839-1659 =
180 Mev.
