Tuning one's shower in some hotels may turn into a challenging coordination
game with imperfect information. The temperature sensitivity increases with the
number of agents, making the problem possibly unlearnable. Because there is in
practice a finite number of possible tap positions, identical agents are
unlikely to reach even approximately their favorite water temperature. We show
that a population of agents with homogeneous strategies is evolutionary
unstable, which gives insights into the emergence of heterogeneity, the latter
being tempting but risky.
