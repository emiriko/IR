Deconfined regions created in heavy ion collisions are bordered by the
confined phase. We discuss boundary conditions (BCs) to model a cold exterior.
Monte Carlo simulations of pure SU(3) lattice gauge theory with thus inspired
BCs show scaling. Corrections to usual results survive in the finite volume
continuum limit and we estimate them in a range from L=5-10 fermi as function
of the volume size $L^3$. In magnitude these corrections are comparable to
those obtained by including quarks.
