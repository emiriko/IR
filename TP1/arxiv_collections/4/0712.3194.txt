Recent progress in the understanding of gravity on noncommutative spaces is
discussed. A gravity theory naturally emerges from matrix models of
noncommutative gauge theory. The effective metric depends on the dynamical
Poisson structure, absorbing the degrees of freedom of the would-be U(1) gauge
field. The gravity action is induced upon quantization.
