By analyzing the apparent horizon (AH) formation in the collision of two
pp-waves with rectangular sources in four dimensions, we study to what extent
the AH can be distorted without violating the energy conditions. It is shown
that the highly distorted AH can form in this system although it cannot be
arbitrarily long. The hoop conjecture is examined for the formation of such
highly distorted AHs, and our result gives a strong support to the hoop
conjecture. We also point out the possible relation between the AH topology
theorem and the hoop conjecture.
