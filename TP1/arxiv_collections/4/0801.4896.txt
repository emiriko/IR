A complete analysis of proton recoil asymmetry in neutron decay in the first
order of radiative and recoil corrections is presented. The possible
contributions from new physics are calculated in terms of low energy coupling
constants, and the sensitivity of the measured asymmetry to models beyond the
Standard model are discussed.
