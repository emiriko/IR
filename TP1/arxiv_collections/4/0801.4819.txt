The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) in the second orbital Landau level
at filling factor 5/2 remains enigmatic and motivates our work. We consider the
effect of the quasi-2D nature of the experimental FQH system on a number of FQH
states (fillings 1/3, 1/5, 1/2) in the lowest, second, and third Landau levels
(LLL, SLL, TLL,) by calculating the overlap, as a function of quasi-2D layer
thickness, between the exact ground state of a model Hamiltonian and the
consensus variational wavefunctions (Laughlin wavefunction for 1/3 and 1/5 and
the Moore-Read Pfaffian wavefunction for 1/2). Using large overlap as a
stability, or FQHE robustness, criterion we find the FQHE does not occur in the
TLL (for any thickness), is the most robust for zero thickness in the LLL for
1/3 and 1/5 and for 11/5 in the SLL, and is most robust at finite-thickness
(4-5 magnetic lengths) in the SLL for the mysterious 5/2 state and the 7/3
state. No FQHE is found at 1/2 in the LLL for any thickness. We examine the
orbital effects of an in-plane (parallel) magnetic field finding its
application effectively reduces the thickness and could destroy the FQHE at 5/2
and 7/3, while enhancing it at 11/5 as well as for LLL FQHE states. The
in-plane field effects could thus be qualitatively different in the LLL and the
SLL by virtue of magneto-orbital coupling through the finite thickness effect.
In the torus geometry, we show the appearance of the threefold topological
degeneracy expected for the Pfaffian state which is enhanced by thickness
corroborating our findings from overlap calculations. Our results have
ramifications for wavefunction engineering--the possibility of creating an
optimal experimental system where the 5/2 FQHE state is more likely described
by the Pfaffian state with applications to topological quantum computing.
