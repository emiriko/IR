We have studied incommensurate spin ordering in single crystal underdoped
La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4} with x~0.08, 0.05 and 0.025 using neutron scattering
techniques. Static incommensurate magnetic order is observed in the
La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4} (x=0.05 and 0.025) compounds with ordering wavevectors
which are rotated by 45 degree about the commensurate (0.5,0.5,0) position,
with respect to that in the superconducting x=0.08 material. These spin
modulations are one dimensional in the x=0.05 and 0.025 samples, with ordering
wavevectors lying along the orthorhombic b* direction. Such a rotation in the
orientation of the static spin ordering as a function of increasing Ba doping,
from diagonal to collinear, is roughly coincident with the transition from an
insulating to a superconducting ground state and is similar to that observed in
the related La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} system. This phenomenon is therefore a
generic property of underdoped La-214 cuprates.
