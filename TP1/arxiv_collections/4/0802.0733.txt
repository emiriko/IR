Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo optimization algorithm and a computer
simulation, I find the passenger ordering which minimizes the time required to
board the passengers onto an airplane. The model that I employ assumes that the
time that a passenger requires to load his or her luggage is the dominant
contribution to the time needed to completely fill the aircraft. The optimal
boarding strategy may reduce the time required to board and airplane by over a
factor of four and possibly more depending upon the dimensions of the aircraft.
In addition, knowledge of the optimal boarding procedure can inform decisions
regarding changes to methods that are employed by a particular carrier. I
explore some of the salient features of the optimal boarding method and discuss
practical modifications to the optimal. Finally, I mention some of the benefits
that could come from implementing an improved passenger boarding scheme.
