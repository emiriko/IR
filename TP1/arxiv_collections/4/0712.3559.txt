The terascale will be explored with the start of the LHC. One of the most
fundamental questions which we expect to be answered is the root of electroweak
symmetry breaking and whether the Higgs mechanism is realized in nature or not.
In this context we pose the question if existing experimental data still allow
for a light non-minimal Higgs sector. We tackle this question first in the
context of the two Higgs doublet model and then we concentrate in two
supersymmetric models, the constrained MSSM and the MSSM with non-universal
Higgs masses. In both supersymmetric scearios, light pseudoscalar and light
charged-Higgs bosons are still viable provided tan beta is large. In this
regime, we emphasize the importance of the constraints provided by the decay B
to tau nu mediated by the charged-Higgs at tree-level. In addition we comment
on generic predictions for hadronic colliders and indirect searches in such
scenarios.
