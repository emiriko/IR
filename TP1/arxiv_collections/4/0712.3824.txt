The Fermilab Tevatron Collider is currently the most copious source of
b-hadrons, thanks to the large b-bbar production cross-section in
  1.96 TeV ppbar collisions. Recent detector upgrades allow for a wide range of
CP violation and flavor-mixing measurements that are fully competitive
(asymmetries in self-tagging modes) or complementary (asymmetries of B_s and
b-baryons decays) with B-factories. In this paper we review some recent CP
violation results from the DO and CDF Collaborations and we discuss the
prospects for future measurements.
