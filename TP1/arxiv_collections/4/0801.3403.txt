Hall magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) properties near a two-dimensional (2D) X-type
magnetic neutral line in the steady state are considered via heuristic and
rigorous developments. Upon considering the steady-state as the asymptotic
limit of the corresponding \textit{time-dependent} problem and using a rigorous
development, Hall effects are shown to be able to sustain the hyperbolicity of
the magnetic field (and hence a more open X-point configuration) near the
neutral line in the steady state. The heuristic development misses this subtle
connection of the steady state with the corresponding \textit{time-dependent}
problem and predicts only an elongated current-sheet configuration (as in
resistive MHD). However, the heuristic development turns out to be useful in
providing insight into the lack of dependence of the reconnection rate on the
mechanism breaking the frozen-in condition of the magnetic field lines. The
latter result can be understood in terms of the ability of the ions and
electrons to transport equal amounts of magnetic flux per unit time out of the
reconnection region.
