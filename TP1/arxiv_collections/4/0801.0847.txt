We argue that immune system is an adaptive complex system. It is shown that
it has emergent properties. Its network structure is of the small world network
type. The network is of the threshold type, which helps in avoiding
autoimmunity. It has the property that every antigen (e.g.virus or bacteria) is
typically attacked by more than one effector. This stabilizes the equilibrium
state. Modelling complex systems is discussed. Cellular automata (CA) type
models are successful but there are much less analytic results about CA than
about other less successful models e.g. partial differential equations (PDE). A
compromise is proposed
