We develop a theory of the conductance of superconductor/normal
metal/superconductor junctions in the case where the superconducting order
parameter has d-wave symmetry. At low temperature the conductance is
proportional to the square root of the inelastic electron relaxation time in
the bulk of the superconductor. As a result it turns out to be much larger than
the conductance of the normal part of the junction.
