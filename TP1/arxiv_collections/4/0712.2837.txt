We show how voting may be viewed naturally from an algebraic perspective by
viewing voting profiles as elements of certain well-studied
$\mathbb{Q}S_n$-modules. By using only a handful of simple combinatorial
objects (e.g., tabloids) and some basic ideas from representation theory (e.g.,
Schur's Lemma), this allows us to recast and extend some well-known results in
the field of voting theory.
