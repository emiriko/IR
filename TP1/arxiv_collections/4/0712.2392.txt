High temperature copper-oxide-based superconductivity is obtained by adding
carriers to insulating "parent compounds". It is widely believed the parent
compounds are "Mott" insulators, in which the lack of conduction arises from
anomalously strong electron-electron repulsion, and that the unusual properties
of Mott insulators are responsible for high temperature superconductivity. This
paper presents a comparison of optical conductivity measurements and
theoretical calculations which challenges this belief. The analysis indicates
that the correlation strength in the cuprates is not as strong as previously
believed, that the materials are not properly regarded as Mott insulators, that
antiferromagnetism is essential to obtain the insulating state and, by
implication, that antiferromagnetism is essential to the properties of the
doped metallic and superconducting state as well.
