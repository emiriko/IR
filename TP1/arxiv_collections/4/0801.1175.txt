Recently, a novel Direct String Magnetic Gradiometer (DSMG) has been
developed, where a vibrating wire, driven by an AC current, is used as a single
sensitive element. It is designed to directly measure the local off-diagonal
components of the magnetic gradient tensor, Bxz, Byz and Bxy, provided the
distance to an object creating magnetic anomalies is much larger than the
length of the string. This requirement is well satisfied in space, if the
sensor is deployed from a satellite platform orbiting near the planet under
surveillance. Current instruments operating at $1{kPa}$ pressure achieve
sensitivity of $1.8 \times 10^{-10}{T}/{m}$ in the band $0.0001{Hz}$ to
$0.1{Hz}$. In this paper we show that proposed modifications to the current
gradiometer design, specifically aimed at the deployment in space, could have a
magnetic gradient sensitivity better than $10^{-13}{T}/{m}/\sqrt{Hz}$ in the
frequency range of interest for specific missions both for fundamental research
and for such applications as geophysical exploration on Mars and other solar
system planets. Also, by combining a few single-axis magnetic gradiometer
modules, it is possible to deploy a full tensor magnetic gradiometer.
