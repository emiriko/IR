Several theorems are demonstrated that determine the sufficient conditions
for the existence of synchronized states (periodical and chaotic) and also of
travelling waves in a CML. Also are analytically proven the existence of
period-doubling cascades for the mentioned patterns. The temporal state of any
oscillators are completely characterized. The given results are valid for a
number of arbitrary oscillators whose individual dynamics is ruled by an
arbitrary C^{2} function.
