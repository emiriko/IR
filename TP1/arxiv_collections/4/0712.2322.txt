In this paper we analyze the existence, stability, dynamical formation and
mobility properties of localized solutions in a one-dimensional system
described by the discrete nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a linear
point defect. We consider both attractive and repulsive defects in a focusing
lattice. Among our main findings are: a) the destabilization of the on--site
mode centered at the defect in the repulsive case; b) the disappearance of
localized modes in the vicinity of the defect due to saddle-node bifurcations
for sufficiently strong defects of either type; c) the decrease of the
amplitude formation threshold for attractive and its increase for repulsive
defects; and d) the detailed elucidation as a function of initial speed and
defect strength of the different regimes (trapping, trapping and reflection,
pure reflection and pure transmission) of interaction of a moving localized
mode with the defect.
