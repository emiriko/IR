Non-dissipative Josephson current through nanoscale superconducting
constrictions is carried by spectroscopically sharp energy states, so-called
Andreev bound states. Although theoretically predicted almost 40 years ago, no
direct spectroscopic evidence of these Andreev bound states exists to date. We
propose a novel type of spectroscopy based on embedding a superconducting
constriction, formed by a single-level molecule junction, in a microwave QED
cavity environment. In the electron-dressed cavity spectrum we find a polariton
excitation at twice the Andreev bound state energy, and a superconducting-phase
dependent ac Stark shift of the cavity frequency. Dispersive measurement of
this frequency shift can be used for Andreev bound state spectroscopy.
