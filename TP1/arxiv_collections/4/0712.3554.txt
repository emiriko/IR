The theory of ghost imaging is developed in a Gaussian-state framework that
both encompasses prior work - on thermal-state and biphoton-state imagers - and
provides a complete understanding of the boundary between classical and quantum
behavior in such systems. The core of this analysis is the expression derived
for the photocurrent-correlation image obtained using a general Gaussian-state
source. This image is expressed in terms of the phase-insensitive and
phase-sensitive cross-correlations between the two detected fields, plus a
background. Because any pair of cross-correlations is obtainable with classical
Gaussian states, the image does not carry a quantum signature per se. However,
if the image characteristics of classical and nonclassical Gaussian-state
sources with identical auto-correlation functions are compared, the
nonclassical source provides resolution improvement in its near field and
field-of-view improvement in its far field.
