We have calculated the p-wave phase shifts and scattering length of $^6$Li.
For this we solve the $p$ partial wave Schr\"odinger equation and analyze the
validity of adopting the semiclassical solution to evaluate the constant
factors in the solution. Unlike in the $s$ wave case, the semiclassical
solution does not provide unique value of the constants. We suggest an
approximate analytic solution, which provides reliable results in special
cases. Further more, we also use the variable phase method to evaluate the
phase shifts. The p-wave scattering lengths of $^{132}$Cs and $^{134}$Cs are
calculated to validate the schemes followed. Based on our calculations, the
value of the $p$ wave scattering length of $^6$Li is $-45a_o$.
