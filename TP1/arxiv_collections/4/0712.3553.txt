Unstable periodic orbits are known to originate scars on some eigenfunctions
of classically chaotic systems through recurrences causing that some part of an
initial distribution of quantum probability in its vicinity returns
periodically close to the initial point. In the energy domain, these
recurrences are seen to accumulate quantum density along the orbit by a
constructive interference mechanism when the appropriate quantization (on the
action of the scarring orbit) is fulfilled. Other quantized phase space
circuits, such as those defined by homoclinic tori, are also important in the
coherent transport of quantum density in chaotic systems. The relationship of
this secondary quantum transport mechanism with the standard mechanism for
scarring is here discussed and analyzed.
