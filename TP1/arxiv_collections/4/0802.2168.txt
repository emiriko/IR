We address the reconstruction of the full photon distribution of multimode
fields generated by seeded parametric down-conversion (PDC). Our scheme is
based on on/off avalanche photodetection assisted by maximum-likelihood
(MaxLik) estimation and does not involve photon counting. We present a novel
constrained MaxLik method that incorporates the request of finite energy to
improve the rate of convergence and, in turn, the overall accuracy of the
reconstruction.
