A scheme for probabilistic entanglement generation between two distant single
electron doped quantum dots, each placed in a high-Q microcavity, by detecting
strong coherent light which has interacted dispersively with both subsystems
and experienced Faraday rotation due to the spin selective trion transitions is
discussed. In order to assess the applicability of the scheme for distant
entanglement generation between atomic qubits proposed by T.D. Ladd et al. [New
J. Phys. 8, 184 (2006)] to two distant quantum dots, one needs to understand
the limitations imposed by hyperfine interactions of the quantum dot spin with
the nuclear spins of the material and by non-identical quantum dots.
Feasibility is displayed by calculating the fidelity for Bell state generation
analytically within an approximate framework. The fidelity is evaluated for a
wide range of parameters and different pulse lengths, yielding a trade-off
between signal and decoherence, as well as a set of optimal parameters.
Strategies to overcome the effect of non-identical quantum dots on the fidelity
are examined and the timescales imposed by the nuclear spins are discussed,
showing that efficient entanglement generation is possible with distant quantum
dots. In this context, effects due to light hole transitions become important
and have to be included. The scheme is discussed for one- as well as for
two-sided cavities, where one must be careful with reflected light which
carries spin information. The validity of the approximate method is checked by
a more elaborate semiclassical simulation which includes trion formation.
