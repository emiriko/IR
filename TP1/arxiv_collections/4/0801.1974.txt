The prospects for central exclusive diffractive (CED) production of MSSM
Higgs bosons at the LHC are reviewed. It is shown that the CED channels, making
use of forward proton detectors at the LHC installed at 220 m and 420 m
distance around ATLAS and / or CMS, can provide important information on the
Higgs sector of the MSSM. In particular, CED production of the neutral CP-even
Higgs bosons h and H and their decays into bottom quarks has the potential to
probe interesting regions of the M_A--tan_beta parameter plane of the MSSM and
may give access to the bottom Yukawa couplings of the Higgs bosons up to masses
of M_H \approx 250 GeV.
