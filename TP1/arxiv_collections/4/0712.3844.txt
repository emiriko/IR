A supersymmetric field theory of light diffusion in semi-infinite disordered
media is presented. With the help of this technique we justify--at the
perturbative level--the local light diffusion proposed by Tiggelen, Lagendijk,
and Wiersma [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{84}, 4333 (2000)], and show that the
coherent backscattering line shape of medium bar displays a crossover from
two-dimensional weak to quasi-one-dimensional strong localization.
