We develop a theory describing the dynamics of quantum kicked rotators
(modelling cold atoms in a pulsed optical field) which are subjected to
combined amplitude and timing noise generated by a renewal process (acting as
an engineered reservoir). For waiting-time distributions of variable exponent
(L\'evy noise), we demonstrate the existence of a regime of nonexponential loss
of phase coherence. In this regime, the momentum dynamics is subdiffusive,
which also manifests itself in a non-Gaussian limiting distribution and a
fractional power-law decay of the inverse participation ratio. The purity
initially decays with a stretched exponential which is followed by two regimes
of power-law decay with different exponents. The averaged logarithm of the
fidelity probes the sprinkling distribution of the renewal process. These
analytical results are confirmed by numerical computations on quantum kicked
rotators subjected to noise events generated by a Yule-Simon distribution.
