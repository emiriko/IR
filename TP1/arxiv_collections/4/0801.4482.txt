UV photoinduced fragmentation of protonated aromatics amino acids have
emerged the last few years, coming from a situation where nothing was known to
what we think a good understanding of the optical properties. We will mainly
focus this review on the tryptophan case. Three groups have mostly done
spectroscopic studies and one has mainly been involved in dynamics studies of
the excited states in the femtosecond/picosecond range and also in the
fragmentation kinetics from nanosecond to millisecond. All these data, along
with high level ab initio calculations, have shed light on the role of the
different electronic states of the protonated molecules upon the fragmentation
mechanisms.
