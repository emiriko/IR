Recently, a method to image molecular electronic wave functions using high
harmonic generation (HHG) was introduced by Itatani \textit{et al.\} [Nature
{\textbf{432}}, 876 (2004)]. We show that, while the tomographic reconstruction
of general orbitals with arbitrary symmetry cannot be performed with long laser
pulses, this becomes possible when extremely short pulses are used. An
alternative reconstruction equation based on momentum matrix elements, rather
than on dipole matrix elements, is proposed. We present simulations of the
procedure for 2D model systems based on numerical solutions of the
time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation, and present results from further
post-processing of the reconstructed orbitals.
