The relativistic Faddeev equation for three-nucleon scattering is formulated
in momentum space and directly solved in terms of momentum vectors without
employing a partial wave decomposition. The equation is solved through Pad\'e
summation, and the numerical feasibility and stability of the solution is
demonstrated. Relativistic invariance is achieved by constructing a dynamical
unitary representation of the Poincar\'e group on the three-nucleon Hilbert
space. Based on a Malfliet-Tjon type interaction, observables for elastic and
break-up scattering are calculated for projectile energies in the intermediate
energy range up to 2 GeV, and compared to their nonrelativistic counterparts.
The convergence of the multiple scattering series is investigated as a function
of the projectile energy in different scattering observables and
configurations. Approximations to the two-body interaction embedded in the
three-particle space are compared to the exact treatment.
