A parton-shower model for hadronic collisions based on the emission
properties of QCD dipoles is proposed. This proposal therefore extends the
well-known radiation pattern of pure final-state colour dipoles to QCD
initial-state radiation, both of which are treated perturbatively.
Corresponding dipole splitting functions are derived and the kinematics of all
dipole splittings is discussed. Application to hadron production in
electron-positron annihilation, to Drell-Yan lepton-pair and QCD jet production
yields encouraging results.
