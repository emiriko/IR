We analyze a supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking model proposed by Intriligator,
Seiberg and Shih in a supergravity (SUGRA) framework. This is a simple and
natural setup which demands neither extra superpotential interactions nor an
additional gauge symmetry. In the SUGRA setup, the U(1)R symmetry is explicitly
broken by the constant term in the superpotential, and pseudo-moduli field
naturally takes non-zero vacuum expectation value through a vanishing
cosmological constant condition. Sfermions tend to be heavier than gauginos,
and the strong-coupling scale is determined once a ratio of sfermion to gaugino
masses is fixed.
