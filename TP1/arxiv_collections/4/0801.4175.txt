We present a gauge-invariant theory of the electromagnetic response of a
chiral px+ipy superconductor in the clean limit. Due to the spontaneously
broken time-reversal symmetry, the effective action of the system contains an
anomalous term not present in conventional superconductors. As a result, the
electromagnetic charge and current responses contain anomalous terms, which
depend explicitly on the chirality of the superconducting order parameter.
These terms lead to a number of unusual effects, such as coupling of the
transverse currents to the collective plasma oscillations and a possibility of
inducing the charge density by the magnetic field perpendicular to the
conducting planes. We calculate the antisymmetric part of the conductivity
tensor (the intrinsic Hall conductivity) and show that it depends on the wave
vector of the electromagnetic field. We also show that the Mermin-Muzikar
magnetization current and the Hall conductivity are strongly suppressed at high
frequencies. Finally, we discuss implications of the theory to the experiments
in Sr2RuO4.
