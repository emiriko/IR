We solve the Percus-Yevick equation in two dimensions by reducing it to a set
of simple integral equations. We numerically obtain both the pair correlation
function and the equation of state for a hard disc fluid and find good
agreement with available Monte-Carlo calculations. The present method of
resolution may be generalized to any even dimension.
