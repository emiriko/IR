Real-time systems are computing systems in which the meeting of their
requirements is vital for their correctness. Consequently, if the real-time
requirements of these systems are poorly understood and verified, the results
can be disastrous and lead to irremediable project failures at the early phases
of development. The present work addresses the problem of detecting deadlock
situations early in the requirements specification phase of a concurrent real
time system, proposing a simple proof-of-concepts prototype that joins
scenario-based requirements specifications and techniques based on topology.
The efforts are concentrated in the integration of the formal representation of
Message Sequence Chart scenarios into the deadlock detection algorithm of
Fajstrup et al., based on geometric and algebraic topology.
