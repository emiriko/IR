We study the dynamics of a point particle in a periodic array of spherical
scatterers, and construct a stochastic process that governs the time evolution
for random initial data in the limit of low scatterer density (Boltzmann-Grad
limit). A generic path of the limiting process is a piecewise linear curve
whose consecutive segments are generated by a Markov process with memory two.
