The properties of the uniform Bose gas is studied within the optimized
variational perturbation theory (Gaussian approximation) in a self-consistent
way. It is shown that the atomic BEC with a repulsive interaction becomes
unstable when the gas parameter gamma=rho a^3 exceeds a critical value
gamma_{crit} ~ 0.01. The quantum corrections beyond the Bogoliubov-Popov
approximation to the energy density, chemical potential and pressure in powers
of gamma expansions are presented.
