The infrared behavior of the gluon and ghost propagators is studied in SU(2)
Euclidean Yang-Mills theory in the maximal Abelian gauge within the
Gribov-Zwanziger framework. The nonperturbative effects associated with the
Gribov copies and with the dimension two condensates are simultaneously encoded
into a local and renormalizable Lagrangian. The resulting behavior turns out to
be in good agreement with the lattice data.
