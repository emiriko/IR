In this manuscript, recent theoretical investigations by the authors in the
area of oxide multilayers are briefly reviewed. The calculations were carried
out using model Hamiltonians and a variety of non-perturbative techniques.
Moreover, new results are also included here. They correspond to the generation
of a metallic state by mixing insulators in a multilayer geometry, using the
Hubbard and Double Exchange models. For the latter, the resulting metallic
state is also ferromagnetic. This illustrates how electron or hole doping via
transfer of charge in multilayers can lead to the study of phase diagrams of
transition metal oxides in the clean limit. Currently, these phase diagrams are
much affected by the disordering standard chemical doping procedure, which
introduces quenched disorder in the material.
