The formation of out-of-equilibrium patterns is a characteristic feature of
spatially-extended, biodiverse, ecological systems. Intriguing examples are
provided by cyclic competition of species, as metaphorically described by the
`rock-paper-scissors' game. Both experimentally and theoretically, such
non-transitive interactions have been found to induce self-organization of
static individuals into noisy, irregular clusters. However, a profound
understanding and characterization of such patterns is still lacking. Here, we
theoretically investigate the influence of individuals' mobility on the spatial
structures emerging in rock-paper-scissors games. We devise a quantitative
approach to analyze the spatial patterns self-forming in the course of the
stochastic time evolution. For a paradigmatic model originally introduced by
May and Leonard, within an interacting particle approach, we demonstrate that
the system's behavior - in the proper continuum limit - is aptly captured by a
set of stochastic partial differential equations. The system's stochastic
dynamics is shown to lead to the emergence of entangled rotating spiral waves.
While the spirals' wavelength and spreading velocity is demonstrated to be
accurately predicted by a (deterministic) complex Ginzburg-Landau equation,
their entanglement results from the inherent stochastic nature of the
system.These findings and our methods have important applications for
understanding the formation of noisy patterns, e.g., in ecological and
evolutionary contexts, and are also of relevance for the kinetics of
(bio)-chemical reactions.
