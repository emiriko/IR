We report measurements of magneto-resistance commensurability peaks, induced
by a square array of anti-dots, in GaAs (311)A two-dimensional holes as a
function of applied in-plane strain. The data directly probe the shapes of the
Fermi contours of the two spin subbands that are split thanks to the spin-orbit
interaction and strain. The experimental results are in quantitative agreement
with the predictions of accurate energy band calculations, and reveal that the
majority spin-subband has a severely distorted Fermi contour whose anisotropy
can be tuned with strain.
