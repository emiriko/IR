In part 1, we proposed a model of dynamics of wetting for slow movements near
a contact line formed at the interface of two immiscible fluids and a solid
when viscous dissipation remains bounded. The contact line is not a material
line and a Young-Dupr\'e equation for the apparent dynamic contact angle taking
into account the line celerity was proposed. In this paper we consider a form
of the interfacial energy of a solid surface in which many small oscillations
are superposed on a slowly varying function. For a capillary tube, a scaling
analysis of the microscopic law associated with the Young-Dupr\'e dynamic
equation yields a macroscopic equation for the motion of the contact line. The
value of the deduced apparent dynamic contact angle yields for the average
response of the line motion a phenomenon akin to the stick-slip motion of the
contact line on the solid wall. The contact angle hysteresis phenomenon and the
modelling of experimentally well-known results expressing the dependence of the
apparent dynamic contact angle on the celerity of the line are obtained.
Furthermore, a qualitative explanation of the maximum speed of wetting (and
dewetting) can be given.
