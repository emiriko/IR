Low momentum two-nucleon interactions obtained with the renormalization group
method and the similarity renormalization group method are used to study the
cutoff dependence of low energy 3N and 4N scattering observables. The residual
cutoff dependence arises from omitted short-ranged 3N (and higher) forces that
are induced by the renormalization group transformations, and may help to
estimate the sensitivity of various 3N and 4N scattering observables to
short-ranged many-body forces.
