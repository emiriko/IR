We study the leading isospin-breaking contributions to the two-nucleon
two-pion exchange potential due to explicit Delta degrees of freedom in chiral
effective field theory. In particular, we find important contributions due to
the delta mass splittings to the charge symmetry breaking potential that act
opposite to the effects induced by the nucleon mass splitting.
