The "pseudodual" of Ward's modified chiral model is a dispersionless limit of
the matrix Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation. This relation allows to carry
solution techniques from KP over to the former model. In particular, lump
solutions of the su(m) model with rather complex interaction patterns are
reached in this way. We present a new example.
