The onset of antiprotonic X-ray transitions at high principal quantum numbers
and the occurence of electronic X-rays in antiprotonic argon, krypton, and
xenon has been analyzed with the help of Multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock
calculations. The shell-by-shell ionisation by Auger electron emission,
characterised by appearance and disappearance of X-ray lines, is followed
through the antiprotonic cascade by considering transition and binding energies
of both the antiproton and the remaining electrons. Electronic lines could be
attributed partly to specific states of the antiprotonic atom de-excitation.
