Data from LEP2 on hadron production in gamma gamma interactions at high pT
exceed the predictions of QCD by about an order of magnitude. The amplitude for
the process is asymptotically proportional to the sum of the squares of the
charges of quarks. The data are suggestive of models where quarks have unit
charges, or larger. Unequivocal tests could be made with the ILC or CLIC, but a
plasma wakefield e-e- collider might provide the most affordable option.
