We present details of our experimental and theoretical study of the
components of the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) in (Ga,Mn)As. We develop
experimental methods to yield directly the non-crystalline and crystalline AMR
components which are then independently analyzed. These methods are used to
explore the unusual phenomenology of the AMR in ultra thin (5nm) (Ga,Mn)As
layers and to demonstrate how the components of the AMR can be engineered
through lithography induced local lattice relaxations. We expand on our
previous [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{99}, 147207 (2007)] theoretical analysis and
numerical calculations to present a simplified analytical model for the origin
of the non-crystalline AMR. We find that the sign of the non-crystalline AMR is
determined by the form of spin-orbit coupling in the host band and by the
relative strengths of the non-magnetic and magnetic contributions to the
impurity potential.
