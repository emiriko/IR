We construct a new static solution to the 5D Einstein-Maxwell equations
describing a static black hole surrounded by a non-rotating dipole black ring.
The configuration is kept in equilibrium by an external magnetic field
interacting with the dipole charge of the black ring. The properties of the
black Saturn-like configuration are studied and the basic physical quantities
are calculated. The solution demonstrates 2-fold continuous non-uniqueness of
the 5D magnetized static neutral black objects for fixed total mass and Melvin
background.
