A lattice model is used to estimate the self-diffusivity of entangled cyclic
and linear polymers in blends of varying compositions. To interpret simulation
results, we suggest a minimal model based on the physical idea that constraints
imposed on a cyclic polymer by infiltrating linear chains have to be released,
before it can diffuse beyond a radius of gyration. Both, the simulation, and
recently reported experimental data on entangled DNA solutions support the
simple model over a wide range of blend compositions, concentrations, and
molecular weights.
