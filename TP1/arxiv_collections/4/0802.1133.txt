Simple algorithm of dynamics of Ising magnetic is described. The algorithm
can be implemented on conventional digital computer and can be used for
construction of specialized processor for simulation of ferromagnetic systems.
The algorithm gives a simple way to calculate 1D correlation functions for 1D
Ising magnetic.
