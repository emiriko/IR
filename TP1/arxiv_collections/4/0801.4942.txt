We propose an unified approach to loop quantum gravity and Fedosov
quantization of gravity following the geometry of double spacetime fibrations
and their quantum deformations. There are considered pseudo-Riemannian
manifolds enabled with 1) a nonholonomic 2+2 distribution defining a nonlinear
connection (N-connection) structure and 2) an Arnowitt-Deser-Misner 3+1
decomposition. The Ashtekar-Barbero variables are generalized and adapted to
the N-connection structure which allows us to write the general relativity
theory equivalently in terms of Lagrange-Finsler variables and related
canonical almost symplectic forms and connections. The Fedosov results are
re-defined for gravitational gauge like connections and there are analyzed the
conditions when the star product for deformation quantization is computed in
terms of geometric objects in loop quantum gravity. We speculate on equivalence
of quantum gravity theories with 3+1 and 2+2 splitting and quantum analogs of
the Einstein equations.
