We investigate the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) on the lattice by
directly measuring the product <Jmu Jnu> (where J is the vector current) and
comparing it with the expectation values of bilinear operators. This will
determine the Wilson coefficients in the OPE from lattice data, and so give an
alternative to the conventional methods of renormalising lattice structure
function calculations. It could also give us access to higher twist quantities
such as the longitudinal structure function F_L = F_2 - 2 x F_1. We use overlap
fermions because of their improved chiral properties, which reduces the number
of possible operator mixing coefficients.
