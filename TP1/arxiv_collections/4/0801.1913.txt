Dynamics is considered as a corollary of the space-time geometry. Evolution
of a particle in the space-time is described as a chain of connected equivalent
geometrical objects. Space-time geometry is determined uniquely by the world
function $\sigma $. Proper modification of the Minkowskian world function for
large space-time interval leads to wobbling of the chain, consisted of timelike
straight segments. Statistical description of the stochastic world chain
coincides with the quantum description by means of the Schr\"{o}dinger
equation. Proper modification of the Minkowskian world function for small
space-time interval may lead to appearance of a world chain, having a shape of
a helix with timelike axis. Links of the chain are spacelike straight segments.
Such a world chain describes a spatial evolution of a particle. In other words,
the helical world chain describes the particle rotation with superluminal
velocity. The helical world chain associated with the classical Dirac particle,
whose world line is a helix. Length of world chain link cannot be arbitrary. It
is determined by the space-time geometry and, in particular, by the elementary
length. There exists some discrimination mechanism, which can discriminate some
world chains.
