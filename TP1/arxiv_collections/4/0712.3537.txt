In this article we present a continuous time model for natural gas and crude
oil future prices. Its main feature is the possibility to link both energies in
the long term and in the short term. For each energy, the future returns are
represented as the sum of volatility functions driven by motions. Under the
risk neutral probability, the motions of both energies are correlated Brownian
motions while under the historical probability, they are cointegrated by a
Vectorial Error Correction Model. Our approach is equivalent to defining the
market price of risk. This model is free of arbitrage: thus, it can be used for
risk management as well for option pricing issues. Calibration on European
market data and numerical simulations illustrate well its behavior.
