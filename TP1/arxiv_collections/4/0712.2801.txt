The evolution of the turbulent energy spectrum for the inviscid spectrally
truncated Euler equations is studied by closure calculations. The observed
behavior is similar to the one found in direct numerical simulations
[Cichowlas, Bona\"ititi, Debbasch, and Brachet, Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 264502
(2005)]. A Kolmogorov spectral range and an equipartition range are observed
simultaneously. Between these two ranges a "quasi-dissipative" zone is present
in the kinetic energy spectrum. The time evolution of the wave number that
marks the beginning of the equipartition range is analyzed and it is shown that
spectral nonlocal interactions are governing this evolution.
