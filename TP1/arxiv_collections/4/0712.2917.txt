This is a comment to hep-th/0703243. The paper determined the relaxation time
tau_pi of the shear viscous stress for the N=4 SYM from AdS/CFT correspondence.
The purpose of this comment is to point out that the value of tau_pi is 3 times
larger than their result if one takes into account an additional term in the
hydrodynamic equation.
