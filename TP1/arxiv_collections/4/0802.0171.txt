We present the dominant two-loop electroweak corrections to the partial decay
widths to gluon jets and prompt photons of the neutral CP-odd Higgs boson A^0,
with mass M_{A^0} < 2 M_W, in the two-Higgs-doublet model for low to
intermediate values of the ratio tan(beta) = v_2/v_1 of the vacuum expectation
values. They apply as they stand to the production cross sections in hadronic
and two-photon collisions, at the Tevatron, the LHC, and a future photon
collider. The appearance of three gamma_5 matrices in closed fermion loops
requires special care in the dimensional regularization of ultraviolet
divergences. The corrections are negative and amount to several percent, so
that they fully compensate or partly screen the enhancement due to QCD
corrections.
