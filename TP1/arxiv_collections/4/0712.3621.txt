Dependence of transition frequencies on the fine structure constant
$\alpha=e^2/\hbar c$ is calculated for several many-electron systems which are
used or planned to be used in the laboratory search for the time variation of
the fine structure constant. In systems with a large number of electrons in
open shells (from 11 to 15) the relative effects of the variation may be
strongly enhanced. For the transitions which were considered before the results
are in good agreement with previous calculations.
