We report a first principles formalism and its numerical implementation for
treating quantum transport properties of nanoelectronic devices with atomistic
disorder. We developed a nonequilibrium vertex correction (NVC) theory to
handle the configurational average of random disorder at the density matrix
level so that disorder effects to nonlinear and nonequilibrium quantum
transport can be calculated from atomic first principles in a self-consistent
and efficient manner. We implemented the NVC into a Keldysh non-equilibrium
Green's function (NEGF) based density functional theory (DFT) and applied the
NEGF-DFT-NVC formalism to magnetic tunnel junctions with interface roughness
disorder. Our results show that disorder has dramatic effects to nonlinear spin
injection and tunnel magneto-resistance ratio.
