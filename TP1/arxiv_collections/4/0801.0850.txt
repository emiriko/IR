In this work we have investigated the changes of the magnetic properties of
highly oriented pyrolytic graphite samples after irradiation either with $\sim
3 \times 10^{14}$ protons or $ 3.5 \times 10^{13} ... 3.5 \times 10^{14}$ iron
ions with energies in the MeV range. Our results show that iron and proton
irradiations can produce similar paramagnetic contributions depending on the
implantation temperature. However, only protons induce a ferromagnetic effect.
