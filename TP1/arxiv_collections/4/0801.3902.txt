It is with pleasure and pride that I introduce this special section in honor
of Ingram Olkin. This tribute is especially fitting because, among the many
profound and far-reaching contributions that he has made to our profession,
Ingram Olkin was the key force behind the genesis of Statistical Science. As
put so eloquently by Morrie DeGroot [1], the founding Executive Editor of
Statistical Science.
