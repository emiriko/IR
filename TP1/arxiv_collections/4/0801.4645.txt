Renyi entropies of a black hole are evaluated by counting the states of the
Hawking radiation which fills a thin shell surrounding the horizon. The width
of the shell is determined from its energy content and the corresponding mass
defect. The Bekenstein-Hawking formula for the entropy of the black hole is
correctly reproduced.
