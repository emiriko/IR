Simulations of the random barrier model show that ac currents at extreme
disorder are carried almost entirely by the percolating cluster slightly above
threshold; thus contradicting traditional theories contributions from isolated
low-activation-energy clusters are negligible. The effective medium
approximation in conjunction with the Alexander-Orbach conjecture leads to an
excellent analytical fit to the universal ac conductivity with no nontrivial
fitting parameters.
