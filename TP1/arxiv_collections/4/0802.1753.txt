It has, quite recently, become fashionable to study a certain class of
holographic-inspired models for the dark energy. These investigations have,
indeed, managed to make some significant advances towards explaining the
empirical data. Nonetheless, surprisingly little thought has been given to
conceptual issues such as the composition and the very nature of the implicated
energy source. In the current discourse, we attempt to fill this gap by the way
of some speculative yet logically self-consistent arguments. Our construction
takes us along a path that begins with an entanglement entropy and ends up at a
Hubble-sized gas of exotic particles. Moreover, our interpretation of the dark
energy turns out to be suggestive of a natural resolution to the
cosmic-coincidence problem.
