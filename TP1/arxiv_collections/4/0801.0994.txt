Beta-decay properties of neutron-rich Ca isotopes have been obtained.
Half-life values were determined for the first time for 54Ca [86(7) ms], 55Ca
[22(2) ms], and 56Ca [11(2) ms]. The half-life of 230(6) ms deduced for 53Ca is
significantly longer than reported previously, where the decay chain 53K ->
53Ca -> 53Sc was considered. A delayed gamma ray with energy 247 keV as
identified following beta decay of 54Ca, and is proposed to depopulate the
first 1+ level in 54Sc. The beta-decay properties compare favorably with the
results of shell model calculations completed in the full pf-space with the
GXPF1 interaction. The half-lives of the neutron-rich Ca isotopes are also
compared with gross beta-decay theory. The systematic trend of the neutron-rich
Ca half-lives is consistent with the presence of a subshell gap at N=32.
