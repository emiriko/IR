In quantum spin systems obeying hyperscaling, the probability distribution of
the total magnetization takes on a universal scaling form at criticality. We
obtain this scaling function exactly for the ground state and first excited
state of the critical quantum Ising spin chain. This is achieved through a
remarkable relation to the partition function of the anisotropic Kondo problem,
which can be computed by exploiting the integrability of the system.
