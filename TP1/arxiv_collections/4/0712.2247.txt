We present a lattice-based numerical method to describe the non equilibrium
behavior of a simple fluid under non-uniform spatial conditions. The evolution
equation for the one-particle phase-space distribution function is derived
starting from a microscopic description of the system. It involves a series of
approximations which are similar to those employed in theories of inhomogeneous
fluids, such as Density Functional theory. Among the merits of the present
approach: the possibility to determine the equation of state of the model, the
transport coefficients and to provide an efficient method of numerical solution
under non-uniform conditions. The algorithm is tested in a particular non
equilibrium situation, namely the steady flow of a hard-sphere fluid across a
narrow slit. Pronounced non-hydrodynamic oscillations in the density and
velocity profiles are found.
