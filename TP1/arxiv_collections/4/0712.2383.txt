We combine results from CDF and D0 searches for a standard model Higgs boson
(H) in ppbar collisions at the Fermilab Tevatron at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV. With
1.0-1.9 fb-1 of data collected at CDF, and 0.9-1.7 fb-1 at D0, the 95% C.L.
upper limits on Higgs production are a factor of 6.2 (1.4) higher than the SM
cross section for a Higgs mass of m_Higgs = 115 (160) GeV/c^2. Based on
simulation, the median expected upper limit is 4.3 (1.9). These results extend
significantly the individual limits of each experiment.
