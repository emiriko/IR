Discrimination of unitary operations is a fundamental quantum information
processing task. Assisted with linear optical elements, we experimentally
demonstrate perfect discrimination between single-bit unitary operations using
two methods--sequential scheme and parallel scheme. The complexity and resource
consumed in these two schemes are analyzed and compared.
