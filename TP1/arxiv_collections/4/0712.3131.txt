Let $X$ be a rational homogeneous space and let $QH^*(X)_{loc}^\times$ be the
group of invertible elements in the small quantum cohomology ring of $X$
localised in the quantum parameters. We generalise results of
arXiv:math/0609796 and realise explicitly the map $\pi_1({\rm Aut}(X))\to
QH^*(X)_{loc}^\times$ described in arXiv:dg-ga/9511011. We even prove that this
map is an embedding and realise it in the equivariant quantum cohomology ring
$QH^*_T(X)_{loc}^\times$. We give explicit formulas for the product by these
elements.
  The proof relies on a generalisation, to a quotient of the equivariant
homology ring of the affine Grassmannian, of a formula proved by Peter Magyar
arXiv:0705.3826. It also uses Peterson's unpublished result -- recently proved
by Lam and Shimozono in arXiv:0705.1386 -- on the comparison between the
equivariant homology ring of the affine Grassmannian and the equivariant
quantum cohomology ring.
