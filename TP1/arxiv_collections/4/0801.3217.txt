Classical uniaxially anisotropic Heisenberg and XY antiferromagnets in a
field along the easy axis on a square lattice are analysed, applying ground
state considerations and Monte Carlo techniques. The models are known to
display antiferromagnetic and spin-flop phases. In the Heisenberg case, a
single-ion anisotropy is added to the XXZ antiferromagnet, enhancing or
competing with the uniaxial exchange anisotropy. Its effect on the stability of
non-collinear structures of biconical type is studied. In the case of the
anisotropic XY antiferromagnet, the transition region between the
antiferromagnetic and spin-flop phases is found to be dominated by degenerate
bidirectional fluctuations. The phase diagram is observed to resemble closely
that of the XXZ antiferromagnet without single-ion anisotropy.
