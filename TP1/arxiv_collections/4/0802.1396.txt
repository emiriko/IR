We investigate cyclotron motion in graphene monolayers considering both the
full quantum dynamics and its semiclassical limit reached at high carrier
energies. Effects of zitterbewegung due to the two dispersion branches of the
spectrum dominate the irregular quantum motion at low energies and are obtained
as a systematic correction to the semiclassical case. Recent experiments are
shown to operate in the semiclassical regime.
