The physics associated with spherically symmetric charged black holes is
analyzed from the point of view of using weak gravitational lensing as a means
for determining the dimensionality of spacetime. In particular, for exact
solutions of electro-vac black holes in four and five spacetime dimensions the
motion of photons is studied using the equations for the null geodesics and
deriving the weak limit bending angles and delays in photon arrival times.
