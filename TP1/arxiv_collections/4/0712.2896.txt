The analytic structure of the $qqq$ wave function, obtained recently in the
high momentum regime of QCD, is employed for the formulation of baryonic
transition amplitudes via quark loops. A new aspect of this study is the role
of a direct ($Y$-shaped, Mercedes-Benz type) $qqq$ force in generating the
$qqq$ wave function. The dynamics is that of a Salpeter-like equation (3D
support for the kernel) formulated covariantly on the light front, a la
Markov-Yukawa Transversality Principle (MYTP) which warrants a 2-way
interconnection between the 3D and 4D Bethe-Salpeter (BSE) forms for 2 as well
as 3 fermion quarks. The dynamics of this 3-body force shows up through a
characteristic singularity in the hypergeometric differential equation for the
3D wave function $\phi$, corresponding to a $negative$ eigenvalue of the spin
operator $i \sigma_1.\sigma_2\times \sigma_3$ which is an integral part of the
$qqq$ force. As a first application of this wave function to the problem of the
proton spin anomaly, the two-gluon contribution to the anomaly yields an
estimate of the right sign, although somewhat smaller in magnitude.
