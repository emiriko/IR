A spin-rotation symmetry in spin-orbit coupled two-dimensional electron
systems gives rise to a long-lived spin excitation that is robust against
short-range impurity scattering. The influence of a constant in-plane electric
field on this persistent spin helix is studied. To probe the field-induced
eigen-modes of the spin-charge coupled system, a surface acoustic wave is
exploited that provides the wave-vector for resonant excitation. The approach
takes advantage of methods worked out in the field of space-charge waves. Sharp
resonances in the field dependence of the in-plane and out-of-plane
magnetization are identified.
