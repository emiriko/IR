This work is devoted to experimental study of influence of superconductivity
(S) on ferromagnetism (FM) (inverse proximity effects) with the help of
Polarized Neutron Reflectivity. Combining meausurements of specular and diffuse
intensities it is possible to obtain full picture of magnetization change in
S/FM layered systems like magnetization rotation, domain state formation,
inducing of magnetization in S layer, etc. To increase weak magnetic signal we
propose to use enhanced neutron standing wave regime (e.g. waveguides). Choose
of materials, optimization of thicknesses of layers, estimation of roughnesses
influence is presented in this work.
