In this work we first prove the existence and uniqueness of a strong solution
to stochastic GOY model of turbulence with a small multiplicative noise. Then
using the weak convergence approach, Laplace principle for so- lutions of the
stochastic GOY model is established in certain Polish space. Thus a
Wentzell-Freidlin type large deviation principle is established utilizing
certain results by Varadhan and Bryc.
