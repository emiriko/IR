Radiative corrections of strong and electroweak interactions are presented at
next-to-leading order for Higgs-boson production in the weak-boson-fusion
channel at the LHC. The calculation includes all weak-boson fusion and
quark-antiquark annihilation diagrams as well as all related interferences. The
electroweak corrections, which also include real corrections from incoming
photons and leading heavy-Higgs-boson effects at two-loop order, are of the
same size as the QCD corrections, viz. typically at the level of 5-10% for a
Higgs-boson mass up to \sim 700 GeV. In general, they do not simply rescale
differential distributions, but induce distortions at the level of 10%. The
discussed corrections have been implemented in a flexible Monte Carlo event
generator.
