The Green-Schwarz anomaly-cancelling mechanism in string theories requires a
Chern-Simons term in the Einstein-Hilbert action, which leads to an amplitude
birefringence of spacetime for the propagation of gravitational waves. While
the degree of birefringence may be intrinsically small, its effects on a
gravitational wave will accumulate as the wave propagates. The proposed Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be sensitive enough to observe the
gravitational waves from sources at cosmological distances great enough that
interesting bounds on the Chern-Simons may be found. Here we evaluate the
effect of a Chern-Simons induced spacetime birefringence to the propagation of
gravitational waves from such systems. We find that gravitational waves from in
coalescing binary black hole system are imprinted with a signature of
Chern-Simons gravity. This signature appears as a time-dependent change in the
apparent orientation of the binary's orbital angular momentum with respect to
the observer line-of-sight, with the change magnitude reflecting the integrated
history of the Chern-Simons coupling over the worldline of a radiation
wavefront. While spin-orbit coupling in the binary system will also lead to an
evolution of the system's orbital angular momentum, the time dependence and
other details of this \emph{real} effect are different than the \emph{apparent}
effect produced by Chern-Simons birefringence, allowing the two effects to be
separately identified.
