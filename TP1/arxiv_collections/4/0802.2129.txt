We report scanning Hall probe microscopy of highly underdoped superconducting
YBa_2Cu_3O_{6+x} with T_c ranging from 5 to 15 K which showed distinct flux
bundles with less than one superconducting flux quantum (Phi_0) through the
sample surface. The sub-Phi_0 features occurred more frequently for lower T_c,
were more mobile than conventional vortices, and occurred more readily when the
sample was cooled with an in-plane field component. We show that these features
are consistent with kinked stacks of pancake vortices.
