High quality epitaxial thin films of LaBiMn4/3Co2/3O6 perovskite were
fabricated on (001)-oriented SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 substrates by the pulsed laser
deposition technique. Magnetization measurements reveal a strong magnetic
anisotropy and a ferromagnetic behavior that is in agreement with a
super-exchange interaction between Mn4+ and Co2+ ions, which are randomly
distributed in the B-site. A distinct anomaly is observed in the dielectric
measurements at 130K corresponding to the onset of the magnetic ordering,
suggesting a coupling. Above this temperature, the extrinsic Maxwell-Wagner
effect is dominating. Theses results are explained using the Raman
spectroscopic studies indicating a weak spin-lattice interaction around this
magnetic transition.
