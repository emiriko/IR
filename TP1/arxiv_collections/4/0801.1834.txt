The free Schrodinger equation has constant velocity wavepacket solutions
\psi_{\bf v} of the form \psi= f({\bf r} - {\bf v}t) e^{- i m c^2 t / 2}. These
solutions are eigenvectors of a momentum operator {\bf \tilde p} which is
symmetric in a positive definite scalar product space. We discuss whether these
\psi_{\bf v} can act as basis states rather than the usual plane wave
solutions.
