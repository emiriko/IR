(Euler, 1775b). Burton's translation appeared in Fluid Dynamics, 34} (1999) pp.
801-82, Springer and is here adapted by permission. A detailed presentation of
Euler's published work can be found in Truesdell, 1954. Euler's work is
discussed also in the perspective of eighteenth century fluid dynamics research
by Darrigol and Frisch, 2008. Explanatory footnotes have been supplied where
necessary by G.K. Mikhailov and a few more by U. Frisch and O.Darrigol. Euler's
memoir had neither footnotes nor a list of references.
