An empirical fit is described to measurements of inclusive inelastic
electron-proton cross sections in the kinematic range of four-momentum transfer
$0 \le Q^2<8$ GeV$^2$ and final state invariant mass $1.1<W<3.1$ GeV. The fit
is constrained by the recent high precision longitudinal and transverse (L/T)
separated cross section measurements from Jefferson Lab Hall C, un-separated
Hall C measurements up to $Q^2$ $\approx 7.5$ ${\rm GeV}^2$, and
photoproduction data at $Q^2 = 0$. Compared to previous fits, the present fit
covers a wider kinematic range, fits both transverse and longitudinal cross
sections, and features smooth transitions to the photoproduction data at
$Q^2=0$ and DIS data at high $Q^2$ and $W$.
