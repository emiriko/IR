It has been shown that tribimaximal mixing can be obtained by some particular
breaking pattern of the $A_4$ symmetry, wherein the extra $A_4$ triplet Higgs
scalars pick up certain fixed vacuum expectation value (VEV) alignments. We
have performed a detailed analysis of the different possible neutrino mass
matrices within the framework of the $A_4$ model. We take into account all
possible singlet and triplet Higgs scalars which leave the Lagrangian invariant
under $A_4$. We break $A_4$ spontaneously, allowing the Higgs to take any VEV
in general. We show that the neutrino mixing matrix deviates from tribimaximal,
both due to the presence of the extra Higgs singlets, as well as from the
deviation of the triplet Higgs VEV from its desired alignment, taken
previously. We solve the eigenvalue problem for a variety of these illustrative
cases and identify the ones where one obtains exact tribimaximal mixing. All
such cases require fine-tuning. We show which neutrino mass matrices would be
strongly disfavored by the current neutrino data. Finally, we study in detail
the phenomenology of the remaining viable mass matrices and establish the
deviation of the neutrino mixing from tribimaximal, both analytically as well
as numerically.
