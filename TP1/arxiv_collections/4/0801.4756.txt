Time-resolved Kerr rotation experiments show that two kinds of spin modes
exist in diluted magnetic semiconductors: (i) coupled electron-magnetic ion
spin excitations and (ii) excitations of magnetic ion spin subsystem, which are
decoupled from electron spins. The latter modes exhibit much longer spin
coherence time and require a description, which goes beyond the mean field
approximation.
