In this work we are concerned with maximality of monotone operators
representable by certain convex functions in non-reflexive Banach spaces. We
also prove that these maximal monotone operators satisfy a Bronsted-Rockafellar
type property.
  We show that if a function in XxX^* and its conjugate are above the duality
product in their respective domains, then this function represents a maximal
monotone operator.
