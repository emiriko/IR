We report pressure tuned Raman and x-ray diffraction data of
Bi1.98Sr2.06Y0.68Cu2O8 revealing a critical pressure at 21 GPa with anomalies
in six physical quantities: electronic Raman background, electron-phonon
coupling, spectral weight transfer from high to low frequency, density
dependent behaviour of phonon and magnon frequencies, and a compressibility
change in the c-axis. For the first time in a cuprate, mobile charge carriers,
lattice, and magnetism all show anomalies at a distinct critical pressure in
the same experimental setting. Furthermore, the Raman spectral changes are
similar to that seen traversing the superconducting dome with doping,
suggesting that the critical pressure at 21 GPa is related to the much
discussed critical point at optimal doping.
