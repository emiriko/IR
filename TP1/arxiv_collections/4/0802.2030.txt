In this article we consider theta-expanded noncommutative gauge field theory,
constructed at the first order in noncommutative parameter theta, as an
effective, anomaly free theory, with one-loop renormalizable gauge sector.
Related phenomenology with emphasis on the standard model forbidden decays, is
discussed. Experimental possibilities of Z -> gamma gamma decay are analyzed
and a firm bound to the scale of the noncommutativity parameter is set around
few TeV's.
