We report on a measurement of the inclusive jet cross section in $p \bar{p}$
collisions at a center-of-mass energy $\sqrt s=$1.96 TeV using data collected
by the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 0.70 fb$^{-1}$.
  The data cover jet transverse momenta from 50 GeV to 600 GeV and jet
rapidities in the range -2.4 to 2.4. Detailed studies of correlations between
systematic uncertainties in transverse momentum and rapidity are presented, and
the cross section measurements are found to be in good agreement with
next-to-leading order QCD calculations.
