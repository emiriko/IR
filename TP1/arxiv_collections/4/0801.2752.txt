The present theory is closely related to Dirac's equation of the electron,
but not to his magnetic monopole theory, except for his relation between
electric and magnetic charge. The theory is based on the fact, that the
massless Dirac equation admits a second electromagnetic coupling, deduced from
a pseudo-scalar gauge invariance. The equation thus obtained has the symmetry
laws of a massless leptonic, magnetic monopole, able to interact weakly. We
give a more precise form of the Dirac relation between electric and magnetic
charges and a quantum form of the Poincare first integral. In the Weyl
representation our equation splits into P-conjugated monopole and antimonopole
equations with the correct electromagnetic coupling and opposite chiralities,
predicted by P. Curie. Charge-conjugated monopoles are symmetric in space and
not in time (contrary to the electric particles), an important fact for the
vacuum polarization. Our monopoles are magnetically excited neutrinos, which
leads to experimental consequences. These monopoles are assumed to be produced
by electromagnetic pulses or arcs, leading to nuclear transmutations and, for
beta radioactive elements, a shortening of the life time and the emission of
monopoles instead of neutrinos in a magnetic field. A corresponding discussion
is given.
