We analyze two versions of the extended technicolor (ETC) incorporating the
top quark condensate via the flavor-universal coloron type topcolor $SU(3)_1
\times SU(3)_2$: A straightforward top-mode ETC having quarks and techniquarks
assigned to a single (strong) $SU(3)_1$, and a ``twisted model'' with
techniquarks carrying the weak $SU(3)_2$ while quarks the strong $SU(3)_1$. The
straightforward model has the same ETC structure as that of Appelquist et al.
without topcolor which we first analyze to find that it yields only too small
ETC-induced mass for the third generation. In contrast, our model having
topcolor takes the form of a version of the topcolor-assisted technicolor (TC2)
after ETC breakings, which triggers the top quark condensate giving rise to a
realistic top mass. However, techniquarks have the strong topcolor $SU(3)_1$ in
addition to the already strong walking/conformal technicolor, which triggers
the techniquark condensate at scale much higher than the weak scale, a
disaster. We then consider a ``twisted model'' of TC2, though not an explicit
ETC. We find a new feature that ``ETC''-induced quark mass is enhanced to the
realistic value by the large anomalous dimension $\gamma_m \simeq 2$ of
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-type topcolor interactions. The result roughly reproduces
the realistic quark masses. We further find a novel effect of the above large
anomalous dimension $\gamma_m \simeq 2$: The top-pion mass has a universal
upper bound, $m_{\pi_t} < 70 \GeV$, in the generic TC2 model.
