We calculate one-loop scattering amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory
away from the origin of the moduli space and demonstrate that the results are
extremely simple, in much the same way as in the conformally invariant theory.
Specifically, we consider the model where an SU(2) gauge group is spontaneously
broken down to U(1). The complete component Lagrange density of the model is
given in a form useful for perturbative calculations. We argue that the
scattering amplitudes with massive external states deserve further study.
Finally, our work shows that loop corrections can be readily computed in a
mass-regulated N=4 theory, which may be relevant in trying to connect
weak-coupling results with those at strong coupling, as discussed recently by
Alday and Maldacena.
