We study the spin-orbit coupling in the whole Brillouin zone for GaAs using
both the $sp^3s^{\ast}d^5$ and $sp^3s^{\ast}$ nearest-neighbor tight-binding
models. In the $\Gamma$-valley, the spin splitting obtained is in good
agreement with experimental data. We then further explicitly present the
coefficients of the spin splitting in GaAs $L$ and $X$ valleys. These results
are important to the realization of spintronic device and the investigation of
spin dynamics far away from equilibrium.
