Microwave response of S-shaped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu2O$_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212)
micron-scale samples, in which the supercurrent was forced to flow
perpendicular to the crystal layers, was investigated. A treatment with a
focused ion beam allowed us to reduce the plasma frequency down to $f_p$$\sim$5
GHz at $T$=0.3 K in naturally stacked Josephson junctions in a crystal. We
observed Shapiro steps at frequencies as low as $\sim$5 GHz. Well-developed
zero-crossing Shapiro steps were observed at frequencies as low as $\sim$10
GHz. They appeared as constant-voltage plateaus with a non-zero voltage
occurring at zero bias current. We confirmed that zero-crossing Shapiro steps
in the Bi-2212 stacked junctions can be observed when the irradiated frequency
is sufficiently larger than $f_p$. The observed high-order fractional steps in
the microwave responses indicate that the interlayer-coupled Bi-2212 Josephson
junctions have nonsinusoidal current-phase relation. Based on the temperature
dependence of the steps we also showed that the finite slope of the steps is
due to the enhancement of the phase diffusion effect.
