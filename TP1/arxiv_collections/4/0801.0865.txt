This paper presents thermal analyses of a power amplifier placed in a wind
tunnel. All the investigations are based on the transient temperature
measurements performed during the circuit cooling process. The measured cooling
curves were used to compute the cumulative and differential structure functions
for the circuit with a heat sink. These functions helped to determine the
optimal values of circuit model parameters necessary for numerical thermal
simulations. The experiments demonstrated the influence of the wind speed on
the value of the heat transfer coefficient and consequently on the temperature
of the entire structure.
