New mechanism of generating flavor mass spectrum is proposed by using an
O'Raifeartaigh-type supersymmetry breaking model. A desired bilinear form of
fermion mass spectrum is naturally realized through F-components of
gauge-singlet (nonet of SU(3) flavor symmetry) superfields, and the suitable
charged-lepton mass relation is reproduced. The charged-slepton mass spectrum
is non-degenerate in general, and can be even hierarchical (proportional to the
charged-lepton masses in the specific case). Flavor changing neutral processes
are suppressed since the charged-lepton and slepton (except for right-handed
sneutrino) mass matrices are diagonalized simultaneously in the flavor space.
The right-handed sneutrinos are light with the similar ratio to the lepton
sector ($\tilde{m}_{\nu_R}$/$\tilde{m}_e \sim m_\nu$/$m_e$).
