The paper concerns the dependence of thermomechanical properties of
three-dimensional solid nanoclusters on the cluster size as well as on its
shape. Investigations are restricted to the class of so-called homogeneous
thermodynamic processes with kinematics based on affine group and referred to
the one whole body, not an infinite system of subbodies. It is shown that then
the thermodynamics of nanoclusters is consistent with dynamics of
affinely-rigid bodies (constrained or not and elastic as well as admitting
viscosity effects). The main discussed top-ics are: (i) a group-theoretical
description of structurally stable solid nanoclusters; (ii) a phe-nomenological
model of mechanical properties of nanoclusters revealing the coexistence of
solid and liquid states in a finite interval of absolute temperature.
