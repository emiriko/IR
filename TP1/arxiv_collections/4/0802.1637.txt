We show that asymptotic equivalence, in a strong form, holds between two
random graph models with slightly differing edge probabilities under
substantially weaker conditions than what might naively be expected.
  One application is a simple proof of a recent result by van den Esker, van
der Hofstad and Hooghiemstra on the equivalence between graph distances for
some random graph models.
