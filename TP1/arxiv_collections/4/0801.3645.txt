We consider the dynamical system created by iterating a morphism of a
projective variety defined over the field of fractions of a discrete valuation
ring. We study the primitive period of a periodic point in this field in
relation to the primitive period of the reduced point in the residue field, the
order of the action on the cotangent space, and the characteristic of the
residue field.
