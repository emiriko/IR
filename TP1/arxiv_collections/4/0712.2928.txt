Based on the ab initio electronic structure calculations the picture of
ferromagnetism in polimerized C60 is proposed which seems to explain the whole
set of controversial experimental data. We have demonstrated that, in contrast
with cubic fullerene, in rhombohedral C60 the segregation of iron atoms is
energetically unprofitable which is a strong argument in favor of intrinsic
character of carbon ferromagnetism which can be caused by vacancies with
unpaired magnetic electrons. It is shown that: (i) energy formation of the
vacancies in the rhombohedral phase of C60 is essentially smaller than in the
cubic phase, (ii) there is a strong ferromagnetic exchange interactions between
carbon cages containing the vacancies, and (iii) the fusion of the magnetic
vacancies into nonmagnetic bivacancy is energetically profitable. The latter
can explain a fragility of the ferromagnetism.
