The before described general principles and methodology of calculating
electron wave propagation in homogeneous isotropic half-infinity slab of
Maxwellian plasma with indefinite but in principal value sense taken integrals
in characteristic equations, and the use of 2D Laplace transform method are
applied to an evaluation of collision damping decrements of plane electron
longitudinal and transverse waves. Damping decrement tends to infinity when the
wave frequency tends to electron Langmuir frequency from above values. We
considered recurrent relations for amplitudes of the overtones which form in
their sum the all solution of the plasma wave non-linear equations including
collision damping and quadratic (non-linear) terms. Collisionless damping at
frequencies more the Langmuir one is possible only in non-Maxwellian plasmas.
