We propose a new type of reduction for integrable systems of coupled matrix
PDEs; this reduction equates one matrix variable with the transposition of
another multiplied by an antisymmetric constant matrix. Via this reduction, we
obtain a new integrable system of coupled derivative mKdV equations and a new
integrable variant of the massive Thirring model, in addition to the already
known systems. We also discuss integrable semi-discretizations of the obtained
systems and present new soliton solutions to both continuous and semi-discrete
systems. As a by-product, a new integrable semi-discretization of the Manakov
model (self-focusing vector NLS equation) is obtained.
