"Semantic Atlas" is a mathematic and statistic model to visualise word senses
according to relations between words. The model, that has been applied to
proximity relations from a corpus, has shown its ability to distinguish word
senses as the corpus' contributors comprehend them. We propose to use the model
and a specialised corpus in order to create automatically a specialised
dictionary relative to the corpus' domain. A morpho-syntactic analysis
performed on the corpus makes it possible to create the dictionary from
syntactic relations between lexical units. The semantic resource can be used to
navigate semantically - and not only lexically - through the corpus, to create
classical dictionaries or for diachronic studies of the language.
