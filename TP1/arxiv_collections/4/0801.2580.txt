We study the steady state of a zero-temperature Bose gas near a Feshbach or
photoassociation resonance using a two-channel mean-field model that
incorporates atomic and molecular condensates, as well as correlated atom pairs
originating from dissociation of molecules into pairs of atoms. We start from a
many-body Hamiltonian for atom-molecule conversion, and derive the time
dependent version of the mean-field theory. The stationary solution of the time
dependent model is rendered unique with an approximation that entails that all
noncondensate atoms are correlated, as if emerging from dissociation of
molecules. The steady state is solved numerically, but limiting cases are also
found analytically. The system has a phase transition in which the atomic
condensate emerges in a nonanalytic fashion. We quantify the scaling of the
observable quantities, such as fractions of atomic and molecular condensates,
with the detuning and the atom-molecule conversion strength. Qualitatively, the
dependence on detuning rounds out with increasing coupling strength. A study of
the thermodynamics shows that the pressure of the atom-molecule system is
negative, even on the molecule side of the resonance. This indicates the
possibility of mechanical instability.
