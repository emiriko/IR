Results of quantum mechanical simulations of the influence of edge disorder
on transport in graphene nanoribbon metal oxide semiconductor field-effect
transistors (MOSFETs) are reported. The addition of edge disorder significantly
reduces ON-state currents and increases OFF-state currents, and introduces wide
variability across devices. These effects decrease as ribbon widths increase
and as edges become smoother. However the bandgap decreases with increasing
width, thereby increasing the band-to-band tunneling mediated subthreshold
leakage current even with perfect nanoribbons. These results suggest that
without atomically precise edge control during fabrication, MOSFET performance
gains through use of graphene will be difficult to achieve.
