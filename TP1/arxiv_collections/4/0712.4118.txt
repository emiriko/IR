An important property of chordal graphs is that these graphs are
characterized by existence of perfect elimination orderings on their vertex
sets. In this paper, we generalize the notion of perfect elimination orderings
to signed graphs, and give a characterization for graphs admitting such
orderings, together with characterizations restricted to some subclasses and
further properties of those graphs.
