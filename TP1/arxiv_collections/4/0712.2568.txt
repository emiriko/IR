The AdS/CFT correspondence suggests that there is a point in the phase
diagram of strongly interacting gauge-theory matter where the viscosity
approaches zero. This paper analyses the possibility that this point represents
a superfluid and that the the system near this point in the phase diagram can
be described by a Landau fluid. Superfluid vortices are constructed and the AdS
analogue of vorticity quantisation is described. The production of vortices in
the quark-gluon plasma during heavy ion collisions is discussed.
