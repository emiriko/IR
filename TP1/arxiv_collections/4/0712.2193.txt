Let (M, F) be a compact codimension-one foliated manifold whose leaves are
equipped with Riemannian metrics, and consider continuous functions on M that
are harmonic along the leaves of F . If every such function is constant on
leaves we say that (M, F) has the Liouville property. Our main result is that
codimension-one foliated bundles over compact negatively curved manifolds
satisfy the Liouville property. Related results for R-covered foliations, as
well as for discrete group actions and discrete harmonic functions, are also
established.
