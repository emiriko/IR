We study decoherence of a three-qubit array coupled to substrate phonons.
Assuming an initial three-qubit entangled state that would be decoherence-free
for identical qubit positions, allows us to focus on non-Markovian effects of
the inevitable spatial qubit separation. It turns out that the coherence is
most affected when the qubits are regularly spaced. Moreover, we find that up
to a constant scaling factor, two-qubit entanglement is not influenced by the
presence f the third qubit, even though all qubits interact via the phonon
field.
