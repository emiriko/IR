When statistical inversion of a lag profile is used to determine an
incoherent scatter target, the posterior variance of the estimated target can
be used to determine how well a certain set of transmission codes perform. In
this work we present an incoherent scatter radar transmission code optimization
search method suitable for different modulation types, including binary phase,
polyphase and amplitude modulation. We find that the combination of amplitude
and phase modulation provides better performance than traditional binary phase
coding, in some cases giving better accuracy than alternating codes.
