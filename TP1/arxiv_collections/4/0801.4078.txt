An ambichiral structure comprising sheets of an anisotropic dielectric
material rejects normally incident plane waves of one circular polarization
(CP) state but not of the other CP state, in its fundamental Bragg regime.
However, if the same structure is made of an dielectric--magnetic material with
indefinite permittivity and permeability dyadics, it may function as a
polarization--universal rejection filter because two of the four planewave
components of the electromagnetic field phasors in each sheet are of the
positive--phase--velocity type and two are of the negative--phase--velocity
type.
