We present a modified optimal control scheme based on the Krotov method,
which allows for strict limitations on the spectrum of the optimized laser
fields, without losing monotonic convergence of the algorithm. The method
guarantees a close link to learning loop control experiments and is
demonstrated for the challenging control of non-resonant Raman transitions,
which are used to implement a set of global quantum gates for molecular
vibrational qubits.
