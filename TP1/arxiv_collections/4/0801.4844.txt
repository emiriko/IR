Given an automorphism of a free group $F_n$, we consider the following
invariants: $e$ is the number of exponential strata (an upper bound for the
number of different exponential growth rates of conjugacy classes); $d$ is the
maximal degree of polynomial growth of conjugacy classes; $R$ is the rank of
the fixed subgroup. We determine precisely which triples $(e,d,R)$ may be
realized by an automorphism of $F_n$. In particular, the inequality $e\le
(3n-2)/4}$ (due to Levitt-Lustig) always holds. In an appendix, we show that
any conjugacy class grows like a polynomial times an exponential under
iteration of the automorphism.
