We consider polygonal Markov fields originally introduced by Arak and
Surgailis (1989). Our attention is focused on fields with nodes of order two,
which can be regarded as continuum ensembles of non-intersecting contours in
the plane, sharing a number of features with the two-dimensional Ising model.
We introduce non-homogeneous version of polygonal fields in anisotropic
enviroment. For these fields we provide a class of new graphical constructions
and random dynamics. These include a generalised dynamic representation,
generalised and defective disagreement loop dynamics as well as a generalised
contour birth and death dynamics. Next, we use these constructions as tools to
obtain new exact results on the geometry of higher order correlations of
polygonal Markov fields in their consistent regime.
