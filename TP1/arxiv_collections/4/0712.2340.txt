For the planned International Linear Collider it is intended to have both --
electron and positron -- beams polarised. This offers a great benefit for many
physics studies, but also provides a challenge for the engineering of the
machine. A polarised positron source that meets the machine parameters is topic
of current design studies and prototype experiments.
