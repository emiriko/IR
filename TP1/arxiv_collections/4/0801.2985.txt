Knowing the mass of the b-quark is essential to the study of the structure
and decays of B mesons as well as to future tests of the Higgs mechanism of
mass generation. We present recent preliminary measurements of the b-quark mass
and related nonperturbative parameters from moments of kinematic distributions
in charmed and charmless semileptonic and radiative penguin B decays. Their
determination from charmless semileptonic B decays is the first measurement in
this mode. The data were collected by the BABAR detector at the PEP-II
asymmetric-energy e+e- -collider at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center at a
center-of-momentum energy of 10.58 GeV.
