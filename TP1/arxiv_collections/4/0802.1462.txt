The scaling of anomalous Hall resistivity on the longitudinal resistivity has
been intensively studied in the different magnetic systems, including
multilayers and granular films, to examine which mechanism, skew scattering or
side-jump, dominates. The basis of the scaling law is that both the
resistivities are due to the electron scattering at the imperfections in the
materials. By studying of anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in the simple Fe/Cu
bilayers, we demonstrate that the measured anomalous Hall effect should not
follow the scaling laws derived from skew scattering or side-jump mechanism due
to the short-circuit and shunting effects of the non-magnetic layers.
