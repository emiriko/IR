We study the possible production of the $\rho$-resonance from the Strong
Electroweak Symmetry Breaking sector at LHC. Due to possibly enhanced couplings
of $\rho$ to the top and bottom quarks we focus on the process pp -> b \bar{b}
t \bar{t} where either b \bar{b} or t \bar{t} are the products of the $\rho$
decay.
