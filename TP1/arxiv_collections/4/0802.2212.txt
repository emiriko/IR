We discuss several aspects of the Lambda(1405) resonance in relation to the
recent theoretical developments in chiral dynamics. We derive an effective
single-channel KbarK N interaction based on chiral SU(3) coupled-channel
approach, emphasizing the important role of the pi Sigma channel and the
structure of the Lambda(1405) in Kbar N phenomenology. In order to clarify the
structure of the resonance, we study the behavior with the number of colors
(Nc) of the poles associated with the Lambda(1405), and argue the physical
meaning of the renormalization procedure.
