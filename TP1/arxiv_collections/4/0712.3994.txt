Frequently during its lifetime a human organism is subjected to the
acoustical and similar to them vibrating impacts. Under the certain conditions
such influence may cause physiological changes in the organs functioning. Thus
the study of the oscillatory mechanical impacts to the organism is very
important task of the numerical physiology. It allows to investigate the
endurance limits of the organism and to develop protective measures in order to
extend them. The noise nuisances affects to the most parts of the organism
disrupting their functions. The vibrating disturbances caused to the lung
function as one of the most sensitive to the acoustical impacts is considered
in this work. The model proposed to describe the air motion in
trachea-bronchial tree is based on the one dimensional no-linear theory
including mass and momentum conservation for the air flow in flexible tubes.
