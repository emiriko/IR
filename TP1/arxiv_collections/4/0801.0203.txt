We study light localization at a phase-slip defect created by two
semi-infinite mismatched identical arrays of coupled optical waveguides. We
demonstrate that the nonlinear defect modes possess the specific properties of
both nonlinear surface modes and discrete solitons. We analyze stability of the
localized modes and their generation in both linear and nonlinear regimes.
