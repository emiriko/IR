Tensor representation (TR) for wave function (WF) of three-nucleon bound
state with the total angular momentum I=1/2 is discussed. The WF in TR has 16
complex components depending on vectors of relative momenta. Constraints on the
WF imposed by requirements of invariance with respect to space inversion and
time reversal are studied. Both parity-even and parity-odd components of the 3N
bound state are constructed using 16 scalar functions. The arguments of the
functions are magnitudes of relative momenta and scalar product of the momenta.
With nuclear forces being time-reversal invariant these functions are real. The
WF in TR is converted into an operator form, accounting for parity violating
contributions. Properties of operator representations for WFs of 2N and 3N
nuclei are compared.
