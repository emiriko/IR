We extend the results of Ref. [arXiv:0705.4294] to noncommutative gauge
theories at finite temperature. In particular, by making use of the background
field method, we analyze renormalization issues and the high-temperature
asymptotics of the one-loop Euclidean free energy of the noncommutative U(1)
gauge model within imaginary time formalism. As a by-product, the heat trace of
the non-minimal photon kinetic operator on noncommutative $S^1 \times R^3$
manifold taken in an arbitrary background gauge is investigated. All possible
types of noncommutativity on $S^1 \times R^3$ are considered. It is
demonstrated that the non-planar sector of the model does not contribute to the
free energy of the system at high temperature. The obtained results are
discussed.
