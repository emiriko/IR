We discuss that in the extreme relativistic limit, i.e., when z >>1, where z
is the surface gravitational redshift, there could be radiation pressure
supported and dominated stars with arbitrary gravitational mass, high or low.
Such Objects are called Eternally Collapsing Objects (ECOs). ECOs are
practically as compact as Schwarzschil Black Holes (BH) and, observationally,
are likely to be mistaken as BHs. Further since any object undergoing continued
collapse must first become an ECO before becoming a true BH state charcterized
by M=0, the observed BH Candidates are ECOs.
