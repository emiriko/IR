New Babar results on exclusive e+e- -> hadrons reactions at low c.m. energy
with a baryon-antibaryon or K\bar{K} pair in the final state are presented.
Cross sections are measured using the initial state radiation technique from
the threshold up to 4--5 GeV. From the measured e+e- -> proton\antiproton,
Lambda\Lbar, Sigma0\Sigbar0, Lambda\Sigbar0(Sigma0\Lbar) cross sections we
derive effective baryon form factors and compare them with predictions. We
measure the K\bar{K}\pi(\eta), K+K-\pi\pi, K+K-3\pi, K+K-4\pi, K+K-K+K- final
states and also study their internal structure. A new Y(2175) state is observed
in e+e- -> K+K-f0(980), with f0\to\pi\pi. The total measured e+e- annihilation
cross section into final states including strange baryons or strange mesons is
estimated to be 10% of the full hadronic cross section.
