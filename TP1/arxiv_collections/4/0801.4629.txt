This paper presents a general iterative bias correction procedure for
regression smoothers. This bias reduction schema is shown to correspond
operationally to the $L_2$ Boosting algorithm and provides a new statistical
interpretation for $L_2$ Boosting. We analyze the behavior of the Boosting
algorithm applied to common smoothers $S$ which we show depend on the spectrum
of $I-S$. We present examples of common smoother for which Boosting generates a
divergent sequence. The statistical interpretation suggest combining algorithm
with an appropriate stopping rule for the iterative procedure. Finally we
illustrate the practical finite sample performances of the iterative smoother
via a simulation study. simulations.
