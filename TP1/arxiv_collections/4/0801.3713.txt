Assembly/Disassembly (A/D) simulations using haptic devices are facing
difficulties while simulating insertion/extraction operations such as removing
cylinders from holes. In order to address this configuration as well as others,
an approach based on contact identification between components is presented in
this paper. This approach can efficiently contribute either to a new A/D
simulation preparation process relying on two types of shape representations
(mesh and CAD NURBS models), or directly to the real time simulation process
when it is performed with 6D haptic devices. The model processing pipeline is
described and illustrated to show how information can be propagated and used
for contact detection. Then, the contact identification process is introduced
and illustrated through an example
