Robustness in a parser refers to an ability to deal with exceptional
phenomena. A parser is robust if it deals with phenomena outside its normal
range of inputs. This paper reports on a series of robustness evaluations of
state-of-the-art parsers in which we concentrated on one aspect of robustness:
its ability to parse sentences containing misspelled words. We propose two
measures for robustness evaluation based on a comparison of a parser's output
for grammatical input sentences and their noisy counterparts. In this paper, we
use these measures to compare the overall robustness of the four evaluated
parsers, and we present an analysis of the decline in parser performance with
increasing error levels. Our results indicate that performance typically
declines tens of percentage units when parsers are presented with texts
containing misspellings. When it was tested on our purpose-built test set of
443 sentences, the best parser in the experiment (C&C parser) was able to
return exactly the same parse tree for the grammatical and ungrammatical
sentences for 60.8%, 34.0% and 14.9% of the sentences with one, two or three
misspelled words respectively.
