During batch growth on mixtures of two growth-limiting substrates, microbes
consume the substrates either sequentially or simultaneously. These growth
patterns are manifested in all types of bacteria and yeasts. The ubiquity of
these growth patterns suggests that they are driven by a universal mechanism
common to all microbial species. In previous work, we showed that a minimal
model accounting only for enzyme induction and dilution explains the phenotypes
observed in batch cultures of various wild-type and mutant/recombinant cells.
Here, we examine the extension of the minimal model to continuous cultures. We
show that: (1) Several enzymatic trends, usually attributed to specific
regulatory mechanisms such as catabolite repression, are completely accounted
for by dilution. (2) The bifurcation diagram of the minimal model for
continuous cultures, which classifies the substrate consumption pattern at any
given dilution rate and feed concentrations, provides a a precise explanation
for the empirically observed correlation between the growth patterns in batch
and continuous cultures. (3) Numerical simulations of the model are in
excellent agreement with the data. The model captures the variation of the
steady state substrate concentrations, cell densities, and enzyme levels during
the single- and mixed-substrate growth of bacteria and yeasts at various
dilution rates and feed concentrations. (4) This variation is well-approximated
by simple analytical expressions that furnish physical insights into the steady
states of continuous cultures. The minimal model provides a framework for
quantitating the effect of regulatory mechanisms. We illustrate this by
analyzing several data sets from the literature.
