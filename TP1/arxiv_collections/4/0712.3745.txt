It has been argued long ago that eta(b) could be observed through the eta(b)
=> J/psi(=> mu+ mu-) J/psi(=> mu+ mu-) decay chain. Recent calculations
indicate that the width of eta(b) into two J/psi is almost three order of
magnitude smaller than the one into the D D*. We study the effects of final
state interactions due to the D D* intermediate state on the J/psi J/psi final
state. We find that the inclusion of this contribution may enhance the short
distance branching ratio of about two orders of magnitude.
