Diffusion of a particle passing over the saddle point of a two-dimensional
quadratic potential is studied via a set of coupled Langevin equations and the
expression for the passing probability is obtained exactly. The passing
probability is found to be strongly influenced by the off-diagonal components
of inertia and friction tensors. If the system undergoes the optimal path to
pass over the saddle point by taking an appropriate direction of initial
velocity into account, which departs from the potential valley and has minimum
dissipation, the passing probability should be enhanced. Application to fusion
of massive nuclei, we show that there exists the optimal injecting choice for
the deformable target and projectile nuclei, namely, the intermediate
deformation between spherical and extremely deformed ones which enables the
fusion probability to reach its maximum.
