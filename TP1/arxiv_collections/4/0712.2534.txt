Data collected in Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron are searched for
indications of new electroweak scale physics. Rather than focusing on
particular new physics scenarios, CDF data are analyzed for discrepancies with
respect to the standard model prediction. A model-independent approach (Vista)
considers the gross features of the data, and is sensitive to new large cross
section physics. A quasi-model-independent approach (Sleuth) searches for a
significant excess of events with large summed transverse momentum, and is
particularly sensitive to new electroweak scale physics that appears
predominantly in one final state. This global search for new physics in over
three hundred exclusive final states in 927 pb^-1 of ppbar collisions at
sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV reveals no such significant indication of physics beyond the
standard model.
