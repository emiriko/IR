Quasi-classical picture of motion of spin 1/2 massless particle in a curved
spacetime is built on base of simple Lagrangian model. The one is constructed
due to analogy with Lagrangian of massive spin 1/2 particle. Equations of
motion and spin propagation coincide with Papapetrou equations describing
dynamic of photon in a curved spacetime.
