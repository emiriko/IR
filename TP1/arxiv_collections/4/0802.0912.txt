Taking into account the constraints imposed by the lattice symmetry, we
calculate the phonon dispersion for graphene with interactions between the
first, second, and third nearest neighbors in the framework of the Born--von
Karman model. Analytical expressions obtained for the dispersion of the
out-of-plane (bending) modes give the nonzero sound velocity. The dispersion of
four in-plane modes is determined by coupled equations. Values of the force
constants are found in fitting with frequencies at critical points and with
elastic constants measured on graphite.
