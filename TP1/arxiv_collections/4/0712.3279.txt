We propose a theoretical scenario for pumping of fractionally charged
quasi-particle in the context of $\nu=1/3$ fractional quantum Hall liquid. We
consider quasi-particle pumping across an anti-dot level tuned close to the
resonance. Fractional charge pumping is achieved by slow and periodic
modulation of coupling of the anti-dot level to left and right moving edges of
a Hall bar set-up. This is attained by periodically modulating the gate
voltages controlling the couplings. In order to obtain quantization of pumped
charge in the unit of the electronic charge fraction ($\nu e$) per pumping
cycle in the adiabatic limit, we argue that the only possibility is to tune the
quasi-particle operator to be irrelevant from being relevant in the
renormalization group sense, which can be accomplished by invoking quantum Hall
line junctions into the Hall bar geometry. We also comment on possibility for
experimental realization of the above scenario.
