We propose a new mechanism for the achievment of homochirality in life
without any autocatalytic production process. Our model consists of a
spontaneous production together with a recycling cross inhibition in a closed
system.
  It is shown that although the rate equations for this system predict no
chiral symmetry breaking, the stochastic master equation predicts complete
homochirality. This is because the fluctuation induced by the discreteness of
population numbers of participating molecules plays essential roles. This
fluctuation conspires with the recyling cross inhibition to realize the
homochirality.
