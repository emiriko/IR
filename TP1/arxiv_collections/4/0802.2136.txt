We report the experimental observations on the simultaneous EIT effects for
probe and trigger fields (double EIT) as well as the large cross-phase
modulation (XPM) between the two fields in a four-level tripod EIT system of
the D1 line of 87Rb atoms. The XPM coefficients (larger than 2*10-5cm2/W) and
the accompanying transmissions (higher than 60%) are measured at slightly
detuning of the probe field from the exact EIT resonance condition. The
presented system can be applied in the recently proposed quantum information
processing with weak cross-Kerr nonlinearities.
