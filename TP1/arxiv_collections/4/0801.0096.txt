A modified quantum teleportation protocol broadens the scope of the classical
forbidden-interval theorems for stochastic resonance. The fidelity measures
performance of quantum communication. The sender encodes the two classical bits
for quantum teleportation as weak bipolar subthreshold signals and sends them
over a noisy classical channel. Two forbidden-interval theorems provide a
necessary and sufficient condition for the occurrence of the nonmonotone
stochastic resonance effect in the fidelity of quantum teleportation. The
condition is that the noise mean must fall outside a forbidden interval related
to the detection threshold and signal value. An optimal amount of classical
noise benefits quantum communication when the sender transmits weak signals,
the receiver detects with a high threshold, and the noise mean lies outside the
forbidden interval. Theorems and simulations demonstrate that both
finite-variance and infinite-variance noise benefit the fidelity of quantum
teleportation.
