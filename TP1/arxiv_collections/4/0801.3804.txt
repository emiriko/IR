We have analyzed the currently available simulation results, as well as
performed some additional Monte Carlo simulation for the hard-core attractive
Yukawa fluid in order to study its corresponding state behavior. We show that
the values of reduced surface tension map onto the master curve, and a
universal equation of state can be obtained in the wide range of the attractive
Yukawa tail length after a certain re-scaling of the number density. Some
comparisons with other nonconformal potentials are presented and discussed.
