This study analyzes performance of several genetic and evolutionary
algorithms on randomly generated NK fitness landscapes with various values of n
and k. A large number of NK problem instances are first generated for each n
and k, and the global optimum of each instance is obtained using the
branch-and-bound algorithm. Next, the hierarchical Bayesian optimization
algorithm (hBOA), the univariate marginal distribution algorithm (UMDA), and
the simple genetic algorithm (GA) with uniform and two-point crossover
operators are applied to all generated instances. Performance of all algorithms
is then analyzed and compared, and the results are discussed.
