We start with a set of n players. With some probability P(n,k), we kill n-k
players; the other ones stay alive, and we repeat with them. What is the
distribution of the number X_n of phases (or rounds) before getting only one
player? We present a probabilistic analysis of this algorithm under some
conditions on the probability distributions P(n,k), including stochastic
monotonicity and the assumption that roughly a fixed proportion alpha of the
players survive in each round.
  We prove a kind of convergence in distribution for X_n-log_a n, where the
basis a=1/alpha; as in many other similar problems there are oscillations and
no true limit distribution, but suitable subsequences converge, and there is an
absolutely continuous random variable Z such that the distribution of X_n can
be approximated by Z+log_a n rounded to the nearest larger integer.
  Applications of the general result include the leader election algorithm
where players are eliminated by independent coin tosses and a variation of the
leader election algorithm proposed by W.R. Franklin. We study the latter
algorithm further, including numerical results.
