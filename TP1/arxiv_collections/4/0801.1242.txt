The orbital magnetic moment of a Co adatom on a Pt(111) surface is calculated
in good agreement with experimental data making use of the LSDA+U method. It is
shown that both electron correlation induced orbital polarization and
structural relaxation play essential roles in orbital moment formation. The
microscopic origins of the orbital moment enhancement are discussed.
