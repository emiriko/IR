We study the single production of the fourth family quarks through the
process pp--> Q'jX at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We have calculated the
decay widths and branching ratios of the fourth family quarks (b' and t') in
the mass range 300-800 GeV. The cross sections of signal and background
processes have been calculated in a Monte Carlo framework. It is shown that the
LHC can discover single t' and b' quarks if the CKM matrix elements
|V_{t'q}|,|V_{qb'}|>=0.01.
