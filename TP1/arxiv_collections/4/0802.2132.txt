We analyze the effect of local decoherence of two qubits on their
entanglement and the Bell inequality violation. Decoherence is described by
Kraus operators, which take into account dephasing and energy relaxation at an
arbitrary temperature.
  We show that in the experiments with superconducting phase qubits the
survival time for entanglement should be much longer than for the Bell
inequality violation.
