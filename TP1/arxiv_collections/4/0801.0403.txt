We show that the Cerf-Adami inequalities do not necessarily depend on
conditional entropies nor any reference to Markov chains. While the latter are
not explicit in the original form, they are often implied in certain
derivations. We also show that these inequalities are intimately related to at
least one interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics. The combination
of these results provides added insight into why some quantum systems violate
the Cerf-Adami inequalities thereby improving our understanding of the
quantum-classical boundary. As a result we suggest that the second law may
serve as some type of boundary condition on classical knowledge.
