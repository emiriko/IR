Theoretical models of compaction processes, such as for example intergranular
pressure-solution (IPS), focus on deformation occurring at the contacts between
spherical grains that constitute an aggregate. In order to investigate the
applicability of such models, and to quantify the deformation of particles
within an aggregate, isostatic experiments were performed in cold-sealed
vessels on glass sphere aggregates at 200 MPa confining pressure and 350
degrees C with varying amounts of fluid.
