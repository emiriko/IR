Principal manifolds are defined as lines or surfaces passing through ``the
middle'' of data distribution. Linear principal manifolds (Principal Components
Analysis) are routinely used for dimension reduction, noise filtering and data
visualization. Recently, methods for constructing non-linear principal
manifolds were proposed, including our elastic maps approach which is based on
a physical analogy with elastic membranes. We have developed a general
geometric framework for constructing ``principal objects'' of various
dimensions and topologies with the simplest quadratic form of the smoothness
penalty which allows very effective parallel implementations. Our approach is
implemented in three programming languages (C++, Java and Delphi) with two
graphical user interfaces (VidaExpert
http://bioinfo.curie.fr/projects/vidaexpert and ViMiDa
http://bioinfo-out.curie.fr/projects/vimida applications). In this paper we
overview the method of elastic maps and present in detail one of its major
applications: the visualization of microarray data in bioinformatics. We show
that the method of elastic maps outperforms linear PCA in terms of data
approximation, representation of between-point distance structure, preservation
of local point neighborhood and representing point classes in low-dimensional
spaces.
