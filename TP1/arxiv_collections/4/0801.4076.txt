We give the presentation of exceptional bounded symmetric domains using the
Albert algebra and exceptional Jordan triple systems.
  The first chapter is devoted to Cayley-Graves algebras, the second to
exceptional Jordan triple systems. In the third chapter, we give a geometric
description of the two exceptional bounded symmetric domains, their boundaries
and their compactification.
