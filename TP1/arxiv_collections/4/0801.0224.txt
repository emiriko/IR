The thesis will present results in Quantum Chromo Dynamics (QCD) with
dynamical lattice fermions. The topological susceptibilty in QCD is determined,
the calculations are carried out with dynamical overlap fermions. The most
important properties of the quark-gluon plasma phase of QCD are studied, for
which dynamical staggered fermions are used.
