The optical properties of the quarter-filled single-band CDW systems have
been reexamined in the model with the electron-phonon coupling related to the
variations of electron site energies. It appears that the indirect,
electron-mediated coupling between phase phonons and external electromagnetic
fields vanishes for symmetry reasons, at variance with the infrared selection
rules used in the generally accepted microscopic theory. It is shown that the
phase phonon modes and the electric fields couple directly, with the coupling
constant proportional to the magnitude of the charge-density wave. The
single-particle contributions to the optical conductivity tensor are determined
for the ordered CDW state and the related weakly doped metallic state by means
of the Bethe--Salpeter equations for elementary electron-hole excitations. It
turns out that this gauge-invariant approach establishes a clear connection
between the effective numbers of residual, thermally activated and bound charge
carriers. Finally, the relation between these numbers and the activation energy
of dc conductivity and the optical CDW gap scale is explained in the way
consistent with the conductivity sum rules.
