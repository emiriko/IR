We present a perturbation theory to find the response of an anisotropic DNA
to the external tension. It is shown that the anisotropy has a nonzero but
small contribution to the force-extension curve of the DNA. Thus an anisotropic
DNA behaves like an isotropic one with an effective bending constant equal to
the harmonic average of its soft and hard bending constants.
