We investigate Laughlin's fractional quantum Hall effect wave function in the
cylinder geometry of Laughlin's integer quantum Hall effect argument, at
filling factor 1/3. We show that the plasma analogy leads to a periodic
density, and that the wave function admits a representation as a ``quantum
polymer'', reminiscent of the quantum dimer model by Rokhsar and Kivelson. We
explain how the representation can be exploited to compute the normalization
and one-particle density in the limit of infinitely many particles.
