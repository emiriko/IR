Nuclear Physics has had its ups and downs. However in recent years, bucked up
by some new and often puzzling data, it has become a potentially very rich
field. We review some of these exciting developments in a few important sectors
of nuclear physics. Emphasis shall be on the study of exotic nuclei and the new
physics that these nuclei are teaching us.
