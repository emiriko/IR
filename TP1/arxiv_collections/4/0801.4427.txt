We point out that there exist two natural definitions of the nucleon
magnetization densities : the density $\rho_M^K (r)$ introduced in Kelly's
phenomenological analysis and theoretically more standard one $\rho_M (r)$. We
can derive an explicit analytical relation between them, although Kelly's
density is more useful to disentangle the physical origin of the different
$Q^2$ dependence of the Sachs electric and magnetic form factors of the
nucleon. We evaluate both of $\rho_M (r)$ and $\rho_M^K (r)$ as well as the
charge density $\rho_{ch}(r)$ of the proton within the framework of the chiral
quark soliton model, to find a noticeable qualitative difference between
$\rho_{ch}(r)$ and $\rho_M^K (r)$, which is just consistent with Kelly's result
obtained from the empirical information on the Sachs electric and magnetic form
factors of the proton.
