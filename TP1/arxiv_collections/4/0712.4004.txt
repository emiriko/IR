In the present paper, we present an extra dimensions inspired model that is
built on the DGP brane-world scenario, then we take the dark energy component
on the brane to be a Chaplygin gas. After that we consider a holographic model
of Chaplygin gas in the framework of DGP cosmology. We show that the
holographic Chaplygin gas can mimic a phantom fluid and cross the phantom
divide in a DGP brane-world setup.
