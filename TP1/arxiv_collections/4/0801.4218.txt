Let $\pi: {\mathbb C}_g \to {\mathbb M}_g$ be the universal family of compact
Riemann surfaces of genus $g \geq 1$. We introduce a real-valued function on
the moduli space ${\mathbb M}_g$ and compute the first and the second
variations of the function. As a consequence we relate the Chern form of the
relative tangent bundle $T_{{\mathbb C}_g/{\mathbb M}_g}$ induced by the
Arakelov-Green function with differential forms on ${\mathbb C}_g$ induced by a
flat connection whose holonomy gives Johnson's homomorphisms on the mapping
class group.
