This chapter of the report of the ``Flavour in the era of the LHC'' Workshop
discusses the theoretical, phenomenological and experimental issues related to
flavour phenomena in the charged lepton sector and in flavour-conserving
CP-violating processes. We review the current experimental limits and the main
theoretical models for the flavour structure of fundamental particles. We
analyze the phenomenological consequences of the available data, setting
constraints on explicit models beyond the Standard Model, presenting benchmarks
for the discovery potential of forthcoming measurements both at the LHC and at
low energy, and exploring options for possible future experiments.
