We give new Backlund transformations (BTs) for some known integrable (in the
sense of being multidimensionally consistent) quadrilateral lattice equations.
As opposed to the natural auto-BT inherent in every such equation, these BTs
are of two other kinds. Specifically, it is found that some equations admit
additional auto-BTs (with Backlund parameter), whilst some pairs of apparently
distinct equations admit a BT which connects them.
