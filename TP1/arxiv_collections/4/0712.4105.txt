We calculate a current and its fluctuation in a two-state stochastic system
under a periodic perturbation. The system could be interpreted as a channel on
a cell surface or a single Michaelis-Menten catalyzing enzyme. It has been
shown that the periodic perturbation induces so-called pump current, and the
pump current and its fluctuation are calculated with the aid of the geometrical
phase interpretation. We give a simple calculation recipe for the statistics of
the current, especially in a non-adiabatic case. The calculation scheme is
based on the non-adiabatic geometrical phase interpretation. Using the Floquet
theory, the total current and its fluctuation are calculated, and it is
revealed that the average of the current shows a stochastic-resonance-like
behavior. In contrast, the fluctuation of the current does not show such
behavior.
