The concept of friction-induced brake vibrations, commonly known as judder,
is investigated. Judder vibration is based on the class of geometrically
induced or kinematic constraint instability. After presenting the modal
coupling mechanism and the associated dynamic model, a stability analysis as
well as a sensitivity analysis have been conducted in order to identify
physical parameters for a brake design avoiding friction-induced judder
instability. Next, in order to reduce the size of the instability regions in
relation to possible system parameter combinations, robust stability via
\mu-synthesis is applied. By comparing the unstable regions between the initial
and controlled brake system, some general indications emerge and it appears
that robust stability via \mu-synthesis has some effect on the instability of
the brake system.
