The synthesis of self-organized quantum dots (QD's) can be achieved through
bottom up layer by layer deposition processes as chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) or physical vapor deposition (PVD). However, QD's may also be synthesized
via sol-gel route, which involves a spontaneous evolution from thin films to
discrete QD's without further deposition. The aim of the paper is to discuss
and compare the physical phenomena involved in QD's formation which initiate
from thin film surface roughening between PVD-CVD and sol-gel synthesis
approaches. We propose two simple physical models which are relevant to explain
the fundamental differences between those methods.
