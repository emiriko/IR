In this paper we summarize the ellipsoidally symmetric Buda-Lund model's
results on HBT radii. We calculate the Bose-Einstein correlation function from
the model and derive formulas for the transverse momentum dependence of the
correlation radii in the Bertsch-Pratt system of out, side and longitudinal
directions. We show a comparison to $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200 GeV$ RHIC PHENIX
two-pion correlation data and make prediction on the same observable for
different particles.
