We discuss the computation of the third virial coefficient in polymer
systems, focusing on an additional contribution absent in the case of
monoatomic fluids. We determine the interpenetration ratio and several
quantities that involve the third virial coefficient for star polymers with 4
and 6 arms in the good-solvent regime, in the limit of a large degree of
polymerization.
