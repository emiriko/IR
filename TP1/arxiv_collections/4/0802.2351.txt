We study the Josephson effect in small one-dimensional (1D) Josephson
junction arrays. For weak Josephson tunneling, topologically different regions
in the charge-stability diagram generate distinct current-phase relationships
(I$\Phi$). We present results for a three-junction system in the vicinity of
charge degeneracy lines and triple points. We explain the generalization to
larger arrays, show that discontinuities of the I$\Phi$ at phase $\pi$ persist
and that, at maximum degeneracy, the problem can be mapped to a tight-binding
model providing analytical results for arbitrary system size.
