For quantum effects to be significant in plasmas it is often assumed that the
temperature over density ratio must be small. In this paper we challenge this
assumption by considering the contribution to the dynamics from the electron
spin properties. As a starting point we consider a multicomponent plasma model,
where electrons with spin up and spin down are regarded as different fluids. By
studying the propagation of Alfv\'{e}n wave solitons we demonstrate that
quantum effects can survive in a relatively high-temperature plasma. The
consequences of our results are discussed.
