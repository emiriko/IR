We discuss the production of single top-quark final states by direct
supersymmetric flavor-changing interactions at the LHC. The total cross section
pp(gg)->t\bar{c}+\bar{t}c is computed at the 1-loop order within the
unconstrained MSSM. We prove that SUSY-QCD effects may furnish sizeable
production rates amounting up to barely 10^5 t\bar{c}(c\bar{t}) events per 100
fb^{-1} of integrated luminosity, in full compliance with the stringent
low-energy constraints from b->s gamma. Furthermore, we show that the
cooperative SUSY-EW effects can be sizeable on their own, regardless of the
SUSY-QCD contribution, with maximum production rates of the order of 10^3
events per 100 fb^{-1}. Owing to the fact that FCNC production of electrically
neutral heavy-quark pairs is virtually absent within the SM, we conclude that
the observation of such pp(gg)->t\bar{c}+\bar{t}c processes at the LHC could
lead to evidence of new physics - of likely supersymmetric nature.
