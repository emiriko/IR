We have performed detailed multifractal analysis on the minutely volatility
of two indexes and 1139 stocks in the Chinese stock markets based on the
partition function approach. The partition function $\chi_q(s)$ scales as a
power law with respect to box size $s$. The scaling exponents $\tau(q)$ form a
nonlinear function of $q$. Statistical tests based on bootstrapping show that
the extracted multifractal nature is significant at the 1% significance level.
The individual securities can be well modeled by the $p$-model in turbulence
with $p = 0.40 \pm 0.02$. Based on the idea of ensemble averaging (including
quenched and annealed average), we treat each stock exchange as a whole and
confirm the existence of multifractal nature in the Chinese stock markets.
