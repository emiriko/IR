The cross sections for e+e- to pi+pi-J/psi, pi+pi-psi(2S), K+K-J/psi, DDbar,
DDbar pi, D*Dbar, and D*D*bar are measured using data sample collected on or
near the Upsilon(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at KEKB. A peak near
4.25 GeV/c^2, corresponding to the so called Y(4260), is observed in
pi+pi-J/psi final state. In addition, there is another cluster of events at
around 4.05 GeV/c^2. Two resonant structures are observed in the pi+pi-psi(2S)
invariant mass distribution, one at 4361+-9+-9 MeV/c^2 with a width of
74+-15+-10 MeV/c^2, and another at 4664+-11+-5 MeV/c^2 with a width of
48+-15+-3 MeV/c^2. The rich structures observed in all these final states
indicate that our understanding of the vector charmonium states above the open
charm threshold is still poor, let alone the other possible dynamics such as
charmonium hybrids or final state re-scattering and so on.
