Electrical polarization of nuclear spins is studied in a Corbino disk under a
breakdown regime of the quantum Hall effect (QHE). Since the edge channels are
completely absent in the Corbino disk, we conclude that the electric current
flowing in the bulk channel of a quantum Hall conductor is relevant to dynamic
nuclear polarization (DNP). A pump and probe measurement demonstrates that DNP
emerges near the critical voltage of the QHE breakdown. The agreement of the
onset voltage of DNP with that of the QHE breakdown indicates that the
underlying origin of DNP is closely related to that of the QHE breakdown.
