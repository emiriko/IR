PDZ domains are typical examples of binding motifs mediating the formation of
protein-protein assemblies in many different cells. A quantitative
characterization of the mechanisms intertwining structure, chemistry and
dynamics with the PDZ function represent a challenge in molecular biology. Here
we investigated the influence of native state topology on the thermodynamics
and the dissociation kinetics for a complex PDZ-peptide via Molecular Dynamics
simulations based on a coarse-grained description of PDZ domains. Our
native-centric approach neglects chemical details but incorporates the basic
structural information to reproduce the protein functional dynamics as it
couples to the binding. We found that at physiological temperatures the
unbinding of a peptide from the PDZ domain becomes increasingly diffusive
rather than thermally activated, as a consequence of the significant reduction
of the free energy barrier with temperature. In turn, this results in a
significant slowing down of the process of two orders of magnitude with respect
to the conventional Arrhenius extrapolation from low temperature calculations.
Finally, a detailed analysis of a typical unbinding event based on the rupture
times of single peptide-PDZ contacts allows to shed further light on the
dissociation mechanism and to elaborate a coherent picture of the relation
between function and dynamics in PDZ domains.
