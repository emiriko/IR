Processor and system architectures that feature multiple memory controllers
are prone to show bottlenecks and erratic performance numbers on codes with
regular access patterns. Although such effects are well known in the form of
cache thrashing and aliasing conflicts, they become more severe when memory
access is involved. Using the new Sun UltraSPARC T2 processor as a prototypical
multi-core design, we analyze performance patterns in low-level and application
benchmarks and show ways to circumvent bottlenecks by careful data layout and
padding.
