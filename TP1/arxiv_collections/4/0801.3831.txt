Discrimination between unknown processes chosen from a finite set is
experimentally shown to be possible even in the case of non-orthogonal
processes. We demonstrate unambiguous deterministic quantum process
discrimination (QPD) of non-orthogonal processes using properties of
entanglement, additional known unitaries, or higher dimensional systems. Single
qubit measurement and unitary processes and multipartite unitaries (where the
unitary acts non-separably across two distant locations) acting on photons are
discriminated with a confidence of $\geq97%$ in all cases.
