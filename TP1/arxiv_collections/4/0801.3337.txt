Laccases (benzenodiol: oxygen oxidoreductases; EC 1.10.3.2) are multicopper
oxidases of wide substrate specificity mainly found in white-rot fungi, which
are the only microorganisms able to degrade the whole wood components, but they
are also expressed in bacteria and higher plants. Laccases are used currently
in biotechnological processes because this enzyme oxidizes both phenolic and
non-phenolic lignin-related compounds as well as highly recalcitrant
environmental pollutants. In this work banana skin has been selected as a
supporting material for laccase produntion because of its high content in
carbohydrates, which due to their organic nature are easily metabolized by the
fungus. In addition, its content in ascorbic acid exerts an inhibitory effect
against bacteria. The activity of the produced laccase is tested in
decoloration studies.
