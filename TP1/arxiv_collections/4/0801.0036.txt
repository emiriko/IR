The charged and the neutral currents are obtained by using a formal
algebraical approach (developed and applied by the author) within the exact
solution of a 3-3-1 gauge model with right-handed neutrinos. The entire
Standard Model phenomenology is recovered without imposing any supplemental
condition, but only by choosing an adecquate set of parameters from the very
beginning of the calculus. A new and rich phenomenology regarding the particles
and their currents occurs as well. The appealing feature of our results resides
in the exact expressions of the currents which need not the adjustment usually
due to the small mixing angle $\phi$ between neutral bosons $Z$ and
$Z^{\prime}$ (like in the most of the papers in the literature treating the
same issue). The required mixing was considered and aleready performed as an
intermediate step by the solving method itself, since the physical eigenstates
of those bosons were determined and then identified in the neutral currents.
