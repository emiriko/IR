We show that when we endow the action principle with the overlooked
possibility to allow endpoint selection, it gains an enormous additional power,
which, perhaps surprisingly, directly corresponds to biological behavior. The
biological version of the least action principle is the most action principle.
For the first time, we formulate here the first principle of biology in a
mathematical form and present some of its applications of primary importance.
