We present a procedure for reconstructing particle cascades from event data
measured in a high energy physics experiment. For evaluating the hypothesis of
a specific physics process causing the observed data, all possible
reconstruction versions of the scattering process are constructed from the
final state objects. We describe the procedure as well as examples of physics
processes of different complexity studied at hadron-hadron colliders. We
estimate the performance by 20 microseconds per reconstructed decay vertex, and
0.6 kByte per reconstructed particle in the decay trees.
