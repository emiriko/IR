The equation of gluodynamics with modified integral kernel is solved up to
2NLO (next-to-next-to-leading order) and 3NLO (next-to-next-to-next-to-leading
order) in perturbative QCD. A relationship between the nuclear factor Ns and
the ratio of the cumulant and factorial moments of the multiplicity
distribution is examined. A comparison of theoretical results and experimental
data in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at 200A GeV and 546A GeV is carried out.
