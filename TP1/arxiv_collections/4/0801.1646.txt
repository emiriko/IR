We study the role of particle-hole symmetry on the universality class of
various quantum phase transitions corresponding to the onset of superfluidity
at zero temperature of bosons in a quenched random medium. The functional
integral formulation of this problem in d spatial dimensions yields a
(d+1)-dimensional classical XY-model with extended disorder--the so-called
random rod problem. Particle-hole symmetry may then be broken by adding nonzero
site energies. We may distinguish three cases: (i) exact particle-hole
symmetry, in which the site energies all vanish, (ii) statistical particle-hole
symmetry in which the site energy distribution is symmetric about zero,
vanishing on average, and (iii) complete absence of particle-hole symmetry in
which the distribution is generic. We explore in each case the nature of the
excitations in the non-superfluid Mott insulating and Bose glass phases. We
find that the Bose glass compressibility, which has the interpretation of a
temporal spin stiffness or superfluid density, is positive in cases (ii) and
(iii), but that it vanishes with an essential singularity as full particle-hole
symmetry is restored. We then focus on the critical point and discuss the
relevance of type (ii) particle-hole symmetry breaking perturbations to the
random rod critical behavior. We argue that a perturbation of type (iii) is
irrelevant to the resulting type (ii) critical behavior: the statistical
symmetry is restored on large scales close to the critical point, and case (ii)
therefore describes the dirty boson fixed point. To study higher dimensions we
attempt, with partial success, to generalize the Dorogovtsev-Cardy-Boyanovsky
double epsilon expansion technique to this problem. The qualitative
renormalization group flow picture this technique provides is quite compelling.
