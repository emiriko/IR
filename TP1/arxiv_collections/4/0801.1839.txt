In adiabatic Cooper pair pumps, operated by means of gate voltage modulation
only, the quantization of the pumped charge during a cycle is limited due to
the quantum coherence of the macroscopic superconducting wave function. In this
work we show that it is possible to obtain very accurate pumps in the
non-adiabatic regime by a suitable choice of the shape of the gate voltage
pulses. We determine the shape of these pulses by applying quantum optimal
control theory to this problem. In the optimal case the error, with respect to
the quantized value, can be as small as of the order of (10E-6)e: the error is
reduced by up to five orders of magnitude with respect to the adiabatic
pumping. In order to test the experimental feasibility of this approach we
consider the effect of charge noise and the deformations of the optimal pulse
shapes on the accuracy of the pump. Charge noise is assumed to be induced by
random background charges in the substrate, responsible for the observed 1/f
noise. Inaccuracies in the pulse shaping are described by assuming a finite
bandwidth for the pulse generator. In realistic cases the error increases at
most of one order of magnitude as compared to the optimal case. Our results are
promising for the realization of accurate and fast superconducting pumps.
