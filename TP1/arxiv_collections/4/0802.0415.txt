Ensembles of single-source events, produced in peripheral and central
collisions and correponding respectively to quasi-projectile and quasi-fusion
sources, are analyzed. After selections on fragment kinematic properties,
excitation energies of the sources are derived using the calorimetric method
and the mean behaviour of fragments of the two ensembles are compared.
Differences observed in their partitions, especially the charge asymmetry, can
be related to collective energy deposited in the systems during the collisions.
