We present an introductory overview of the use of spin chains as quantum
wires, which has recently developed into a topic of lively interest. The
principal motivation is in connecting quantum registers without resorting to
optics. A spin chain is a permanently coupled 1D system of spins. When one
places a quantum state on one end of it, the state will be dynamically
transmitted to the other end with some efficiency if the spins are coupled by
an exchange interaction. No external modulations or measurements on the body of
the chain, except perhaps at the very ends, is required for this purpose. For
the simplest (uniformly coupled) chain and the simplest encoding (single qubit
encoding), however, dispersion reduces the quality of transfer. We present a
variety of alternatives proposed by various groups to achieve perfect quantum
state transfer through spin chains. We conclude with a brief discussion of the
various directions in which the topic is developing.
