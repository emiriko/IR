We use the more intuitive approach due to Kolmogorov (and subsequently,
Landau in his text on fluid dynamics) to calculate some third-order structure
functions for quasi-geostrophic turbulence for the forward cascade of
pseudo-potential enstrophy and the inverse energy cascade in quasi-geostrophic
turbulence.
