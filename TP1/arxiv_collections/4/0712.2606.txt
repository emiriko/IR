A small part of the Torah is arranged into a two dimensional array. The
characters are then permuted using a simple recursive deterministic algorithm.
The various permutations are then passed through three stochastic filters and
one deterministic filter to identify the permutations which most closely
approximate readable Biblical Hebrew. Of the 15 Billion sequences available at
the second level of recursion, 800 pass the a priori thresholds set for each
filter. The resulting "Biblical Hebrew" text is available for inspection and
the generation of further material continues.
