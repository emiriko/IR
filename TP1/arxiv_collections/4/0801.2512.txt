The angular correlation of the electrons in the neutrinoless double beta
decay ($0\nu2\beta$) is calculated taking into account the nucleon recoil, the
$S$ and $P$-waves for the electrons and the electron mass using a general
Lorentz invariant effective Lagrangian. We show that the angular coefficient is
essentially independent of the nuclear matrix element models. We work out the
angular coefficient in several scenarios for new physics, in particular, in the
left-right symmetric models.
