We report on magnetotransport measurements on CoFe nanoparticles surrounded
by an insulating organic layer. Samples were obtained by evaporating a solution
of nanoparticles on a patterned substrate. Typical behaviour of Coulomb
blockade in array of nanoparticles is observed. High and low field
magnetoresistance have been evidenced. Below 10 K, a large high-field
magnetoresistance is measured, reaching up to 500 %. Its amplitude decreases
strongly with increasing voltage. At 1.6 K, this high-field magnetoresistance
vanishes and an inverse low field tunnelling magnetoresistance is observed.
