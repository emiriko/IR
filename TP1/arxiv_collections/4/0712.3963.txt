In looking for imprints of extra dimensions in brane world models one usually
builts these so that they are compatible with known low energy physics and thus
focuses on high energy effects. Nevertheless, just as submillimeter Newton's
law tests probe the mode structure of gravity other low energy tests might
apply to matter. As a model example, in this work we determine the 4D Casimir
force corresponding to a scalar field subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions
on two parallel planes lying within the single brane of a Randall-Sundrum
scenario extended by one compact extra dimension. Using the Green's function
method such a force picks the contribution of each field mode as if it acted
individually but with a weight given by the square of the mode wave functions
on the brane. In the low energy regime one regains the standard 4D Casimir
force that is associated to a zero mode in the massless case or to a
quasilocalized or resonant mode in the massive one whilst the effect of the
extra dimensions gets encoded as an additional term.
