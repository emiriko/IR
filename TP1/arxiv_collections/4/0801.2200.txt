Simultaneous $\chi^{2}$ analyses are performed for elastic scattering and
fusion cross section data for the $^{12}$C+$^{208}$Pb system at
near-Coulomb-barrier energies by using the extended optical model approach in
which the polarization potential is decomposed into direct reaction (DR) and
fusion parts. Use is made of the double folding potential as a bare potential.
It is found that the experimental elastic scattering and fusion data are well
reproduced without introducing any normalization factor for the double folding
potential and also that both DR and fusion parts of the polarization potential
determined from the $\chi^{2}$ analyses satisfy separately the dispersion
relation. Furthermore, it is shown that the imaginary parts of both DR and
fusion potentials at the strong absorption radius change very rapidly, which
results in a typical threshold anomaly in the total imaginary potential as
observed with tightly bound projectiles such as $\alpha$-particle and $^{16}$O.
