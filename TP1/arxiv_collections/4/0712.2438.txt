The (W,Q2)-dependence of the ratio of inclusive electron scattering cross
sections for 15N/12C was determined in the kinematic range 0.8<W<2 GeV and
0.2<Q2<1 GeV2 using 2.285 GeV electrons and the CLAS detector at Jefferson Lab.
The ratios exhibit only slight resonance structure, in agreement with a simple
phenomenological model and an extrapolation of DIS ratios to low Q2. Ratios of
4He/12C using 1.6 to 2.5 GeV electrons were measured with very high statistical
precision, and were used to correct for He in the N and C targets. The (W,Q2)
dependence of the 4He/12C ratios is in good agreement with the phenomenological
model, and exhibit significant resonance structure centered at W=0.94, 1.23 and
1.5 GeV.
