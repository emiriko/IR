I recently demonstrated that the Earth is a mechanical oscillator in which
springtide induced magnification of all-masses resonance forces tectonics. I
here generalize this georesonator concept so to make it apply to any body,
anywhere in all the universes, and at all times. It turns out that there is no
distinction between physics at intergalactic, mechanist, quantum, and smaller
scales. Instead of being a constant (of proportionality of physics at all
scales), G is a parameter of most general form: G = s e^2, nonlinearly varying
amongst different scales s. The so called scale variability of physics but not
of G, imagined as such by Planck and Einstein, is due to springtide-induced
extreme resonance of Earth masses critically impeding terrestrial experiments
for estimating G, while providing artificial settings for quantum experiments
to all trivially "work". Thus the derived equation is that of levitation.
Reality is a system of near infinitely many magnifying oscillators, where
permanent energy decay of all oscillation forbids constancy of known "physical
constants". This hyperresonator concept explains the magnetism (as every forced
oscillator feature), as well as the gravitation (as forward propagation of
mechanical vibrations along the aether i.e. throughout the vacuum structure).
To test my claim I propose a Space mission to collect on site measurements of
eigenperiods of the Sun, its planets, and their satellites. The levitation
equitation enables propulsionless Space travel via gravity sailing: Space
vehicle hull ought to be engineered so as to automatically adjust its grave
mode, to the vehicle instant gravitational surroundings, akin to trout up
swimming.
