We derive the model equations describing the thermoacoustic resonator, that
is, an acoustical resonator containing a viscous medium inside. Previous
studies on this system have addressed this sytem in the frame of the plane-wave
approximation, we extend the previous model to by considering spatial effects
in a large aperture resonator. This model exhibits pattern formation and
localized structures scenario.
