Anomalous quantum Hall effects in single-layer and bilayer graphene are
related with nontrivial topological properties of electron states (Berry phases
$\pi$ and 2$\pi$, respectively). It was known that the Atiyah-Singer index
theorem guarantees, for the case of the single-layer, existence of zero-energy
states for the case of inhomogeneous magnetic fields assuming that the total
flux is non-zero. This leads, in particular, to appearance of midgap states in
corrugated graphene and topologically protects zero-energy Landau level in
corrugated single-layer graphene. Here we apply this theorem to the case of
bilayer graphene and prove the existence of zero-energy modes for this case.
