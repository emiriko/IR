We present a new probabilistic algorithm to find a finite set of points
intersecting the closure of each connected component of the realization of
every sign condition over a family of real polynomials defining regular
hypersurfaces that intersect transversally. This enables us to show a
probabilistic procedure to list all feasible sign conditions over the
polynomials. In addition, we extend these results to the case of closed sign
conditions over an arbitrary family of real multivariate polynomials. The
complexity bounds for these procedures improve the known ones.
