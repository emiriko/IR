This paper investigates the effect of drug treatment on the standard
within-host HIV model, assuming that therapy occurs periodically. It is shown
that eradication is possible under these periodic regimes, and we
quantitatively characterize successful drugs or drug combinations, both
theoretically and numerically. We also consider certain optimization problems,
motivated for instance, by the fact that eradication should be achieved at
acceptable toxicity levels to the patient. It turns out that these optimization
problems can be simplified considerably, and this makes calculations of the
optima a fairly straightforward task. All our results will be illustrated by
means of numerical examples based on up-to-date knowledge of parameter values
in the model.
