Results of point contact Andreev reflection (PCAR) experiments on (In,Mn)Sb
are presented and analyzed in terms of current models of charge conversion at a
superconductor-ferromagnet interface. We investigate the influence of surface
transparency, and study the crossover from ballistic to diffusive transport
regime as contact size is varied. Application of a Nb tip to a (In,Mn)Sb sample
with Curie temperature Tc of 5.4 K allowed the determination of
spin-polarization when the ferromagnetic phase transition temperature is
crossed. We find a striking difference between the temperature dependence of
the local spin polarization and of the macroscopic magnetization, and
demonstrate that nanoscale clusters with magnetization close to the saturated
value are present even well above the magnetic phase transition temperature.
