Dependencies between types in object-oriented software can be viewed as
directed graphs, with types as nodes and dependencies as edges. The in-degree
and out-degree distributions of such graphs have quite different forms, with
the former resembling a power-law distribution and the latter an exponential
distribution. This effect appears to be independent of application or type
relationship. A simple generative model is proposed to explore the proposition
that the difference arises because the programmer is aware of the out-degree of
a type but not of its in-degree. The model reproduces the two distributions,
and compares reasonably well to those observed in 14 different type
relationships across 12 different Java applications.
