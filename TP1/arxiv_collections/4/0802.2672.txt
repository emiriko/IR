Sub shot noise imaging of weak object by exploiting Parametric Down Converted
light represents a very interesting technological development. A precise
characterization of PDC speckle structure in dependence of pump beam parameters
is a fundamental tool for this application. In this paper we present a first
set of data addressed to this purpose.
