We find the most general supersymmetric solutions of ungauged N=1,d=4
supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of vector and chiral
supermultiplets, which turn out to be essentially pp-waves and strings. We also
introduce magnetic 1-forms and their supersymmetry transformations and 2-forms
associated to the isometries of the scalar manifold and their supersymmetry
transformations. Only the latter can couple to BPS objects (strings), in
agreement with our results.
