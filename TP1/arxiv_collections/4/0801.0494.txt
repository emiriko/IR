We have recently presented a novel protocol to teleport an unknown atomic
state via cavity QED and position measurements. Here, after a brief review of
our scheme, we provide a quantitative study of its efficiency. This is
accomplished by an explicit description of the measurement process that allows
us to derive the fidelity with respect to the atomic internal state to be
teleported.
