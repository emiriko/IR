A random matrix model to describe the coupling of $m$-fold symmetry is
constructed. The particular threefold case is used to analyze data on
eigenfrequencies of elastomechanical vibration of an anisotropic quartz block.
It is suggested that such experimental/theoretical study may supply a powerful
means to discern intrinsic symmetry of physical systems.
