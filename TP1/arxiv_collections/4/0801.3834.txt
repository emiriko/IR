Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p>0$ and $C$ a
connected nonsingular projective curve over $k$ with genus $g \geq 2$. Let
$(C,G)$ be a "big action", i.e. a pair $(C,G)$ where $G$ is a $p$-subgroup of
the $k$-automorphism group of $C$ such that$\frac{|G|}{g} >\frac{2 p}{p-1}$. We
denote by $G_2$ the second ramification group of $G$ at the unique ramification
point of the cover $C \to C/G$. The aim of this paper is to describe the big
actions whose $G_2$ is $p$-elementary abelian. In particular, we obtain a
structure theorem by considering the $k$-algebra generated by the additive
polynomials. We more specifically explore the case where there is a maximal
number of jumps in the ramification filtration of $G_2$. In this case, we
display some universal families.
