This paper considers the problem of cardinality estimation in data stream
applications. We present a statistical analysis of probabilistic counting
algorithms, focusing on two techniques that use pseudo-random variates to form
low-dimensional data sketches. We apply conventional statistical methods to
compare probabilistic algorithms based on storing either selected order
statistics, or random projections. We derive estimators of the cardinality in
both cases, and show that the maximal-term estimator is recursively computable
and has exponentially decreasing error bounds. Furthermore, we show that the
estimators have comparable asymptotic efficiency, and explain this result by
demonstrating an unexpected connection between the two approaches.
