The Weibel instability in the quantum plasma case is treated by means of a
fluid-like (moments) approach. Quantum modifications to the macroscopic
equations are then identified as effects of first or second kind. Quantum
effects of the first kind correspond to a dispersive term, similar to the Bohm
potential in the quantum hydrodynamic equations for plasmas. Effects of the
second kind are due to the Fermi statistics of the charge carriers and can
become the dominant influence for strong degeneracy. The macroscopic dispersion
relations are of higher order than those for the classical Weibel instability.
This corresponds to the presence of a cutoff wave-number even for the strong
temperature anisotropy case.
