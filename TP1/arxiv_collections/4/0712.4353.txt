The path integral approach to quantum mechanics requires a substantial
generalisation to describe the dynamics of systems confined to bounded domains.
Non-local boundary conditions can be introduced in Feynman's approach by means
of boundary amplitude distributions and complex phases to describe the quantum
dynamics in terms of the classical trajectories. The different prescriptions
involve only trajectories reaching the boundary and correspond to different
choices of boundary conditions of selfadjoint extensions of the Hamiltonian.
One dimensional particle dynamics is analysed in detail.
