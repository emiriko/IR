A painting consists of objects which are arranged in specific ways. The art
of painting is drawing the objects, which can be considered as known trends, in
an expressive manner. Detrended methods are suitable for characterizing the
artistic works of the painter by eliminating trends. It means that we study the
paintings, regardless of its apparent purpose, as a stochastic process. We
apply multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis to characterize the
statistical properties of Mona Lisa, as an instance, to exhibit the fractality
of the painting. Our results show that Mona Lisa is long range correlated and
almost behaves similar in various scales.
