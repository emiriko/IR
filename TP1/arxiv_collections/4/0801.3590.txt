The neutrinoproduction of charged $\rho$ mesons on nuclei and nucleons is
investigated for the first time at moderate energies ($<E_\nu > \approx$ 10
GeV), using the date obtained with SKAT bubble chamber. No strong nuclear
effects are observed in $\rho^+$ and $\rho^-$ production. The fractions of
charged and neutral pions originating from $\rho$ decays are obtained and
compared with higher energy data. From analysis of the obtained and available
data on $\rho^+$ and $K^{*+}$(892) neutrinoproduction, the strangeness
suppression factor in the quark string fragmentation is extracted: $\lambda_s =
0.18\pm0.03$. Estimations are obtained for cross sections of quasiexclusive
single $\rho^+$ and coherent $\rho^+$ neutrinoproduction on nuclei. The
estimated coherent cross section $\sigma_{\rho^+}^{coh}$ = (0.29$\pm0.16)\cdot
10^{-38}$ cm$^2$ is compatible with theoretical predictions.
