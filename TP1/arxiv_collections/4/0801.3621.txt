We prove the spin-statistics theorem for massive particles obeying braid
group statistics in three-dimensional Minkowski space. We start from first
principles of local relativistic quantum theory. The only assumption is a gap
in the mass spectrum of the corresponding charged sector, and a restriction on
the degeneracy of the corresponding mass.
