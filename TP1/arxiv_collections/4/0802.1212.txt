We consider Dirac particles confined to a thin strip, e.g., graphene
nanoribbon, with rough edges. The confinement is implemented by a large mass in
the Hamiltonian or by imposing boundary conditions directly on the graphene
wave-functions. The scattering of a rough edge leads to a transverse
channel-mixing and provides crucial limitation to the quantum transport in
narrow ribbons. We solve the problem perturbatively and find the edge
scattering contribution to the conductivity, which can be measured
experimentally. The case of Schroedinger particles in a strip is also
addressed, and the comparison between Schroedinger and Dirac transport is made.
Anomalies associated with quasi-one dimensionality, such as Van Hove
singularities and localization, are discussed. The violation of the Matthiessen
rule is pointed out.
