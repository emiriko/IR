The charged Higgs boson decays $H^\pm\to W^\pm A_1$ and $H^\pm\to W^\pm h_i$
are studied in the framework of the next-to Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model (NMSSM). It is found that the decay rate for $H^\pm\to W^\pm A_1$ can
exceed the rates for the $\tau^\pm\nu$ and $tb$ channels both below and above
the top-bottom threshold. The dominance of $H^\pm\to W^\pm A_1$ is most readily
achieved when $A_1$ has a large doublet component and small mass. We also study
the production process $pp\to H^\pm A_1$ at the LHC followed by the decay
$H^\pm\to W^\pm A_1$ which leads to the signature $W^\pm A_1 A_1$. We suggest
that $p p\to H^\pm A_1$ is a promising discovery channel for a light charged
Higgs boson in the NMSSM with small or moderate $\tan\beta$ and dominant decay
mode $H^\pm \to W^\pm A_1$. This $W^\pm A_1 A_1$ signature can also arise from
the Higgsstrahlung process $pp\to W^\pm h_1$ followed by the decay $h_1\to A_1
A_1$. It is shown that there exist regions of parameter space where these
processes can have comparable cross sections and we suggest that their
respective signals can be distinguished at the LHC by using appropriate
reconstruction methods.
