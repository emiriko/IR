We study the collider phenomenology of bilinear R-parity violating
supergravity, the simplest effective model for supersymmetric neutrino masses
accounting for the current neutrino oscillation data. At the CERN Large Hadron
Collider the center-of-mass energy will be high enough to probe directly these
models through the search for the superpartners of the Standard Model (SM)
particles. We analyze the impact of R-parity violation on the canonical
supersymmetry searches - that is, we examine how the decay of the lightest
supersymmetric particle (LSP) via bilinear R-parity violating interactions
degrades the average expected missing momentum of the reactions and show how
this diminishes the reach in the 'usual' channels for supersymmetry searches.
However, the R-parity violating interactions lead to an enhancement of the
final states containing isolated same-sign di-leptons and trileptons,
compensating the reach loss in the fully inclusive channel. We show how the
searches for displaced vertices associated to LSP decay substantially increase
the coverage in supergravity parameter space, giving the corresponding reaches
for two reference luminosities of 10 and 100 fb$^{-1}$ and compare with those
of the R-parity conserving minimal supergravity model.
