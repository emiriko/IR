We report results of molecular dynamics simulations characterizing the
solvation and interaction of small apolar particles such as methane and Xenon
in imidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs). The simulations are able to reproduce
semi-quantitatively the anomalous temperature dependence of the solubility of
apolar particles in the infinite dilution regime. We observe that the
``solvophobic solvation'' of small apolar particles in ILs is governed by
compensating entropic and enthalpic contributions, very much like the
hydrophobic hydration of small apolar particles in liquid water. In addition,
our simulations clearly indicate that the solvent mediated interaction of
apolar particles dissolved in ILs is similarly driven by compensating
enthalpic/entropic contributions, making the ``solvophobic interaction''
thermodynamically analogous to the hydrophobic interaction.
