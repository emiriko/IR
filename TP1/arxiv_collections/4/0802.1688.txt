Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is observed in gaseous 4He at
room temperature. Ultra-narrow (less than 10 kHz) EIT windows are obtained for
the first time for purely electronic spins in the presence of Doppler
broadening. The positive role of collisions is emphasized through measurements
of the power dependence of the EIT resonance. Measurement of slow light opens
up possible ways to applications.
