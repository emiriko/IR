We present a phenomenological Lagrangian and Poisson brackets for obtaining
nondissipative hydrodynamic theory of supersolids. A Lagrangian is constructed
on the basis of unification of the principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics
and classical field theory. The Poisson brackets, governing the dynamics of
supersolids, are uniquely determined by the invariance requirement of the
kinematic part of the found Lagrangian. The generalization of Lagrangian is
discussed to include the dynamics of vortices. The obtained equations of motion
do not account for any dynamic symmetry associated with Galilean or Lorentz
invariance. They can be reduced to the original Andreev-Lifshitz equations if
to require Galilean invariance. We also present a relativistic-invariant
supersolid hydrodynamics, which might be useful in astrophysical applications.
