A composite, exponential relaxation function, modulated by a periodic
component, was used to fit to an experimental time series of blood glucose
levels. The 11 parameters function that allows for the detection of a possible
rhythm transition was fitted to the experimental time series using a genetic
algorithm. It has been found that the relaxation from a hyperglycemic condition
following a change in the anti-diabetic treatment, can be characterized by a
change from an initial 12 hours ultradian rhythm to a near-24 hours circadian
rhythm.
