Several searches for long-lived particles have been performed using data from
p-pbar collisions from Run II at the Tevatron. In most cases, new analysis
techniques have been developed to carry out each search and/or estimate the
backgrounds. These searches expand the discovery potential of the CDF and D0
experiments to new physics that may have been missed by traditional search
techniques. This review discusses searches for (1) neutral, long-lived
particles decaying to muons, (2) massive, neutral, long-lived particles
decaying to a photon and missing energy, (3) stopped gluinos, and (4) charged
massive stable particles. It summarizes some of the theoretical and
experimental motivations for such searches.
