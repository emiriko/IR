It is widely documented that the absence of a structured approach to
spreadsheet engineering is a key factor in the high level of spreadsheet
errors. In this paper we propose and investigate the application of Test-Driven
Development to the creation of spreadsheets. Test-Driven Development is an
emerging development technique in software engineering that has been shown to
result in better quality software code. It has also been shown that this code
requires less testing and is easier to maintain. Through a pair of case studies
we demonstrate that Test-Driven Development can be applied to the development
of spreadsheets. We present the detail of these studies preceded by a clear
explanation of the technique and its application to spreadsheet engineering. A
supporting tool under development by the authors is also documented along with
proposed research to determine the effectiveness of the methodology and the
associated tool.
