We present experimental studies of static and dynamic properties of 0, pi and
0-pi superconductor-insulator-ferromagnet-superconductor (SIFS) Josephson
junctions of small and intermediate length. In the underdamped limit these
junctions exhibit a rich dynamical behavior such as resonant steps on the
current-voltage characteristics. Varying the experimental conditions, zero
field steps, Fiske steps and Shapiro steps are observed with a high resolution.
A strong signature of the 0-pi Josephson junction is demonstrated by measuring
the critical current as a function of two components (B_x, B_y) of an in-plane
magnetic field. The experimental observation of a half-integer zero field step
in 0-pi SIFS junctions is presented.
