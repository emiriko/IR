Proposed is an alternative method for permutational sampling in quantum gases
using the path integral formulation of statistical mechanics. It is shown that
in principle we are able to use two operators which enable us to construct a
Markov chain through a graph of the irreducible representation of the symmetric
group. As an illustration of this method, a test calculation of four particles
in a harmonic trap is performed.
