Scroll waves exist ubiquitously in three-dimensional excitable media. It's
rotation center can be regarded as a topological object called vortex filament.
In three-dimensional space, the vortex filaments usually form closed loops, and
even linked and knotted. In this letter, we give a rigorous topological
description of knotted vortex filaments. By using the $\phi$-mapping
topological current theory, we rewrite the topological current form of the
charge density of vortex filaments and use this topological current we reveal
that the Hopf invariant of vortex filaments is just the sum of the linking and
self-linking numbers of the knotted vortex filaments. We think that the precise
expression of the Hopf invariant may imply a new topological constraint on
knotted vortex filaments.
