We describe the Fortran code CPsuperH2.}, which contains several improvements
and extensions of its predecessor CPsuperH. It implements improved calculations
of the Higgs-boson pole masses, notably a full treatment of the 4 times 4
neutral Higgs propagator matrix including the Goldstone boson and a more
complete treatment of threshold effects in self-energies and Yukawa couplings,
improved treatments of two-body Higgs decays, some important three-body decays,
and two-loop Higgs-mediated contributions to electric dipole moments.
CPsuperH2.0 also implements an integrated treatment of several B-meson
observables, including the branching ratios of B_s to mu^+ mu^-, B_d to tau^+
tau^-, B_u to tau nu, B to X_s gamma and the latter's CP-violating asymmetry
A_CP, and the supersymmetric contributions to the B^0_{s,d} - \bar B^0_{s,d}
mass differences. These additions make CPsuperH2.0 an attractive integrated
tool for analyzing supersymmetric CP and flavour physics as well as searches
for new physics at high-energy colliders such as the Tevatron, LHC and linear
colliders. The program may be obtained from
