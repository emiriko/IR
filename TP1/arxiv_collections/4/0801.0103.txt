We show that a complete Riemannian manifold has finite topological type
(i.e., homeomorphic to the interior of a compact manifold with boundary),
provided its Bakry-\'{E}mery Ricci tensor has a positive lower bound, and
either of the following conditions:
  (i) the Ricci curvature is bounded from above; (ii) the Ricci curvature is
bounded from below and injectivity radius is bounded away from zero.
  Moreover, a complete shrinking Ricci soliton has finite topological type if
its scalar curvature is bounded.
