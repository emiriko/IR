A three-component dynamic system with influence of pumping and nonlinear
dissipation describing a quantum cavity electrodynamic device is studied.
Different dynamical regimes are investigated in terms of divergent trajectories
approaches and fractal statistics. It has been shown, that in such a system
stable and unstable dissipative structures type of limit cycles can be formed
with variation of pumping and nonlinear dissipation rate. Transitions to
chaotic regime and the corresponding chaotic attractor are studied in details.
