A general method for numerical computation of the thermal density matrix of a
single-particle quantum system is presented. The Schrodinger equation in
imaginary time tau is solved numerically by the finite difference time domain
(FDTD) method using a set of initial wave functions at tau=0 . By choosing this
initial set appropriately, the set of wave functions generated by the FDTD
method can be used to construct the thermal density matrix. The theoretical
basis of the method, a numerical algorithm for its implementation, and
illustrative examples in one, two and three dimensions are given in this paper.
The numerical results show that the procedure is efficient and accurately
determines the density matrix and thermodynamic properties of single-particle
systems. Extensions of the method to more general cases are briefly indicated.
