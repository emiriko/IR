The Josephson tunneling through a 2D normal contact with the spin-orbit split
conduction band has been studied in the diffusive regime. Linearized Usadel
equations for triplet components of the pairing function revealed a striking
similarity to the equations of spin diffusion driven by the electric field in
normal metals. Consequently, we predict that the out-of-plane spin-Hall
polarization accumulates towards lateral sample edges and the in-plane
polarization is finite throughout the entire normal region. At the same time,
the spin-Hall current is absent in the considered case of the stationary
Josephson effect.
