The systematic trends in structural and electronic properties of perylene
diimide (PDI) derived dye molecules have been investigated by DFT calculations
based on projector augmented wave (PAW) method including gradient corrected
exchange-correlation effects. TDDFT calculations have been performed to study
the visible absorbance activity of these complexes. The effect of different
ligands and halogen atoms attached to PDI were studied to characterize the
light harvesting properties. The atomic size and electronegativity of the
halogen were observed to alter the relaxed molecular geometries which in turn
influenced the electronic behavior of the dye molecules. Ground state molecular
structure of isolated dye molecules studied in this work depends on both the
halogen atom and the carboxylic acid groups. DFT calculations revealed that the
carboxylic acid ligands did not play an important role in changing the
HOMO-LUMO gap of the sensitizer. However, they serve as anchor between the PDI
and substrate titania surface of the solar cell or photocatalyst. A
commercially available dye-sensitizer, ruthenium bipyridine (RuBpy), was also
studied for electronic and structural properties in order to make a comparison
with PDI derivatives for light harvesting properties. Results of this work
suggest that fluorinated, chlorinated, brominated, and iyodinated PDI compounds
can be useful as sensitizers in solar cells and in artificial photosynthesis.
