In the past few years the B-factories became unexpected players in the scalar
mesons business: in order to access the CP violation effects, it is necessary
to handle the dynamics of the strong interaction between the final state
hadrons. A number of large statistics studies heavy flavor decays involving a
scalar component have been performed recently by Belle and BaBar, who have
joined CLEOc, BES, E791 and FOCUS in the effort to understand the physics of
the scalar mesons. In this talk, the most recent results from these experiments
will be reviewed, with emphasis on the low energy $K\pi$ system and on the
f0(1370).
