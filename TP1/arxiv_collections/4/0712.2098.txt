We use phase field simulations to study composites made of two different
ferroelastics (e.g., two types of martensite). The deformation of one material
due to a phase transformation can elastically affect the other constituent and
induce it to transform as well. We show that the phase transformation can then
occur above its normal critical temperature and even higher above this
temperature in nanocomposites than in bulk composites. Microstructures depend
on temperature, on the thickness of the layers, and on the crystal structure of
the two constituents -- certain nanocomposites exhibit a great diversity of
microstructures not found in bulk composites. Also, the periodicity of the
martensite twins may vary over 1 order of magnitude based on geometry.
