There have been several propositions for a geometric and essentially
non-linear formulation of quantum mechanics. From a purely mathematical point
of view, the point of view of Jordan algebra theory might give new strength to
such approaches: there is a ``Jordan geometry'' belonging to the Jordan part of
the algebra of observables, in the same way as Lie groups belong to the Lie
part. Both the Lie geometry and the Jordan geometry are well-adapted to
describe certain features of quantum theory. We concentrate here on the
mathematical description of the Jordan geometry and raise some questions
concerning possible relations with foundational issues of quantum theory.
