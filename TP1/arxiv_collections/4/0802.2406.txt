Results from two optical-fiber gravitational-wave interferometric detectors
are reported. The detector design is very small, cheap and simple to build and
operate. Using two detectors has permitted various tests of the design
principles as well as demonstrating the first simultaneous detection of
correlated gravitational waves from detectors spatially separated by 1.1km. The
frequency spectrum of the detected gravitational waves is sub-mHz with a strain
spectral index a=-1.4 +/- 0.1. As well as characterising the wave effects the
detectors also show, from data collected over some 80 days in the latter part
of 2007, the dominant earth rotation effect and the earth orbit effect. The
detectors operate by exploiting light speed anisotropy in optical-fibers. The
data confirms previous observations of light speed anisotropy, earth rotation
and orbit effects, and gravitational waves.
