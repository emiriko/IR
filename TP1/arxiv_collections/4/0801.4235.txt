The resonance production of new chiral spin-1 bosons and their detection
through the Drell--Yan process at the CERN LHC is considered. Quantitative
evaluations of various differential cross-sections of the chiral bosons
production are made within the CalcHEP package. The new neutral chiral bosons
can be observed as a Breit--Wigner resonance peak in the invariant dilepton
mass distribution, as usual. However, unique new signatures of the chiral
bosons exist. First, there is no Jacobian peak in the lepton transverse
momentum distribution. Second, the lepton angular distribution in the
Collins-Soper frame for the high on-peak invariant masses of the lepton pairs
has a peculiar "swallowtail" shape.
