Single crystals of RbOs2O6 have been grown from Rb2O and Os in sealed quartz
ampoules. The crystal structure has been identified at room temperature as
cubic with the lattice constant a = 10.1242(12) A. The anisotropy of the
tetrahedral and octahedral networks is lower and the displacement parameters of
alkali metal atoms are smaller than for KOs2O6, so the "rattling" of the alkali
atoms in RbOs2O6 is less pronounced. Superconducting properties of RbOs2O6 in
the mixed state have been well described within the London approach and the
Ginzburg-Landau parameter kappa(0) = 31 has been derived from the reversible
magnetization. This parameter is field dependent and changes at low
temperatures from kappa = 22 (low fields) to kappa = 31 at H_{c2}. The
thermodynamic critical field H_{c}(0) = 1.3 kOe and the superconducting gap
2delta/k_{B}T_{c} = 3.2 have been estimated. These results together with
slightly different H_{c2}(T) dependence obtained for crystals and
polycrystalline RbOs2O6 proof evidently that this compound is a weak-coupling
BCS-type superconductor close to the dirty limit.
