Angular distributions of 7Li(7Li,t), (7Li,alpha) and (7Li,6He) reactions were
measured for laboratory energies from 2 - 16 MeV. Exact finite range DWBA
analyses were performed with the aim to identify contributions of direct
processes and to investigate the applicability of DWBA to such few nucleon
systems. It turned out that DWBA can be successfully applied to estimate
differential and total cross sections of direct transfer processes in 7Li+7Li
interaction. The direct mechanism was found to play a dominant role in most of
these reactions but significant contributions of other, strongly energy
dependent processes were also established. It is suggested that these processes
might be due to isolated resonances superimposed on the backround of
statistical fluctuations arising from interference of compound nucleus and
direct transfer contributions.
