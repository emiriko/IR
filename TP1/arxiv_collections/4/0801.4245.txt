A calculation of nuclear effects in the extraction of neutron single spin
asymmetries in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering off 3He is described.
In the kinematics of forth-coming experiments at JLab, it is found that the
nuclear effects arising within an Impulse Approximation approach are under
control.
