We study the spin dynamics of two dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) with
Rashba spin-orbit coupling by taking account of electron-electron interactions.
The diffusion equations for charge and spin densities are derived by making use
of the path-integral approach and the quasiclassical Green's function.
Analyzing the effect of the interactions, we show that the spin-relaxation time
can be enhanced by the electron-electron interaction in the ballistic regime.
