We investigate and clarify the notion of locality as it pertains to the
cascades of two-dimensional turbulence. The mathematical framework underlying
our analysis is the infinite system of balance equations that govern the
generalized unfused structure functions, first introduced by L'vov and
Procaccia. As a point of departure we use a revised version of the system of
hypotheses that was proposed by Frisch for three-dimensional turbulence. We
show that both the enstrophy cascade and the inverse energy cascade are local
in the sense of non-perturbative statistical locality. We also investigate the
stability conditions for both cascades. We have shown that statistical
stability with respect to forcing applies unconditionally for the inverse
energy cascade. For the enstrophy cascade, statistical stability requires
large-scale dissipation and a vanishing downscale energy dissipation. A careful
discussion of the subtle notion of locality is given at the end of the paper.
