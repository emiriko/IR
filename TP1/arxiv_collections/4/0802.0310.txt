We analyse the possibilities to detect a new $Z^{\prime}$ boson in
di-electron events at Tevatron and LHC in the framework of the 331 model with
right-handed neutrinos. Using $p\bar{p}$ collision data collected by the CDF II
detector at Fermilab Tevatron, we find that the 331 $Z^{\prime}$ boson is
excluded with masses below 920 GeV. For an integrated luminosity of $100
fb^{-1}$ at LHC, and considering a central value $M_{Z^{\prime}}=1500$ GeV, we
obtain the invariant mass distribution in the process $pp\to Z^{\prime}\to
e^{+}e^{-}$, where a huge peak, corresponding to 800 signal events, is found
above the SM background. The number of di-electron events vary from 10000 to 1
in the mass range of $M_{Z^{\prime}}=1000-5000$ GeV.
