The author proposes, a priori, a simple set of principles that can be
developed into a range of algorithms by which means the Torah might be decoded.
It is assumed that the Torah is some form of transposition cipher with the
unusual property that the plain text of the Torah may also be the cipher text
of one or more other documents written in Biblical Hebrew. The decryption
principles are based upon the use of Equidistant Letter Sequences (ELS) and the
notions of Message Length, Dimensionality, Euclidean Dimension, Topology, Read
Direction, Skip Distance and offset. The principles can be applied recursively
and define numerous large subsets of the 304,807! theoretically possible
permutations of the characters of the Torah.
