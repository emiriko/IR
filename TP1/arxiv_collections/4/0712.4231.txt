We established a large class of exactly soluble spin liquids and chiral spin
liquids on three dimensional helix lattices by introducing Kitaev-type's spin
coupling. In the chiral spin liquids, exact stable ground states with
spontaneous breaking of the time reversal symmetry are found. The
fractionalized loop excitations in both the spin and chiral spin liquids obey
non-abelian statistics. We characterize this kind of statistics by non-abelian
Berry phase and quantum algebra relation. The topological correlation of loops
is independent of local order parameter and it measures the intrinsic global
quantum entanglement of degenerate ground states.
