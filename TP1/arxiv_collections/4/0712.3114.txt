The aim of this paper is to propose an abstract construction of spaces which
keep the main properties of the (already known) Hardy spaces H^1. We construct
spaces through an atomic (or molecular) decomposition. We prove some results
about continuity from these spaces into L^1 and some results about
interpolation between these spaces and the Lebesgue spaces. We also obtain some
results on weighted norm inequalities. Then we apply this abstract theory to
the L^p maximal regularity. Finally we present partial results in order to
understand a characterization of the duals of Hardy spaces.
