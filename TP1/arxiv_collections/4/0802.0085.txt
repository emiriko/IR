We study the dynamics of bright solitons formed in a Bose-Einstein condensate
with attractive atomic interactions perturbed by a weak bichromatic optical
lattice potential. The lattice depth is a biperiodic function of time with a
zero mean, which realises a flashing ratchet for matter-wave solitons. The
average velocity of a soliton and the directed soliton current induced by the
ratchet depend on the number of atoms in the soliton. We employ this feature to
study collisions between ratchet-driven solitons and find that soliton
transport can be induced through their interactions. In the regime when
matter-wave solitons are narrow compared to the lattice period the ratchet
dynamics is well described by the effective Hamiltonian theory.
