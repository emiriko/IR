We report on a theoretical study of quantum charge transport in atomistic
models of silicon nanowires with surface roughness-based disorder. Depending on
the nanowires features (length, roughness profile) various conduction regimes
are explored numerically by using efficient real space order N computational
approaches of both Kubo-Greenwood and Landauer-Buttiker transport frameworks.
Quantitative estimations of the elastic mean free paths, charge mobilities and
localization lengths are performed as a function of the correlation length of
the surface roughness disorder. The obtained values for charge mobilities well
compare with the experimental estimates of the most performant undoped
nanowires. Further the limitations of the Thouless relationship between the
mean free path and the localization length are outlined.
