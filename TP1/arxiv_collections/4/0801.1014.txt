The dependence of the Josephson Plasma Resonance (JPR) frequency in heavily
underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+\delta on temperature and controlled pointlike
disorder, introduced by high-energy electron irradiation, is cross-correlated
and compared to the behavior of the ab-plane penetration depth. It is found
that the zero temperature plasma frequency, representative of the superfluid
component of the c-axis spectral weight, decreases proportionally with T_c when
the disorder is increased. The temperature dependence of the JPR frequency is
the same for all disorder levels, including pristine crystals. The reduction of
the c-axis superfluid density as function of disorder is accounted for by
pair-breaking induced by impurity scattering in the CuO2 planes, rather than by
quantum fluctuations of the superconducting phase. The reduction of the c-axis
superfluid density as function of temperature follows a T^{2}--law and is
accounted for by quasi-particle hopping through impurity induced interlayer
states.
