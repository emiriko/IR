In this talk, we first give a brief review of the so-called minimal seesaw
models and then concentrate on the minimal type-I seesaw model with two almost
degenerate right-handed Majorana neutrinos of ${\cal O}(1 {\rm TeV})$. A
specific texture of the neutrino Yukawa coupling matrix is proposed to achieve
the nearly tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern. This ansatz predicts (1)
$\theta^{}_{23} = \pi/4$, $|\delta| = \pi/2$ and $\sin^2 \theta^{}_{12} = (1 -
2 \tan^2 \theta^{}_{13})/3$ in the $m^{}_1 = 0$ case; and (2) $\theta^{}_{23}
=\pi/4$ and $\theta^{}_{13} = \delta = 0$ in the $m^{}_3 = 0$ case. In both
cases, the cosmological baryon number asymmetry can be explained via the
resonant leptogenesis mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate the significance of
flavor-dependent effects in our leptogenesis scenario.
