Carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNT FETs) have been proposed as
possible building blocks for future nano-electronics. But a challenge with CNT
FETs is that they appear to randomly display varying amounts of hysteresis in
their transfer characteristics. The hysteresis is often attributed to charge
trapping in the dielectric layer between the nanotube and the gate. This study
includes 94 CNT FET samples, providing an unprecedented basis for statistics on
the hysteresis seen in five different CNT-gate configurations. We find that the
memory effect can be controlled by carefully designing the gate dielectric in
nm-thin layers. By using atomic layer depositions (ALD) of HfO$_{2}$ and
TiO$_{2}$ in a triple-layer configuration, we achieve the first CNT FETs with
consistent and narrowly distributed memory effects in their transfer
characteristics.
