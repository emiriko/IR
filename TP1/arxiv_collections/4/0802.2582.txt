We present models of flavorful supersymmetry in higher dimensions. The Higgs
fields and the supersymmetry breaking field are localized in the same place in
the extra dimension(s). The Yukawa couplings and operators generating the
supersymmetry breaking parameters then receive the same suppression factors
from the wavefunction profiles of the matter fields, leading to a specific
correlation between these two classes of interactions. The resulting
phenomenology is very rich, while stringent experimental constraints from the
low-energy flavor and CP violating processes can all be satisfied. We construct
both unified and non-unified models in this framework, which can be either
strongly or weakly coupled at the cutoff scale. We analyze one version in
detail, a strongly coupled unified model, which addresses various issues of
supersymmetric grand unification. The models presented here provide an explicit
example in which the supersymmetry breaking spectrum can be a direct window
into the physics of flavor at a very high energy scale.
