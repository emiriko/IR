By means of a numerical analysis using a non-Abelian symmetry realization of
the density matrix renormalization group, we study the behavior of vector
chirality correlations in isotropic frustrated chains of spin S=1 and S=1/2,
subject to a strong external magnetic field. It is shown that the field induces
a phase with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry, in line with earlier
theoretical predictions. We present results on the field dependence of the
order parameter and the critical exponents.
