We derive lattice actions for Yang-Mills quantum mechanics for models with
$\cQ=4, 8$ and 16 supercharges which possess an exact supersymmetry at non-zero
lattice spacing. These are obtained by dimensional reduction of twisted
versions of the corresponding super Yang-Mills theories in $D=2, 3$ and 4
dimensions.
