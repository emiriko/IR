During most of the Phanerozoic eon, which began about a half-billion years
ago, there were few glacial intervals until the late Pliocene 2.75 million
years ago. Beginning at that time, the Earth's climate entered a period of
instability with the onset of cyclical ice ages. At first these had a 41,000
year cycle, and about 1 million years ago the period lengthened to 100,000
years, which has continued to the present. Over this period of instability the
climate has been extraordinarily sensitive to small forcings, whether due to
Milankovitch cycles, solar variations, aerosols, or albedo variations driven by
cosmic rays. The current interglacial has lasted for some ten thousand
years-about the duration of past interglacials-and serious policy
considerations arise as it nears its likely end. It is extremely unlikely that
the current rise in carbon dioxide concentration-some 30% since 1750, and
projected further increase over the next few decades-will significantly
postpone the next glaciation.
