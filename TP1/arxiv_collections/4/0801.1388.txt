In this paper we employ all-electron time dependent density functional theory
(TDDFT) to calculate the long range dipole-dipole dispersion coefficient (van
der Waals coefficient) $C_{6}$ of alkali-metal atoms Li, Na, K, alkali-metal
atom dimers Li$_{2}$, Na$_{2}$, K$_{2}$ and sodium clusters containing even
number of atoms ranging from 2 to 20 atoms. The dispersion coefficients are
obtained via Casimir-Polder expression which relates it to the frequency
dependent linear polarizabilty at imaginary frequencies. The frequency
dependent polarizabilities are calculated by employing TDDFT--based complete
sum-over-states expressions for the atoms, and direct TDDFT linear response
theory for the closed shell dimers and clusters.
