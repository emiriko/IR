An extensive program of strange particle production off the nucleon is
currently underway with the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) in Hall
B at Jefferson Laboratory. This talk will emphasize strangeness
electroproduction in the baryon resonance region between W=1.6 and 2.4 GeV,
where indications of s-channel structure are suggestive of high-mass baryon
resonances coupling to kaons and hyperons in the final state. Precision
measurements of cross sections and polarization observables are being carried
out with highly polarized electron and real photon beams at energies up to 6
GeV. The near-term and longer-term future of this program will also be
discussed.
