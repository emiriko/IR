Precision tests of the Standard Model and searches for New Physics in the
quark flavor sector depend on accurate theoretical calculations of decay rates
and spectra for rare, flavor-changing processes. The theoretical status and
recent developments of techniques allowing such calculations are reviewed.
Special attention is paid to the calculation of the B->Xs+gamma branching
ratio, the extraction of the b-quark mass from a fit to B->Xc+l+nu moments, and
the determination of |V(ub)| from spectra in the inclusive decay B->Xu+l+nu.
  From a reanalysis of different inclusive distributions the updated average
value |V(ub)|=(3.98+-0.15+-0.30)*10^{-3} is derived. Using only the
theoretically cleanest channels, we obtain |V(ub)|=(3.70+-0.15+-0.28)*10^{-3}.
