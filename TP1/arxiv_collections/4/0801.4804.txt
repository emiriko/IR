Ultra-cold RbCs molecules in high-lying vibrational levels of the
a$^3\Sigma^+$ ground electronic state are confined in an optical trap.
Inelastic collision rates of these molecules with both Rb and Cs atoms are
determined for individual vibrational levels, across an order of magnitude of
binding energies. A simple model for the collision process is shown to
accurately reproduce the observed scattering rates.
