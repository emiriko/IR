Employing the Monte-Carlo method and the exact diagonalization, we have
investigated the temperature dependence of the thermoelectric power (TEP) for
the double exchange model in the dilute carrier concentration limit. We have
found that the TEP follows the Heikes formula in the high temperature regime,
whereas, in the intermediate temperature regime, the TEP is suppressed by the
exchange coupling between itinerant electrons and local spins. In the low
temperature regime, the TEP exhibits an anomalous peak and dip feature near the
magnetic transition temperature $T_C$ which can be understood based on the
magnetic polaron state. We have also found that the TEP, in the presence of the
magnetic field, shows the positive magnetothermoelectric power near $T_C$.
