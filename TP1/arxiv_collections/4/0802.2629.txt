Strange nonchaotic attractors (SNAs) are observed in quasiperiodically driven
time--delay systems. Since the largest Lyapunov exponent is nonpositive,
trajectories in two such identical but distinct systems show the property of
{\it phase}--synchronization. Our results are illustrated in the model SQUID
and R\"ossler oscillator systems.
