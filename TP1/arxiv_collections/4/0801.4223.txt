Numerical simulations of two-dimensional capillary filling using the
pseudo-potential lattice Boltzmann model for multiphase fluids are presented,
with special emphasis on the role of finite-vapour density effects. It is shown
that whenever the density of the light-phase exceeds about ten percent of the
dense phase, the front motion proceeds through a combined effect of capillary
advection and condensation. As a result, under these conditions, the front
proceeds at a higher speed as compared to the Washburn prediction. It is
suggested that such an acceleration effect might be observed in experiments
performed sufficiently close to critical conditions
