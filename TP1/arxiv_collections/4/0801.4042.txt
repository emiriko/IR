We report the stopping of an atomic beam, using a series of pulsed
electromagnetic coils. We use a supersonic beam of metastable neon created in a
gas discharge as a monochromatic source of paramagnetic atoms. A series of
coils is fired in a timed sequence to bring the atoms to near-rest, where they
are detected on a micro-channel plate. Applications to fundamental problems in
physics and chemistry are discussed.
