Cumulant generating function phi(n) and rate function Sigma(f) of the free
energy is evaluated in p-body Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model by using the
replica method with the replica number n finite. From a perturbational
argument, we show that the cumulant generating function is constant in the
vicinity of n = 0. On the other hand, with the help of two analytic properties
of phi(n), the behavior of phi(n) is derived again. However this is also shown
to be broken at a finite value of n, which gives a characteristic value in the
rate function near the thermodynamic value of the free energy. Through the
continuation of phi(n) as a function of n, we find out a way to derive the 1RSB
solution at least in this model, which is to fix the RS solution to be a
monotone increasing function.
