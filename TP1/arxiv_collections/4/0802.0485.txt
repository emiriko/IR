We track particle motions in a granular material subjected to compaction
using a laser scattering based imaging method where compaction is achieved
through thermal cycling. Particle displacements in this jammed fluid correlate
strongly with rearrangments of the Voronoi cells defining the local spatial
partitioning about the particles, similar to previous observations of Rahman on
cooled liquids. Our observations provide further evidence of commonalities
between particle dynamics in granular matter close to jamming and supercooled
liquids.
