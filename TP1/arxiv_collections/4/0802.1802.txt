In this note we fix the preliminary results obtained in the study of gluon
density function of the paper \cite{bom3}. The LO BK equation for unintegrated
gluon density with impact parameter dependence is considered in order to fix
the parameters of the proposed model. In particular the form of initial
condition for the equations of proton-proton scattering from \cite{bom3} is
determined, which is similar to the form of fenomenological GBW ansatz. The
gluon density function and $F_{2}$ function are also calculated and compared
with the results for the gluon density and $F_{2}$ functions from the GRV
parameterization for different values of $Q^2$. It is shown, that the results
for $F_2$ structure function of the considered model are in the good accordance
with the results obtained from the GRV parameterization of parton densities.
