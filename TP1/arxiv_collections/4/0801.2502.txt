We present measurements of the low temperature specific heat of single
crystals of kappa-(ET)_2Cu[N(CN)_2]Br as a function of the cooling rate through
the glasslike structure transition at $\sim$ 80K. We find that rapid cooling
produces a small (< 4%) decrease in the superconducting transition temperature
accompanied by a substantial (up to 50%) decrease in the normal-state
electronic specific heat. A natural explanation of our data is that there is a
macroscopic phase separation between superconducting and insulating regions in
rapidly cooled samples.
