The exact dynamics of a disordered spin star system, describing a central
spin coupled to N distinguishable and non interacting spins 1/2, is reported.
Exploiting their interaction with the central single spin system, we present
possible conditional schemes for the generation of W-like states, as well as of
well-defined angular momentum states, of the N uncoupled spins. We provide in
addition a way to estimate the coupling intensity between each of the N spins
and the central one. Finally the feasibility of our procedure is briefly
discussed.
