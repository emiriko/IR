We propose a network implementation with enhanced security at the physical
layer by means of time-hopping CDMA, supporting cryptographically secure
point-to-point and point-to-multipoint communication. In particular, we analyze
an active star topology optical network implementation capable of supporting
128 simultaneous users up to 20 km apart. The feasibility of the proposed
scheme is demonstrated through numerical simulation.
