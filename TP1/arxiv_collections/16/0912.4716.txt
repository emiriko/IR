Interferometry of non-Abelian edge excitations is a useful tool in
topological quantum computing. In this paper we present a theory of a
non-Abelian edge state interferometer in a 3D topological insulator brought in
proximity to an s-wave superconductor. The non-Abelian edge excitations in this
system have the same statistics as in the previously studied 5/2 fractional
quantum Hall (FQH) effect and chiral p-wave superconductors. There are however
crucial differences between the setup we consider and these systems, like the
need for a converter between charged and neutral excitations and the neutrality
of the non-Abelian excitations. These differences manifest themselves in a
temperature scaling exponent of -7/4 for the conductance instead of -3/2 as in
the 5/2 FQH effect.
