We investigate a new strategy which can defeat the (in)famous Carter's
"anthropic" argument against extraterrestrial life and intelligence. In
contrast to those already considered by Wilson, Livio, and others, the present
approach is based on relaxing hidden uniformitarian assumptions, considering
instead a dynamical succession of evolutionary regimes governed by both global
(Galaxy-wide) and local (planet- or planetary system-limited) regulation
mechanisms. This is in accordance with recent developments in both astrophysics
and evolutionary biology. Notably, our increased understanding of the nature of
supernovae and gamma-ray bursts, as well as of strong coupling between the
Solar System and the Galaxy on one hand, and the theories of "punctuated
equilibria" of Eldredge and Gould and "macroevolutionary regimes" of Jablonski,
Valentine, et al. on the other, are in full accordance with the regulation-
mechanism picture. The application of this particular strategy highlights the
limits of application of Carter's argument, and indicates that in the real
universe its applicability conditions are not satisfied. We conclude that
drawing far-reaching conclusions about the scarcity of extraterrestrial
intelligence and the prospects of our efforts to detect it on the basis of this
argument is unwarranted.
