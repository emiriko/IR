We consider QCD based model of hadrons interaction in which gluons density in
wave function of initial state is low in rapidity space and real hadrons are
produced by decay of color field strings. Hadrons production processes in pp
and p antip interactions differ on principle. There are three types of
inelastic processes in p antip collision. The first type is production of
secondary hadrons shower from decay of gluon string. The second type is shower
produced from decay of two quark strings and the third one -- from decay of
three quark strings. At the same time there are only two types of inelastic
processes for pp collision, they are shower from gluon string and shower from
two quark strings. Therefore multiplicity distributions and inclusive spectra
of secondary hadrons are different in pp and p antip interactions, and this
difference may be observed at energy sqrt(s)=900 GeV.
