We present a temperature dependent photoluminescence study of silicon optical
nanocavities formed by introducing point defects into two-dimensional photonic
crystals. In addition to the prominent TO phonon assisted transition from
crystalline silicon at ~1.10 eV we observe a broad defect band luminescence
from ~1.05-1.09 eV. Spatially resolved spectroscopy demonstrates that this
defect band is present only in the region where air-holes have been etched
during the fabrication process. Detectable emission from the cavity mode
persists up to room-temperature, in strong contrast the background emission
vanishes for T > 150 K. An Ahrrenius type analysis of the temperature
dependence of the luminescence signal recorded either in-resonance with the
cavity mode, or weakly detuned, suggests that the higher temperature stability
may arise from an enhanced internal quantum efficiency due to the
Purcell-effect.
