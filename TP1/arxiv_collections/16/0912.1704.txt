We investigate dynamical transport aspects of a combined
nanomechanical-superconducting device in which Cooper pair tunneling interfere
with the mechanical motion of a vibrating molecular quantum dot embedded in a
Josephson junction. Six different regimes for the tunneling dynamics are
identified with respect to the electron level and the charging energy in the
quantum dot. In five of those regimes new time-scales are introduced which are
associated with the energies of the single electron transitions within the
quantum dot, while there is one regime where the internal properties of the
quantum dot are static.
