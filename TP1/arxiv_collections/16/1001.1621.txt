Previously we gave a conjectural cohomological argument for the validity of
the Riemann hypotheses for Hasse-Weil zeta functions. In the present note we
sketch how the same cohomological formalism would imply the conjectured
positivity properties of the height pairings of homologically trivial cycles.
