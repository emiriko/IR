Various effective temperature scales have been proposed over the years.
Despite much work and the high internal precision usually achieved, systematic
differences of order 100 K (or more) among various scales are still present. We
present an investigation based on the Infrared Flux Method aimed at assessing
the source of such discrepancies and pin down their origin.
  We break the impasse among different scales by using a large set of solar
twins, stars which are spectroscopically and photometrically identical to the
Sun, to set the absolute zero point of the effective temperature scale to
within few degrees. Our newly calibrated, accurate and precise temperature
scale applies to dwarfs and subgiants, from super-solar metallicities to the
most metal-poor stars currently known. At solar metallicities our results
validate spectroscopic effective temperature scales, whereas for [Fe/H]<-2.5
our temperatures are roughly 100 K hotter than those determined from model fits
to the Balmer lines and 200 K hotter than those obtained from the excitation
equilibrium of Fe lines.
  Empirical bolometric corrections and useful relations linking photometric
indices to effective temperatures and angular diameters have been derived. Our
results take full advantage of the high accuracy reached in absolute
calibration in recent years and are further validated by interferometric
angular diameters and space based spectrophotometry over a wide range of
effective temperatures and metallicities.
