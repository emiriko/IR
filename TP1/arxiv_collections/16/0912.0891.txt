A new method is developed for prediction of UT1. The method is based on
construction of a general harmonic model of the Earth rotation using all the
data available for the last 80-100 years, and modified autoregression
technique. A rigorous comparison of UT1 predictions computed at SNIIM with the
prediction computed by IERS (USNO) in 2008-2009 has shown that proposed method
pro-vides substantially better accuracy.
