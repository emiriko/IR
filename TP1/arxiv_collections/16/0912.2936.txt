The use of G-parity boundary conditions to compute Delta I = 1/2, K to pi pi
decays is reviewed and a method to consistently treat both the pions and kaon
in full QCD proposed. This approach creates a physical, final-state, pion
momentum using a 3 fm box and avoids statistical noise coming from pions with
smaller momentum.
