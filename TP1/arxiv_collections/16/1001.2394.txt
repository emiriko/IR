An experimental investigation of the impact of sample inhomogeneity on
measurements of the linear elongational viscosity of two low-density
polyethelenes is presented. A novel method of in-situ measurements of the
diameter of samples under extension has recently been implemented to properly
account for the sample non-uniformities during elongation. Two types of low
density polyethylenes (LDPE's) have been investigated: Lupolen 1840 D and LPDE
1840 H. Whereas in the case of Lupolen 1840 H the Trouton relationship is
verified, in the case of Lupolen 1840 D the deviations can be as large as 40%,
depending on the magnitude of the initial sample non-uniformity and the
experimental conditions. Based on real time visualization of the sample, these
deviations are associated with an inhomogeneous deformation of the specimen.
Differences in the homogeneity of deformation between the H and D samples are
explained by significantly different maximal retardation times. The
experimental investigation is complemented by a simplified theoretical
estimation of the error induced by the sample inhomogeneity in the case of
measurements of elongational viscosities in the linear range. A fair level of
agreement is found with the experimentally measured error.
