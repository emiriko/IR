A model of two Calogero-Sutherland Bose gases A and B with strong odd-wave AB
attractions induced by a p-wave AB Feshbach resonance is studied. The ground
state wave function is found analytically by a Bose-Bose duality mapping, which
permits one to accurately determine static physical properties by a Monte Carlo
method. The condensation of particles or particle pairs (molecules) is tested
by analyzing the presence of the off-diagonal long-range order in one- or
two-body density matrices. The p-wave symmetry of AB interaction makes possible
quasi-condensation of type A particles at the Fermi momentum of the B
component. The zero-temperature phase diagram is drawn in terms of densities
and interaction strengths.
