A controversy has developed regarding the stellar wind mass loss rates in
O-stars. The current consensus is that these winds may be clumped which implies
that all previously derived mass loss rates using density-squared diagnostics
are overestimated by a factor of ~ 2. However, arguments based on FUSE
observations of the P V resonance line doublet suggest that these rates should
be smaller by another order of magnitude, provided that P V is the dominant
phosphorous ion among these stars. Although a large mass loss rate reduction
would have a range of undesirable consequences, it does provide a
straightforward explanation of the unexpected symmetric and un-shifted X-ray
emission line profiles observed in high energy resolution spectra. But
acceptance of such a large reduction then leads to a contradiction with an
important observed X-ray property: the correlation between He-like ion source
radii and their equivalent X-ray continuum optical depth unity radii. Here we
examine the phosphorous ionization balance since the P V fractional abundance,
q(P V), is fundamental to understanding the magnitude of this mass loss
reduction. We find that strong "XUV" emission lines in the He II Lyman
continuum can significantly reduce q(P V). Furthermore, owing to the unique
energy distribution of these XUV lines, there is a negligible impact on the S V
fractional abundance (a key component in the FUSE mass loss argument). We
conclude that large reductions in O-star mass loss rates are not required, and
the X-ray optical depth unity relation remains valid.
