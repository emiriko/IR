(abridged) The clustering properties of galaxies belonging to different
luminosity ranges or having different morphological types are different. These
characteristics or `marks' permit to understand the galaxy catalogs that carry
all this information as realizations of marked point processes. Many attempts
have been presented to quantify the dependence of the clustering of galaxies on
their inner properties. The present paper summarizes methods on spatial marked
statistics used in cosmology to disentangle luminosity, colour or morphological
segregation and introduces a new one in this context, the mark connection
function. The methods used here are the partial correlation functions,
including the cross-correlation function, the normalised mark correlation
function, the mark variogram and the mark connection function. All these
methods are applied to a volume-limited sample drawn from the 2dFGRS, using the
spectral type as the mark. We show the virtues of each method to provide
information about the clustering properties of each population, the dependence
of the clustering on the marks, the similarity of the marks as a function of
the pair distances, and the way to characterise the spatial correlation between
the marks. We demonstrate by means of these statistics that passive galaxies
exhibit stronger spatial correlation than active galaxies at small scales (r
<20 Mpc/h). The mark connection function, introduced here, is particularly
useful for understanding the spatial correlation between the marks.
