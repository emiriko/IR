At finite weak mixing angle the sphaleron solution of Weinberg-Salam theory
can be endowed with angular momentum proportional to the electric charge. Here
we show, that this holds also for sphaleron-antisphaleron systems such as
pairs, chains and vortex rings. We also address the equilibrium conditions for
these solutions.
