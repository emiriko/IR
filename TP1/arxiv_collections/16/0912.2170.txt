We propose a method of controlling two-atom interaction using both magnetic
and laser fields. We analyse the role of quantum interference between magnetic
and optical Feshbach resonances in controlling cold collision. In particular,
we demonstrate that this method allows us to suppress inelastic and enhance
elastic scattering cross sections. Quantum interference is shown to modify
significantly the threshold behaviour and resonant interaction of ultracold
atoms. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to manipulate not only the
spherically symmetric s-wave interaction but also the anisotropic higher
partial-wave interactions which are particularly important for high temperature
superfluid or superconducting phases of matter.
