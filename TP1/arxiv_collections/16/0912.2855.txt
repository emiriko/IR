Based on the statistical hadronization model, we obtain quantitative
predictions for the relative abundances of hadron species in pp collisions at
the LHC. By using the parameters of the model determined at sqrt s = 200 GeV,
and extrapolating the overall normalization from ppbar collisions at the SPS
and Tevatron, we find that the expected rapidity densities are almost
grand-canonical. Therefore, at LHC the ratios between different species become
essentially energy-independent, provided that the hadronization temperature T_H
and the strangeness suppression factor gamma_S retain the stable values
observed in the presently explored range of pp and ppbar collisions.
