Efforts aimed at large-scale integration of nanoelectronic devices that
exploit the superior electronic and mechanical properties of single-walled
carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) remain limited by the difficulties associated with
manipulation and packaging of individual SWNTs. Alternative approaches based on
ultra-thin carbon nanotube networks (CNNs) have enjoyed success of late with
the realization of several scalable device applications. However, precise
control over the network electronic transport is challenging due to i) an often
uncontrollable interplay between network coverage and its topology and ii) the
inherent electrical heterogeneity of the constituent SWNTs. In this letter, we
use template-assisted fluidic assembly of SWCNT networks to explore the effect
of geometric confinement on the network topology. Heterogeneous SWCNT networks
dip-coated onto sub-micron wide ultra-thin polymer channels exhibit a topology
that becomes increasingly aligned with decreasing channel width and thickness.
Experimental scale coarse-grained computations of interacting SWCNTs show that
the effect is a reflection of an aligned topology that is no longer dependent
on the network density, which in turn emerges as a robust knob that can induce
semiconductor-to-metallic transitions in the network response. Our study
demonstrates the effectiveness of directed assembly on channels with varying
degrees of confinement as a simple tool to tailor the conductance of the
otherwise heterogeneous network, opening up the possibility of robust
large-scale CNN-based devices.
