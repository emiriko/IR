We report data on the Hall coefficient (RH) of the carbon substituted
Mg(B1-xCx)2 single crystals with x in the range from 0 to 0.1. The temperature
dependences of RH obtained for the substituted crystals differ systematically
at low temperatures, but all of them converge to the value of 1.8 x 10^-10
m^3/C at room temperature. The RH(T) data together with results of the
thermoelectric power and electrical resistivity measurements are interpreted
within a quasi-classical transport approach, where the presence of four
different conducting sheets is considered. The main influence of the carbon
substitution on the transport properties in the normal state is associated with
enhanced scattering rates, rather than modified concentration of charge
carriers. Presumably the carbon substitution increases the electron-impurity
scattering mainly in the pi band.
