The process of hydrogen desorption from graphane (graphene sheet saturated by
hydrogen adsorbed from both sides) has been studied using the method of
molecular dynamics. The temperature dependences of the time of desorption onset
for various hydrogen coverages on graphene are calculated and the corresponding
activation energies in the Arrhenius equation are determined. It is established
that graphane exhibits a rather high thermal stability that makes possible its
usein two-dimensional electronics even at room temperature. For the same
reason, graphane can hardly be considered as a promising hydrogen storage
material for fuel cells.
