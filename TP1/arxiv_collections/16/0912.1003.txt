We compute masses, trilinear self-couplings and decay widths into weak bosons
of the scalar composite bosons in the case of the Minimal and Ultraminimal
technicolor models. The masses, computed via the Bethe-Salpeter equation, turn
out to be light and the trilinear couplings smaller than the one that would be
expected when compared to a fundamental Standard Model scalar boson with the
same mass. The decay widths into electroweak bosons of the Ultraminimal model
scalars bosons are much smaller than the one of the Minimal model.
