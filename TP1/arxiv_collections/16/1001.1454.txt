In this paper we present several novel efficient techniques and
multidimensional data structures which can improve the decision making process
in many domains. We consider online range aggregation, range selection and
range weighted median queries; for most of them, the presented data structures
and techniques can provide answers in polylogarithmic time. The presented
results have applications in many business and economic scenarios, some of
which are described in detail in the paper.
