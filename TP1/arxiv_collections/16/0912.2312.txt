Aims: We present a detailed analysis of OGLE 2004-BLG-482, a relatively
high-magnification single-lens microlensing event which exhibits clear
extended-source effects. These events are relatively rare, but they potentially
contain unique information on the stellar atmosphere properties of their source
star, as shown in this study. Methods: Our dense photometric coverage of the
overall light curve and a proper microlensing modelling allow us to derive
measurements of the OGLE 2004-BLG-482 source star's linear limb-darkening
coefficients in three bands, including standard Johnson-Cousins I and R, as
well as in a broad clear filter. In particular, we discuss in detail the
problems of multi-band and multi-site modelling on the expected precision of
our results. We also obtained high-resolution UVES spectra as part of a ToO
programme at ESO VLT from which we derive the source star's precise fundamental
parameters. Results: From the high-resolution UVES spectra, we find that OGLE
2004-BLG-482's source star is a red giant of MK type a bit later than M3, with
Teff = 3667 +/- 150 K, log g = 2.1 +/- 1.0 and an assumed solar metallicity.
This is confirmed by an OGLE calibrated colour-magnitude diagram. We then
obtain from a detailed microlensing modelling of the light curve linear
limb-darkening coefficients that we compare to model-atmosphere predictions
available in the literature, and find a very good agreement for the I and R
bands. In addition, we perform a similar analysis using an alternative
description of limb darkening based on a principal component analysis of ATLAS
limb-darkening profiles, and also find a very good agreement between
measurements and model predictions.
