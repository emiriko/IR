Let A be a finite-dimensional associative algebra and $\phi$ a symmetric
linear function on $A$. In this note, we will show that the pseudotrace maps
are obtained as special cases of well-known symmetric linear functions on the
endomorphism rings of projective modules. We also prove that modules are
interlocked with $\phi$ if and only if they are projective. As an application
of our approach, we will give proofs of several propositions and theorems for
pseudotrace maps for an arbitrary finite-dimensional associative algebra.
