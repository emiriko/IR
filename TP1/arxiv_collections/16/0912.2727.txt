The processes proton + antiproton -> gamma + heavy-flavour jet(s) + X and
proton + proton -> gamma + heavy-flavour jet(s) + X are studied in the
framework of a special two-Higgs-doublet model, the MCPM. As distinguishing
feature of this model we find that radiative Higgs-boson production and decay
lead to heavy flavour c jets but no b jets in the above processes. Thus, the
prediction is that b jets should be given by the normal QCD processes whereas
for c jets an excess over the QCD expectation should occur. We present results
both for Tevatron and LHC energies.
