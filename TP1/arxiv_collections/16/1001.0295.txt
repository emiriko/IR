We study the effect of quantum memory in magic squares game when played in
quantum domain. We consider different noisy quantum channels and analyze their
influence on the magic squares quantum pseudo-telepathy game. We show that the
probability of success can be used to distinguish the quantum channels. It is
seen that the mean success probability decreases with increase of quantum
noise. Where as the mean success probability increases with increase of quantum
memory. It is also seen that the behaviour of amplitude damping and phase
damping channels is similar. On the other hand, the behaviour of depolarizing
channel is similar to the flipping channels. Therefore, the probability of
success of the game can be used to distinguish the quantum channels.
