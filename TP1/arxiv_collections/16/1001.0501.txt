We report a transit timing study of the transiting exoplanetary system HD
189733. In total we observed ten transits in 2006 and 2008 with the 2.6-m
Nordic Optical Telescope, and two transits in 2007 with the 4.2-m William
Herschel Telescope. We used Markov-Chain Monte Carlo simulations to derive the
system parameters and their uncertainties, and our results are in a good
agreement with previously published values. We performed two independent
analyses of transit timing residuals to place upper mass limits on putative
perturbing planets. The results show no evidence for the presence of planets
down to 1 Earth mass near the 1:2 and 2:1 resonance orbits, and planets down to
2.2 Earth masses near the 3:5 and 5:3 resonance orbits with HD 189733b. These
are the strongest limits to date on the presence of other planets in this
system.
