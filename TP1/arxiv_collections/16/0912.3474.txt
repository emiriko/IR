Consider a spherically symmetric spacetime generated by a self-gravitating
massless scalar field $\phi$ and let $\psi$ be a test (nonspherical) massless
scalar field propagating on this dynamical background. Gundlach, Price, and
Pullin \cite{gpp2} computed numerically the late-time tails for different
multipoles of the field $\psi$ and suggested that solutions with compactly
supported initial data decay in accord with Price's law as $t^{-(2\ell+3)}$ at
timelike infinity. We show that in the case of the time-dependent background
Price's law holds only for $\ell=0$ while for each $\ell\geq 1$ the tail decays
as $t^{-(2\ell+2)}$.
