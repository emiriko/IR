To obtain maximal resolution in STM and AFM, the size of the protruding tip
orbital has to be minimized. Beryllium as tip material is a promising candidate
for enhanced resolution because a beryllium atom has just four electrons,
leading to a small covalent radius of only 96 pm. Besides that, beryllium is
conductive and has a high elastic modulus, which is a necessity for a stable
tip apex. However beryllium tips that are prepared ex situ, are covered with a
robust oxide layer, which cannot be removed by just heating the tip. Here we
present a successful preparation method that combines the heating of the tip by
field emission and a mild collision with a clean metal plate. That method
yields a clean, oxide-free tip surface as proven by a work function of as
deduced from a current-distance curve. Additionally, a STM image of the
Si-(111)-(7x7) is presented to prove the single-atom termination of the
beryllium tip.
