We describe our perspective on the Structural Glass Transition (SGT) problem
built on the premise that a viable theory must provide a consistent picture of
the dynamics and statics, which are manifested by large increase in shear
viscosity and thermodynamic anamolies respectively. For the static and dynamic
description to be consistent we discovered, using a density functional
description without explicit inclusion of quenched random interactions and a
mean-field theory, that there be an exponentially large number of metastable
states at temperatures less than a critical transition temperature, $T_A$. At a
lower temperature ($T_K < T_A$), which can be associated with the Kauzmann
temperature, the number of glassy states is non-extensive. Based on this theory
we formulated an entropic droplet picture to describe transport in finite
dimensions in the temperature range $T_K < T < T_A$. From the finding that
glasses are trapped in one of many metastable states below $T_A$ we argue that
during the SGT law of large numbers is violated. As a consequence in glasses
there are sub sample to sub sample fluctuations provided the system is observed
for times longer than the typical relaxation time in a liquid. These
considerations, which find support in computer simulations and experiments,
also link the notion of dynamic heterogeneity to the violation of law of large
numbers. Thus, the finding that there is an extensive number of metastable
states in the range $T_K < T < T_A$ offers a coherent explanation of many of
the universal features of glass forming materials.
