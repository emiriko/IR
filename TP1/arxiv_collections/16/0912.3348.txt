The solution to the Schwinger-Dyson equation that describes the summation
over Pomeron loop diagrams is derived. The solution is a closed expression
which splits into two parts. The first leads directly to the renormalization of
the BFKL Pomeron, and the second contribution is equivalent to non interacting
Pomerons with renormalized vertices. Thus a closed expression is derived for
the sum over Pomeron loop diagrams in the perturbative QCD approach, which
preserves unitarity.
