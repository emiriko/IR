Using a Multi-Channel Algebraic Scattering (MCAS) approach we have analyzed
the spectra of two hyper-nuclear systems, Lambda9Be and Lambda13C. We have
studied the splitting of the two odd-parity excited levels (1/2- and 3/2-) at
11 MeV excitation in Lambda13C, originated by the weak Lambda-nucleus
spin-orbit force. We have also considered the splittings of the 3/2+ and 5/2+
levels in both Lambda9Be and Lambda13C, finding how they originate from
couplings to the collective 2+ states of the core nuclei. In both hyper-nuclei,
we suggest that there could be additional low-lying resonant states in the
Lambda-nucleus continua. From the MCAS approach one can extract also the full
coupled-channel scattering wave-function to be used in the calculation of
various transition matrix elements. As a first application, we have considered
the EM-transition matrix elements for the capture reaction Alpha + 3He -> 7Be +
Gamma .
