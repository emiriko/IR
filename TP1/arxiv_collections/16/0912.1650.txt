We investigate the one- to two-dimensional zigzag transition in clusters
consisting of a small number of particles interacting through a Yukawa (Debye)
potential and confined in a two-dimensional biharmonic potential well. Dusty
(complex) plasma clusters with $n \le 19$ monodisperse particles are
characterized experimentally for two different confining wells. The well
anisotropy is accurately measured, and the Debye shielding parameter is
determined from the longitudinal breathing frequency. Debye shielding is shown
to be important. A model for this system is used to predict equilibrium
particle configurations. The experiment and model exhibit excellent agreement.
The critical value of $n$ for the zigzag transition is found to be less than
that predicted for an unshielded Coulomb interaction. The zigzag transition is
shown to behave as a continuous phase transition from a one-dimensional to a
two-dimensional state, where the state variables are the number of particles,
the well anisotropy and the Debye shielding parameter. A universal critical
exponent for the zigzag transition is identified for transitions caused by
varying the Debye shielding parameter.
