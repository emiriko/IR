Our observations of the quiet Sun with the NST have yielded unanticipated
results on smal-scale solar dynamic. Althought small-scale solar dynamic have
been well-studied, the NST is enabling us to probe finer scale dynamic
exploiting higher spatial resolution. We discuss NST resutls from data taken
29th July 2009 using an broadband filter centered on TiO 705.7nm spectral line.
Data are from the center of the solar disk where we observed quiet Sun.
  We registered bright-point like structures in most of the intergranular
lanes. They vary in behaviour and evolution. Co-registered solar oscillations
tend to congregate near certain types of bright-point like structures. The
oscillations with maximum power tend to appear only above or near these
structures.
