We present a simple yet powerful technique for forming iterative methods of
various convergence orders. Methods of various convergence orders (four, six,
eight and ten) are formed through a modest modification of the classical Newton
method. The technique can be easily implemented in existing software packages
as suggested by the presented C$^{++}$ algorithm. Finally some problems are
solved through the proposed algorithm.
