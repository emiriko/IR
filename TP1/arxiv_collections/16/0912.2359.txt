We report the detection of the eclipse of the very-hot Jupiter WASP-12b via
z'-band time-series photometry obtained with the 3.5-meter ARC telescope at
Apache Point Observatory. We measure a decrease in flux of 0.082+/-0.015%
during the passage of the planet behind the star. That planetary flux is
equally well reproduced by atmospheric models with and without extra absorbers,
and blackbody models with f > 0.585+/-0.080. It is therefore necessary to
measure the planet at other wavelengths to further constrain its atmospheric
properties. The eclipse appears centered at phase = 0.5100 (+0.0072,-0.0061),
consistent with an orbital eccentricity of |e cos w| = 0.016 (+0.011,-0.009)
(see note at end of Section 4). If the orbit of the planet is indeed eccentric,
the large radius of WASP-12b can be explained by tidal heating.
