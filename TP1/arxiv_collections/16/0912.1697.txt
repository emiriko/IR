It is shown that the problem of reduction can be formulated in a uniform way
using the theory of invariants. This provides a powerful tool of analysis and
it opens the road to new applications of these algebras, beyond the context of
integrable systems. Moreover, it is proven that sl2-Automorphic Lie Algebras
associated to the icosahedral group I, the octahedral group O, the tetrahedral
group T, and the dihedral group Dn are isomorphic. The proof is based on
techniques from classical invariant theory and makes use of Clebsch-Gordan
decomposition and transvectants, Molien functions and the trace-form. This
result provides a complete classification of sl2-Automorphic Lie Algebras
associated to finite groups when the group representations are chosen to be the
same and it is a crucial step towards the complete classification of
Automorphic Lie Algebras.
