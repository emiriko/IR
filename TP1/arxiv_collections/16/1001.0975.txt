We discuss the scattering of photons from a three-level emitter in a
one-dimensional waveguide, where the transport is governed by the interference
of spontaneously emitted and directly transmitted waves. The scattering problem
is solved in closed form for different level structures. Several possible
applications are discussed: The state of the emitter can be switched
deterministically by Raman scattering, thus enabling applications in quantum
computing such as a single photon transistor. An array of emitters gives rise
to a photonic band gap structure, which can be tuned by a classical driving
laser. A disordered array leads to Anderson localization of photons, where the
localization length can again be controlled by an external driving.
