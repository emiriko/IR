In an early paper (Horowitz and Albano, Phys. Rev. E.,{\bf 73} 031111 (2006))
we studied growing models, generically called $X/RD$, such that a particle is
attached to the aggregate with probability $p$ following the mechanisms of a
generic model $X$, and at random [Random Deposition (RD)] with probability $(1
-p)$. We also formulated scaling relationships that are expected to hold in the
limits $p \to 0$ and $L \to \infty $, where $L$ is the sample side. In a
comment, Kolakowska and Novotny (KN) stated that our scaling hypotheses does
not hold. Here, we show that the criticisms of KN are outlined by analyzing
data out of the proper scaling regime and consequently they are groundless and
can be disregarded.
