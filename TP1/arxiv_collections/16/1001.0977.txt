Quorum sensing is the mechanism by which bacteria communicate and synchronize
group behaviors. Quantitative information on parameters such as the copy number
of particular quorum-sensing proteins should contribute strongly to
understanding how the quorum-sensing network functions. Here we show that the
copy number of the master regulator protein LuxR in Vibrio harveyi, can be
determined in vivo by exploiting small-number fluctuations of the protein
distribution when cells undergo division. When a cell divides, both its volume
and LuxR protein copy number N are partitioned with slight asymmetries. We have
measured the distribution functions describing the partitioning of the protein
fluorescence and the cell volume. The fluorescence distribution is found to
narrow systematically as the LuxR population increases while the volume
partitioning is unchanged. Analyzing these changes statistically, we have
determined that N = 80-135 dimers at low cell density and 575 dimers at high
cell density. In addition, we have measured the static distribution of LuxR
over a large (3,000) clonal population. Combining the static and time-lapse
experiments, we determine the magnitude of the Fano factor of the distribution.
This technique has broad applicability as a general, in vivo technique for
measuring protein copy number and burst size.
