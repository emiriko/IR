In Bioinformatics, text mining and text data mining sometimes interchangeably
used is a process to derive high-quality information from text. Perl Status
Reporter (SRr) is a data fetching tool from a flat text file and in this
research paper we illustrate the use of SRr in text or data mining. SRr needs a
flat text input file where the mining process to be performed. SRr reads input
file and derives the high quality information from it. Typically text mining
tasks are text categorization, text clustering, concept and entity extraction,
and document summarization. SRr can be utilized for any of these tasks with
little or none customizing efforts. In our implementation we perform text
categorization mining operation on input file. The input file has two
parameters of interest (firstKey and secondKey). The composition of these two
parameters describes the uniqueness of entries in that file in the similar
manner as done by composite key in database. SRr reads the input file line by
line and extracts the parameters of interest and form a composite key by
joining them together. It subsequently generates an output file consisting of
the name as firstKey secondKey. SRr reads the input file and tracks the
composite key. It further stores all that data lines, having the same composite
key, in output file generated by SRr based on that composite key.
