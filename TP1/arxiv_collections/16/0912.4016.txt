We propose an efficient approach for deterministically generating scalable
cluster states with photons. This approach involves unitary transformations
performed on atoms coupled to optical cavities. Its operation cost scales
linearly with the number of qubits in the cluster state, and photon qubits are
encoded such that single-qubit operations can be easily implemented by using
linear optics. Robust optical one-way quantum computation can be performed
since cluster states can be stored in atoms and then transferred to photons
that can be easily operated and measured. Therefore, this proposal could help
performing robust large-scale optical one-way quantum computation.
