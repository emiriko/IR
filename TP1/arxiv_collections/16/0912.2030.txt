We present results from combining a grid-based radiative transfer code with a
Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code to produce a flexible system for modelling
radiation hydrodynamics. We use a benchmark model of a circumstellar disc to
determine a robust method for constructing a gridded density distribution from
SPH particles. The benchmark disc is then used to determine the accuracy of the
radiative transfer results. We find that the SED and the temperature
distribution within the disc are sensitive to the representation of the disc
inner edge, which depends critically on both the grid and SPH resolution. The
code is then used to model a circumstellar disc around a T-Tauri star. As the
disc adjusts towards equilibrium vertical motions in the disc are induced
resulting in scale height enhancements which intercept radiation from the
central star. Vertical transport of radiation enables these perturbations to
influence the mid-plane temperature of the disc. The vertical motions decay
over time and the disc ultimately reaches a state of simultaneous hydrostatic
and radiative equilibrium.
