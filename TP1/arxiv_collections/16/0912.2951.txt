INTEGRAL observations of the Small Magellanic Cloud region have resulted in
the serendipitous detection of two transient hard X-ray sources in the
Magellanic Bridge. In this paper we present the timing and spectral
characteristics of these sources across the 2-100 keV energy range, which, in
conjunction with their optical counterparts, demonstrate that they are high
mass X-ray binaries in the Magellanic Bridge. Together with one previously
known high mass X-ray binary system, and three candidates, these sources
represent an emerging population of X-ray binaries in the Bridge, probably
initiated by tidally induced star formation as a result of the gravitational
interaction between the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.
