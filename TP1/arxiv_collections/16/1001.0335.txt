We propose a novel way to communicate signals in the form of waves across a d
- dimensional lattice. The mechanism is based on quantum search algorithms and
makes it possible to both search for marked positions in a regular grid and to
communicate between two (or more) points on the lattice. Remarkably, neither
the sender nor the receiver needs to know the position of each other despite
the fact that the signal is only exchanged between the contributing parties.
This is an example of using wave interference as a resource by controlling
localisation phenomena effectively. Possible experimental realisations will be
discussed.
