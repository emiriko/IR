The KLOE experiment at the phi-factory DA$\Phi$NE has measured the pion form
factor in the range between 0.1 < M_{pipi}^2 < 0.85 GeV^2 using events taken at
sqrt{s}= 1 GeV with a photon emitted at large polar angles in the initial
state. This measurement extends the M_{pipi}^2 region covered by KLOE ISR
measurements of the pion form factor down to the two pion production threshold.
The value obtained in this measurement of the dipion contribution to the muon
anomalous magnetic moment of \Delta a_mu^{pipi} =
(478.5+-2.0_{stat}+-4.8_{syst}+-2.9_{theo}) 10^{-10} further confirms the
discrepancy between the Standard Model evaluation for a_mu and the experimental
value measured by the (g-2) collaboration at BNL.
