A detailed study of charge collection efficiency has been performed on the
Silicon Drift Detectors (SDD) of the ALICE experiment. Three different methods
to study the collected charge as a function of the drift time have been
implemented. The first approach consists in measuring the charge at different
injection distances moving an infrared laser by means of micrometric step
motors. The second method is based on the measurement of the charge injected by
the laser at fixed drift distance and varying the drift field, thus changing
the drift time. In the last method, the measurement of the charge deposited by
atmospheric muons is used to study the charge collection efficiency as a
function of the drift time. The three methods gave consistent results and
indicated that no charge loss during the drift is observed for the sensor types
used in 99% of the SDD modules mounted on the ALICE Inner Tracking System. The
atmospheric muons have also been used to test the effect of the
zero-suppression applied to reduce the data size by erasing the counts in cells
not passing the thresholds for noise removal. As expected, the zero suppression
introduces a dependence of the reconstructed charge as a function of drift time
because it cuts the signal in the tails of the electron clouds enlarged by
diffusion effects. These measurements allowed also to validate the correction
for this effect extracted from detailed Monte Carlo simulations of the detector
response and applied in the offline data reconstruction.
