There are many flat directions in SUSY models, which may dissipate their
energy and source the radiation background during inflation. However, the only
possibility that has been studied in this direction is warm inflation, which
uses "warm" (or "dissipative" if we consider more modest situation) direction
as the inflaton. In this talk we discuss other significant possibilities of
such directions which are dissipative and may or may not be "warm".
Affleck-Dine (AD) mechanism and other cosmological scenarios are discussed in
the light of "dissipative field", instead of using the conventional light field
with mass protection. We sometimes consider Morikawa-Sasaki coefficient for the
non-thermal background, which is important because the dissipation calculated
for a naive thermal background with $T\to 0$ is not enough to discuss the
dissipation with the non-thermal background.
