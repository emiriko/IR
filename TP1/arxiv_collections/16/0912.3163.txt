Aims. We demonstrate the feasibility of determining parallaxes for nearby
objects with theWide Field Camera on the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope
(UKIRT) using the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey as a first epoch. We determine
physical parameters for ULAS J003402.77-005206.7, one of the coolest brown
dwarfs currently known, using atmospheric and evolutionary models with the
distance found here.
  Methods. Observations over the period 10/2005 to 07/2009 were pipeline
processed at the Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit and combined to produce a
parallax and proper motion using standard procedures.
  Results. We determined pi = 79.6 +/- 3.8 mas, mura = -20.0 +/- 3.7 mas/yr and
mudec = -363.8 +/- 4.3 mas/yr for ULAS J003402.77-005206.7.
  Conclusions. We have made a direct parallax determination for one of the
coolest objects outside of the solar system. The distance is consistent with a
relatively young, 1 - 2 Gyr, low mass, 13 - 20 MJ, cool, 550-600K, brown dwarf.
We present a measurement of the radial velocity that is consistent with an age
between 0.5 and 4.0 Gyr.
