Following recent literature on dS instability in presence of interactions, we
study the decay of massive particles in general FRW models and the emission
from naked singularities either associated with 4D charged black holes or with
2D shock waves, by means of the Hamilton--Jacobi tunneling method. It is shown
that the two-dimensional semi-classical tunneling amplitude from a naked
singularity computed in that way is the same as the one-loop result of quantum
field theory.
