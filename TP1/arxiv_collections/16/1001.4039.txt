We have applied the light-front formalism to calculate the electromagnetic
form factors for the pion and the kaon from two models at low and high energies
in order to explore the differences between such models. We have also compared
the results for the ratio $F_{K}(Q^2)/F_{\pi}(Q^2)$ with the experimental data
up to 10 [GeV/c]$^2$ and we have observed that the theoretical results are in
good concordance for low energies, but they are very different at higher energy
scales.
