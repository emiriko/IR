We generalize the idea of chainwise stimulated Raman adiabatic passage
(STIRAP) [Kuznetsova \textit{et al.} Phys. Rev. A \textbf{78}, 021402(R)
(2008)] to a photoassociation-based chainwise atom-molecule system, with the
goal of directly converting two-species atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC)
into a ground polar molecular BEC. We pay particular attention to the
intermediate Raman laser fields, a control knob inaccessible to the usual
three-level model. We find that an appropriate exploration of both the
intermediate laser fields and the stability property of the atom-molecule
STIRAP can greatly reduce the power demand on the photoassociation laser, a key
concern for STIRAPs starting from free atoms due to the small Franck-Condon
factor in the free-bound transition.
