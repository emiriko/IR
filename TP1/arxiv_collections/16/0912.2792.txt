The electronic stress tensor of the hydrogen molecule ion H_2^+ is
investigated for the ground state (sigma_g 1s) and the first excited state
(sigma_u^* 1s) using their exact wave functions. A map of its largest
eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector is shown to be closely related to the
nature of chemical bonding. For the ground state, we also show the spatial
distribution of interaction energy density to describe in which part of the
molecule stabilization and destabilization take place.
