From Sloan Digital Sky Survey u'g'r'i'z' imaging, we estimate the stellar
masses of the host galaxies of 70 low redshift SN Ia (0.015 < z < 0.08) from
the hosts' absolute luminosities and mass-to-light ratios. These nearby SN were
discovered largely by searches targeting luminous galaxies, and we find that
their host galaxies are substantially more massive than the hosts of SN
discovered by the flux-limited Supernova Legacy Survey. Testing four separate
light curve fitters, we detect ~2.5{\sigma} correlations of Hubble residuals
with both host galaxy size and stellar mass, such that SN Ia occurring in
physically larger, more massive hosts are ~10% brighter after light curve
correction. The Hubble residual is the deviation of the inferred distance
modulus to the SN, calculated from its apparent luminosity and light curve
properties, away from the expected value at the SN redshift. Marginalizing over
linear trends in Hubble residuals with light curve parameters shows that the
correlations cannot be attributed to a light curve-dependent calibration error.
Combining 180 higher-redshift ESSENCE, SNLS, and HigherZ SN with 30 nearby SN
whose host masses are less than 10^10.8 solar masses in a cosmology fit yields
1+w=0.22 +0.152/-0.143, while a combination where the 30 nearby SN instead have
host masses greater than 10^10.8 solar masses yields 1+w=-0.03 +0.217/-0.108.
Progenitor metallicity, stellar population age, and dust extinction correlate
with galaxy mass and may be responsible for these systematic effects. Host
galaxy measurements will yield improved distances to SN Ia.
