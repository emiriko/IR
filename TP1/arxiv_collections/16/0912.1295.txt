Let X be a projective manifold of dimension n. Beltrametti and Sommese
conjectured that if A is an ample divisor such that $K_X+(n-1)A$ is nef, then
$K_X+(n-1)A$ has non-zero global sections. We prove a weak version of this
conjecture in arbitrary dimension. In dimension three, we prove the stronger
non-vanishing conjecture of Ambro, Ionescu and Kawamata and give an application
to Seshadri constants.
