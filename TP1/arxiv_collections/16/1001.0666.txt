Pixel detectors are used in the innermost part of the multi purpose
experiments at LHC and are therefore exposed to the highest fluences of
ionising radiation, which in this part of the detectors consists mainly of
charged pions. The radiation hardness of all detector components has thoroughly
been tested up to the fluences expected at the LHC. In case of an LHC upgrade,
the fluence will be much higher and it is not yet clear how long the present
pixel modules will stay operative in such a harsh environment. The aim of this
study was to establish such a limit as a benchmark for other possible detector
concepts considered for the upgrade.
  As the sensors and the readout chip are the parts most sensitive to radiation
damage, samples consisting of a small pixel sensor bump-bonded to a CMS-readout
chip (PSI46V2.1) have been irradiated with positive 200 MeV pions at PSI up to
6E14 Neq and with 21 GeV protons at CERN up to 5E15 Neq.
  After irradiation the response of the system to beta particles from a Sr-90
source was measured to characterise the charge collection efficiency of the
sensor. Radiation induced changes in the readout chip were also measured. The
results show that the present pixel modules can be expected to be still
operational after a fluence of 2.8E15 Neq. Samples irradiated up to 5E15 Neq
still see the beta particles. However, further tests are needed to confirm
whether a stable operation with high particle detection efficiency is possible
after such a high fluence.
