The Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope was launched in June 2008 and the onboard
Large Area Telescope (LAT) has been collecting data since August of that same
year. The LAT is currently being used to study a wide range of science topics
in high-energy astrophysics, one of which is the study of high-energy cosmic
rays. The LAT has recently demonstrated its ability to measure cosmic-ray
electrons, and the Fermi LAT Collaboration has published a measurement of the
high-energy cosmic-ray electron spectrum in the 20 GeV to 1 TeV energy range.
Some methods for performing a similar analysis to measure the cosmic-ray proton
spectrum using the LAT will be presented with emphasis on unfolding the
reconstructed proton energy.
