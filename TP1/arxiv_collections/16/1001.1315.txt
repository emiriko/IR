How is quality control organized in the new "Mode 2" of the production of
scientific knowledge? When institutional boundaries are increasingly blurred in
a Triple Helix of University-Industry-Government relations, criteria for
quality control in the production of scientific knowledge can be expected to
change at the interfaces. The categorization in terms of two modes of knowledge
production was introduced by Gibbons et al. (1994) in order to describe changes
in the networks of scientific communications (funding patterns, research
configurations, styles of knowledge management, etc.). These changes were
mainly specified as institutional parameters in order to deal with the subjects
of R&D management and S&T policies, that is, ex ante (Spiegel-Ring 1973 Van den
Daele et al. 1979). We focus on the 'validation boundaries' emerging from the
differences between Mode 1 and Mode 2 that is, on the criteria for quality
control that can analytically and reflexively be brought to the fore ex post.
The shift from an institutional frame of reference to a focus on the dynamics
of communications enables us to clarify several problems in the discussion of
the future of university research.
