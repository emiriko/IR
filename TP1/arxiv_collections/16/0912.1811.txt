By applying an exact unitary transformation to a two-band hamiltonian which
also includes the effects due to large pnictogen polarizabilities, we show that
an attractive spin-mediated Hubbard term appears in the $d_{xz}$, $d_{yz}$
nearest-neighbour channel. This pairing mechanism implies a singlet
superconducting order parameter in iron pnictides.
