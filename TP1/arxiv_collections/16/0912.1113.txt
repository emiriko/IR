The principle of energy conservation leads to a generalized choice of
transition probability in a piecewise adiabatic representation of
quantum(-classical) dynamics. Significant improvement (almost an order of
magnitude, depending on the parameters of the calculation) over previous
schemes is achieved. Novel perspectives for theoretical calculations in
coherent many-body systems are opened.
