Quantum mechanics provides several methods to generate and securely
distribute private lists of numbers suitably correlated to solve the Three
Byzantine Generals Problem. So far, these methods are based on three-qutrit
singlet states, four-qubit entangled states, and three or two pairwise quantum
key distribution channels. Here we show that the problem can be solved using a
single qutrit. This scheme presents some advantages over previous schemes, and
emphasizes the specific role of qutrits in basic quantum information
processing.
