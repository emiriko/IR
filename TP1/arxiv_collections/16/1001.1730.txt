The "Divide and Concur'' (DC) algorithm, recently introduced by Gravel and
Elser, can be considered a competitor to the belief propagation (BP) algorithm,
in that both algorithms can be applied to a wide variety of constraint
satisfaction, optimization, and probabilistic inference problems. We show that
DC can be interpreted as a message-passing algorithm on a constraint graph,
which helps make the comparison with BP more clear. The "difference-map''
dynamics of the DC algorithm enables it to avoid "traps'' which may be related
to the "trapping sets'' or "pseudo-codewords'' that plague BP decoders of
low-density parity check (LDPC) codes in the error-floor regime.
  We investigate two decoders for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes based
on these ideas. The first decoder is based directly on DC, while the second
decoder borrows the important "difference-map'' concept from the DC algorithm
and translates it into a BP-like decoder. We show that this "difference-map
belief propagation'' (DMBP) decoder has dramatically improved error-floor
performance compared to standard BP decoders, while maintaining a similar
computational complexity. We present simulation results for LDPC codes on the
additive white Gaussian noise and binary symmetric channels, comparing DC and
DMBP decoders with other decoders based on BP, linear programming, and
mixed-integer linear programming.
