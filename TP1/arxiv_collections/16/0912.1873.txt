We predict that there is a population of low-luminosity dwarf galaxies
orbiting within the halo of the Milky Way that have surface brightnesses low
enough to have escaped detection in star-count surveys. The overall count of
stealth galaxies is sensitive to the presence (or lack) of a low-mass threshold
in galaxy formation. These systems have luminosities and stellar velocity
dispersions that are similar to those of known ultrafaint dwarf galaxies but
they have more extended stellar distributions (half light radii greater than
about 100 pc) because they inhabit dark subhalos that are slightly less massive
than their higher surface brightness counterparts. As a result, the typical
peak surface brightness is fainter than 30 mag per square arcsec. One
implication is that the inferred common mass scale for Milky Way dwarfs may be
an artifact of selection bias. If there is no sharp threshold in galaxy
formation at low halo mass, then ultrafaint galaxies like Segue 1 represent the
high-mass, early forming tail of a much larger population of objects that could
number in the hundreds and have typical peak circular velocities of about 8
km/s and masses within 300 pc of about 5 million solar masses. Alternatively,
if we impose a low-mass threshold in galaxy formation in order to explain the
unexpectedly high densities of the ultrafaint dwarfs, then we expect only a
handful of stealth galaxies in the halo of the Milky Way. A complete census of
these objects will require deeper sky surveys, 30m-class follow-up telescopes,
and more refined methods to identify extended, self-bound groupings of stars in
the halo.
