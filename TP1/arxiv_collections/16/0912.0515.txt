A nearby star having a near-transit of a galaxy will cause a time-dependent
weak lensing of the galaxy. Because the effect is small, we refer to this as
weak microlensing. This could provide a useful method to weigh low-mass stars
and brown dwarfs. We examine the feasibility of measuring masses in this way
and we find that a star causes measurable weak microlensing in a galaxy even at
10 Einstein radii away. Of order one magnitude I < 25 galaxy comes close enough
to one or other of the ~100 nearest stars per year.
