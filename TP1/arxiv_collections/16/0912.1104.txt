The Big Bang theory cannot and does not provide any explanation for the
primordial hot and dense initial condition. In order to give an explanation for
the cause of the Big Bang, this paper expands the original Dirac sea (which
includes only electrons) to the quark Dirac sea (QDS) including quarks (u and
d) for producing the Big Bang with quark energy. The QDS is composed of
"relatively infinite" u-quarks and d-quarks as well as electrons with negative
energy in the vacuum. A huge number of domains with sizes much smaller than
$10^{-18}$m of the body-central cubic quark lattice with a lattice constant "a"
= Planck length ($1.62\times10^{-35}m$) are distributed randomly over the QDS.
The QDS is a homogeneous, isotropic, equivalent "continuous" and "empty" (no
net electric charge, no net color charge, no gravitational force field since
the gravitational potential is the same at any physical point in the QDS)
perfect vacuum model. The gravity of the universe pulls on the quarks inside
the QDS. The pulling force becomes larger and larger as the universe shrinks
and shrinks. Once the pulling force is larger than the binding force on the
quarks by the whole QDS, a huge number of quarks and antiquarks will be excited
out from the QDS. This is a necessary and sufficient condition for the Big
Bang. The huge number of excited quark-antiquark pairs annihilate back to the
QDS and release a huge amount of energy; these energies make the big bang.
