This paper is devoted to the unique solvability of backward stochastic
Volterra integral equations (BSVIEs for short), in terms of both M-solution
introduced in [15] and the adapted solutions in [6], [11]. We prove the
existence and uniqueness of M-solutions of BSVIEs in Lp (1<p<2), which extends
the results in [15]. The unique solvability of adapted solutions of BSVIEs in
Lp (p>1) is also considered, which also generalize the results in [6] and [11].
