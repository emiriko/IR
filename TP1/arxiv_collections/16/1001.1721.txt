Near-critical binary mixtures containing ionic solutes near a charged wall
preferentially adsorbing one component of the solvent are studied. Within the
Landau-Ginzburg approach extended to include electrostatic interactions and the
chemical preference of ions for one component of the solvent, we obtain a
simple form for the leading-order correction to the Debye-Huckel theory result
for the charge density profile. Our result shows that critical adsorption
influences significantly distribution of ions near the wall. This effect may
have important implications for the screening of electrostatic interactions
between charged surfaces immersed in binary near-critical solvents.
