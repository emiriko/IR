The Galactic Center region is expected to host the largest density of Dark
Matter (DM) particles within the Milky Way. Then a relatively large gamma-ray
signal would be expected from the possible DM particles annihilation (or
decay). We are searching for the DM gamma-ray signal from the Galactic Center,
which is also rich in bright discrete gamma-ray sources. Furthermore intense
diffuse gamma-ray emission due to cosmic-ray interactions with interstellar gas
and radiation is detected from the same direction. A preliminary analysis of
the data, taken during the first 11 months of the Fermi satellite operations,
is reported. The diffuse gamma-ray backgrounds and discrete sources, as we know
them today, can account for the large majority of the detected gamma-ray
emission from the Galactic Center. Nevertheless a residual emission is left,
not accounted for by the above models. An improved model of the Galactic
diffuse emission and a careful evaluation of new (possibly unresolved) sources
(or source populations) will improve the sensitivity for a DM search.
