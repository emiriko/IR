The B/C ratio is used in cosmic-ray physics to constrain the transport
parameters. However, from the same set of data, the various published values
show a puzzling large scatter of these parameters. We investigate the impact of
using different inputs (gas density and hydrogen fraction in the Galactic disc,
source spectral shape, low-energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient, and
nuclear fragmentation cross-sections) on the best-fit values of the transport
parameters. We quantify the systematics produced when varying these inputs, and
compare them to statistical uncertainties. We discuss the consequences for the
slope of the diffusion coefficient delta. The analysis relies on the
propagation code USINE interfaced with the Minuit minimisation routines. We
find the typical systematic uncertainties to be larger than the statistical
ones. The several published values of delta (from 0.3 to 0.8) can be recovered
when varying the low-energy shape of the diffusion coefficient and the
convective wind strength. Models including a convective wind are characterised
by delta > 0.6, which cannot be reconcile with the expected theoretical values
(1/3 and 1/2). However, from a statistical point of view (chi^2 analysis),
models with both reacceleration and convection-hence large delta-are favoured.
The next favoured models in line yield delta that can be accommodated with 1/3
and 1/2, but require a strong upturn of the diffusion coefficient at low energy
(and no convection). To date, using the best statistical tools, the transport
parameter determination is still plagued by many unknowns at low energy (~
GeV/n). To disentangle between all these configurations, measurements of the
B/C ratio at TeV/n energies and/or combination with other secondary-to-primary
ratios is necessary.
