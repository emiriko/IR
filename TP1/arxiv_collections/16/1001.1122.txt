We present several applications of non-linear data modeling, using principal
manifolds and principal graphs constructed using the metaphor of elasticity
(elastic principal graph approach). These approaches are generalizations of the
Kohonen's self-organizing maps, a class of artificial neural networks. On
several examples we show advantages of using non-linear objects for data
approximation in comparison to the linear ones. We propose four numerical
criteria for comparing linear and non-linear mappings of datasets into the
spaces of lower dimension. The examples are taken from comparative political
science, from analysis of high-throughput data in molecular biology, from
analysis of dynamical systems.
