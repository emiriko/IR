It was recently proposed that the leading singularities of the S-Matrix of N
= 4 super Yang-Mills theory arise as the residues of a contour integral over a
Grassmannian manifold, with space-time locality encoded through residue
theorems generalizing Cauchy's theorem to more than one variable. We provide a
method to identify the residue corresponding to any leading singularity, and we
carry this out very explicitly for all leading singularities at tree level and
one-loop. We also give several examples at higher loops, including all generic
two-loop leading singularities and an interesting four-loop object. As a
special case we consider a 12-pt N^4MHV leading singularity at two loops that
has a new kinematic structure involving double square roots. Our analysis
results in a simple picture for how the topological structure of loop graphs is
reflected in various substructures within the Grassmannian.
