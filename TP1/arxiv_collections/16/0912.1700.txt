We consider a linearly elastic composite medium, which consists of a
homogeneous matrix containing statistically inhomogeneous random set of
heterogeneities and loaded by inhomogeneous remote loading. The new general
integral equation is obtained by a centering procedure without any auxiliary
assumptions such as, e.g., effective field hypothesis implicitly exploited in
the known centering methods. The method makes it possible to abandon the basic
concepts of classical micromechanics such as effective field hypothesis, and
the hypothesis of "ellipsoidal symmetry". The results of this abandonment leads
to detection of some fundamentally new effects that is impossible in the
framework of a classical background of micromechanics.
