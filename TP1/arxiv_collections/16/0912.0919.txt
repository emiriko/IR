In this talk we give an overview of the 3D phase diagram of two-flavour
non-zero temperature lattice QCD with twisted-mass Wilson fermions and a
tree-level Symanzik-improved gauge action. We present a first feasibility study
at maximal twist and, for the quenched case, we demonstrate automatic
O(a)-improvement to work.
