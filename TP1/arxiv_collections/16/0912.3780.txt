We present results from the first two years of our fast-cadence 15 GHz
gamma-ray blazar monitoring program, part of the F-GAMMA radio monitoring
project. Our sample includes the 1158 blazars north of -20 degrees declination
from the Candidate Gamma-Ray Blazar Survey (CGRaBS), which encompasses a
significant fraction of the extragalactic sources detected by the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope. We introduce a novel likelihood analysis for
computing a time series variability amplitude statistic that separates
intrinsic variability from measurement noise and produces a quantitative error
estimate. We use this method to characterize our radio light curves. We also
present results indicating a statistically significant correlation between
simultaneous average 15 GHz radio flux density and gamma-ray photon flux.
