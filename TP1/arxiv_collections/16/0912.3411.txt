We use a Nambu-Jona Lasinio type model to investigate the phase diagram of
dense quark matter under neutron star conditions in mean field approximation.
The model contains selfconsistently determined quark masses and allows for
diquark condensation in the scalar as well as in the pseudoscalar channel. The
latter gives rise to the possibility of K^0 condensation in the CFL phase. In
agreement with earlier studies we find that this CFLK^0 phase covers large
regions of the phase diagram and that the predominant part of this phase is
fully gapped. We show, however, that there exists a region at very low
temperatures where the CFLK^0 solutions become gapless, possibly indicating an
instability towards anisotropic or inhomogeneous phases. The physical
significance of solutions with pseudoscalar diquark condensates in the 2SC
phase is discussed as well.
