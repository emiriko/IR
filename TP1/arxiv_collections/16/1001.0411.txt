Due to quantum fluctuations, probed at small scales, spacetime is very
complicated -- something akin in complexity to a turbulent froth which the late
John Wheeler dubbed quantum foam, aka spacetime foam. Our recent work suggests
that (1) we may be close to being able to detect quantum foam with
extragalactic sources once the Very Large Telescope Interferometers (VLTI) are
fully operational; (2) dark energy is arguably a cosmological manifestation of
quantum foam, the constituents of which obey infinite statistics; (3) in the
gravitational context, turbulence is closely related to holographic quantum
foam, partly validating Wheeler's picture of a turbulent spacetime.
