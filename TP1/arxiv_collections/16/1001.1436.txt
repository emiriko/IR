The indeterministic outcome of a measurement of an individual quantum is
certified by the impossibility of the simultaneous, definite, deterministic
pre-existence of all conceivable observables from physical conditions of that
quantum alone. We discuss possible interpretations and consequences for quantum
oracles.
