We present here a phenomenological solid quark star pulsar model to interpret
the observed thermal X-ray emission of isolated pulsars. The heat capacity for
solid quark stars was found to be quite small, so that the residual internal
stellar heat gained at the birth of the star could be dissipated in an
extremely short timescale. However, the bombardment induced by backflowing
plasma at the poles of solid quark stars would get the stars be reheated, so
that long term soft X-ray emission can be sustained. Such a scenario could be
used for those X-ray pulsars with significant magnetospheric activities, and
their cooling processes would thus be established. Dim X-ray isolated neutron
stars (XDINs) as well as compact central objects (CCOs) have been observed with
dominant soft X-ray radiation combined with little magnetospheric
manifestations. Such sources could be solid quark stars accreting in the
propeller regime.
