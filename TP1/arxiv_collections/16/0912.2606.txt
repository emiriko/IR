We analise the efficiency of wavefront reconstruction in the MultiConjugate
Adaptive Optics system for the European Solar Telescope (EST). We present
preliminary results derived from numerical simulations. We study a 4 meter
class telescope with multiple deformable mirrors conjugated at variable
heights. Along with common issues, difficulties peculiar to the solar case have
to be considered, such as the low contrast and extended nature of the natural
guide features. Our findings identify basic requirements for the EST Adaptive
Optics system and show some of its capabilities.
