Electron transport properties are investigated in an array of mesoscopic
rings, where each ring is threaded by a magnetic flux $\phi$. The array is
attached to two semi-infinite one-dimensional metallic electrodes, namely,
source and drain, where the rings are considered either in series or in
parallel configuration. A simple tight-binding model is used to describe the
system and all the calculations are done based on the Green's function
formalism. Here, we present conductance-energy and current-voltage
characteristics in terms of ring-to-electrode coupling strength, ring-electrode
interface geometry and magnetic flux. Most interestingly it is observed that,
typical current amplitude in an array of mesoscopic rings in the series
configuration is much larger compared to that in parallel configuration of
those rings. This feature is completely different from the classical analogy
which may provide an important signature in designing nano-scale electronic
devices.
