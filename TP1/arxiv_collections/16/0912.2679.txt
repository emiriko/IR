We present a Regge-inspired effective-Lagrangian framework for charged-kaon
photoproduction from the deuteron. Quasi-free kaon production is investigated
using the Regge-plus-resonance elementary operator within the non-relativistic
plane-wave impulse approximation. The Regge-plus-resonance model was developed
to describe photoinduced and electroinduced kaon production off protons and can
be extended to strangeness production off neutrons. The non-resonant
contributions to the amplitude are modelled in terms of K+(494) and K*+(892)
Regge-trajectory exchange in the t-channel. This amplitude is supplemented with
a selection of s-channel resonance-exchange diagrams. We investigate several
sources of theoretical uncertainties on the semi-inclusive charged-kaon
production cross section. The experimental error bars on the photocoupling
helicity amplitudes turn out to put severe limits on the predictive power when
considering quasi-free kaon production on a bound neutron.
