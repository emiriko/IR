Gamma-ray bursts, detected by the Swift satellite, are separated into two
samples: the bursts with and without determined redshifts. These two samples
are compared by the standard Student t-test and F-test. We have compared the
dispersions and the mean values of the durations, peak fluxes and fluences in
order to find any differences among these two samples. No essential differences
were found.
