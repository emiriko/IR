We present a model of adaptive regulatory networks consisting of a simple
biologically-motivated rewiring procedure coupled to an elementary stability
criterion. The resulting networks exhibit a characteristic stationary
heavy-tailed degree distribution, show complex structural microdynamics and
self-organize to a dynamically critical state. We show analytically that the
observed criticality results from the formation and breaking of transient
feedback loops during the adaptive process.
