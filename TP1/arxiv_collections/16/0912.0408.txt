For a homogeneous space X (not necessarily principal) of a connected
algebraic group G (not necessarily linear) over a number field k, we prove a
theorem of strong approximation for the adelic points of X in the Brauer-Manin
set. Namely, for an adelic point x of X orthogonal to a certain subgroup (which
may contain transcendental elements) of the Brauer group Br(X) of X with
respect to the Manin pairing, we prove a strong approximation property for x
away from a finite set S of places of k. Our result extends a result of Harari
for torsors of semiabelian varieties and a result of Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and Xu
for homogeneous spaces of simply connected semisimple groups, and our proof
uses those results.
