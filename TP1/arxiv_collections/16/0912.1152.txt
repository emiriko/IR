We analyze the near-field interaction between the resonant sub-wavelength
elements of a metamaterial, and present a method to calculate the electric and
magnetic interaction coefficients. We show that by adjusting the relative
configuration of the neighboring split ring resonators it becomes possible to
manipulate this near-field interaction, and thus tune the response of
metamaterials. We use the results of this analysis to explain the
experimentally observed tuning of microwave metamaterials.
