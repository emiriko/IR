We report here on the most recent results obtained on a new class of High
Mass X-ray Binaries, the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients. Since October 2007,
we have been performing a monitoring campaign with Swift of four SFXTs
(IGRJ17544-2916, XTEJ1739-302, IGRJ16479-4514 and the X-ray pulsar
AXJ1841.0-0536) for about 1-2 ks, 2-3 times per week, allowing us to derive the
previously unknown long term properties of this new class of sources (their
duty cycles, spectral properties in outbursts and out-of-outbursts, temporal
behaviour). We also report here on additional Swift observations of two SFXTs
which are not part of the monitoring: IGRJ18483-0311 (observed with Swift/XRT
during a whole orbital cycle) and SAXJ1818.6-1703 (observed for the first time
simultaneously in the energy range 0.3-100 keV during a bright flare).
