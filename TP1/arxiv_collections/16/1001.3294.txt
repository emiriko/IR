Cold and dense nuclear and/or quark matter can be found in the interior of
compact stars. It is very challenging to determine the ground state and
properties of this matter because of the strong-coupling nature of QCD. I give
a pedagogical introduction to microscopic calculations based on
phenomenological models, effective theories, and perturbative QCD. I discuss
how the results of these calculations can be related to astrophysical
observations to potentially rule out or confirm candidate phases of dense
matter.
