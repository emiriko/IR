We describe and present initial results from a Fermi cycle 2 program designed
to monitor the behavior of the centimeter-band linear polarization and total
flux density emitted by gamma-ray-bright blazars during flaring. The goal of
the program is to identify changes in the magnetic field structure in the radio
jet associated with gamma-ray flaring and ultimately to test whether gamma-ray
flaring is associated with the onset of shocks in the radio jet. Light curves
illustrating radio band variability patterns are shown for sample program
sources.
