Y. Palu has generalized the cluster multiplication formulas to 2-Calabi-Yau
categories with cluster tilting objects (\cite{Palu2}). The aim of this note is
to construct a variant of Y. Palu's formula and deduce a new version of the
cluster multiplication formula (\cite{XiaoXu}) for acyclic quivers in the
context of cluster categories.
