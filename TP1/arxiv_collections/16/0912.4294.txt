We are integrating the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) into the
Interplanetary Network (IPN) of Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) detectors. With the GBM,
the IPN will comprise 9 experiments. This will 1) assist the Fermi team in
understanding and reducing their systematic localization uncertainties, 2)
reduce the sizes of the GBM and Large Area Telescope (LAT) error circles by 1
to 4 orders of magnitude, 3) facilitate the identification of GRB sources with
objects found by ground- and space-based observatories at other wavelengths,
from the radio to very high energy gamma-rays, 4) reduce the uncertainties in
associating some LAT detections of high energy photons with GBM bursts, and 5)
facilitate searches for non-electromagnetic GRB counterparts, particularly
neutrinos and gravitational radiation. We present examples and demonstrate the
synergy between Fermi and the IPN. This is a Fermi Cycle 2 Guest Investigator
project.
