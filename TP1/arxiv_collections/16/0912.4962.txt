So far, the Standard Model of Elementary Particles has not succeeded getting
a trustworthy account of the proton spin, which remains an enigma. This
hindrance is known as the proton spin crisis, owing to the experimental
evidence already from 1988 suggesting that little or none of the proton spin
would come from the spin of the quarks. This prompted theorists to a flood of
guessworks about the proton spin. Since it remains unsolved, in the framework
of new physics an exploratory approach based on a novel paradigm is proposed,
which brings a renewed access to this challenge, through its reciprocal
relationship with the g-factor.
