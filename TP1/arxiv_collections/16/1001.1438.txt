This paper develops a novel methodology to study robust stability properties
of Nash equilibrium points in dynamic games. Small-gain techniques in modern
mathematical control theory are used for the first time to derive conditions
guaranteeing uniqueness and global asymptotic stability of Nash equilibrium
point for economic models described by functional difference equations.
Specification to a Cournot oligopoly game is studied in detail to demonstrate
the power of the proposed methodology.
