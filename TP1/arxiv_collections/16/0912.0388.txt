In this contribution we review some recent results about the emergence of 2D
integrable systems in 3D Lattice Gauge Theories near the deconfinement
transition. We focus on some concrete examples involving the flux tube
thickness, the ratio of k-string tensions and Polyakov loops correlators in
various models.
