Effect of a complicated many-body environment is analyzed on the electron
random scattering by a 2D mesoscopic open ballistic structure. A new mechanism
of decoherence is proposed. The temperature of the environment is supposed to
be zero whereas the energy of the incoming particle $E_{in}$ can be close to or
somewhat above the Fermi surface in the environment. The single-particle
doorway resonance states excited in the structure via external channels are
damped not only because of escape through such channels but also due to the
ulterior population of the long-lived environmental states. Transmission of an
electron with a given incoming $E_{in}$ through the structure turns out to be
an incoherent sum of the flow formed by the interfering damped doorway
resonances and the retarded flow of the particles re-emitted into the structure
by the environment. Though the number of the particles is conserved in each
individual event of transmission, there exists a probability that some part of
the electron's energy can be absorbed due to environmental many-body effects.
In such a case the electron can disappear from the resonance energy interval
and elude observation at the fixed transmission energy $E_{in}$ thus resulting
in seeming loss of particles, violation of the time reversal symmetry and, as a
consequence, suppression of the weak localization. The both decoherence and
absorption phenomena are treated within the framework of a unit microscopic
model based on the general theory of the resonance scattering. All the effects
discussed are controlled by the only parameter: the spreading width of the
doorway resonances, that uniquely determines the decoherence rate
