The aim of this work is to try to bridge over theoretical immunology and
disordered statistical mechanics. Our long term hope is to contribute to the
development of a quantitative theoretical immunology from which practical
applications may stem. In order to make theoretical immunology appealing to the
statistical physicist audience we are going to work out a research article
which, from one side, may hopefully act as a benchmark for future improvements
and developments, from the other side, it is written in a very pedagogical way
both from a theoretical physics viewpoint as well as from the theoretical
immunology one.
  Furthermore, we have chosen to test our model describing a wide range of
features of the adaptive immune response in only a paper: this has been
necessary in order to emphasize the benefit available when using disordered
statistical mechanics as a tool for the investigation. However, as a
consequence, each section is not at all exhaustive and would deserve deep
investigation: for the sake of completeness, we restricted details in the
analysis of each feature with the aim of introducing a self-consistent model.
