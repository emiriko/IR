An analytical solution for symmetric Skyrmion was proposed for the SU(2)
Skyrme model, which take the form of the hybrid form of a kink-like solution
and that given by the instanton method. The static properties of nucleons was
then computed within the framework of collective quantization of the Skyrme
model, with a good agreement with that given by the exact numeric solution. The
comparisons with the previous results as well as the experimental values are
also given.
