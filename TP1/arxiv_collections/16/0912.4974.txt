J. H. C. Whitehead gave an elegant integral formula for the Hopf invariant
H(p) of a smooth map p from the 3-sphere to the 2-sphere. Given an open book
structure b on the 3-sphere (or, essentially equivalently, an isolated critical
point of a map F from 4-space to the plane), Whitehead's formula can be
"integrated along the fibers" to express H(p) as the integral of a certain
1-form over the circle. In case p is geometrically related to b (or F) -- for
instance, if p is the map (one component of the fiberwise generalized Gauss map
of F) whose Hopf invariant lambda(K) is the "enhancement of the Milnor number"
of the fibered link K in the 3-sphere associated to F (or b), previously
studied by the author and others -- it might be hoped that this 1-form has
geometric significance. This note makes that hope somewhat more concrete, in
the form of several speculations and questions.
