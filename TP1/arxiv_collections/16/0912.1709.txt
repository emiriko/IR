A set of physics models for nanodosimetry simulation is being re-engineered
for use in Geant4-based simulations. This extension of Geant4 capabilities is
part of a larger scale R&D project for multi-scale simulation involving
adaptable, co-working condensed and discrete transport schemes. The project in
progress reengineers the physics modeling capabilities associated with an
existing FORTRAN track-structure code for nanodosimetry into a software design
suitable to collaborate with an object oriented simulation kernel. The first
experience and results of the ongoing re-engineering process are presented.
