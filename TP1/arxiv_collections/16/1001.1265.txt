The theory of multiphase polymer systems has a venerable tradition. The
'classical' theory of polymer demixing, the Flory-Huggins theory, was developed
already in the forties of the last century. It is still the starting point for
most current approaches -- be they improved theories for polymer
(im)miscibility that take into account the microscopic structure of blends more
accurately, or sophisticated field theories that allow to study inhomogeneous
multicomponent systems of polymers with arbitrary architectures in arbitrary
geometries. In contrast, simulations of multiphase polymer systems are
relatively young. They are still limited by the fact that one must simulate a
large number of large molecules in order to obtain meaningful results. Both
powerful computers and smart modeling and simulation approaches are necessary
to overcome this problem.
  This article gives an overview over the state-of-the art in both areas,
theory and simulation. While the theory has reached a fairly mature stage by
now, and many aspects of it are covered in textbooks on polymer physics, the
information on simulations is much more scattered. This is why some effort has
been invested into putting together a representative list of references in this
area (up to the year of 2008) -- which is of course still far from complete.
