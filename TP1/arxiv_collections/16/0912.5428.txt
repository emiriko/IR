We calculate the entropy and cooling rate of the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2
XXZ chain under an adiabatic demagnetization process using the quantum
transfer-matrix technique and non-linear integral equations. The limiting case
of the Ising chain (corresponding to infinitely large anisotropy) is presented
for comparison. Our exact results for the Heisenberg chain are used as a
crosscheck for the numerical exact diagonalization as well as Quantum Monte
Carlo simulations and allow us to benchmark the numerical methods. Close to
field-induced quantum phase transitions we observe a large magnetocaloric
effect. Furthermore, we verify universal low-temperature power laws in the
cooling rate and entropy, in particular linear scaling of entropy with
temperature T in the gapless Luttinger-liquid state and scaling as \sqrt{T} at
field-induced transitions to gapped phases.
