Our primary task is to demonstrate that the logarithmic nonlinearity in the
quantum wave equation can cause the spontaneous symmetry breaking and mass
generation phenomena on its own, at least in principle. To achieve this goal,
we view the physical vacuum as a kind of the fundamental Bose-Einstein
condensate embedded into the fictitious Euclidean space. The relation of such
description to that of the physical (relativistic) observer is established via
the fluid/gravity correspondence map, the related issues, such as the induced
gravity and scalar field, relativistic postulates, Mach's principle and
cosmology, are discussed. For estimate the values of the generated masses of
the otherwise massless particles such as the photon, we propose few simple
models which take into account small vacuum fluctuations. It turns out that the
photon's mass can be naturally expressed in terms of the elementary electrical
charge and the extensive length parameter of the nonlinearity. Finally, we
outline the topological properties of the logarithmic theory and corresponding
solitonic solutions.
