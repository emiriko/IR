The current flow from the bulk is due to the anomaly on the brane-but the
absence of current flow is not, necessarily, due to anomaly cancellation, but
to the absence of the chiral zero modes themselves, due to the existence of the
layered phase. This can be understood in terms of the difference between the
Chern-Simons terms in three and five dimensions. Thus the anomaly cancellation
in four dimensions, which is essential for shielding the boundary from quantum
effects within the bulk, makes sense only along the transition line between the
layered and the Coulomb phase, which, in turn, requires the presence of a
compact U(1) factor for the gauge group.
