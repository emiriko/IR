The key questions of uniqueness and existence in time-dependent density
functional theory are usually formulated only for potentials and densities that
are analytic in time. Simple examples, standard in quantum mechanics, lead
however to non-analyticities. We reformulate these questions in terms of a
non-linear Schr\"odinger equation with a potential that depends non-locally on
the wavefunction.
