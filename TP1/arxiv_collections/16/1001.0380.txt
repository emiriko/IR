In this paper, we study the blowup of the $N$-dim Euler or Euler-Poisson
equations with repulsive forces, in radial symmetry. We provide a novel
integration method to show that the non-trivial classical solutions $(\rho,V)$,
with compact support in $[0,R]$, where $R>0$ is a positive constant and in the
sense which $\rho(t,r)=0$ and $V(t,r)=0$ for $r\geq R$, under the initial
condition% $H_{0}=\int_{0}^{R}rV_{0}dr>0$ blow up on or before the finite time
$T=R^{3}/(2H_{0})$ for pressureless fluids or $\gamma>1.$
  The main contribution of this article provides the blowup results of the
Euler $(\delta=0)$ or Euler-Poisson $(\delta=1)$ equations with repulsive
forces, and with pressure $(\gamma>1)$, as the previous blowup papers
(\cite{MUK} \cite{MP}, \cite{P} and \cite{CT}) cannot handle the systems with
the pressure term, for $C^{1}$ solutions.
