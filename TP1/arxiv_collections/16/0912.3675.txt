Modern, state of the art nanomechanical devices are capable of creating
spatial superpositions that are massive enough to begin to experimentally
access the quantum to classical crossover, and thus force us to consider the
possible ways in which the usual quantum dynamics may be affected. One recent
theoretical proposal describes the crossover from unitary quantum mechanics to
classical dynamics as a form of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Here, we propose
a specific experimental setup capable of identifying the source of unitarity
breaking in such a mechanism. The experiment is aimed specifically at
clarifying the role played by gravity, and distinguishes the resulting dynamics
from that suggested by alternative scenarios for the quantum to classical
crossover. We give both a theoretical description of the expected dynamics, and
a discussion of the involved experimental parameter values and the proposed
experimental protocol.
