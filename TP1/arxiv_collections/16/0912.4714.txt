This paper develops a formulation of the quasispecies equations appropriate
for polysomic, semiconservatively replicating genomes. This paper is an
extension of previous work on the subject, which considered the case of haploid
genomes. Here, we develop a more general formulation of the quasispecies
equations that is applicable to diploid and even polyploid genomes.
Interestingly, with an appropriate classification of population fractions, we
obtain a system of equations that is formally identical to the haploid case. As
with the work for haploid genomes, we consider both random and immortal DNA
strand chromosome segregation mechanisms. However, in contrast to the haploid
case, we have found that an analytical solution for the mean fitness is
considerably more difficult to obtain for the polyploid case. Accordingly,
whereas for the haploid case we obtained expressions for the mean fitness for
the case of an analogue of the single-fitness-peak landscape for arbitrary
lesion repair probabilities (thereby allowing for non-complementary genomes),
here we solve for the mean fitness for the restricted case of perfect lesion
repair.
