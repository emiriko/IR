We compare Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph observations of SQ-A & SQ-B in
Stephan's Quintet, Ambartzumian's knot in Arp 105, Arp 242-N3, Arp 87-N1, a
bridge star forming region, NGC 5291 N and NGC 5291 S. The PAHs tend to be
mainly neutral grains with a typical size of 50 - 100 carbon atoms. The
interstellar radiation field is harder than typical starburst galaxies, being
similar to that found in dwarf galaxies. The neon line ratios are consistent
with a recent episode of star formation. We detect warm H2 in SQ-A, Arp 87N1
and SQ-B. Using our 8 um images of 14 interacting systems we identify 62 tidal
star forming knots (TSFKs). The estimated stellar masses range from super star
cluster (10^4-10^6 Msun) to TDG (~10^9 Msun) sizes. The stellar mass, with some
scatter, scales with the 8 um luminosity and tends to be an order of magnitude
smaller than the KISS sample of star forming dwarfs. An exception to this are
the more massive TSFKs in Arp 242. The TSFKs, form two distinct clumps in a
mid-infrared color diagram. There are 38 red-TSFKs with [4.5] - [8.0] > 3 and
[3.6] - [4.5] < 0.4. This populations has significantly enhanced non-stellar
emission, most likely due to PAHs and/or hot dust. The second group of 21
sources has 1.2 < [4.5] - [8.0] < 3 and [3.6] - [4.5] < 0.4, these colors are
similar to star forming dwarf and spiral galaxies. The redder [4.5] - [8.0]
population tends to have the sources with a rising 8-24 um SED while the blue
population tends to contain the sources with a descending SED. The rising SED
is typical of spiral and starburst galaxies with a dominant 40 - 60 K dust
component and the declining SED probably indicates a dominant hot dust
component.
