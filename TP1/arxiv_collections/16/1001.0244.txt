We present designs of all-optical computing circuits, namely, half-full
adder/subtractor, de-multiplexer, multiplexer, and an arithmetic unit, based on
bacteriorhodopsin (BR) protein coated microcavity switch in a tree
architecture. The basic all-optical switch consists of an input infrared (IR)
laser beam at 1310 nm in a single mode fiber (SMF-28) switched by a control
pulsed laser beam at 532 nm, which triggers the change in the resonance
condition on a silica bead coated with BR between two tapered fibers. We show
that fast switching of 50 us can be achieved by injecting a blue laser beam at
410 nm that helps in truncating the BR photocycle at the M intermediate state.
Realization of all-optical switch with BR coated microcavity switch has been
done experimentally. Based on this basic switch configuration, designs of
all-optical higher computing circuits have been presented. The design requires
2n-1 switches to realize n bit computation. The proposed designs require less
number of switches than terahertz optical asymmetric demultiplexer based
interferometer designs. The combined advantages of high Q factor, tunability,
compactness and low power control signals, with the flexibility of cascading
switches to form circuits, makes the designs promising for practical
applications. The design combines the exceptional sensitivities of BR and
microcavities for realizing low power circuits and networks. The designs are
general and can be implemented (i) in both fiber-optic and integrated optic
formats, (ii) with any other coated photosensitive material, or (iii) an
externally controlled microresonator switch.
