Skyrmionic states in noncentrosymmetric magnets with Lifshitz invariants are
investigated within the phenomenological Dzyaloshinskii model. The interaction
between the chiral Skyrmions, being repulsive in a broad temperature range,
changes into attraction at high temperatures. This leads to a remarkable
confinement effect: near the ordering temperature Skyrmions exist only as bound
states, and Skyrmion lattices are formed by an unusual instability-type
nucleation transition. Numerical investigations on two-dimensional models
demonstrate the confinement and the occurrence of different Skyrmion lattice
precursor states near the ordering transition that can become thermodynamically
stable by anisotropy or longitudinal softness in cubic helimagnets.
