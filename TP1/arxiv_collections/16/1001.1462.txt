Super Soft Source (SSS) spectra are powered by nuclear burning on the surface
of a white dwarf. The released energy causes a radiatively-driven wind that
leads to a radially extended atmosphere around the white dwarf. Significant
blue shifts in photospheric absorption lines are found in the spectra of novae
during their SSS phase, being an evidence of continued mass loss in this phase.
We present spherically symmetric PHOENIX models that account for the expansion
of the ejecta. A comparison to a plane parallel, hydrostatic atmosphere model
demonstrates that the mass loss can have a significant impact on the model
spectra. The dynamic model yields less pronounced absorption edges, and harder
X-ray spectra are the result. Therefore, lower effective temperatures are
needed to explain the observed spectra. Although both types of models are yet
to be fine-tuned in order to accurately determine best fit parameters, the
implications on the chemical abundances are going in opposite directions. With
the expanding models the requirement for strong depletion of the crucial
elements that cause these edges is now avoidable.
