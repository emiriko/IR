Rotation and magnetic activity are intimately linked in main-sequence stars
of G or later spectral types. The presence and level of magnetic activity
depend on stellar rotation, and rotation itself is strongly influenced by
strength and topology of the magnetic fields. Open clusters represent
especially useful targets to investigate the rotation/activity/age connection.
The open cluster M11 has been studied as a part of the RACE-OC project
(Rotation and ACtivity Evolution in Open Clusters), which is aimed at exploring
the evolution of rotation and magnetic activity in the late-type members of
open clusters with different ages. Photometric observations of the open cluster
M11 were carried out in June 2004 using LOAO 1m telescope. The rotation periods
of the cluster members are determined by Fourier analysis of photometric data
time series. We further investigated the relations between the surface
activity, characterized by the light curve amplitude, and rotation. We have
discovered a total of 75 periodic variables in the M11 FoV, of which 38 are
candidate cluster members. Specifically, among cluster members we discovered 6
early-type, 2 eclipsing binaries and 30 bona-fide single periodic late-type
variables. Considering the rotation periods of 16 G-type members of the almost
coeval 200-Myr M34 cluster, we could determine the rotation period distribution
from a more numerous sample of 46 single G stars at an age of about 200-230 Myr
and determine a median rotation period P=4.8d. A comparison with the younger
M35 cluster (~150 Myr) and with the older M37 cluster (~550 Myr) shows that G
stars rotate slower than younger M35 stars and faster than older M37 stars. The
measured variation of the median rotation period is consistent with the
scenario of rotational braking of main-sequence spotted stars as they age.
