We consider short pulse propagation in nonlinear metamaterials characterized
by a weak Kerr-type nonlinearity in their dielectric response. In the frequency
"band gaps" (where linear electromagnetic waves are evanescent) with linear
effective permittivity \epsilon<0 and permeability \mu>0, we derive two
short-pulse equations (SPEs) for the high- and low-frequency band gaps. The
structure of the solutions of the SPEs is also briefly discussed, and
connections with the soliton solutions of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation
are presented.
