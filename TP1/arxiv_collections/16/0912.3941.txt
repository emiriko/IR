Genetically identical cells under the same environmental conditions can show
strong variations in protein copy numbers due to inherently stochastic events
in individual cells. We here develop a theoretical framework to address how
variations in enzyme abundance affect the collective kinetics of metabolic
reactions observed within a population of cells. Kinetic parameters measured at
the cell population level are shown to be systematically deviated from those of
single cells, even within populations of homogeneous parameters. Because of
these considerations, Michaelis-Menten kinetics can even be inappropriate to
apply at the population level. Our findings elucidate a novel origin of
discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro kinetics, and offer potential utility
for analysis of single-cell metabolomic data.
