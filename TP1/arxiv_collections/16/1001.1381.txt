We use the recent results on dark matter searches of the 22-string IceCube
detector to probe the remaining allowed window for strongly interacting dark
matter in the mass range 10^4<m_X<10^15 GeV. We calculate the expected signal
in the 22-string IceCube detector from the annihilation ofsuch particles
captured in the Sun and compare it to the detected background. As a result, the
remaining allowed region in the mass versus cross sectionparameter space is
ruled out. We also show the expected sensitivity of the complete IceCube
detector with 86 strings.
