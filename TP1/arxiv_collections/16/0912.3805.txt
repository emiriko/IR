The Quantum Reverse Shannon Theorem states that any quantum channel can be
simulated by an unlimited amount of shared entanglement and an amount of
classical communication equal to the channel's entanglement assisted classical
capacity. In this paper, we provide a new proof of this theorem, which has
previously been proved by Bennett, Devetak, Harrow, Shor, and Winter. Our proof
has a clear structure being based on two recent information-theoretic results:
one-shot Quantum State Merging and the Post-Selection Technique for quantum
channels.
