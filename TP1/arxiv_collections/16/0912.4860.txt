In this work, we discuss the contribution of the mesonic loops to the decay
rates of $\chi_{c1}\to \phi\phi,\,\omega\omega$ which are suppressed by the
helicity selection rules and $\chi_{c1}\to \phi\omega$ which is a double-OZI
forbidden process. We find that the mesonic loop effects naturally explain the
clear signals of $\chi_{c1}\to \phi\phi,\,\omega\omega$ decay modes observed by
the BES collaboration. Moreover, we investigate the effects of the
$\omega-\phi$ mixing which may result in the order of magnitude of the
branching ratio $BR(\chi_{c1} \to \omega \phi)$ being $10^{-7}$. Thus, we are
waiting for the accurate measurements of the $BR(\chi_{c1} \to \omega \omega)$,
$BR(\chi_{c1} \to \phi \phi)$ and $BR(\chi_{c1} \to \omega \phi)$, which may be
very helpful for testing the long-distant contribution and the $\omega-\phi$
mixing in $\chi_{c1}\to\phi\phi,\,\omega\omega,\,\omega\phi$ decays.
