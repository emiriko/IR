Ensuring the radiation hardness of PbWO4 crystals was one of the main
priorities during the construction of the electromagnetic calorimeter of the
CMS experiment at CERN. The production on an industrial scale of radiation hard
crystals and their certification over a period of several years represented a
difficult challenge both for CMS and for the crystal suppliers. The present
article reviews the related scientific and technological problems encountered.
