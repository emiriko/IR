The current status of effective field theory (EFT) descriptions of
nucleon-nucleon (NN) interactions is briefly reviewed, and a new formulation of
EFT which treats pion interactions perturbatively is presented. This approach
differs from the Kaplan-Savage-Wise (KSW) expansion in that the singular short
distance part of the pion tensor interaction is summed to all orders.
