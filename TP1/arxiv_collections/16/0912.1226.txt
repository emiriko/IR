In social systems, meaning can be communicated in addition to underlying
processes of the information exchange. Meaning processing incurs on information
processing with hindsight, while information processing recursively follows the
time axis. The sole assumption of social relatedness as a variable among groups
of agents provides sufficient basis for deriving the logistic map as a
first-order approximation of the social system. The anticipatory formulation of
this equation can be derived for both anticipation in the interaction term and
in the aggregation among subgroups. Using this formula in a cellular automaton,
an observer is generated as a reflection of the system under observation. The
social system of interactions among observations can improve on the
representations entertained by each of the observing systems.
