In this article, we re-study the heavy baryon states $\Omega_b$, $\Omega_c$,
$\Xi'_b$, $\Xi'_c$, $\Sigma_b$ and $\Sigma_c$ with the QCD sum rules, after
subtracting the contributions from the corresponding negative parity heavy
baryon states, the predicted masses are in good agreement with the experimental
data.
