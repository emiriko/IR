The accurate theoretical treatment of low-energy electro-weak processes in
lightest nuclei is of great current importance not only in the context of
nuclear physics {\it per se} but also from the astrophysical and
particle-physics viewpoints. I give a brief survey of the recent remarkable
progress in this domain.
