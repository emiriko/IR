A multidimensional cosmological type model with 1-component anisotropic fluid
is considered. An exact solution is obtained. This solution is defined on a
product manifold containing n Ricci-flat factor spaces. We singled out a
special solution governed by the function cosh. It is shown that this special
solution has Kasner-like asymptotics in the limits \tau \to + 0 and
  \tau \to + \infty, where \tau is a synchronous time variable. A relation
between two sets of Kasner parameters \alpha_{\infty} and \alpha_{0} is found.
This formula (of "scattering law") is coinciding with that obtained earlier for
the S-brane solution (when scalar fields are absent).
