SOFIA is a 2.5 meter airborne infrared telescope, mounted in a Boeing 747SP
aircraft. Due to the large size of the telescope, only a few degrees of azimuth
are available at the telescope bearing. This means the heading of the aircraft
is fundamentally associated with the telescope's observation targets, and the
ground track necessary to enable a given mission is highly complex and
dependent on the coordinates, duration, and order of observations to be
performed. We have designed and implemented a Flight Management Infrastructure
(FMI) product in order to plan and execute such missions in the presence of a
large number of external constraints (e.g. restricted airspace, international
boundaries, elevation limits of the telescope, aircraft performance, winds at
altitude, and ambient temperatures). We present an overview of the FMI,
including the process, constraints and basic algorithms used to plan and
execute SOFIA missions.
