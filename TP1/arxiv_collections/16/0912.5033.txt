All the classes of static massless scalar field models available currently in
the Einstein theory of gravity necessarily contain a strong curvature naked
singularity. We obtain here a family of solutions for static massless scalar
fields coupled to gravity, which does not have any strong curvature
singularity. This class of models contain a thin shell of singular matter,
which has a physical interpretation. The central curvature singularity is,
however, avoided which is common to all static massless scalar field spacetimes
models known so far. Our result thus points out that the full class of
solutions in this case may contain non-singular models, which is an intriguing
possibility.
