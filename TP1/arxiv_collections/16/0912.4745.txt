Zigzag graphene nanoribbons can have magnetic ground states with
ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, or canted configurations, depending on
carrier density. We show that an electric field directed across the ribbon
alters the magnetic state, favoring antiferromagnetic configurations. This
property can be used to prepare ribbons with a prescribed spin-orientation on a
given edge.
