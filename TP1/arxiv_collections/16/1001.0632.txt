A collisionless plasma is modeled by the Vlasov-Poisson system in three space
dimensions. A fixed background of positive charge - dependant upon only
velocity - is assumed. The situation in which mobile negative ions balance the
positive charge as x tends to infinity is considered. Thus, the total positive
charge and the total negative charge are both infinite. Smooth solutions with
appropriate asymptotic behavior for large x, which were previously shown to
exist locally in time, are continued globally. This is done by showing that the
charge density decays at least as fast as x^{-6}. This article also establishes
spatial decay estimates for the electrostatic field and its derivatives.
