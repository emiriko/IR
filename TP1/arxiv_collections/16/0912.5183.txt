Neutrinos produced in dark matter self-annihilations in the Galactic halo
might be detectable by IceCube. We present a search for such a signal using the
IceCube detector in the 22-string configuration. We first evaluate the
sensitivity before presenting the result based on the collected data. We find
that even with the partially instrumented detector and a small dataset, we are
able to meaningfully constrain the dark matter self-annihilation cross-section.
Future analyses, based on data sets from a larger detector and the inclusion of
the Galactic center, are expected to considerably improve these results.
