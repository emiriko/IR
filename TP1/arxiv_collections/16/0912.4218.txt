We consider mid-infrared (5 to 25 micrometers), optically cooled detectors
based on a microcantilever sensor of the radiation pressure. A significant
enhancement of sensitivity is achieved due the combination of low effective
temperature (10 K), non-absorption detection, and a high quality optical
microcavity. Applications to spectrometry are examined. It is shown that an
optically cooled radiation pressure sensor potentially has a sensitivity an
order of magnitude better than the best conventional uncooled detectors.
