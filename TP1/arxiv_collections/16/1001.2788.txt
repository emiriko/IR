It might be expected that trajectories for a dynamical system which has no
negative Lyapunov exponent (implying exponential growth of small separations
will not cluster together. However, clustering can occur such that the density
$\rho(\Delta x)$ of trajectories within distance $\Delta x$ of a reference
trajectory has a power-law divergence, so that $\rho(\Delta x)\sim \Delta
x^{-\beta}$ when $\Delta x$ is sufficiently small, for some $0<\beta<1$. We
demonstrate this effect using a random map in one dimension. We find no
evidence for this effect in the chaotic logistic map, and argue that the effect
is harder to observe in deterministic maps.
