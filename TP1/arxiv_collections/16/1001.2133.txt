Numerical integration of the differential equations of light propagation in
the Schwarzschild metric shows that in some situations relevant for practical
observations the well-known post-Newtonian solution for light propagation has
an error up to 16 microarcsecond. The aim of this work is to demonstrate this
fact, identify the reason for this error and to derive an analytical formula
accurate at the level of 1 microarcsecond as needed for high-accuracy
astrometric projects (e.g., Gaia).
  An analytical post-post-Newtonian solution for the light propagation for both
Cauchy and boundary problems is given for the Schwarzschild metric augmented by
the PPN and post-linear parameters $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\epsilon$. Using
analytical upper estimates of each term we investigate which
post-post-Newtonian terms may play a role for an observer in the solar system
at the level of 1 microarcsecond and conclude that only one post-post-Newtonian
term remains important for this numerical accuracy. In this way, an analytical
solution for the boundary problem for light propagation is derived. That
solution contains terms of both post-Newtonian and post-post-Newtonian order,
but is valid for the given numerical level of 1 microarcsecond. The derived
analytical solution has been verified using the results of a high-accuracy
numerical integration of differential equations of light propagation and found
to be correct at the level well below 1 microarcsecond for arbitrary observer
situated within the solar system. Furthermore, the origin of the
post-post-Newtonian terms relevant for the microarcsecond accuracy is
elucidated. We demonstrate that these terms result from an inadequate choice of
the impact parameter in the standard post-Newtonian formulas.
