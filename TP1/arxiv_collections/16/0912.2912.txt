A one dimensional exclusion process is introduced where particles hop to a
neighbouring vacant site with a rate that depends on the size of the block they
belong to. This model is equivalent to a zero range process (ZRP) and shares
the same steady state distribution. However positional ordering is lost in this
mapping and spatial correlations which depend on position indices can not be
calculated directly from the ZRP equivalence. We devise a method to calculate
these correlations and illustrate it by reproducing certain known results.
Unexplored correlations in some other model systems are also investigated. This
method can be generically used to find exact correlations of one dimensional
exclusion processes which has ZRP correspondence.
