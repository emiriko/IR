Brown and Mallik (BM) recently showed that, for hot sources, recombination of
non-thermal electrons (NTR) onto highly ionised heavy ions is not negligible
compared to non-thermal bremsstrahlung (NTB) as a source of flare hard X-rays
(HXRs) and so should be included in modelling non-thermal HXR flare emission.
In view of major discrepancies between BM results for the THERMAL continua and
those of the Chianti code and of RHESSI solar data, we critically re-examine
and correct the BM analysis and modify the conclusions concerning the
importance of NTR. Although the analytic Kramers expression used by BM is
correct for the purely hydrogenic recombination cross section, the heuristic
expressions used by BM to extend the Kramers expression beyond the `bare
nucleus' case to which it applies had serious errors. BM results have therefore
been recalculated using corrected expressions, which have been validated
against the results of detailed calculations. At T ~ 10-30 MK the dominant ions
are Fe 22+, 23+, 24+ for which BM erroneously overestimated NTR emission by
around an order of magnitude. Contrary to the BM claim, NTR in hot flare
plasmas does NOT dominate over NTB, although in some cases it can be comparable
and so still very important in inversions of photon spectra to derive electron
spectra, especially as NTR includes sharp edge features. The BM claim of
dominance of NTR over NTB in deka-keV emission is incorrect due to a serious
error in their analysis. However, the NTR contribution can still be large
enough to demand inclusion in spectral fitting, the spectral edges having
potentially serious effects on inversion of HXR spectra to infer fast electron
spectra.
