We investigate temperature-dependence of the upper critical fields Hc2(T) of
a superconducting FeTe0.6Se0.4 single crystal by measuring resistivity in
static magnetic fields up to 45 T. The observations of strong bending in the
Hc2ab(T) curves and nearly isotropic Hc2ab(0) ~ Hc2c(0) ~ 48 T support the
presence of strong Pauli paramagnetic effect. We show that the
Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg formula considering the Pauli limiting and the
spin-orbit scattering together can effectively describe both Hc2ab(T) and
Hc2c(T) curves. The enhancement in quasi-particle density of states or
increased scattering resulting from Te(Se) vacancy or excess Fe is discussed as
a possible origin for the manifesting Pauli paramagnetic effect.
