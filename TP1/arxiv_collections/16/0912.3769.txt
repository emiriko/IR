Blazars are a small fraction of all extragalactic sources but, unlike other
objects, they are strong emitters across the entire electromagnetic spectrum.
In this study we have conducted a detailed investigation of the broad-band
spectral properties of the gamma-ray selected blazars of the Fermi-LAT Bright
AGN Sample (LBAS). By combining the accurately estimated Fermi gamma-ray
spectra with Swift, radio, NIR-Optical and hard-X/gamma-ray data, collected
within three months of the LBAS data taking period, we were able to assemble
high-quality and quasi-simultaneous Spectral Energy Distributions (SED) for 48
LBAS blazars.
