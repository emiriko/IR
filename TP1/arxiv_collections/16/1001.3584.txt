Molecular nanomagnets show clear signatures of coherent behavior and have a
wide variety of effective low-energy spin Hamiltonians suitable for encoding
qubits and implementing spin-based quantum information processing. At the
nanoscale, the preferred mechanism for control of quantum systems is through
application of electric fields, which are strong, can be locally applied, and
rapidly switched. In this work, we provide the theoretical tools for the search
for single molecule magnets suitable for electric control. By group-theoretical
symmetry analysis we find that the spin-electric coupling in triangular
molecules is governed by the modification of the exchange interaction, and is
possible even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. In pentagonal molecules
the spin-electric coupling can exist only in the presence of spin-orbit
interaction. This kind of coupling is allowed for both $s=1/2$ and $s=3/2$
spins at the magnetic centers. Within the Hubbard model, we find a relation
between the spin-electric coupling and the properties of the chemical bonds in
a molecule, suggesting that the best candidates for strong spin-electric
coupling are molecules with nearly degenerate bond orbitals. We also
investigate the possible experimental signatures of spin-electric coupling in
nuclear magnetic resonance and electron spin resonance spectroscopy, as well as
in the thermodynamic measurements of magnetization, electric polarization, and
specific heat of the molecules.
