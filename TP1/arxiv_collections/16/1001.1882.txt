So far only quasifree fields have been shown to satisfy the Haag-Araki axioms
for local algebras of observables; we show from a model in 1 + 1 dimensions
that there can be representations in which two ingoing free particles produce a
pair of out-going solitons with positive probability, which can be computed.
This happens when the experiment is designed to observe this outcome. It is
proposed that the same idea will work in four dimensions.
