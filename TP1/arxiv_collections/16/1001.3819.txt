We study the statistical properties of the wide binary population in the
Galaxy field with projected separations larger than 200 AU by constructing the
stellar angular two-point correlation function (2PCF) from a homogeneous sample
of nearly 670'000 main sequence stars. The selected stars lie within a
rectangular region around the Northern Galactic Pole and have apparent r-band
magnitudes between 15 and 20.5 mag and spectral classes later than G5 (g-r >
0.5 mag). The data were taken from the Sixth Data Release of the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey. We model the 2PCF by means of the Wasserman-Weinberg technique
including several assumptions on the distribution of the binaries' orbital
parameters, luminosity function, and density distribution in the Galaxy. In
particular, we assume that the semi-major axis distribution is described by a
single powerlaw. The free model parameters - the local wide binary number
density and the power-law index of the semi-major axis distribution - are
inferred simultaneously by least-square fitting. We find the separation
distribution to follow Oepik's law up to the Galactic tidal limit, without any
break and a local density of 5 wide binaries per 1'000 cubic parsec with both
components having spectral type later than G5. This implies that about 10% of
all stars in the solar neighbourhood are members of such a late-type wide
binary system. With a relative statistical (2 sigma) error of about 10%, our
findings are in general agreement with previous studies of wide binaries. The
data suggest that about 800 very wide pairs with projected separations larger
than 0.1 pc exist in our sample, whereas none are found beyond 0.8 pc.
