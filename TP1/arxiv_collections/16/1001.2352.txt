A model of a device is proposed and related theoretical calculation is
performed to study the weak interactions among neutral atoms and molecules. In
this model 3-body collisions among the neutral particles occur repeatedly in a
trap. Results of calculation demonstrate that information on interaction can be
obtained by observing the time-dependent densities of the system.
