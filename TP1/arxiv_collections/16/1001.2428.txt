Test experiments of hybridization in DNA microarrays show systematic
deviations from the equilibrium isotherms. We argue that these deviations are
due to the presence of a partially hybridized long-lived state, which we
include in a kinetic model. Experiments confirm the model predictions for the
intensity vs. free energy behavior. The existence of slow relaxation phenomena
has important consequences for the specificity of microarrays as devices for
the detection of a target sequence from a complex mixture of nucleic acids.
