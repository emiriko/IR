A theoretical model for the calculation of the phonon-drag thermopower,
$S^{g}$, in degenerately doped semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotubes
(SWCNTs) is proposed. Detailed calculations of $S^{g}$ are performed as a
function of temperature, tube radius and position of the Fermi level. We derive
a simple analytical expression for $S^{g}$ that can be utilized to determine
the free carrier density in doped nanotubes. At low temperatures $S^{g}$ shows
an activated behavior characteristic of the one-dimensional (1D) character of
carriers. Screening effects are taken into account and it is found that they
dramatically reduce the magnitude of $S^{g}$. Our results are compared with
previous published experimental data in bulk p-doped SWCNT materials. Excellent
agreement is obtained in the temperature range 10-200 K for a consistent set of
parameters. This is a striking result in view of the complexity of these
systems.
