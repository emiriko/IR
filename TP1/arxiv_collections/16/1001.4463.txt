We discuss results from a recently proposed all-order description of hard,
radiative corrections to certain multi-jet processes at hadron colliders. The
description is based on obtaining an all-order estimate of the t-channel
singularities of scattering amplitudes. As a simple example, we illustrate the
similarities between qQ and qg-scattering. In particular, we discuss how at
tree-level, all non-suppressed helicity-amplitudes for these processes consist
of a pure t-channel pole. This structure is used in the construction of
all-order approximations.
