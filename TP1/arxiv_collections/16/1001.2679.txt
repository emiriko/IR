Basing on the general photon eigenstate and anomaly cancellation, it is shown
that the electric charge quantization in SU(3)_c X SU(3)_L X U(1)_X model with
exotic particles can be obtained independently on parameters alpha and betta.
The fixation of hypercharges of fermions fields by the Higgs fields and
dependence of the electric charges quantization conditions from the
hypercharges of Higgs fields leads to the fact that the electric charge in the
considered model can be quantized and fixed only in the presence of Higgs
fields. In addition, we have shown that in the considered model the classical
constraints following from the Yukawa interactions are equivalent to the
conditions following from the parity invariance of electromagnetic interaction.
The most general expressions for the gauge bosons masses, eigenstates of
neutral fields and the interactions of leptons and quarks with gauge bosons
have been derived in the arbitrary case
