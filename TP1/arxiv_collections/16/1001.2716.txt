We consider the continuum limit of a moose model corresponding to a
generalization to N sites of the Degenerate BESS model. The five dimensional
formulation emerging in this limit is a realization of a RS1 type model with
SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R in the bulk, broken by boundary conditions and a vacuum
expectation value on the infrared brane. A low energy effective Lagrangian is
derived by means of the holographic technique and corresponding bounds on the
model parameters are obtained.
