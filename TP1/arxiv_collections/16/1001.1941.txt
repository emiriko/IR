Neutron diffraction measurements have been carried out to investigate the
magnetic form factor of the parent SrFe2As2 system of the iron-based
superconductors. The general feature is that the form factor is approximately
isotropic in wave vector, indicating that multiple d-orbitals of the iron atoms
are occupied as expected based on band theory. Inversion of the diffraction
data suggests that there is some elongation of the spin density toward the As
atoms. We have also extended the diffraction measurements to investigate a
possible jump in the c-axis lattice parameter at the structural phase
transition, but find no detectable change within the experimental
uncertainties.
