We analyze electron spin relaxation in electronic transport through
coherently coupled double quantum dots in the spin blockade regime. In
particular, we focus on hyperfine interaction as the spin relaxation mechanism.
We pay special attention to the effect of the dynamical nuclear spin
polarization induced by the electronic current on the nuclear environment. We
discuss the behaviour of the electronic current and the induced nuclear spin
polarization versus an external magnetic field for different hyperfine coupling
intensities and interdot tunnelling strengths. We take into account, for each
magnetic field, all hyperfine mediated spin relaxation processes coming from
the different opposite spin levels approaches. We find that the current as a
function of the external magnetic field shows a peak or a dip, and that the
transition from a current dip to a current peak behaviour is obtained by
decreasing the hyperfine coupling or by increasing the interdot tunnelling
strength. We give a physical picture in terms of the interplay between the
electrons tunnelling out of the double quantum dot and the spin flip processes
due to the nuclear environment.
