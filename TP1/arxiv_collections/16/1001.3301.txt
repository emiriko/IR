Context: Radiative feedback plays a crucial role in the formation of massive
stars. The implementation of a fast and accurate description of the proceeding
thermodynamics in pre-stellar cores and evolving accretion disks is therefore a
main effort in current hydrodynamics simulations.
  Aims: We introduce our newly implemented three-dimensional frequency
dependent radiation transport algorithm for hydrodynamics simulations of
spatial configurations with a dominant central source.
  Methods: The module combines the advantage of the speed of an approximate
Flux Limited Diffusion (FLD) solver with the high accuracy of a frequency
dependent first order ray-tracing routine.
  Results: We prove the viability of the scheme in a standard radiation
benchmark test compared to a full frequency dependent Monte-Carlo based
radiative transfer code. The setup includes a central star, a circumstellar
flared disk, as well as an envelope. The test is performed for different
optical depths. Considering the frequency dependence of the stellar
irradiation, the temperature distributions can be described precisely in the
optically thin, thick, and irradiated transition regions. Resulting radiative
forces onto dust grains are reproduced with high accuracy. The achievable
parallel speedup of the method imposes no restriction on further radiative
(magneto-) hydrodynamics simulations.
  Conclusions: The proposed approximate radiation transport method enables
frequency dependent radiation hydrodynamics studies of the evolution of
pre-stellar cores and circumstellar accretion disks around an evolving massive
star in a highly efficient and accurate manner.
