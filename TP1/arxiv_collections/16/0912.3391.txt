RINGO on the Liverpool Telescope has now measured the optical polarization of
GRB 060418 (where a 2 sigma upper limit of P<8% was determined) and GRB 090102
(when a detection of P = 10 +/-1 % was made). We discuss the implications of
these observations for the various competing models of GRB jet magnetization
and describe a possible unified model that can explain both measurements.
