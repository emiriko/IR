The recent paper claims that mean characteristics of chaotic orbits differ
from the corresponding values averaged over the set of unstable periodic
orbits, embedded in the chaotic attractor. We demonstrate that the alleged
discrepancy is an artifact of the improper averaging: Since the natural measure
is non-uniformly distributed over the attractor, different periodic orbits make
different contributions into the time averages. As soon as the corresponding
weights are accounted for, the discrepancy disappears.
