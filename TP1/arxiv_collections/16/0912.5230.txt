We perform monthly total and polarized intensity imaging of a sample of
$\gamma$-ray blazars (33 sources) with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at
43 GHz with the high resolution of 0.1 milliarcseconds. From Summer 2008 to
October 2009 several of these blazars triggered Astronomical Telegrams due to a
high $\gamma$-ray state detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT): AO
0235+164, 3C 273, 3C 279, PKS 1510-089, and 3C 454.3. We have found that 1)
$\gamma$-ray flares in these blazars occur during an increase of the flux in
the 43 GHz VLBI core; 2) strong $\gamma$-ray activity, consisting of several
flares of various amplitudes and durations (weeks to months), is simultaneous
with the propagation of a superluminal knot in the inner jet, as found
previously for BL Lac (Marscher et al. 2008); 3) coincidence of a superluminal
knot with the 43 GHz core precedes the most intense $\gamma$-ray flare by
36$\pm$24 days. Our results strongly support the idea that the most dramatic
$\gamma$-ray outbursts of blazars originate in the vicinity of the mm-wave core
of the relativistic jet. These results are preliminary and should be tested by
future monitoring with the VLBA and Fermi.
