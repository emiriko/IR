In this paper distribution amplitudes of pseudoscalar and vector
nonrelativistic mesons are considered. Using equations of motion for the
distribution amplitudes, it is derived relations which allow one to calculate
the masses of nonrelativistic pseudoscalar and vector meson if the leading
twist distribution amplitudes are known. These relations can be also rewritten
as relations between the masses of nonrelativistic mesons and infinite series
of QCD operators, what can be considered as an exact version of Gremm-Kapustin
relation in NRQCD.
