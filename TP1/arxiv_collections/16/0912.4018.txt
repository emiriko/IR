Pandey & Dwivedi (2007) again tried to claim that the dispersion relation for
the given set of equations must be a sixth degree polynomial. Through a series
of papers, they are unnecessarily creating confusion. In the present
communication, we have shown how Pandey & Dwivedi (2007) are introducing an
additional root, which is insignificant. Moreover, five roots of both the
polynomials are common and they are sufficient for the discussion of
propagation of slow-mode and fast-mode waves.
