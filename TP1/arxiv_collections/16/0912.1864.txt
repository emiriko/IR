Paradoxes are a relatively frequent occurrence in physics. The nature of
their genesis is diverse and they are found in all branches of physics. There
are a number of general and special classifications of paradoxes, but there are
no classifications of paradoxes in physics. Nowadays, physics is a fundamental
and rather formalized science, the paradoxes of which imply falsity and
imprecision. One of the basic methods of addressing a problem is to present
classifications that facilitate its formulation and study. This work groups
together the paradoxes in physics according to certain common characteristics,
which should assist in explaining the causes for paradox formation.
