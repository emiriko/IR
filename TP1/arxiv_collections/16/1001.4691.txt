Recently, self-annihilation of dark matter particles is proposed to explain
the "WMAP Haze" and excess of energetic positrons and electrons in ATIC and
PAMELA results. If self-annihilation of dark matter occurs around the
recombination of cosmic plasma, energy release from self-annihilation of dark
matter delays the recombination, and hence affects CMB anisotropy. By using the
recent CMB data, we have investigated the self-annihilation of dark matter
particles. In this investigation, we do not find statistically significant
evidence, and impose an upper bound on <sigma v> / m_chi. The upcoming data
from Planck surveyor and the Fermi Gamma-ray telescope will allow us to break
some of parameter degeneracy and improve constraints on self-annihilation of
dark matter particles.
