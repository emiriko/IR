Since VLBI techniques give microarcsecond position accuracy of celestial
objects, tests of GR using radio sources as probes of a gravitational field
have been made. We present the results from two recent tests using the VLBA: In
2005, the measurement of the classical solar deflection; and in 2002, the
measurement of the retarded gravitational deflection associated with Jupiter.
The deflection experiment measured PPN-gamma to an accuracy of 0.0003; the
Jupiter experiment measured the retarded term to 20% accuracy. The controversy
over the interpretation of the retarded term is summarized.
