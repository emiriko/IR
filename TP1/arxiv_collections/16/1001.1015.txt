Guided by molecular dynamics simulations, we generalize the
Navier-Stokes-Fourier constitutive equations and the continuum motion equations
to include both transverse and longitudinal temperatures. To do so we partition
the contributions of the heat transfer, the work done, and the heat flux vector
between the longitudinal and transverse temperatures. With shockwave boundary
conditions time-dependent solutions of these equations converge to give
stationary shockwave profiles. The profiles include anisotropic temperature and
can be fitted to molecular dynamics results, demonstrating the utility and
simplicity of a two-temperature description of far-from-equilibrium states.
