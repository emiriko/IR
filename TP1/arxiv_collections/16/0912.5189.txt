We show that the mathematical proof of the four color theorem yields a
perfect interpretation of the Standard Model of particle physics. The steps of
the proof enable us to construct the t-Riemann surface and particle frame which
forms the gauge. We specify well-defined rules to match the Standard Model in a
one-to-one correspondence with the topological and algebraic structure of the
particle frame. This correspondence is exact - it only allows the particles and
force fields to have the observable properties of the Standard Model, giving us
a Grand Unified Theory. In this paper, we concentrate on explicitly specifying
the quarks, gauge vector bosons, the Standard Model scalar Higgs $H^{0}$ boson
and the weak force field. Using all the specifications of our mathematical
model, we show how to calculate the values of the Weinberg and Cabibbo angles
on the particle frame. Finally, we present our prediction of the Higgs $H^{0}$
boson mass $M_{H^{0}} = 125.992 \simeq 126 GeV$, as a direct consequence of the
proof of the four color theorem.
