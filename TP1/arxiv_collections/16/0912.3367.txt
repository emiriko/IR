Helioseismology has enabled us to better understand the solar interior, while
also allowing us to better constrain solar models. But now is a tremendous
epoch for asteroseismology as space missions dedicated to studying stellar
oscillations have been launched within the last years (MOST and CoRoT). CoRoT
has already proved valuable results for many types of stars, while Kepler,
which was launched in March 2009, will provide us with a huge number of seismic
data very soon. This is an opportunity to better constrain stellar models and
to finally understand stellar structure and evolution. The goal of this
research work is to estimate the global parameters of any solar-like
oscillating target in an automatic manner. We want to determine the global
parameters of the acoustic modes (large separation, range of excited pressure
modes, maximum amplitude, and its corresponding frequency), retrieve the
surface rotation period of the star and use these results to estimate the
global parameters of the star (radius and mass).To prepare the analysis of
hundreds of solar-like oscillating stars, we have developed a robust and
automatic pipeline. The pipeline consists of data analysis techniques, such as
Fast Fourier Transform, wavelets, autocorrelation, as well as the application
of minimisation algorithms for stellar-modelling. We apply our pipeline to some
simulated lightcurves from the asteroFLAG team and the Aarhus-asteroFLAG
simulator, and obtain results that are consistent with the input data to the
simulations. Our strategy gives correct results for stars with magnitudes below
11 with only a few 10% of bad determinations among the reliable results. We
then apply the pipeline to the Sun and three CoRoT targets.In particular we
determine the parameters of the Sun, HD49933, HD181906, and HD181420.
