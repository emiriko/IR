We studied the field dependencies of specific heat coefficient $\gamma(H) =
\lim_{T \rightarrow 0} C(T,H)/T $ and thermal conductivity coefficient $\lim_{T
\rightarrow 0} \kappa(T ,H)/T$ of the $\pm$s-wave state in the mixed state. We
found that it is a generic feature of the two band s-wave state with the
unequal sizes of gaps, small $\Delta_S$ and large $\Delta_L$, that Doppler
shift of the quasiparticle excitations (Volovik effect) creates a finite
density of states, on the extended states outside of vortex cores, proportional
to $H$ in contrast to the $\sqrt{H}$ dependence of the d-wave state. Impurity
scattering effect on the $\pm$s-wave state, however, makes this generic
$H$-linear dependence sublinear approaching to the $\sqrt{H}$ behavior. Our
calculations of $\lim_{T \rightarrow 0} \kappa(T ,H)/T$ successfully fit the
experimental data of Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x )_2$ As$_2$ with different Co-doping
$x$ by systematically varying the gap size ratio $R= |\Delta_S | / |\Delta_L
|$. We also resolve the dilemma of a substantial value of $\gamma(H \rightarrow
0)$ but almost zero value of $\lim_{T \rightarrow 0} \kappa(T ,H \rightarrow
0)/T$, observed in experiments.
