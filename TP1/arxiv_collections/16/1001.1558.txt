The BBGKY hierarchy of equations for a particle interacting with ideal gas is
analyzed in terms of irreducible many-particle correlations between gas atoms
and the particle's motion. The transition to the hard-sphere interaction is
formulated from viewpoint of the recently discovered exact relations connecting
the correlations with the particle's probability distribution. Then the
Boltzmann-Grad limit is considered and shown not to lead to the Bolzmann
hierarchy and the molecular chaos, since correlations of all orders keep
significant.in this limit, merely taking a singular form.
