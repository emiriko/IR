Currently laser cooling schemes are fundamentally based on the weak coupling
regime. This requirement sets the trap frequency as an upper bound to the
cooling rate. In this work we present a numerical study that shows the
feasibility of cooling in the strong coupling regime which then allows cooling
rates that are faster than the trap frequency with state of the art
experimental parameters. The scheme we present can work for trapped atoms or
ions as well as mechanical oscillators. It can also cool medium size ions
chains close to the ground state.
