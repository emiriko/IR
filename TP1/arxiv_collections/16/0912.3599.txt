This paper is about a curious phenomenon. Suppose we have a data matrix,
which is the superposition of a low-rank component and a sparse component. Can
we recover each component individually? We prove that under some suitable
assumptions, it is possible to recover both the low-rank and the sparse
components exactly by solving a very convenient convex program called Principal
Component Pursuit; among all feasible decompositions, simply minimize a
weighted combination of the nuclear norm and of the L1 norm. This suggests the
possibility of a principled approach to robust principal component analysis
since our methodology and results assert that one can recover the principal
components of a data matrix even though a positive fraction of its entries are
arbitrarily corrupted. This extends to the situation where a fraction of the
entries are missing as well. We discuss an algorithm for solving this
optimization problem, and present applications in the area of video
surveillance, where our methodology allows for the detection of objects in a
cluttered background, and in the area of face recognition, where it offers a
principled way of removing shadows and specularities in images of faces.
