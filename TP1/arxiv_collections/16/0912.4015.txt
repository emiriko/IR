Chandra [1] made an attempt to show that the work of Dwivedi and Srivastava
[2] (hereinafter DS) can be investigated even analytically and their results
are erroneous. Dwivedi and Srivastava [3] picked up some values of Chandra [1]
and tried to show that they are not physically acceptable. Some results of
Chandra [1] are not physically acceptable, as these are the outcome of the
wrong approach of DS. However, the results are numerically correct whereas the
results of DS are numerically wrong.
