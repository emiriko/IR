The phase description is a powerful tool for analyzing noisy limit cycle
oscillators. The method, however, has found only limited applications so far,
because the present theory is applicable only to the Gaussian noise while noise
in the real world often has non-Gaussian statistics. Here, we provide the phase
reduction for limit cycle oscillators subject to general, colored and
non-Gaussian, noise including heavy-tailed noise. We derive quantifiers like
mean frequency, diffusion constant, and the Lyapunov exponent to confirm
consistency of the result. Applying our results, we additionally study a
resonance between the phase and noise.
