We present a sample of 484 L dwarfs, 210 of which are newly discovered from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 spectroscopic database. We
combine this sample with known L dwarfs to investigate their $izJHK_S$ colors.
Our spectroscopically selected sample has $\sim$0.1 magnitude bluer median
$J-K_S$ colors at a given spectral type (for L0 to L4) than previously known L
dwarfs, which reflects a bias towards redder L dwarfs in past selection
criteria. We present photometric distance relations based on $i-z$ and $i-J$
colors and derive distances to our L dwarf sample. We combine the distances
with SDSS/2MASS proper motions in order to examine the tangential velocities.
For the majority of our spectroscopic sample, we measured radial velocities and
present three dimensional kinematics. We also provide H$\alpha$ detections for
the fraction of our sample with sufficient quality spectra. Comparison of the
velocities of our L dwarf sample to a kinematic model shows evidence for both
cold and hot dynamical populations, consistent with young and old disk
components. The dispersions of these components are similar to those found for
M dwarfs. We also show that $J-K_S$ color is correlated with velocity
dispersion, confirming a relationship between $J-K_S$ color and age.
