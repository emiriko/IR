In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with conserved R-parity, the
decays of the next-to-lightest neutralino into the lightest neutralino and two
leptons are always involved in each supersymmetric particle decay chain. In
this thesis we calculate one-loop corrections to the two-body decays of the
next-to-lightest neutralino into a lepton and a slepton, which again decays
into another lepton and the lightest neutralino. We also investigate a scenario
where the next-to-lightest neutralino can undergo three-body decays. Not only
the branching ratios of leptonic decay modes, but also the dilepton invariant
mass distribution, are studied. Its endpoint is often used to reconstruct
mass-differences of supersymmetric particles. At one-loop level the branching
ratios of these leptonic decays are increased significantly and the shape of
dilepton invariant mass distribution is altered by the hard photon emission.
