In this paper we investigate the coupling properties of pairs of quadrature
observables, showing that, apart from the Weyl relation, they share the same
coupling properties as the position-momentum pair. In particular, they are
complementary. We determine the marginal observables of a covariant phase space
observable with respect to an arbitrary rotated reference frame, and observe
that these marginal observables are unsharp quadrature observables. The related
distributions constitute the Radon tranform of a phase space distribution of
the covariant phase space observable. Since the quadrature distributions are
the Radon transform of the Wigner function of a state, we also exhibit the
relation between the quadrature observables and the tomography observable, and
show how to construct the phase space observable from the quadrature
observables. Finally, we give a method to measure together with a single
measurement scheme any complementary pair of quadrature observables.
