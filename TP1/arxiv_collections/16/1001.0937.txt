For a given cocharacter mu, mu-admissibility and mu-permissibility are
combinatorial notions introduced by Kottwitz and Rapoport that arise in the
theory of bad reduction of Shimura varieties. In this paper we prove that
mu-admissibility is equivalent to mu-permissibility in all previously unknown
cases of minuscule cocharacters mu in Iwahori-Weyl groups attached to split
orthogonal groups. This, combined with other cases treated previously by
Kottwitz-Rapoport and the author, establishes the equivalence of
mu-admissibility and mu-permissibility for all minuscule cocharacters in split
classical groups, as conjectured by Rapoport.
