We construct quantum stochastic integrals for the integrator being a
martingale in a von Neumann algebra, and the integrand -- a suitable process
with values in the same algebra, as densely defined operators affiliated with
the algebra. In the case of a finite algebra we allow the integrator to be an
$L^2$--martingale in which case the integrals are $L^2$--martingales too.
