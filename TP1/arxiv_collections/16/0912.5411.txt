We investigate neutralino dark matter in supersymmetric flipped SU(5),
focusing on candidates with masses of order 30 - 150 GeV and spin independent
cross sections that are consistent with the most recent CDMS II results. We
assume gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking and restrict the magnitude of
the soft supersymmetry breaking mass parameters to 1 TeV or less. With
non-universal soft gaugino and Higgs masses, and taking flipped SU(5) into
account, we identify allowed regions of the parameter space and highlight some
benchmark solutions including Higgs and sparticle spectroscopy.
