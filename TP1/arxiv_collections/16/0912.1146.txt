We present magnetization ($M$) data of the $d$-metal alloy Ni$_{1-x}$V$_x$ at
vanadium concentrations close to $x_c \approx 11.4%$ where the onset of
long-range ferromagnetic (FM) order is suppressed to zero temperature. Above
$x_c$, the temperature ($T$) and magnetic field ($H$) dependencies of the
magnetization are best described by simple nonuniversal power laws. The
exponents of $M/H \sim T^{-\gamma}$ and $M \sim H^\alpha$ are related by
$1-\gamma=\alpha$ for wide temperature ($10K < T \leq 300K$) and field ($H \leq
5T$) ranges. $\gamma$ is strongly $x$ dependent, decreasing from 1 at $x\approx
x_c$ to $\gamma < 0.1$ for x=15%. This behavior is not compatible with either
classical or quantum critical behavior in a clean 3D FM. Instead it closely
follows the predictions for a quantum Griffiths phase associated with a quantum
phase transition in a disordered metal. Deviations at the lowest temperatures
hint at a freezing of large clusters and the onset of a cluster glass phase,
presumably due to RKKY interactions in this alloy.
