High moments of multiplicity distributions of conserved quantities are
predicted to be sensitive to critical fluctuations. To understand the effect of
the complicated non-critical physics backgrounds on the proposed observable, we
have studied various moments of net-proton distributions with AMPT, Hijing,
Therminator and UrQMD models, in which no QCD critical point physics is
implemented. It is found that the centrality evolution of various moments of
net-proton distributions can be uniformly described by a superposition of
emission sources. In addition, in the absence of critical phenomena, some
moment products of net-proton distribution, related to the baryon number
susceptibilities ratio in Lattice QCD calculation, are predicted to be constant
as a function of the collision centrality. We argue that a non-monotonic
dependence of the moment products as a function collision centrality and the
beam energy may be used to locate the QCD critical point.
