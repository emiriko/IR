Particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE) is a physical effect that is not yet
adequately modelled in Geant4. The current status as in Geant4 9.2 release is
reviewed and new developments are described. The capabilities of the software
prototype are illustrated in application to the shielding of the X-ray
detectors of the eROSITA telescope on the upcoming Spectrum-X-Gamma space
mission.
