Transport coefficients can be obtained from 2-point correlators using the
Kubo formulae. It has been shown that the full leading order result for
electrical conductivity and (QCD) shear viscosity is contained in the re-summed
2-point function that is obtained from the 3-loop 3PI re-summed effective
action. The theory produces all leading order contributions without the
necessity for power counting, and in this sense it provides a natural framework
for the calculation. In this article we study the 4-loop 4PI effective action
for a scalar theory with cubic and quartic interactions in the presence of
spontaneous symmetry breaking. We obtain a set of integral equations that
determine the re-summed 2-point vertex function. A next-to-leading order
contribution to the viscosity could be obtained from this set of coupled
equations.
