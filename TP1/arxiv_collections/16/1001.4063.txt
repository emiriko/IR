A two-layer statistically equivalent periodic unit cell is offered to predict
a macroscopic response of plain weave multilayer carbon-carbon textile
composites. Falling-short in describing the most typical geometrical
imperfections of these material systems the original formulation presented in
(Zeman and \v{S}ejnoha, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 41
(2004), pp. 6549--6571) is substantially modified, now allowing for nesting and
mutual shift of individual layers of textile fabric in all three directions.
Yet, the most valuable asset of the present formulation is seen in the
possibility of reflecting the influence of negligible meso-scale porosity
through a system of oblate spheroidal voids introduced in between the two
layers of the unit cell. Numerical predictions of both the effective thermal
conductivities and elastic stiffnesses and their comparison with available
laboratory data and the results derived using the Mori-Tanaka averaging scheme
support credibility of the present approach, about as much as the reliability
of local mechanical properties found from nanoindentation tests performed
directly on the analyzed composite samples.
