The VERITAS IACT observatory has carried out an extensive survey of the
Cygnus region between 67 and 82 degrees in galactic longitude and between -1
and 4 degrees in galactic latitude. This region is a natural choice for a Very
High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray survey in the Northern Hemisphere, as it contains a
substantial number of potential VHE gamma-ray emitters such as supernova
remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, high-mass X-ray binaries, and massive star
clusters, in addition to a few previously detected VHE gamma-ray sources. It is
also home to a number of GeV gamma-ray sources, including no less than four new
high-significance sources detected in the first six months of Fermi data. The
VERITAS survey, comprising more than 140 hours of observations, reaches an
average VHE point-source flux sensitivity of better than 4% of the Crab Nebula
flux at energies above 200 GeV. Here we report on preliminary results from this
survey, including two source detections, and discuss the prospects for further
studies that would exploit the joint coverage provided by VERITAS and Fermi
data in this region.
