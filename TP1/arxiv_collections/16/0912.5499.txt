We study manipulation of entanglement between two identical networks of
quantum mechanical particles. Firstly, we reduce the problem of entanglement
transfer to the problem of quantum state transfer. Then, we consider
entanglement concentration and purification based on free dynamics on the
networks and local measurements on the vertices. By introducing an appropriate
measure of efficiency, we characterize the performance of the protocol. We give
evidence that such a measure does not depend on the network topology, and we
estimate the contribution given by the number of entangled pairs initially
shared by the two networks.
