To better understand the contribution of cosmic ray muons to the CUORICINO
background, 10 plastic scintillator detectors were installed at the CUORICINO
site and operated during the final 3 months of the experiment. From these
measurements, an upper limit of 0.0021 counts/(keV kg yr) (95% CL) was obtained
on the cosmic ray-induced background in the neutrinoless double beta decay
region of interest. The measurements were also compared to Geant4 simulations.
