Considering an arbitrary, varying equation of the state parameter, the
thermodynamic properties of the dark energy fluid in a semiclassical loop
quantum cosmology scenario, which we consider the inverse volume modification,
is studied. The equation of the state parameters are corrected as a
semiclassical one during considering the effective behavior. Assuming that the
apparent horizon has Hawking temperature, the modified entropy-area relation is
obtained, we find that this relation is different from the one which is
obtained by considering the holonomy correction. Considering the dark energy is
a thermal equilibrium fluid, we get the expressions for modified temperature,
chemical potential and entropy. The temperature, chemical potential and entropy
are well-defined in the semiclassical regions.
