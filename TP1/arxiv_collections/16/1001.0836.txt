We show a practical application of an well-known nonequilibrium relation, the
Jarzynski equality, in quantum computation. Its implementation may open a way
to solve combinatorial optimization problems, minimization of a real
single-valued function, cost function, with many arguments. It has been
disclosed that the ordinary quantum computational algorithm to solve a kind of
hard optimization problems, has a bottleneck that its computational time is
restricted to be extremely slow without relevant errors. However, by our novel
strategy shown in the present study, we might overcome such a difficulty.
