Recent cross section (e,e'pN) short-range correlation experiments have
clearly shown the strong dominance of tensor correlations for (e,e'p) missing
momenta greater than the Fermi momentum; while recent D(e,e'p)n and 4He(e,e'p)t
asymmetry experiments at low missing momentum have shown small changes from the
free nucleon form factor. By doing asymmetry experiments as a function of
missing momentum, these results can be linked together and observed as a change
of sign in the measured asymmetry. This idea will be presented within the
context of the recently completed Jefferson Lab Hall A quasi-elastic, polarized
3He(e,e'N) experiments (N=0,p,n,d) where the asymmetries of several reaction
channels were measured with three, orthogonal target-spin directions. Together,
these various experiments will help us to better understand nucleons in the
nuclear medium.
