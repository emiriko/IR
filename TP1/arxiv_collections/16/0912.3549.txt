A dual-gate graphene field-effect transistors is presented, which shows
improved RF performance by reducing the access resistance using electrostatic
doping. With a carrier mobility of 2700 cm2/Vs, a cutoff frequency of 50 GHz is
demonstrated in a 350-nm gate length device. This fT value is the highest
frequency reported to date for any graphene transistor, and it also exceeds
that of Si MOSFETs at the same gate length, illustrating the potential of
graphene for RF applications.
