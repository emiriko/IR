A permutation is simsun if for all k, the subword of the one-line notation
consisting of the k smallest entries does not have three consecutive decreasing
elements. Simsun permutations were introduced by Simion and Sundaram, who
showed that they are counted by the Euler numbers. In this paper we enumerate
simsun permutations avoiding a pattern or a set of patterns of length 3. The
results involve Motkzin, Fibonacci, and secondary structure numbers. The
techniques in the proofs include generating functions, bijections into lattice
paths and generating trees.
