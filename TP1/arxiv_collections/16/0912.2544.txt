We present near-IR VLT/ISAAC and mid-IR Spitzer/IRS spectroscopy of the young
massive cluster in the W31 star-forming region. H-band spectroscopy provides
refined classifications for four cluster members O stars with respect to Blum
et al. In addition, photospheric features are detected in the massive Young
Stellar Object (mYSO) #26. Spectroscopy permits estimates of stellar
temperatures and masses, from which a cluster age of ~0.6 Myr and distance of
3.3 kpc are obtained, in excellent agreement with Blum et al. IRS spectroscopy
reveals mid-infrared fine structure line fluxes of [Ne II-III] and [S III-IV]
for four O stars and five mYSOs. In common with previous studies, stellar
temperatures of individual stars are severely underestimated from the observed
ratios of fine-structure lines, despite the use of contemporary stellar
atmosphere and photoionization models. We construct empirical temperature
calibrations based upon the W31 cluster stars of known spectral type,
supplemented by two inner Milky Way ultracompact (UC) HII regions whose
ionizing star properties are established. Calibrations involving [NeIII]
15.5um/[NeII] 12.8um, [SIV] 10.5um/[NeII] 12.8um or [ArIII] 9.0um/[NeII] 12.8um
have application in deducing the spectral types of early- to mid- O stars for
other inner Milky Way compact and UCHII regions. Finally, evolutionary phases
and timescales for the massive stellar content in W31 are discussed, due to the
presence of numerous young massive stars at different formation phases in a
`coeval' cluster.
