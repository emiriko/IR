We describe the thermodynamical interpretation of the interaction between new
agegraphic dark energy and dark matter in a non-flat universe. When new
agegraphic dark energy and dark matter evolve separately, each of them remains
in thermodynamic equilibrium. As soon as an interaction between them is taken
into account, their thermodynamical interpretation changes by a stable thermal
fluctuation. We obtain a relation between the interaction term of the dark
components and this thermal fluctuation.
