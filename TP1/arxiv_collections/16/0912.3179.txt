Using high quality graphene pnp junctions, we observe prominent conductance
fluctuations on transitions between quantum Hall (QH) plateaus as the top gate
voltage Vtg is varied. In the Vtg-B plane, the fluctuations form crisscrossing
lines that are parallel to those of the adjacent plateaus, with different
temperature dependences for the conductance peaks and valleys. These
fluctuations arise from Coulomb-induced charging of electron- or hole-doped
localized states when the device bulk is delocalized, underscoring the
importance of electronic interactions in graphene in the QH regime.
