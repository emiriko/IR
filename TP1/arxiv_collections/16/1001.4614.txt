Qubits driven by resonant strong pulses are studied and a parameter regime is
explored in which the dynamics can be solved in closed form. Instantaneous
coherent destruction of tunneling can be seen for longer pulses, whereas
shorter pulses allow a fast preparation of the qubit state. Results are
compared with recent experiments of pulsed nitrogen-vacancy center spin qubits
in diamond.
