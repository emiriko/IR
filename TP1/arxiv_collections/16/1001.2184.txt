We explore the possibilities of current modulation at nano-scale level using
mesoscopic rings. A single mesoscopic ring or an array of such rings is used
for current modulation where each ring is threaded by a time varying magnetic
flux $\phi$ which plays the central role in the modulation action. Within a
tight-binding framework, all the calculations are done based on the Green's
function formalism. We present numerical results for the two-terminal
conductance and current which support the essential features of current
modulation. The analysis may be helpful in fabricating mesoscopic or nano-scale
electronic devices.
