Recently, the CDMS experiment has reported the possible first
direct-detection of dark matter. We update the direct-detection constraints for
neutralino dark matter arising in a realistic string model constructed from
intersecting D6-branes taking into account the recent data from the CDMS
collaboration. We find that there are well-defined regions of the supersymmetry
parameter space where neutralino dark matter satisfying the CDMS and all other
experimental limits may be obtained. This results in a set of distinct
superpartner and Higgs spectra which may be tested at LHC.
