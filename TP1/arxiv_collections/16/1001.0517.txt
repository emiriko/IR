I have analyzed reduced neutron widths ({\Gamma}_{n}^0) for the subset of
1245 resonances in the nuclear data ensemble (NDE) for which they have been
reported. Random matrix theory (RMT) predicts for the Gaussian orthogonal
ensemble (GOE) that these widths should follow a \c{hi}^2 distribution having
one degree of freedom ({\nu}=1) - the Porter Thomas distribution (PTD). Careful
analysis of the {\Gamma}_{n}^2 values in the NDE rejects the validity of the
PTD with a statistical significance of at least 99.97% ({\nu}=0.801\pm0.052).
This striking disagreement with the RMT prediction is most likely due to the
inclusion of significant p-wave contamination to the supposedly pure s-wave
NDE. When an energy dependent threshold is used to remove the p-wave
contamination, the PTD is still rejected with a statistical significance of at
least 98.17% ({\nu}=1.217\pm0.092). Furthermore, examination of the primary
references for the NDE reveals that many resonances in most of the individual
data sets were selected using methods derived from RMT. Therefore, using the
full NDE data set to test RMT predictions seems highly questionable. These
results cast very serious doubt on claims that the NDE represents a striking
confirmation of RMT.
