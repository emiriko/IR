Open charm mesons (pseudo-scalar and scalar as well as axial-vector and
vector) propagating or resting in nuclear matter display an enhanced
sensitivity to the chiral condensate. This offers new prospects to seek for
signals of chiral restoration, in particular in p-A and p-bar-A reactions as
envisaged in first-round experiments by the CBM and PANDA collaborations at
FAIR. Weinberg type sum rules for charming chiral partners are presented, and
the distinct in-medium modifications of open-charm mesons are discussed. We
also address the gluon condensates near Tc and their impact on QCD sum rules.
