Six of the key physics measurements that will be made by the LHCb experiment,
concerning CP asymmetries and rare B decays, are discussed in detail. The "road
map" towards the precision measurements is presented, including the use of
control channels and other techniques to understand the performance of the
detector with the first data from the LHC.
