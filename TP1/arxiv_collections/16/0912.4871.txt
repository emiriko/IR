We derive absolutely anticommuting Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) and
anti-BRST symmetry transformations for the 4D free Abelian 2-form gauge theory
by exploiting the superfield approach to BRST formalism. The antisymmetric
tensor gauge field of the above theory was christened as the "notoph" (i.e. the
opposite of "photon") gauge field by Ogievetsky and Palubarinov way back in
1966-67. We briefly outline the problems involved in obtaining the absolute
anticommutativity of the (anti-) BRST transformations and their resolution
within the framework of geometrical superfield approach to BRST formalism. One
of the highlights of our results is the emergence of a Curci-Ferrari type of
restriction in the context of 4D Abelian 2-form (notoph) gauge theory which
renders the nilpotent (anti-) BRST symmetries of the theory to be absolutely
anticommutative in nature.
