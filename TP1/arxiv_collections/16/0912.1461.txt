There are five known classes of lattice equations that hold in every infinite
dimensional Hilbert space underlying quantum systems: generalised
orthoarguesian, Mayet's E_A, Godowski, Mayet-Godowski, and Mayet's E equations.
We obtain a result which opens a possibility that the first two classes
coincide. We devise new algorithms to generate Mayet-Godowski equations that
allow us to prove that the fourth class properly includes the third. An open
problem related to the last class is answered. Finally, we show some new
results on the Godowski lattices characterising the third class of equations.
