We consider chiral fermions interacting minimally with abelian and
non-abelian gauge fields. Using a path integral approach and exploring the
consequences of a mechanism of symmetry restoration, we show that the gauge
anomaly has null expectation value in the vacuum for both cases (abelian and
non-abelian). We argue that the same mechanism has no possibility to cancel the
chiral anomaly, what eliminates competition between chiral and gauge symmetry
at full quantum level. We also show that the insertion of the gauge anomaly in
arbitrary gauge invariant correlators gives a null result, which points towards
anomaly cancellation in the subspace of physical state vectors.
