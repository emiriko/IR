A brief overview of jets and their central drivers is presented, with a focus
on accreting black hole systems. In particular, scaling relations that
elucidate some basic properties of the engines are derived, and the
implications for the associated outflows are discussed. The kinematics and
dynamics of relativistic jets in various systems and the dissipation of their
bulk energy is considered, with an emphasis on consequences of recent
observations. Also considered is the interaction of the jets with their
environment. Comments on multi-messenger probes are made at the end.
