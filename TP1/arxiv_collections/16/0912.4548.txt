A recently proposed experiment considers the possibility of reaching regimes
where quantum behavior might be observed in nanomechanical systems. This
proposed experiment is examined here for feasibility on the basis of results of
earlier studies identifying a boundary separating obligatory classical behavior
from quantum behavior based on effects dependent on large scale properties of
the universe. Calculations indicate that cosmologically induced effects leading
to a quantum to classical transition will not interfere with the proposed
experiment at the level at which it is described. Thus, this experiment may be
expected to be able to succeed for the case of nanomechanical systems such as
the 50 nanometer radius spheres under consideration; however, the success of
similar experiments for larger micro scale systems may be ruled out.
