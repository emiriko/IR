A thermal atomic beam of dysprosium (Dy) atoms is cooled using the
$4f^{10}6s^2 (J=8) \to 4f^{10}6s6p (J=9)$ transition at 421 nm. The cooling is
done via a standing light wave orthogonal to the atomic beam. Efficient
transverse cooling to the Doppler limit is demonstrated for all observable
isotopes of dysprosium. Branching ratios to metastable states are demonstrated
to be $<5\times10^{-4}$. A scheme for enhancement of the
nonzero-nuclear-spin-isotope cooling, as well as a method for direct
identification of possible trap states, is proposed.
