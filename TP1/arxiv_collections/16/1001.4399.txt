Extreme helium stars are very rare low-mass supergiants in a late stage of
evolution. They are probably contracting to become white dwarfs following a
violent phase of evolution which caused them to become hydrogen-deficient
giants, possibly R CrB stars. Using the latest generation of models for
spherically expanding stellar atmospheres, we set out to measure mass-loss
rates for a representative fraction of these stars. We have used
high-resolution ultraviolet and optical spectra, and ultraviolet, optical and
near-infrared photometry from a variety of archives. Overall atmospheric
parameters have mostly been taken from previous analyses and checked for
consistency. Mass-loss rates were measured by fitting the P-Cygni and
asymmetric profiles of C, N and Si ultraviolet resonance lines and lie in the
range 10^{-10} - 10^{-7} M_{\odot} yr^{-1}. These rates follow a Castor-type
(\dot{M} \propto L^{1.5}) relation marking a lower limit for the mass loss from
hot stars of all kinds. The mass-loss rates of the studied stars also show a
strong correlation with their proximity to the Eddington limit. There is no
firm evidence for variability in the stellar wind, although photospheric
pulsations have been reported in many cases.
