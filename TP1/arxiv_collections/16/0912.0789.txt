It is shown that the Schrodinger symmetry algebra of a free particle in d
spatial dimensions can be embedded into a representation of the higher-spin
algebra. The latter spans an infinite dimensional algebra of higher-order
symmetry generators of the free Schrodinger equation. An explicit
representation of the maximal finite dimensional subalgebra of the higher spin
algebra is given in terms of non-relativistic generators. We show also how to
convert Vasiliev's equations into an explicit non-relativistic covariant form,
such that they might apply to non-relativistic systems. Our procedure reveals
that the space of solutions of the Schrodinger equation can be regarded also as
a supersymmetric module.
