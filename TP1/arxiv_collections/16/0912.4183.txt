Turbulent scaling phenomena are studied in an ultracold Bose gas away from
thermal equilibrium. Fixed points of the dynamical evolution are characterized
in terms of universal scaling exponents of correlation functions. The scaling
behavior is determined analytically in the framework of quantum field theory,
using a nonperturbative approximation of the two-particle irreducible effective
action. While perturbative Kolmogorov scaling is recovered at higher energies,
scaling solutions with anomalously large exponents arise in the infrared regime
of the turbulence spectrum. The extraordinary enhancement in the momentum
dependence of long-range correlations could be experimentally accessible in
dilute ultracold atomic gases. Such experiments have the potential to provide
insight into dynamical phenomena directly relevant also in other present-day
focus areas like heavy-ion collisions and early-universe cosmology.
