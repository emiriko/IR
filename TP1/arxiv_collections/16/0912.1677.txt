We theoretically study the internal Josephson effect, which is driven by spin
exchange interactions and magnetic dipole-dipole interactions, in a three-level
system for spin-1 Bose--Einstein condensates, obtaining novel spin dynamics. We
introduce single spatial mode approximations into the Gross--Pitaevskii
equations and derive the Josephson type equations, which are analogous to
tunneling currents through three junctions between three superconductors. From
an analogy with two interacting nonrigid pendulums, we identify unique varied
oscillational modes, called the 0--$\pi$, 0--$running$, $running$--$running$,
$2n\pi & running$--$2\pi$, $single nonrigid pendulum$, and $two rigid
pendulums$ phase modes. These Josephson modes in the three states are expected
to be found in real atomic Bose gas systems.
