In addition to the double phase transition (with the Curie temperatures
T_C=300K and T_{Ct}=144K), a low-temperature anomaly in the dependence of the
magnetization is observed in the bulk magnetic graphite (with an average
granular size of L=10nm), which is attributed to manifestation of the size
effects below the quantum temperature. The best fits of the high-temperature
data (using the mean-field Curie-Weiss and Bloch expressions) produced
reasonable estimates for the model parameters, such as defects mediated
effective spin exchange energy J=12meV (which defines the intragranular Curie
temperature T_C) and proximity mediated interactions between neighboring grains
(through potential barriers created by thin layers of non-magnetic graphite)
with energy J_t=exp(-d/s)J=5.8meV (which defines the intergranular Curie
temperature T_{Ct}) with d=1.5nm and s=2nm being the intergranular distance and
characteristic length, respectively.
