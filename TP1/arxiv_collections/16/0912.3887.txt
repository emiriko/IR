The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has provided the measurement of the high
energy cosmic ray electrons plus positrons (CRE) spectrum with unprecedented
accuracy form 20 GeV to 1 TeV. Recently this range has been extended down to ~
7 GeV. The spectrum shows no prominent features and it is significantly harder
than that inferred from several previous experiments. While the reported
Fermi-LAT data alone may be interpreted in terms of a single (electron
dominated) Galactic component, when combined with other complementary
experimental results, specifically the CRE spectrum measured by H.E.S.S., and
especially the positron fraction measured by PAMELA, an additional electron and
positron component seems to be required. We show that the acceleration of
electron-positron pairs in Galactic pulsars may offer a natural (though not
unique) interpretation of all those results.
