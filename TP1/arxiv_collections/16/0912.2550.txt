We present a new distributed algorithm for state space minimization modulo
branching bisimulation. Like its predecessor it uses signatures for refinement,
but the refinement process and the signatures have been optimized to exploit
the fact that the input graph contains no tau-loops.
  The optimization in the refinement process is meant to reduce both the number
of iterations needed and the memory requirements. In the former case we cannot
prove that there is an improvement, but our experiments show that in many cases
the number of iterations is smaller. In the latter case, we can prove that the
worst case memory use of the new algorithm is linear in the size of the state
space, whereas the old algorithm has a quadratic upper bound.
  The paper includes a proof of correctness of the new algorithm and the
results of a number of experiments that compare the performance of the old and
the new algorithms.
