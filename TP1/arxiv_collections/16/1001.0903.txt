Let $G$ be a group and $X$ be a $G$-space. A subset $F$ of $X$ is called a
kaleidoscopical configuration if there exists a surjective coloring $\chi:X\to
Y$ such that the restriction of $\chi$ on each subset $gF$, $g\in G$ is a
bijection. We give some constructions of kaleidoscopical configurations in an
arbitrary $G$-space, develop some kaleidoscopical technique for Abelian groups
(considered as $G$-spaces with the action $(g,x)\mapsto g+x$), and describe
kaleidoscopical configurations in the cyclic groups of order $N=p^m$ or
$N=p_1... p_k$ where $p$ is prime and $p_1,...,p_k$ are distinct primes.
  Let $G$ be a group and $X$ be a $G$-space. A subset $F$ of $X$ is called a
kaleidoscopical configuration if there exists a coloring $\chi:X\rightarrow C$
such that the restriction of $\chi$ on each subset $gF$, $g\in G$, is a
bijection. We present a construction (called the splitting construction) of
kaleidoscopical configurations in an arbitrary $G$-space, reduce the problem of
characterization of kaleidoscopical configurations in a finite Abelian group
$G$ to a factorization of $G$ into two subsets, and describe all
kaleidoscopical configurations in isometrically homogeneous ultrametric spaces
with finite distance scale. Also we construct $2^c$ (unsplittable)
kaleidoscopical configurations of cardinality continuum in the Euclidean space
$R^n$.
