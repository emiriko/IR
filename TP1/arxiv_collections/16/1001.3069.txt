We go beyond the Standard Model guided by presymmetry, the discrete
electroweak quark-lepton symmetry hidden by topological effects which explain
quark fractional charges as in condensed matter physics. We show that partners
of the particles of the Standard Model and the discrete symmetry associated
with this partnership appear as manifestations of a residual presymmetry in the
sense of Ekstein and its extension from matter to forces. This duplication of
the spectrum of the Standard Model keeps spin and comes nondegenerated about
the TeV scale.
