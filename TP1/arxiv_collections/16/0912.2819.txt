Quantum operators of coordinates and momentum components of a particle in the
Minkowski spacetime can belong to the generalized Snyder-Yang algebra and
produce a quantum phase space with three new constants in the general case.
With account for the O(2,6) invariance in the quantum phase space of a color
particle the equation of motion is obtained, which contains a oscillator rising
potential. The presence of the oscillator potential can simulate a confinement
of a color particle. A parameter of the oscillator potential is estimated and a
relationship between current and constituent quark masses is obtained.
