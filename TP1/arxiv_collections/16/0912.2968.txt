In this review, I briefly summarize the present status of experimental and
theoretical investigations of the properties of matter under conditions
characteristic of planetary interiors, from terrestrial to jovian planets. I
first focus on the two lightest elements, hydrogen and helium, and discuss
recent theoretical and experimental investigations of their properties at high
pressure and temperature. Then, I discuss the impact of these properties, as
well as of the equation of state of heavier elements, on planetary interiors.
Finally, I highlight the importance of exoplanet transit observations and of
the inferred mass-radius relationships to determine the planetary interior
compositions.
