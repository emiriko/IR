We study a diagonal 2-orbital ladder model of the Fe based superconductors
using the density matrix renormalization group method. At half filling, we find
a close competition between a "spin-striped" state and a non-collinear
"spin-checkerboard" state, as well as significant nematic correlations. Upon
finite hole or electron doping, the dominant pairing correlations are found to
have A$_{1,g}$ ($S-$wave) symmetry.
