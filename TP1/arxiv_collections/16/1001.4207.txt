Perturbative relations between pole and running heavy quark masses, defined
in the Minkowski regions, are considered. Special attention is paid to the
appearance of the kinematic $\pi^2$-effects, which exist in the coefficients of
these series. The estimates of order $O(\alpha_s^4)$ QCD corrections are
presented.
