A fragmenting relativistic string is widely used for modelling particle
production via quark-gluon strings formed in hadron inelastic interactions of
high energies. In this note we focus on motion and fragmentation of
relativistic string with non-zero transverse separation of its ends and study
this scenario as a possible mechanism bringing anisotropy into the asimuthal
angle disribution of produced particles in inelastic interactions of hadrons.
