We look into the concept of electric charge quantization in the Standard
Model. The role of the vector nature of electromagnetism and that of mass
generation by Yukawa coupling is studied. We show how the baryon and the lepton
numbers arise naturally in this picture. This points to an unambiguous and
fundamental understanding of the actual nature of the right-handed neutrino.
This conforms to Wigner's analysis of the irreducible representations of the
Poincare group.
