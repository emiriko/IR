Cylindrically-symmetric solutions in Conformal Gravity are investigated and
several new solutions are presented and discussed. Among them, a family of
vacuum solutions, generalizations of the Melvin solution and cosmic strings of
the Abelian Higgs model. The Melvin-like solutions have finite energy per unit
length, while the string-like solutions do not.
