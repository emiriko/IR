We establish a construction of optimal authentication codes achieving perfect
multi-fold secrecy by means of combinatorial designs. This continues the
author's work (ISIT 2009) and answers an open question posed therein. As an
application, we present the first infinite class of optimal codes that provide
two-fold security against spoofing attacks and at the same time perfect two-
fold secrecy.
