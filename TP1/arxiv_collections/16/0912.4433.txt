We experimentally demonstrate the compatibility of wavelength multiplexed
active polarization stabilization for quantum communication in an optical fiber
carrying telecom traffic. One of the feedback control channels contains a 9.953
Gb/s data stream generated from a BER meter. We verify the ability to transmit
single-photons in the two opposite directions of a 23 km optical fiber spool,
while maintaining their state of polarization stable and a classical BER in the
feedback channel error-free, during 6 hours of continuous operation.
