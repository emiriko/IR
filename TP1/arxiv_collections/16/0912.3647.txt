In the popular littlest Higgs model, T-parity can be broken by
Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) terms induced by a strongly coupled UV completion. On
the other hand, certain models with multiple scalar multiplets (called moose
models) permit the implementation of an exchange symmetry (X-parity) such that
it is not broken by the WZW terms. Here we present a concrete and realistic
construction of such a model. The little Higgs model with X-Parity is a
concrete and realistic implementation of this idea. In this contribution, the
properties of the model are reviewed and the collider phenomenology is
discussed in some detail. We also present new results on the decay properties
and LHC signatures of the light triplet scalars that are predicted by this
model.
