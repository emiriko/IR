We obtain the QCD quark condensate from consideration of unquenched quark
dynamics in Dyson-Schwinger gluon vacuum. We consider the non-local extension
of the condensate and determine the quark virtuality. We also obtain the
condensate-driven contribution of the non-perturbative QCD to Euler--Heisenberg
Lagrangian of QED in external electromagnetic fields.
