"Schrodinger's cat" is a gedankenexperiment intended to highlight conceptual
difficulties in the interpretation of quantum mechanics. The generation of
'cat-like' states is central to numerous quantum information protocols. In
particular, much attention has been drawn by states containing N photons in a
superposition of all being in one of two designated modes. These maximally path
entangled states, known as 'NOON' states, exhibit enhanced phase sensitivity
and allow reaching the fundamental quantum limit of precision measurement. Such
states could also be used for obtaining 'super-resolution' in quantum
lithography. Creation of NOON states in the lab, has been limited to N=3.
Surpassing this has proven a formidable experimental challenge. Here, we
realize a scheme for generation of high fidelity NOON states with arbitrarily
large N. We demonstrate the versatility of the scheme by measuring up to N=5 in
a single setup, this is in contrast to previous experiments which were
custom-designed for a specific N. The scheme is based on high order
interference between 'quantum' down-converted light and 'classical' coherent
light in the photon number basis. Our results verify the high degree of path
entanglement which emerges naturally from the interference of two ubiquitous,
easy to generate, states of light.
