Open quantum system interacting with structured environment is important and
manifests non- Markovian behavior, which was conventionally studied using
quantum trajectory stochastic method. In this paper, by dividing the effects of
the environment into two parts, we propose a deterministic method without using
quantum trajectory. This method is more efficient and accurate than stochastic
method in most Markovian and non-Markovian cases. We also extend this method to
the generalized Lindblad master equation.
