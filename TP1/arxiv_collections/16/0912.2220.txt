The mixing of the quasifission component to the fissionlike cross section
causes ambiguity in the quantitative estimation of the complete fusion cross
section from the observed angular and mass distributions of the binary
products. We show that the partial cross section of quasifission component of
binary fragments covers the whole range of the angular momentum values leading
to capture. The calculated angular momentum distributions for the compound
nucleus and dinuclear system going to quasifission may overlap: competition
between complete fusion and quasifission takes place at all values of initial
orbital angular momentum. Quasifission components formed at large angular
momentum of the dinuclear system can show isotropic angular distribution and
their mass distribution can be in mass symmetric region similar to the
characteristics of fusion-fission components. As result the unintentional
inclusion of the quasifission contribution into the fusion-fission fragment
yields can lead to overestimation of the probability of the compound nucleus
formation.
