In this study, we investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of
graphane nanoribbons. We find that zigzag and armchair graphane nanoribbons
with H-passivated edges are nonmagnetic semiconductors. While bare armchair
ribbons are also nonmagnetic, adjacent dangling bonds of bare zigzag ribbons
have antiferromagnetic ordering at the same edge. Band gaps of the H-passivated
zigzag and armchair nanoribbons exponentially depend on their width. Detailed
analysis of adsorption of C, O, Si, Pt, Ti, V and Fe atoms on the graphane
ribbon surface reveal that functionalization of graphane ribbons is possible
via these adatoms. It is found that C, O, V and Pt atoms have tendency to
replace H atoms of graphane. We showed that significant spin polarizations in
graphane can be achieved through creation of domains of H-vacancies and
CH-divacancies.
