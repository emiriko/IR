The ever-expanding catalog of detected super-Earths calls for theoretical
studies of their properties in the case of a substantial water layer. This work
considers such water planets with a range of masses and water mass fractions (2
to 5 M_Earth, 0.02% to 50% H2 O). First, we model the thermal and dynamical
structure of the near-surface for icy and oceanic surfaces, finding separate
regimes where the planet is expected to maintain a subsurface liquid ocean and
where it is expected to exhibit ice tectonics. Newly discovered exoplanets may
be placed into one of these regimes given estimates of surface temperature,
heat flux, and gravity. Second, we construct a parameterized convection model
for the underlying ice mantle of higher ice phases, finding that materials
released from the silicate iron core should traverse the ice mantle on the
timescale of 0.1 to 100 megayears. We present the dependence of the overturn
times of the ice mantle and the planetary radius on total mass and water mass
fraction. Finally, we discuss the implications of these internal processes on
atmospheric observables.
