Recently,the principle of nonviolation of information causality [Nature
461,1101 (2009)], has been proposed as one of the foundational properties of
nature. We explore the Hardy's nonlocality theorem for two qubit systems, in
the context of generalised probability theory, restricted by the principle of
nonviolation of information causality. Applying, a sufficient condition for
information causality violation, we derive an upper bound on the maximum
success probability of Hardy's nonlocality argument. We find that the bound
achieved here is higher than that allowed by quantum mechanics,but still much
less than what the nosignaling condition permits. We also study the Cabello
type nonlocality argument (a generalization of Hardy's argument) in this
context.
