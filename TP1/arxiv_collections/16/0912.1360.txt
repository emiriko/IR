In this note we consider a branching Brownian motion (BBM) on $\mathbb{R}$ in
which a particle at spatial position $y$ splits into two at rate $\beta y^2$,
where $\beta>0$ is a constant. This is a critical breeding rate for BBM in the
sense that the expected population size blows up in finite time while the
population size remains finite, almost surely, for all time. We find an
asymptotic for the almost sure rate of growth of the population.
