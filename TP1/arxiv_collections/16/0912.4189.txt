Epidemic spreading of infectious diseases is ubiquitous and has often
considerable impact on public health and economic wealth. The large variability
in spatio-temporal patterns of epidemics prohibits simple interventions and
demands for a detailed analysis of each epidemic with respect to its infectious
agent and the corresponding routes of transmission. To facilitate this
analysis, a mathematical framework is introduced which links epidemic patterns
to the topology and dynamics of the underlying transmission network. The
evolution both in disease prevalence and transmission network topology are
derived from a closed set of partial differential equations for infections
without recovery which are in excellent agreement with complementarily
conducted agent based simulations. The mutual influence between the epidemic
process and its transmission network is shown by several case studies on HIV
epidemics in synthetic populations. They reveal context dependent key processes
which drive the epidemic and which in turn can be exploited for targeted
intervention strategies. The mathematical framework provides a capable toolbox
to analyze epidemics from first principles. This allows for fast in silico
modeling - and manipulation - of epidemics which is especially powerful if
complemented with adequate empirical data for parametrization.
