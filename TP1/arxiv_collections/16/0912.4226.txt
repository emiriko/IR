We study systems of equations of the form X1 = f1(X1, ..., Xn), ..., Xn =
fn(X1, ..., Xn), where each fi is a polynomial with nonnegative coefficients
that add up to 1. The least nonnegative solution, say mu, of such equation
systems is central to problems from various areas, like physics, biology,
computational linguistics and probabilistic program verification. We give a
simple and strongly polynomial algorithm to decide whether mu=(1, ..., 1)
holds. Furthermore, we present an algorithm that computes reliable sequences of
lower and upper bounds on mu, converging linearly to mu. Our algorithm has
these features despite using inexact arithmetic for efficiency. We report on
experiments that show the performance of our algorithms.
