Mirror dark matter offers a framework to explain the existing dark matter
direct detection experiments, including the impressive DAMA annual modulation
signal. Here we examine the implications of mirror dark matter for experiments
like CDMSII/Ge and XENON10 which feature higher recoil energy threshold than
the DAMA NaI experiments. We show that the two events seen in the CDMSII/Ge
experiment are consistent with the interactions of the anticipated heavy $\sim
Fe'$ component. This interpretation of the CDMSII/Ge events is a natural one
given that a) mirror dark matter predicts an event rate which is sharply
falling with respect to recoil energy and b) that the two observed events are
in the low energy region near threshold. Importantly this interpretation of the
CDMSII events can be checked by on-going and future experiments, and we hereby
predict that the bulk of the events will be in the $E_R \stackrel{<}{\sim} 18$
keV region.
