It has been shown that complete complementary codes can be applied into some
communication systems like approximately synchronized CDMA systems because of
its good correlation properties. CT-CDMA is one of the communication systems
based on complete complementary codes. In this system, the information data of
the multiple users can be transmitted by using the same set of complementary
codes through a single frequency band. In this paper, we propose to apply
CT-CDMA systems into a kind of steganography. It is shown that a large amount
of secret data can be embedded in the stego image by the proposed method
through some numerical experiments using color images.
