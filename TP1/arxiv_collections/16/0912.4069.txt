Within the framework of the dinuclear system (DNS) model, production cross
sections of new superheavy nuclei with charged numbers Z=108-114 are analyzed
systematically. Possible combinations based on the actinide nuclides $^{238}$U,
$^{244}$Pu and $^{248,250}$Cm with the optimal excitation energies and
evaporation channels are pointed out to synthesize new isotopes which lie
between the nuclides produced in the cold fusion and the $^{48}$Ca induced
fusion reactions experimentally, which are feasible to be constructed
experimentally. It is found that the production cross sections of superheavy
nuclei decrease drastically with the charged numbers of compound nuclei. Larger
mass asymmetries of the entrance channels enhance the cross sections in 2n-5n
channels.
