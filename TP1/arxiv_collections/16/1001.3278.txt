We propose two supersymmetric Standard Models (SMs) with decaying and stable
dark matter (DM) particles. To explain the SM fermion masses and mixings and
have a heavy decay DM particle S, we consider the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism by
introducing an anomalous U(1)_X gauge symmetry. Around the string scale, the
U(1)_X gauge symmetry is broken down to a Z_2 symmetry under which S is odd
while all the SM particles are even. S obtains a vacuum expectation value
around the TeV scale, and then it can three-body decay dominantly to the
second/third family of the SM leptons in Model I and to the first family of the
SM leptons in Model II. Choosing a benchmark point in the constrained minimal
supersymmetric SM with exact R parity, we show that the lightest neutralino DM
is consistent with the CDMS II experiment. Considering S three-body decay and
choosing suitable parameters, we show that the PAMELA and Fermi-LAT experiments
and the PAMELA and ATIC experiments can be explained in Model I and Model II,
respectively.
