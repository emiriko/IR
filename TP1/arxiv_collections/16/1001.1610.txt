A theory, graphical notation, mathematical calculus and implementation for
finding whether two given expressions can, at execution time, denote references
attached to the same object. Intended as the basis for a comprehensive solution
to the "frame problem" and as a complement to, or even a replacement for,
separation logic, shape analysis, ownership types and dynamic frames.
