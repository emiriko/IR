We calculate the tunneling process of a Dirac particle across two square
barriers separated a distance $d$, as well as the scattering by a double cusp
barrier where the centers of the cusps are separated a distance larger than
their screening lengths. Using the scattering matrix formalism, we obtain the
transmission and reflection amplitudes for the scattering processes of both
configurations. We show that, the presence of transmission resonances modifies
the Lorentizian shape of the energy resonances and induces the appearance of
additional maxima in the transmission coefficient in the range of energies
where transmission resonances occur. We calculate the Wigner time-delay and
show how their maxima depend on the position of the transmission resonance.
