We review the analysis of the Cosmic Web by means of an extensive toolset
based on the use of Delaunay and Voronoi tessellations. The Cosmic Web is the
salient and pervasive foamlike pattern in which matter has organized itself on
scales of a few up to more than a hundred Megaparsec. First, we describe the
Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator (DTFE). The DTFE formalism is shown to
recover the hierarchical nature and the anisotropic morphology of the cosmic
matter distribution. The Multiscale Morphology Filter (MMF) uses the DTFE
density field to extract the diverse morphological elements - filaments, sheets
and clusters - on the basis of a ScaleSpace analysis which searches for these
morphologies over a range of scales. Subsequently, we discuss the Watershed
Voidfinder (WVF), which invokes the discrete watershed transform to identify
voids in the cosmic matter distribution. The WVF is able to determine the
location, size and shape of the voids. The watershed transform is also a key
element in the SpineWeb analysis of the cosmic matter distribution. It allows
the determination of the filamentary spine and connected walls in the cosmic
matter density field through the identification of the singularities and
corresponding separatrices. Finally, we describe the concept of Alphashapes for
assessing the topology of the cosmic matter distribution.
