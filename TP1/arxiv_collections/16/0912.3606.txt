We present results from numerical solution of Einstein's equation in five
dimensions describing evolution of rapidly rotating black holes. We show, for
the first time, that the rapidly rotating black holes in higher dimensions are
unstable against nonaxisymmetric deformation; for the five-dimensional case,
the critical value of spin parameter for onset of the instability is $\approx
0.87$.
