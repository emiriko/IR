Exact wormhole solutions, while eagerly sought after, often have the
appearance of being overly specialized or highly artificial. A case for the
possible existence of traversable wormholes would be more compelling if an
abundance of solutions could be found. It is shown in this note that for many
of the wormhole geometries in the literature, the exact solutions obtained
imply the existence of large sets of additional solutions.
