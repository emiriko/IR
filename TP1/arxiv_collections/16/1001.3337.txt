High resolution optical spectra of 57 Galactic B-type supergiant stars have
been analyzed to determine their rotational and macroturbulent velocities. In
addition, their atmospheric parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity
and microturbulent velocity) and surface nitrogen abundances have been
estimated using a non-LTE grid of model atmospheres. Comparisons of the
projected rotational velocities have been made with the predictions of stellar
evolutionary models and in general good agreement was found. However for a
small number of targets, their observed rotational velocities were
significantly larger than predicted, although their nitrogen abundances were
consistent with the rest of the sample. We conclude that binarity may have
played a role in generating their large rotational velocities. No correlation
was found between nitrogen abundances and the current projected rotational
velocities. However a correlation was found with the inferred projected
rotational velocities of the main sequence precursors of our supergiant sample.
This correlation is again in agreement with the predictions of single star
evolutionary models that incorporate rotational mixing. The origin of the
macroturbulent and microturbulent velocity fields is discussed and our results
support previous theoretical studies that link the former to sub-photospheric
convection and the latter to non-radial gravity mode oscillations. In addition,
we have attempted to identify differential rotation in our most rapidly
rotating targets.
