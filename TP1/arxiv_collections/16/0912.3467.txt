We propose a method to derive the line-of-sight magnetic flux density from
measurements in the chromospheric Ca II IR line at 854.2 nm. The method
combines two well-understood techniques, the center-of-gravity and bisector
methods, in a single hybrid technique. The technique is tested with
magneto-static simulations of a flux tube. We apply the method to observations
with the Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer (IBIS) installed at the
Dunn Solar Telescope of the NSO/SP to investigate the morphology of the lower
chromosphere, with focus on the chromospheric counterparts to the underlying
photospheric magnetic flux elements.
