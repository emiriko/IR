We construct the most general, relativistically invariant, contact Lagrangian
at order Q^2 in the power counting, Q denoting the low momentum scale. A
complete, but non-minimal, set of (contact) interaction terms is identified,
which upon non-relativistic reduction generate 2 leading independent operator
combinations of order Q^0 and 7 sub-leading ones of order Q^2 - a result
derived previously in the heavy-baryon formulation of effective field theories
(EFT's). We show that Poincare covariance of the theory requires that
additional terms with fixed coefficients be included, in order to describe the
two-nucleon potential in reference frames other than the center-of-mass frame.
These terms will contribute in systems with mass number A>2, and their impact
on EFT calculations of binding energies and scattering observables in these
systems should be studied.
