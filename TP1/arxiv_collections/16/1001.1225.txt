Recent studies introduced biased (degree-dependent) edge percolation as a
model for failures in real-life systems. In this work, such process is applied
to networks consisting of two types of nodes with edges running only between
nodes of unlike type. Such bipartite graphs appear in many social networks, for
instance in affiliation networks and in sexual contact networks in which both
types of nodes show the scale-free characteristic for the degree distribution.
During the depreciation process, an edge between nodes with degrees k and q is
retained with probability proportional to (kq)^(-alpha), where alpha is
positive so that links between hubs are more prone to failure. The removal
process is studied analytically by introducing a generating functions theory.
We deduce exact self-consistent equations describing the system at a
macroscopic level and discuss the percolation transition. Critical exponents
are obtained by exploiting the Fortuin-Kasteleyn construction which provides a
link between our model and a limit of the Potts model.
