We trap atoms in versatile two-dimensional (2D) arrays of optical potentials,
prepare flexible 2D spin configurations, perform site-selective coherent
manipulation, and demonstrate the implementation of simultaneous measurements
of different system properties, such as dephasing and decoherence. This novel
approach for the flexible manipulation of atomic quantum systems is based on
the combination of 2D arrays of microlenses and 2D arrays of liquid crystal
light modulators. It offers novel types of control for the investigation of
quantum degenerate gases, quantum information processing, and quantum
simulations.
