The OPE of local operators in the presence of defect lines is considered both
in the rational CFT and the $c>25$ Virasoro (Liouville) theory. The duality
transformation of the 4-point function with inserted defect operators is
explicitly computed. The two channels of the correlator reproduce the
expectation values of the Wilson and 't Hooft operators, recently discussed in
Liouville theory in relation to the AGT conjecture.
