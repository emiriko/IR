In this note we present some recent results for Kirchhoff equations in
generalized Gevrey spaces. We show that these spaces are the natural framework
where classical results can be unified and extended. In particular we focus on
existence and uniqueness results for initial data whose regularity depends on
the continuity modulus of the nonlinear term, both in the strictly hyperbolic
case, and in the degenerate hyperbolic case.
