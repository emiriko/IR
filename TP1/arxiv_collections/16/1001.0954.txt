Starting from Stratton-Panofsky-Phillips-Jefimenko equations for the electric
and magnetic fields generated by completely arbitrary charge and current
density distributions at rest, we derive far-zone approximations for the
fields, containing all components, dominant as well as sub-dominant. Using
these approximate formulas, we derive general formulas for the total
electromagnetic linear momentum and angular momentum, valid at large distances
from arbitrary, non-moving charge and current sources.
