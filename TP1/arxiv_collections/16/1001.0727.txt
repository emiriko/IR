We present a solitary wave solution of the generalized nonlinear Schrodinger
equation for dispersive permittivity and permeability using a scaling
transformation and coupled amplitude-phase formulation. We have considered the
third-order dispersion effect (TOD) into our model and show that soliton shift
may be suppressed in a negative index material by a judicious choice of the TOD
and self-steepening parameter.
