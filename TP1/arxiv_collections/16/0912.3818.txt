A search of the literature reveals that none of the five new optical effects
predicted by the special theory of relativity have ever been observed to occur
in nature. In particular, the speed of light (c) has never been measured
directly with a moving detector to validate the invariance of c to motion of
the observer, a necessary condition for the Lorentz invariance of c. The
invariance of c can now only be inferred from indirect experimental evidence.
It is also not widely recognized that essentially all of the experimental
support for special relativity in the photon sector consists of null results.
The experimental basis for special relativity in the photon sector is
summarized, and concerns about the completeness, integrity and interpretation
of the present body of experimental evidence are discussed.
