We study a two-dimensional electron system where the electrons occupy two
conduction band valleys with anisotropic Fermi contours and strain-tunable
occupation. We observe persistent quantum Hall states at filling factors $\nu =
1/3$ and 5/3 even at zero strain when the two valleys are degenerate. This is
reminiscent of the quantum Hall ferromagnet formed at $\nu = 1$ in the same
system at zero strain. In the absence of a theory for a system with anisotropic
valleys, we compare the energy gaps measured at $\nu = 1/3$ and 5/3 to the
available theory developed for single-valley, two-spin systems, and find that
the gaps and their rates of rise with strain are much smaller than predicted.
