The gamma-ray survey of the sky by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope offers
both opportunities and challenges for multiwavelength and multi-messenger
studies. Gamma-ray bursts, pulsars, binary sources, flaring Active Galactic
Nuclei, and Galactic transient sources are all phenomena that can best be
studied with a wide variety of instruments simultaneously or contemporaneously.
Identification of newly-discovered gamma-ray sources is largely a
multiwavelength effort. From the gamma-ray side, a principal challenge is the
latency from the time of an astrophysical event to the recognition of this
event in the data. Obtaining quick and complete multiwavelength coverage of
gamma-ray sources can be difficult both in terms of logistics and in terms of
generating scientific interest. The Fermi LAT team continues to welcome
cooperative efforts aimed at maximizing the scientific return from the mission
through multiwavelength studies.
