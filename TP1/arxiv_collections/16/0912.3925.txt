Fingerprinting is a well known technique, which is often used in designing
Monte Carlo algorithms for verifying identities involving ma- trices, integers
and polynomials. The book by Motwani and Raghavan [1] shows how this technique
can be applied to check the correctness of matrix multiplication -- check if AB
= C where A, B and C are three nxn matrices. The result is a Monte Carlo
algorithm running in time $Theta(n^2)$ with an exponentially decreasing error
probability after each indepen- dent iteration. In this paper we give a simple
alternate proof addressing the same problem. We also give further
generalizations and relax various assumptions made in the proof.
