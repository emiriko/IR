Supersymmetric QED hydrogen-like bound states are remarkably similar to
non-supersymmetric hydrogen, including an accidental degeneracy of the fine
structure and which is broken by the Lamb shift. This article classifies the
states, calculates the leading order spectrum, and illustrates the results in
several limits. The relation to other non-relativistic bound states is
explored.
