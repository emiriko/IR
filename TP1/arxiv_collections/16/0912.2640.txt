We demonstrate an electrically controlled high-spin (S=5/2) to low-spin
(S=1/2) transition in a three-terminal device incorporating a single Mn2+ ion
coordinated by two terpyridine ligands. By adjusting the gate-voltage we reduce
the terpyridine moiety and thereby strengthen the ligand-field on the Mn-atom.
Adding a single electron thus stabilizes the low-spin configuration and the
corresponding sequential tunnelling current is suppressed by spin-blockade.
  From low-temperature inelastic cotunneling spectroscopy, we infer the
magnetic excitation spectrum of the molecule and uncover also a strongly
gate-dependent singlet-triplet splitting on the low-spin side. The measured
bias-spectroscopy is shown to be consistent with an exact diagonalization of
the Mn-complex, and an interpretation of the data is given in terms of a
simplified effective model.
