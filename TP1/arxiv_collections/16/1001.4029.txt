We summarise the new conformal framework of an Anisotropic Future Endless
Universe and an Anisotropic Future Singularity. Both new definitions are
motivated by, but not restricted to quiescent cosmology and the Weyl curvature
hypothesis, which previously only possessed a framework for a classical initial
state of the universe, namely the Isotropic Singularity. Some of the features
of the framework are briefly discussed.
