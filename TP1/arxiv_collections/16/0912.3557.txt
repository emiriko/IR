Equations for the neutron reflection amplitude from a magnetic non-collinear
wave resonator (NWR) are obtained. It is shown that resonances of the same
reflection order of neutrons experiencing spin-flip (spin-flip neutrons) appear
in pairs. Conditions under which in the resonator square enhancement of the
spin-flip neutron reflection intensity with respect to growth of the portion of
scattered and absorbed neutrons takes place, are determined.
