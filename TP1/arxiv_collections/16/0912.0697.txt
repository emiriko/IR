We present a detailed study of partial-wave contributions of nuclear forces
to pairing in nuclei. For T=1, J=0 pairing, partial waves beyond the standard
1S0 channel play an interesting role for the pair formation in nuclei. The
additional contributions are dominated by the repulsive 3P1 partial wave. Their
effects, and generally spin-triplet nuclear forces between paired nucleons, are
influenced by the interplay of spin-orbit partners. We explore the impact of
including partial waves beyond the 1S0 channel on neutron-neutron pairing gaps
in semi-magic isotopic chains. In addition, we show that nuclear forces favor
T=1, J=0 over T=0, J=1 pairing, except in low-j orbitals. This is in contrast
to the free-space motivation that suggests the formation of deuteron-like T=0
pairs in N=Z nuclei. The suppression of T=0 pairing is because the 3S1 strength
is distributed on spin-orbit partners and because of the effects of the
repulsive 1P1 channel and of D waves.
