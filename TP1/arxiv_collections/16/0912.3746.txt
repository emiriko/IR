Gravitational-wave signals from inspirals of binary compact objects (black
holes and neutron stars) are primary targets of the ongoing searches by
ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) interferometers (LIGO, Virgo, and
GEO-600). We present parameter-estimation results from our Markov-chain
Monte-Carlo code SPINspiral on signals from binaries with precessing spins. Two
data sets are created by injecting simulated GW signals into either synthetic
Gaussian noise or into LIGO detector data. We compute the 15-dimensional
probability-density functions (PDFs) for both data sets, as well as for a data
set containing LIGO data with a known, loud artefact ("glitch"). We show that
the analysis of the signal in detector noise yields accuracies similar to those
obtained using simulated Gaussian noise. We also find that while the Markov
chains from the glitch do not converge, the PDFs would look consistent with a
GW signal present in the data. While our parameter-estimation results are
encouraging, further investigations into how to differentiate an actual GW
signal from noise are necessary.
