We report the first results from deep X-ray observations of the Wolf-Rayet
binary system WR147 with the Chandra HETG. Analysis of the zeroth order data
reveals that WR147 is a double X-ray source. The northern counterpart is likely
associated with the colliding wind region, while the southern component is
certainly identified with the WN star in this massive binary. The latter is the
source of high energy X-rays (including the Fe K_alpha complex at 6.67 keV)
whose production mechanism is yet unclear. For the first time, X-rays are
observed directly from a WR star in a binary system.
