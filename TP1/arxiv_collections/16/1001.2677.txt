For strong exact magnetic fields the action functional (i.e., the length plus
the linear magnetic term) is not bounded from below on the space of closed
contractible curves and the lower estimates for critical levels are derived by
using the principle of throwing out cycles. It is proved that for almost every
energy level the principle of throwing out cycles gives periodic magnetic
geodesics on the critical levels defined by the "thrown out" cycles.
