A left-right symmetric model is discussed with new mirror fermions and a
Higgs sector with two doublets and neutral scalar singlets. The seesaw
mechanism is generalized, including not only neutrino masses but also charged
fermion masses. The spectrum of heavy neutrinos presents a second seesaw mass
matrix and has neutrinos masses naturally in the TeV region. The model has very
clear signatures for the new neutral vector gauge bosons. Two classes of models
are discussed. New mirror neutrinos can be very light and a new $Z^{\prime}$
can be discriminated from other models by a very high invisible branching
fraction. The other possibility is that mirror neutrinos can have masses
naturally in the TeV region and can be produced through $Z^{\prime}$ decays
into heavy neutrino pairs. Signatures and production processes for the model at
the LHC energy are also presented.
