We address this work to investigate symbolic sequences with long-range
correlations by using computational simulation. We analyze sequences with two,
three and four symbols that could be repeated $l$ times, with the probability
distribution $p(l)\propto 1/ l^{\mu}$. For these sequences, we verified that
the usual entropy increases more slowly when the symbols are correlated and the
Tsallis entropy exhibits, for a suitable choice of $q$, a linear behavior. We
also study the chain as a random walk-like process and observe a nonusual
diffusive behavior depending on the values of the parameter $\mu$.
