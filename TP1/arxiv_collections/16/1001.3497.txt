SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) is a new trend towards increasing the
profit margins in an organization due to incorporating business services to
business practices. Rational Unified Process (RUP) is a unified method planning
form for large business applications that provides a language for describing
method content and processes. The well defined mapping of SOA and RUP leads to
successful completion of RUP software projects to provide services to their
users. DOA (Digital Office Assistant) is a multi user SOA type application that
provides appropriate viewer for each user to assist him through services. In
this paper authors proposed the mapping strategy of SOA with RUP by considering
DOA as case study.
