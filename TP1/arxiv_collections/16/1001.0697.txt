We investigate the dynamics of deposition of small Na clusters on MgO(001)
surface. A hierarchical modeling is used combining Quantum Mechanical with
Molecular Mechanical (QM/MM) description. Full time-dependent
density-functional theory is used for the cluster electrons while the substrate
atoms are treated at a classical level. We consider Na$_6$ and Na$_8$ at
various impact energies. We analyze the dependence on cluster geometry, trends
with impact energy, and energy balance. We compare the results with deposit on
the much softer Ar(001) surface.
