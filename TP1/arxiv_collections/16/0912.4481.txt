We derive the three-point function of the AdS3 WZNW model in the
minisuperspace limit by Wick rotation from the H3+ model. The result is
expressed in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of the Lie algebra sl(2,R).
We also introduce a covariant basis of functions on AdS3, which can be
interpreted as bulk-boundary propagators.
