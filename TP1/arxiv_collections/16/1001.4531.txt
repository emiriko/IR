We report on the observations of 14 dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Space Telescope taken during the first 11 months of survey mode
operations. The Fermi telescope provides a new opportunity to test particle
dark matter models through the expected gamma-ray emission produced by pair
annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Local Group dwarf
spheroidal galaxies, the largest galactic substructures predicted by the cold
dark matter scenario, are attractive targets for such indirect searches for
dark matter because they are nearby and among the most extreme dark matter
dominated environments. No significant gamma-ray emission was detected above
100 MeV from the candidate dwarf galaxies. We determine upper limits to the
gamma-ray flux assuming both power-law spectra and representative spectra from
WIMP annihilation. The resulting integral flux above 100 MeV is constrained to
be at a level below around 10^-9 photons cm^-2 s^-1. Using recent stellar
kinematic data, the gamma-ray flux limits are combined with improved
determinations of the dark matter density profile in 8 of the 14 candidate
dwarfs to place limits on the pair annihilation cross-section of WIMPs in
several widely studied extensions of the standard model. With the present data,
we are able to rule out large parts of the parameter space where the thermal
relic density is below the observed cosmological dark matter density and WIMPs
(neutralinos here) are dominantly produced non-thermally, e.g. in models where
supersymmetry breaking occurs via anomaly mediation. The gamma-ray limits
presented here also constrain some WIMP models proposed to explain the Fermi
and PAMELA e^+e^- data, including low-mass wino-like neutralinos and models
with TeV masses pair-annihilating into muon-antimuon pairs. (Abridged)
