The problem of the quantum harmonic oscillator is investigated in the
framework of bicomplex numbers, which are pairs of complex numbers making up a
commutative ring with zero divisors. Starting with the commutator of the
bicomplex position and momentum operators, and adapting the algebraic treatment
of the standard quantum harmonic oscillator, we find eigenvalues and eigenkets
of the bicomplex harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian. We construct an
infinite-dimensional bicomplex module from these eigenkets. Turning next to the
differential equation approach, we obtain coordinate-basis eigenfunctions of
the bicomplex harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian in terms of hyperbolic Hermite
polynomials.
