We introduce quasi-invariant polynomials for an arbitrary finite complex
reflection group W. Unlike in the Coxeter case, the space Q_k of
quasi-invariants of a given multiplicity is not, in general, an algebra but a
module over the coordinate ring of some (singular) affine variety X_k. We
extend the main results of Etingof, Ginzburg and the first author (see [BEG])
to this setting: in particular, we show that the variety X_k and the module Q_k
are Cohen-Macaulay, and the rings of differential operators on X_k and Q_k are
simple rings, Morita equivalent to the Weyl algebra A_n(C), where n = dim X_k .
Our approach relies on representation theory of complex Cherednik algebras and
is parallel to that of [BEG]. As a by-product, we prove the existence of shift
operators for an arbitrary complex reflection group, confirming a conjecture of
Dunkl and Opdam. Another result is a proof of a conjecture of Opdam, concerning
certain operations (KZ twists) on the set of irreducible representations of W.
