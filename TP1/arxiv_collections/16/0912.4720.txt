We derive the complete asymptotic expansion in terms of powers of $N$ for the
geodesic $f$-energy of $N$ equally spaced points on a rectifiable simple closed
curve $\Gamma$ in ${\mathbb R}^p$, $p\geq2$, as $N \to \infty$. For $f$
decreasing and convex, such a point configuration minimizes the $f$-energy
$\sum_{j\neq k}f(d(\mathbf{x}_j, \mathbf{x}_k))$, where $d$ is the geodesic
distance (with respect to $\Gamma$) between points on $\Gamma$. Completely
monotonic functions, analytic kernel functions, Laurent series, and weighted
kernel functions $f$ are studied. % Of particular interest are the geodesic
Riesz potential $1/d^s$ ($s \neq 0$) and the geodesic logarithmic potential
$\log(1/d)$. By analytic continuation we deduce the expansion for all complex
values of $s$.
