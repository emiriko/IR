We show for the first time the direct time variable radio images in the
context of shocked accretion flows around a black hole under the general
relativistic treatment of both hydrodynamics and radiation transfer. Time
variability around a black hole can be induced by the non-axisymmetric standing
accretion shock instability (namely Black Hole SASI). Since the spiral arm
shock waves generate the density and temperature waves at the post shock
region, they cause time variability in the black hole vicinity. Based on our
dynamical simulations, we discuss a possibility of detection for the time
variable radio images of M87 by the future space telescope VSOP2/ASTRO-G
satellite. The most luminous part of the images is predicted to be near 15
Schwarzschild radii for some snapshots. We show that our results are consistent
with existing observational data such as timeaveraged radio spectra, VLBA
images and variability timescale for M87. We also discuss observations of M87
with millimeter and sub-millimeter interferometers.
