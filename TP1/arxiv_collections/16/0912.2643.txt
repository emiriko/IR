With the advent of high-resolution infrared spectrographs, Radial Velocity
(RV) searches enter into a new domain. As of today, the most important
technical question to address is which wavelength reference is the most
suitable for high-precision RV measurements.
  In this work we explore the usage of atmospheric absorption features. We make
use of CRIRES data on two programs and three different targets. We re-analyze
the data of the TW Hya campaign, reaching a dispersion of about 6 m/s on the RV
standard in a time scale of roughly 1 week. We confirm the presence of a
low-amplitude RV signal on TW Hya itself, roughly 3 times smaller than the one
reported at visible wavelengths. We present RV measurements of Gl 86 as well,
showing that our approach is capable of detecting the signal induced by a
planet and correctly quantifying it.
  Our data show that CRIRES is capable of reaching a RV precision of less than
10 m/s in a time-scale of one week. The limitations of this particular approach
are discussed, and the limiting factors on RV precision in the IR in a general
way. The implications of this work on the design of future dedicated IR
spectrographs are addressed as well.
