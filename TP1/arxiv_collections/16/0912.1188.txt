The eikonal model must be denoted as strongly preferable for the analysis of
elastic high-energy hadron collisions. The given approach allows to derive
corresponding impact parameter profiles that characterize important physical
features of nucleon collisions, e.g., the range of different forces. The
contemporary phenomenological analysis of experimental data is, however, not
able to determine these profiles unambiguously, i.e., it cannot give the answer
whether the elastic hadron collisions are more central or more peripheral than
the inelastic ones. However, in the collisions of mass objects (like protons)
the peripheral behavior of elastic collisions should be preferred.
