We construct representations of the braid groups B_n on n strands on free
Z[q,q^-1,s,s^-1]-modules W_{n,l} using generic Verma modules for an integral
version of quantum sl_2. We prove that the W_{n,2} are isomorphic to the
faithful Lawrence Krammer Bigelow representations of B_n after appropriate
identification of parameters of Laurent polynomial rings by constructing
explicit integral bases and isomorphism. We also prove that the
B_n-representations W_{n,l} are irreducible over the fractional field Q (q,s).
