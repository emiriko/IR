Several singular limits are investigated in the context of a $2 \times 2$
system arising for instance in the modeling of chromatographic processes. In
particular, we focus on the case where the relaxation term and a $L^2$
projection operator are concentrated on a discrete lattice by means of Dirac
measures. This formulation allows to study more easily some time-splitting
numerical schemes.
