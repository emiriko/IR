The cluster state quantum computation is a versatile approach to build a
scalable quantum computer. In this thesis we theoretically demonstrate that a
one dimensional array of double quantum dots with long spin relaxation time can
evolve to a cluster state via capacitive coupling to a transmission line
resonator. By applying an oscillating voltage to gates of the double quantum
dots, we prove that the evolution operator for such interaction is an
Ising-like operator. Subsequently, the interacting qubits will become highly
entangled that we realize a cluster state. Furthermore, we propose an
experiment to investigate validity of our theoretical method. Considering the
current advanced technology in semiconductor nanofabrication, our proposed
structure can be integrated on a chip where provides scalability and convenient
control of the qubits. The scalability of our scheme implies that we can expand
this structure to higher dimensional arrays of the qubits where paves the way
for further experimental investigation on the theory of measurement-based
quantum computation.
