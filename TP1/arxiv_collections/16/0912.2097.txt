The fifth part of the OGLE-III Catalog of Variable Stars presents 23 R CrB
(RCB) stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). 17 of these objects have been
spectroscopically confirmed by previous studies, while 6 stars are new
candidates for RCB variables. We publish the VI multi-epoch OGLE photometry for
all objects.
  We use the sample of carbon-rich long-period variables released in the
previous part of this catalog to select objects with severe drops in
luminosity, i.e. with the DY-Per-like light curves. DY Per stars are often
related to R CrB variables. We detect at least 600 candidates for DY Per stars,
mostly among dust enshrouded giants. We notice that our candidate DY Per stars
form a continuity with other carbon-rich long-period variables, so it seems
that DY Per stars do not constitute a separate group of variable stars.
