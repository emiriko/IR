We give general sufficient conditions for the existence of trapped surfaces
due to concentration of matter in spherically symmetric initial data sets
satisfying the dominant energy condition. These results are novel in that they
apply and are meaningful for arbitrary spacelike slices, that is they do not
require any auxiliary assumptions such as maximality, time-symmetry, or special
extrinsic foliations, and most importantly they can easily be generalized to
the nonspherical case once an existence theory for a modified version of the
Jang equation is developed. Moreover, our methods also yield positivity and
monotonicity properties of the Misner-Sharp energy.
