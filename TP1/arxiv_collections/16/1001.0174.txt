We study framed links in irreducible 3-manifolds that are $Z$-homology
3-spheres or atoroidal $Q$-homology 3-spheres. We calculate the dual of the
Kauffman skein module over the ring of two variable power series with complex
coefficients. For links in $S^3$ we give a new construction of the classical
Kauffman polynomial.
