Ultracold polar molecules offer the possibility of exploring quantum gases
with interparticle interactions that are strong, long-range, and spatially
anisotropic. This is in stark contrast to the dilute gases of ultracold atoms,
which have isotropic and extremely short-range, or "contact", interactions. The
large electric dipole moment of polar molecules can be tuned with an external
electric field; this provides unique opportunities such as control of ultracold
chemical reactions, quantum information processing, and the realization of
novel quantum many-body systems. In spite of intense experimental efforts aimed
at observing the influence of dipoles on ultracold molecules, only recently
have sufficiently high densities been achieved. Here, we report the observation
of dipolar collisions in an ultracold molecular gas prepared close to quantum
degeneracy. For modest values of an applied electric field, we observe a
dramatic increase in the loss rate of fermionic KRb molecules due to ultrcold
chemical reactions. We find that the loss rate has a steep power-law dependence
on the induced electric dipole moment, and we show that this dependence can be
understood with a relatively simple model based on quantum threshold laws for
scattering of fermionic polar molecules. We directly observe the spatial
anisotropy of the dipolar interaction as manifested in measurements of the
thermodynamics of the dipolar gas. These results demonstrate how the long-range
dipolar interaction can be used for electric-field control of chemical reaction
rates in an ultracold polar molecule gas. The large loss rates in an applied
electric field suggest that creating a long-lived ensemble of ultracold polar
molecules may require confinement in a two-dimensional trap geometry to
suppress the influence of the attractive dipolar interactions.
