The hydrogen-deficiency in extremely hot post-AGB stars of spectral class
PG1159 is probably caused by a (very) late helium-shell flash or a AGB final
thermal pulse that consumes the hydrogen envelope, exposing the usually-hidden
intershell region. Thus, the photospheric element abundances of these stars
allow us to draw conclusions about details of nuclear burning and mixing
processes in the precursor AGB stars. We compare predicted element abundances
to those determined by quantitative spectral analyses performed with advanced
non-LTE model atmospheres. A good qualitative and quantitative agreement is
found for many species (He, C, N, O, Ne, F, Si, Ar) but discrepancies for
others (P, S, Fe) point at shortcomings in stellar evolution models for AGB
stars. Almost all of the chemical trace elements in these hot stars can only be
identified in the UV spectral range. The Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer
and the Hubble Space Telescope played a crucial role for this research.
