This paper addresses weight optimization problem in distributed consensus
averaging algorithm over networks with symmetric star topology. We have
determined optimal weights and convergence rate of the network in terms of its
topological parameters. In addition, two alternative topologies with more rapid
convergence rates have been introduced. The new topologies are Complete-Cored
Symmetric (CCS) star and K-Cored Symmetric (KCS) star topologies. It has been
shown that the optimal weights for the edges of central part in symmetric and
CCS star configurations are independent of their branches. By simulation
optimality of obtained weights under quantization constraints have been
verified.
