The whispering-gallery mode (WGM) excitation and Luneburg lens (LL) effect
are studied for a lossy circularly-layered dielectric cylinder illuminated by a
beam field. The latter is simulated by the Complex Source-Point (CSP) beam.
Exact series solution to the wave scattering problem is used to obtain the
far-field patterns and directivity. The WG mode effect is shown to undermine
the LL performance. Index Terms: Layered circular dielectric cylinder, Complex
source point beam, Whispering-gallery modes, Luneburg lens.
