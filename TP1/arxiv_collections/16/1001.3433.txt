We measure the frequencies of small-amplitude shape oscillations of a
magnetically-levitated water droplet. The droplet levitates in a
magnetogravitational potential trap. The restoring forces of the trap, acting
on the droplet's surface in addition to the surface tension, increase the
frequency of the oscillations. We derive the eigenfrequencies of the normal
mode vibrations of a spherical droplet in the trap and compare them with our
experimental measurements. We also consider the effect of the shape of the
potential trap on the eigenfrequencies.
