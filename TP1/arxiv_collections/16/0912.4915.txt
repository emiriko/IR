We study the texture of the exciton condensate at low temperatures in an
independently gated electron-hole bilayer system. A model Hamiltonian is solved
in real space within a mean-field approximation. It is found that, with
increased electron-hole density polarization, the system experiences phase
transformations from the zero center-of-mass momentum superfluid state, through
one- and two-dimensional exciton pair modulated states, into the normal state.
At weak density polarization, the modulating state resembles the
Larkin-Ovchinikov state in superconductors in the presence of an exchange field
in the weak-coupling BCS limit, and becomes stripe-like in the strong coupling
BEC limit. In the one-dimensional modulated phase, the density of states
exhibits low-energy intra-gap resonance quasiparticle states, which are
localized in the nodal region.
