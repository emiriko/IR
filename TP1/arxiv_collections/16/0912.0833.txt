To derive the history of star formation in the Universe a set of calibrated
star formation rate tracers at different wavelengths is required. The
calibration has to consistently take into account the effects of extinction,
star formation regime (short or long-lived) and evolutionary state to avoid
biases at different redshift ranges. We use evolutionary synthesis models
optimized for intense episodes of star formation in order to compute a
consistent calibration of the most usual star formation rate tracers at
different energy ranges, from X-ray to radio luminosities. Nearly-instantaneous
and continuous star formation regimes, and the effect of interstellar
extinction are considered, as well as the effect of metallicity on the
calibration of the different estimators. A consistent calibration of a complete
set of star formation rate tracers is presented, computed for the most usual
star-forming regions conditions: evolutionary state, star formation regime,
interstellar extinction and initial mass function. We discuss the validity of
the different tracers in different star formation scenarios and compare our
predictions with previous calibrations of general use. Nearly-instantaneous and
continuous star formation regimes must be distinguished. While the Star
Formation Strength (\msun) should be used for the former, the more common Star
Formation Rate (\msun yr$^{-1}$) is only valid for episodes forming stars at a
constant rate during extended periods for time. Moreover, even for the latter,
the evolutionary state should be taken into account, since most SFR tracers
stabilize only after 100 Myr of evolution.
