The Pimenov algebra with two generators is defined and some of its properties
are shown. Some exact matrix over the Pimenov algebra representations of the
motions group of Galilean plane (the Galilean group) are considered. A
geometric interpretation of them is giving. We consider also a exact
representation of the Galilean group by elements of Grassmann algebra.
