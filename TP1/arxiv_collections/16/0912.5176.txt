The deletion channel is the simplest point-to-point communication channel
that models lack of synchronization. Despite significant effort, little is
known about its capacity, and even less about optimal coding schemes. In this
paper we intiate a new systematic approach to this problem, by demonstrating
that capacity can be computed in a series expansion for small deletion
probability. We compute two leading terms of this expansion, and show that
capacity is achieved, up to this order, by i.i.d. uniform random distribution
of the input. We think that this strategy can be useful in a number of capacity
calculations.
