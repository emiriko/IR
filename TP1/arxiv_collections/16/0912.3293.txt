Liquid crystal elastomers are cross-linked polymer networks covalently bonded
with liquid crystal mesogens. In the nematic phase, due to strong coupling
between mechanical strain and orientational order, these materials display
strain-induced instabilities associated with formation and evolution of
orientational domains. Using a 3-d finite element elastodynamics simulation, we
investigate one such instability, the onset of stripe formation in a monodomain
film stretched along an axis perpendicular to the nematic director. In our
simulation we observe the formation of striped domains with alternating
director rotation. This model allows us to explore the fundamental physics
governing dynamic mechanical response of nematic elastomers and also provides a
potentially useful computational tool for engineering device applications.
