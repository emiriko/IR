We give a rigorous computer-assisted proof that the triangular bi-pyramid is
the unique configuration of 5 points on the 2-sphere that globally minimizes
the Coulomb (1/r) potential. We also prove the same result for the (1/r^2)
potential. The main mathematical contribution of the paper is a fairly
efficient energy estimate that works for any number of points and any power-law
potential.
