This paper presents an efficient method for implementing the Gaussian
elimination technique for an nxm (m>=n) matrix, using a 2D SIMD array of nxm
processors. The described algorithm consists of 2xn-1=O(n) iterations, which
provides an optimal speed-up over the serial version. A particularity of the
algorithm is that it only requires broadcasts on the rows of the processor
matrix and not on its columns. The paper also presents several extensions and
applications of the Gaussian elimination algorithm.
