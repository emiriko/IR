The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has been surveying the sky in gamma rays
from 30 MeV to more than 300 GeV since August 2008. Fermi is the only mission
able to detect high energy > few hundreds MeV emission from the Sun during the
new solar cycle 24: the Solar System Science Group of the Fermi team is
continuously monitoring high energy emission from the Sun searching for flare
events. Preliminary upper limits (E>100 MeV) have been derived for all solar
flares detected so far by other missions and experiments (RHESSI, Fermi, GBM,
GOES). Upper limit for flaring Sun emission (integrated over one year of data)
has also been derived. Here we present the analysis techniques as well as the
details of this search and the preliminary results obtained so far.
