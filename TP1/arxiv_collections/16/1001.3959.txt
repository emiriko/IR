In the present article we report on evidence for hadronic molecule structures
in the charmonium sector. In particular we discuss the Y(3940) and the recently
observed Y(4140) as heavy hadron molecule states with quantum numbers $J^{PC} =
0^{++}$ or $2^{++}$. The Y(3940) state is considered to be a superposition of
$D^{\ast +}D^{\ast -}$ and $D^{\ast 0} \overline{D^{\ast 0}}$, while the
Y(4140) is a bound state of $D_s^{\ast +}$ and $D_s^{\ast -}$ mesons. We give
predictions for both the strong Y(3940) to J/psi omega, Y(4140) to J/psi phi
and radiative Y(3940)/Y(4140) to gamma gamma decay widths in a phenomenological
Lagrangian approach. The results for the strong hidden charm decay modes
clearly support the molecular interpretation of the Y(3940) and Y(4140), while
our estimates for the radiative decays provide a sensitive test for the
underlying meson structure of the two Y mesons discussed here. The alternative
assignment of $J^{PC} = 2^{++}$ is also tested, giving similar results for the
strong decay widths.
