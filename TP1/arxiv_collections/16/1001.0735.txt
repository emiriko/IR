Hybrid logic extends modal logic with support for reasoning about individual
states, designated by so-called nominals. We study hybrid logic in the broad
context of coalgebraic semantics, where Kripke frames are replaced with
coalgebras for a given functor, thus covering a wide range of reasoning
principles including, e.g., probabilistic, graded, default, or coalitional
operators. Specifically, we establish generic criteria for a given coalgebraic
hybrid logic to admit named canonical models, with ensuing completeness proofs
for pure extensions on the one hand, and for an extended hybrid language with
local binding on the other. We instantiate our framework with a number of
examples. Notably, we prove completeness of graded hybrid logic with local
binding.
