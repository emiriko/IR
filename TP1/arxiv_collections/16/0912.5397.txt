We show that the discrepancy on the critical flavor number of fermions
$N_f^c$ for the appearance of the infrared fixed point based on the t'Hooft
anomaly matching condition and derived from the Schr\"odinger functional method
($N_f^c\sim 9)$ and the experimental analysis of the JLab group using Bjorken
sum rule and GDH sum rule, and our lattice simulation($N_f^c\sim 3$) could be
resolved by assuming the topological structure of the infrared fixed point is
not that of $U(1)^3$ but that of $G_2$ with triality automorphism of octonions
which appear in the product of quaternions.
  The agreement of the infrared fixed point of the running coupling measured in
lattice simulations with use of the quaternion real condition and the
prediction of the BLM renormalization theory might be due to the boundary
condition on $S^3\times R$ manifold of quaternion. The form factor of a proton
measured via Ward identity through the difference of the inverse propagator at
momentum p+q/2 and at p-q/2 agrees with the phenomenological dipole fit.
