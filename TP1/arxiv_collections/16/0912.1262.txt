Innovation is slowing greatly in the pharmaceutical sector. It is considered
here how part of the problem is due to overly limiting intellectual property
relations in the sector. On the other hand, computing and software in
particular are characterized by great richness of intellectual property
frameworks. Could the intellectual property ecosystem of computing come to the
aid of the biosciences and life sciences? We look at how the answer might well
be yes, by looking at (i) the extent to which a drug mirrors a software
program, and (ii) what is to be gleaned from trends in research publishing in
the life and biosciences.
