This paper proposes a multi agent system by compiling two technologies, query
processing optimization and agents which contains features of personalized
queries and adaption with changing of requirements. This system uses a new
algorithm based on modeling of users' long-term requirements and also GA to
gather users' query data. Experimented Result shows more adaption capability
for presented algorithm in comparison with classic algorithms.
