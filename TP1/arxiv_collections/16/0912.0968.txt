We report results from a search for production of a neutral Higgs boson in
association with a $b$ quark. We search for Higgs decays to $\tau$ pairs with
one $\tau$ subsequently decaying to a muon and the other to hadrons. The data
correspond to 2.7fb$^{-1}$ of $\ppbar$ collisions recorded by the D0 detector
at $\sqrt{s} = 1.96$TeV. The data are found to be consistent with background
predictions. The result allows us to exclude a significant region of parameter
space of the minimal supersymmetric model.
