We confirm recent discovery by Cao that in the vicinity of fast rotating
black holes jets can be launched centrifugally by cold, magnetized disks even
for nearly vertically shaped magnetic flux surfaces. Outflows produced under
such extreme conditions are investigated via studying kinematics of test
particles in the force-free magnetosphere approximation. Implications of a
possibility of magneto-centrifugal launching of very well collimated central
outflows around the fast rotating black holes are discussed in the general
context of the jet formation scenarios in AGNs.
