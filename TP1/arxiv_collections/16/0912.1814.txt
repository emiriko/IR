We investigate the possibility of writing a manifestly supersymmetric action
for 11-dimensional supergravity. The construction involves an explicit relation
between the fields in the super-vielbein and the super-3-form, and uses
non-minimal pure spinors. A simple cubic interaction term for a single scalar
superfield is found.
