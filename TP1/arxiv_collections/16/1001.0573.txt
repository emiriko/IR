We develop a three-temperature model to simulate the time dependence of
electron and phonon temperatures in high-temperature superconductors displaying
strong anistropic electron-phonon coupling. This model not only takes the
tight-binding band structure into account, but also is valid in superconducting
state. Based on this model, we calculate the time-resolved spectral function
via the double-time Green's functions. We find that the dip-hump structure
evolves with the time delay. More interestingly, new phononic structures are
obtained when the phonons are excited by a laser field. This signature may
serve as a direct evidence for electron-vibration mode coupling.
