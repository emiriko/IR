Bianchi type V string cosmological models in general relativity are
investigated. To get the exact solution of Einstein's field equations, we have
taken some scale transformations followed by Camci $\it et ~ al$ (2001). It is
shown that Einstein's field equations are solvable for any arbitrary cosmic
scale function. Solution for particular form of cosmic scale functions are also
obtained. Some physical and geometrical aspects of the models are discussed.
