The proximity operator of a convex function is a natural extension of the
notion of a projection operator onto a convex set. This tool, which plays a
central role in the analysis and the numerical solution of convex optimization
problems, has recently been introduced in the arena of signal processing, where
it has become increasingly important. In this paper, we review the basic
properties of proximity operators which are relevant to signal processing and
present optimization methods based on these operators. These proximal splitting
methods are shown to capture and extend several well-known algorithms in a
unifying framework. Applications of proximal methods in signal recovery and
synthesis are discussed.
