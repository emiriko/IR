We review recent progress in limit laws for the one-dimensional asymmetric
simple exclusion process (ASEP) on the integer lattice. The limit laws are
expressed in terms of a certain Painlev\'e II function. Furthermore, we take
this opportunity to give a brief survey of the appearance of Painlev\'e
functions in statistical physics.
