This work presents short-time Monte Carlo simulations for the two dimensional
Majority-vote model starting from ordered and disordered states. It has been
found that there are two pseudo-critical points, each one within the error-bar
range of previous reported values performed using fourth order cumulant
crossing method. The results show that the short-time dynamic for this model
has a dependence on the initial conditions. Based on this dependence a method
is proposed for the evaluation of the pseudo critical points and the extraction
of the dynamical critical exponent $z$ and the static critical exponent
$\beta/\nu$ for this model.
