The standard procedure for hardware design consists of describing circuit in
a hardware description language at logic level followed by extensive
verification and logic-synthesis. However, this process consumes significant
time and needs a lot of effort. An alternative is to use formal specification
language as a high-level hardware description language and synthesize hardware
from formal specification. Bloem et.al. gave formal specifications and
synthesize the AMBA AHB Arbiter. Our contributions are as follows:(1) We
present more complete and compact formal specifications for the AMBA AHB
Arbiter, and obtain significant (order of magnitude) improvement in synthesis
results (both with respect to time and the number of gates of the synthesize
circuit); (2) we present formal specification and synthesize to generate
compact circuits for the remaining two components of the AMBA AHB protocol,
namely, the AMBA AHB Master and AMBA AHB Slave; and (3) from the lessons learnt
we present few principles for writing formal specifications for efficient
hardware synthesis. Thus with intelligently written complete formal
specifications we are able to automatically synthesize an important and widely
used industrial protocol.
