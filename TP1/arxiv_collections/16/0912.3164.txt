Current interferometric gravitational wave detectors use the combination of
quasi-monochromatic, continuous-wave laser light at 1064 nm and fused silica
test masses at room temperature. Detectors of the third generation, such as the
Einstein-Telescope, will involve a considerable sensitivity increase. The
combination of 1550 nm laser radiation and crystalline silicon test masses at
low temperatures might be important ingredients in order to achieve the
sensitivity goal. Here we compare some properties of the fused silica and
silicon test mass materials relevant for decreasing the thermal noise in future
detectors as well as the recent technology achievements in the preparation of
laser radiation at 1064 nm and 1550 nm relevant for decreasing the quantum
noise. We conclude that silicon test masses and 1550 nm laser light have the
potential to form the future building blocks of gravitational wave detection.
