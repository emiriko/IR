Spin-polarized electric current exerts torque on local magnetic spins,
resulting in magnetic domain-wall (DW) motion in ferromagnetic nanowires. Such
current-driven DW motion opens great opportunities toward next-generation
magnetic devices controlled by current instead of magnetic field. However, the
nature of the current-driven DW motion--considered qualitatively different from
magnetic-field-driven DW motion--remains yet unclear mainly due to the
painfully high operation current densities J_OP, which introduce uncontrollable
experimental artefacts with serious Joule heating. It is also crucial to reduce
J_OP for practical device operation. By use of metallic Pt/Co/Pt nanowires with
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, here we demonstrate DW motion at current
densities down to the range of 10^9 A/m^2--two orders smaller than existing
reports. Surprisingly the current-driven motion exhibits a scaling behaviour
identical to the field-driven motion and thus, belongs to the same universality
class despite their qualitative differences. Moreover all DW motions driven by
either current or field (or by both) collapse onto a single curve, signalling
the unification of the two driving mechanisms. The unified law manifests
non-vanishing current efficiency at low current densities down to the practical
level, applicable to emerging magnetic nanodevices.
