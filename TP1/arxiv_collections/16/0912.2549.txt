Coordination in distributed environments, like Grids, involves selecting the
most appropriate services, resources or compositions to carry out the planned
activities. Such functionalities appear at various levels of the infrastructure
and in various means forming a blurry domain, where it is hard to see how the
participating components are related and what their relevant properties are. In
this paper we focus on a subset of these problems: resource brokering in Grid
middleware. This paper aims at establishing a semantical model for brokering
and related activities by defining brokering agents at three levels of the Grid
middleware for resource, host and broker selection. The main contribution of
this paper is the definition and decomposition of different brokering
components in Grids by providing a formal model using Abstract State Machines.
