Vapor-liquid menisci of the truncated and shifted Lennard-Jones fluid between
parallel planar walls are investigated by molecular dynamics simulation.
Thereby, the characteristic energy of the unlike dispersive interaction between
fluid molecules and wall atoms is systematically varied to determine its
influence on the contact angle. The temperature is varied as well, covering
most of the range between the triple point temperature and the critical
temperature of the bulk fluid. The transition between obtuse and acute angles
is found to occur at a temperature-independent magnitude of the fluid-wall
dispersive interaction energy. On the basis of the present simulation results,
fluid-wall interaction potentials can be adjusted to contact angle
measurements.
