We have observed 8 faint cataclysmic variable stars photometrically. The
nova-like Car2 was extensively sampled but showed little variability. V1040 Cen
was observed near the end of a dwarf nova outburst and possessed dwarf nova and
quasi-periodic oscillations. Ha 075648 has strong large amplitude flickering
and a possible orbital modulation at 3.49 h. The correct identification for the
nova remnant IL Nor (Nova Nor 1893) has been established. HS Pup (Nova Pup
1963) has a possible orbital period of 3.244 h. SDSS J2048-06 is a low mass
transfer dwarf nova that in quiescence shows slow variations at 7.67 h (though
poorly sampled with our observations) and an orbital modulation at 87.26 min.
The dwarf nova CSS 081419-005022 has an orbital period of 1.796 h and the
eclipsing dwarf nova CSS 112634-100210 has an orbital period of 1.8581 h.
