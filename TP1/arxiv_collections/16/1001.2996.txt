The properties of materials near structural phase transitions are often
successfully described in the framework of Landau theory. While the focus is
usually on phase transitions, which are induced by temperature changes
approaching a critical temperature T-c, here we will discuss structural phase
transformations driven by high hydrostatic pressure, as they are of major
importance for understanding processes in the interior of the earth. Since at
very high pressures the deformations of a material are generally very large,
one needs to apply a fully nonlinear description taking physical as well as
geometrical nonlinearities (finite strains) into account. In particular it is
necessary to retune conventional Landau theory to describe such phase
transitions. In Troster et al (2002 Phys. Rev. Lett. 88 55503) we constructed a
Landau-type free energy based on an order parameter part, an order
parameter-(finite) strain coupling and a nonlinear elastic term. This model
provides an excellent and efficient framework for the systematic study of phase
transformations for a wide range of materials up to ultrahigh pressures.
