Using angle resolved photoemission it is shown that the low lying electronic
states of the iron pnictide parent compound EuFe$_2$As$_2$ are strongly
modified in the magnetically ordered, low temperature, orthorhombic state
compared to the tetragonal, paramagnetic case above the spin density wave
transition temperature. Back-folded bands, reflected in the orthorhombic/
anti-ferromagnetic Brillouin zone boundary hybridize strongly with the
non-folded states, leading to the opening of energy gaps. As a direct
consequence, the large Fermi surfaces of the tetragonal phase fragment, the low
temperature Fermi surface being comprised of small droplets, built up of
electron and hole-like sections. These high resolution ARPES data are therefore
in keeping with quantum oscillation and optical data from other undoped
pnictide parent compounds.
