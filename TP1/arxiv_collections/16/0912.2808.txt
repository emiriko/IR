Photometric $(ubvy-\beta$) and spectroscopic observations of the $\delta$
Scuti variables \astrobj{7 Aql} and \astrobj{8 Aql} are described. The
Str\"omgren standard indices and physical parameters of both stars are derived.
Spectral types of F0V and F2III have been assigned to \astrobj{7 Aql} and
\astrobj{8 Aql} respectively considering the results from both spectroscopy and
photometry. Differential $uvby$ light curves were also analyzed. A attempt of
multicolour mode identification is carried out.
