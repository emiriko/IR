The charge spreading of ground and excited states of Klein-Gordon particles
moving in a Coulomb potential is quantitatively analyzed by means of the
ordinary moments and the Heisenberg measure as well as by use of the most
relevant information-theoretic measures of global (Shannon entropic power) and
local (Fisher's information) types. The dependence of these complementary
quantities on the nuclear charge Z and the quantum numbers characterizing the
physical states is carefully discussed. The comparison of the relativistic
Klein-Gordon and non-relativistic Schrodinger values is made. The
non-relativistic limits at large principal quantum number n and for small
values of Z are also reached.
