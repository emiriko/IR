The underlying physics of neutrino oscillation in vacuum can be demonstrated
by an optical analogical experiment. Two different neutrino flavors are
represented by two polarization states of a laser beam, whereas the different
phase propagation in vacuum is mimicked by the propagation difference of an
ordinary and an extraordinary beam in a birefringent crystal. This allows us to
demonstrate neutrino oscillation by optical methods in a fully microscopic way
at the particle level. The description of both realizations of oscillation is
also mathematically identical. In our demonstration experiment we can vary the
oscillation parameters such as propagation length L and mixing angle Theta.
