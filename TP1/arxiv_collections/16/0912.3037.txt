While electron spins in silicon heterostructures make attractive qubits,
little is known about the coherence of electrons at the Si/SiO2 interface. We
report spin relaxation (T1) and coherence (T2) times for mobile electrons and
natural quantum dots at a 28Si/SiO2 interface. Mobile electrons have short T1
and T2 of 0.3 us at 5 K. In line with predictions, confining electrons and
cooling increases T1 to 0.8 ms at 350 mK. In contrast, T2 for quantum dots is
around 10 us at 350 mK, increasing to 30 us when the dot density is reduced by
a factor of two. The quantum dot T2 is shorter than T1, indicating that T2 is
not controlled by T1 at 350 mK but is instead limited by an extrinsic
mechanism. The evidence suggests that this extrinsic mechanism is an exchange
interaction between electrons in neighboring dots.
