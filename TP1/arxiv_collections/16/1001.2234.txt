The tomographic method is employed to investigate the presence of quantum
correlations in two classes of parameter-dependent states of two qutrits. The
violation of some Bell's inequalities in a wide domain of the parameter space
is shown. A comparison between the tomographic approach and a recent method
elaborated by Wu, Poulsen and Molmer shows the better adequacy of the former
method with respect to the latter one.
