A systematic study of the production of omega-mesons in
proton-proton-collisions was carried out in a kinematically complete experiment
at three excess energies(epsilon= 92, 128, 173MeV). Both protons were detected
using the large-acceptance COSY-TOF spectrometer at an external beam line at
the Cooler Synchrotron COSY at Forschungszentrum J\"ulich. The total cross
section, angular distributions of both omega-mesons and protons were measured
and presented in various reference frames such as the overall CMS, helicity and
Jackson frame. In addition, the orientation of the omega-spin and invariant
mass spectra were determined. We observe omega-production to take place
dominantly in Ss and Sp final states at epsilon = 92, 128 MeV and,
additionally, in Sd at epsilon= 173 MeV. No obvious indication of resonant
omega-production via N^*-resonances was found, as proton angular distributions
are almost isotropic and invariant mass spectra are compatible with phase space
distributions. A dominant role of ^3P_1 and ^1S_0 initial partial waves for
omega-production was concluded from the orientation of the decay plane of the
omega-meson. Although the Jackson angle distributions in the omega-p-Jackson
frame are anisotropic we argue that this is not an indication of a resonance
but rather a kinematical effect reflecting the anisotropy of the omega angular
distribution. The helicity angle distribution in the omega-p-helicity frame
shows an anisotropy which probably reflects effects of the omega angular
momenta in the final state; this observable may be, in addition to the
orientation of the omega decay plane, the most sensitive one to judge the
validity of theoretical descriptions of the production process.
