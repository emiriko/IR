A hybrid model of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is presented, inspired by the
proposals of hybrid computation by S. Lloyd and P. van Loock et. al. The model
is based on two observations made about both the discrete and continuous
algorithms already available. First, the Fourier transform is a single-step
operation in a continuous-variable (CV) setting. Additionally, any
implementation of the oracle is nontrivial in both schemes. The steps of the
computation are very similar to those in the CV algorithm, with the main
difference being the way in which the qunats, or quantum units of analogic
information, and the qubits interact in the oracle. Using both discrete and
continuous states of light, linear devices, and photo-detection, an optical
implementation of the oracle is proposed. For simplicity, infinitely squeezed
states are used in the continuous register, whereas the optical qubit is
encoded in the dual-rail logic of the KLM protocol. The initial assumption of
ideal states as qunats will be dropped to study the effects of finite squeezing
in the quality of the computation.
