Under integral restrictions on dilatations, it is proved existence theorems
for the degenerate Beltrami equations with two characteristics and, in
particular, to the Beltrami equations of the second type that play a great role
in many problems of mathematical physics and to the so--called reduced Beltrami
equations that also have significant applications.
