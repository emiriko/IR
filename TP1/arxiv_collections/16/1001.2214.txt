Using group theory arguments we extend and complete our previous work by
deriving all SU(6) exact wave functions associated to the spectrum of mixed
symmetric baryon states $[N_c-1,1]$ in the $1/N_c$ expansion. The extension to
SU(6) enables us to study the mass spectra of both strange and nonstrange
baryons, while previous work was restricted to nonstrange baryons described by
SU(4). The wave functions are specially written in a form to allow a comparison
with the approximate, customarily used wave functions, where the system is
separated into a ground state core and an excited quark. We show that the
matrix elements of the flavor operator calculated with the exact wave functions
acquire the same asymptotic form at large $N_c$, irrespective of the
spin-flavor multiplet contained in $[N_c-1,1]$, while with the approximate wave
function one cannot obtain a similar behaviour. The isoscalar factors of the
permutation group of $N_c$ particles derived here can be used in any problem
where a given fermion system is described by the partition $[N_c-1,1]$, and one
fermion has to be separated from the rest.
