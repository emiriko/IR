Given a family of k disjoint connected polygonal sites in general position
and of total complexity n, we consider the farthest-site Voronoi diagram of
these sites, where the distance to a site is the distance to a closest point on
it. We show that the complexity of this diagram is O(n), and give an O(n log^3
n) time algorithm to compute it. We also prove a number of structural
properties of this diagram. In particular, a Voronoi region may consist of k-1
connected components, but if one component is bounded, then it is equal to the
entire region.
