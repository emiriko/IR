We study the cosmology of a 5-dimensional brane, which represents a
regularization of a 4-dimensional codimension-2 brane, embedded in a conical
bulk. The brane is assumed to be tensional, and to contain a curvature term.
Cosmology is obtained by letting the brane move trough the bulk, and
implementing dynamical junction conditions. Our results shows that, with
suitable choices of the parameters, the resulting cosmological dynamics mimics
fairly well standard 4-dimensional cosmology.
