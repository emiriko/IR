We summarize our current understanding of the neutrino flavor conversions
inside a core collapse supernova, clarifying the important role played by the
"collective effects" in determining flavor conversion probabilities. The
potentially observable $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ spectra may help us identify
the neutrino mixing scenario, distinguish between primary flux models, and
learn more about the supernova explosion.
