Using the Tibet-III air shower array, we search for TeV gamma-rays from 27
potential Galactic sources in the early list of bright sources obtained by the
Fermi Large Area Telescope at energies above 100 MeV. Among them, we observe 7
sources instead of the expected 0.61 sources at a significance of 2 sigma or
more excess. The chance probability from Poisson statistics would be estimated
to be 3.8 x 10^-6. If the excess distribution observed by the Tibet-III array
has a density gradient toward the Galactic plane, the expected number of
sources may be enhanced in chance association. Then, the chance probability
rises slightly, to 1.2 x 10^-5, based on a simple Monte Carlo simulation. These
low chance probabilities clearly show that the Fermi bright Galactic sources
have statistically significant correlations with TeV gamma-ray excesses. We
also find that all 7 sources are associated with pulsars, and 6 of them are
coincident with sources detected by the Milagro experiment at a significance of
3 sigma or more at the representative energy of 35 TeV. The significance maps
observed by the Tibet-III air shower array around the Fermi sources, which are
coincident with the Milagro >=3sigma sources, are consistent with the Milagro
observations. This is the first result of the northern sky survey of the Fermi
bright Galactic sources in the TeV region.
