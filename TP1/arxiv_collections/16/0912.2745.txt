Carbon nanotubes bridge the molecular and crystalline quantum worlds, and
their extraordinary electronic, mechanical and optical properties have
attracted enormous attention from a broad scientific community. We review the
basic principles of fabricating spin-electronic devices based on individual,
electrically-gated carbon nanotubes, and present experimental efforts to
understand their electronic and nuclear spin degrees of freedom, which in the
future may enable quantum applications.
