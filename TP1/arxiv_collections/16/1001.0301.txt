We show the details of the pathway for dissociative ionization process of
ground electronic state of aligned D$^{+}_{2}$ due to first ionization of D$_2$
in short ($\thicksim$100 fs) and intense ($4.0\times10^{14}$ W cm$^{-2}$) 480
nm laser pulses. The initial vibrational state of D$^{+}_{2}$ comes from the
vertical transformation of the ground state of D$_{2}$. The initial wavepacket
in the ground electronic state of D$_{2}^{+}$ is outgoing through
dissociation-ionization channel accompanied by a strong coupling between $1s
\sigma_{g}$ and $2p \sigma_{u}$ electronic states. We show explicitly that the
transition from the coupling states $1s \sigma_{g}$ and $2p \sigma_{u}$ to the
ionization state is not a direct transition but takes place through other
intermediate states with some dissociation energy that results in the
internuclear distribution of the ionization to move considerably to larger
internuclear distances.
