Expressions for energy and angular momentum changes of the hydrogen atom due
to interaction with the electromagnetic field during the period of the electron
motion in the Coulomb field are derived. It is shown that only the energy
change for the motion between two subsequent passings of the pericenter is
related to the quasiclassical dipole matrix element for transitions between
excited states.
