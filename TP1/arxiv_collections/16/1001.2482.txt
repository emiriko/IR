We describe the formation and properties of Holstein polarons in the entire
parameter regime. Our presentation focuses on the polaron mass and radius,
which we obtain with an improved numerical technique. It is based on the
combination of variational exact diagonalization with an improved construction
of phonon states, providing results even for the strong coupling adiabatic
regime. In particular we can describe the formation of large and heavy
adiabatic polarons. A comparison of the polaron mass for the one and three
dimensional situation explains how the different properties in the static
oscillator limit determine the behavior in the adiabatic regime. The transport
properties of large and small polarons are characterized by the f-sum rule and
the optical conductivity. Our calculations are approximation-free and have
negligible numerical error. This allows us to give a conclusive and impartial
description of polaron formation. We finally discuss the implications of our
results for situations beyond the Holstein model.
