We continue work on the connection between world sheet representation of the
planar phi^3 theory and string formation. The present article, like the earlier
work, is based on the existence of a solitonic solution on the world sheet, and
on the zero mode fluctuations around this solution. The main advance made in
this paper is the removal of the cutoff and the transition to the continuum
limit on the world sheet. The result is an action for the modes whose energies
remain finite in this limit (light modes). The expansion of this action about a
dense background of graphs on the world sheet leads to the formation of a
string.
