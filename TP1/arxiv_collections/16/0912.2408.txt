A class of static, vacuum solutions of (free-electromagnetic) Kaluza-Klein
equations with three-dimensional spherical symmetry is studied. In order to
explore the dynamic in such spacetimes, geodesic equations are obtained and the
effective potential for massive test particles is analysed. Particular
attention is devoted to the properties of the four dimensional counterpart of
these solutions in their Schwarzschild limit. A modification of the circular
stable orbits compared with the Schwarzschild case is investigated.
