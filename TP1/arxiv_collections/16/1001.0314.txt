We study the behaviour of the dynamical zeta function and the orbit Dirichlet
series for products of maps. The behaviour under products of the radius of
convergence for the zeta function, and the abscissa of convergence for the
orbit Dirichlet series, are discussed. The orbit Dirichlet series of the
cartesian cube of a map with one orbit of each length is shown to have a
natural boundary.
