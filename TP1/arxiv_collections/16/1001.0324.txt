In the paper [FSM] we described some Siegel modular threefolds which admit a
Calabi-Yau model. Using a different method we give in this paper an enlarged
list of such varieties that admits a Calabi-Yau model in the following weak
sense: there exists a desingularization in the category of complex spaces of
the Satake compactification which admits a holomorphic three-form without zeros
and whose first Betti number vanishes Basic for our method is the paper [GN] of
van Geemen and Nygaard.
