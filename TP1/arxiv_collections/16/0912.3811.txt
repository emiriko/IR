H.E.S.S. is one of the most sensitive instruments in the very high energy
(VHE; > 100 GeV) gamma-ray domain and has revealed many new sources along the
Galactic Plane. After the successful first VHE Galactic Plane Survey of 2004,
H.E.S.S. has continued and extended that survey in 2005-2008, discovering a
number of new sources, many of which are unidentified. Some of the unidentified
H.E.S.S. sources have several positional counterparts and hence several
different possible scenarios for the origin of the VHE gamma-ray emission;
their identification remains unclear. Others have so far no counterparts at any
other wavelength. Particularly, the lack of an X-ray counterpart puts serious
constraints on emission models. Several newly discovered and still unidentified
VHE sources are reported here.
