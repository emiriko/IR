We report electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in cold 85Rb atoms,
trapped in the lower hyperfine level F = 2, of the ground state 5$^{2}S_{1/2}$
(Tiwari V B \textit{et al} 2008 {\it Phys. Rev.} A {\bf 78} 063421). Two steady
state $\Lambda$-type systems of hyperfine energy levels are investigated using
probe transitions into the levels F$^{\prime}$ = 2 and F$^{\prime}$ = 3 of the
excited state 5$^{2}P_{3/2}$ in the presence of coupling transitions F = 3
$\to$ F$^{\prime}$ = 2 and F = 3 $\to$ F$^{\prime}$ = 3, respectively. The
effects of uncoupled magnetic sublevel transitions and coupling field's Rabi
frequency on the EIT signal from these systems are studied using a simple
theoretical model.
