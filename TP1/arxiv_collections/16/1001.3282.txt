We present results concerning the nature of the cosmological big bounce(BB)
transition within the loop geometry underlying loop quantum cosmology (LQC).
Our canonical quantization method is an alternative to the standard LQC. An
evolution parameter we use has clear interpretation both at classical and
quantum levels. The physical volume operator has discrete spectrum which is
bounded from below. The minimum gap in the spectrum defines a quantum of the
volume. The spectra of operators are parametrized by a free parameter to be
determined.
