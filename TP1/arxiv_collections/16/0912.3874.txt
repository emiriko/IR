We study the quantum correlations in a 2D system that possesses a topological
quantum phase transition. The quantumness of two-body correlations is measured
by quantum discord. We calculate both the correlation of two local spins and
that of an arbitrary spin with the rest of the lattice. It is notable that
local spins are classically correlated, while the quantum correlation is hidden
in the global lattice. This is different from other systems which are not
topologically orderd. Moreover, the mutual information and global quantum
discord show critical behavior in the topological quantum phase transition.
