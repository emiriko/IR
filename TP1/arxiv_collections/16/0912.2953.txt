We study the properties of charmed hadrons in dense matter within a
coupled-channel approach which accounts for Pauli blocking effects and meson
self-energies in a self-consistent manner. We analyze the behaviour in this
dense environment of dynamically-generated baryonic resonances as well as the
open-charm meson spectral functions. We discuss the implications of the
in-medium properties of open-charm mesons on the $D_{s0}(2317)$ and the
predicted X(3700) scalar resonances.
