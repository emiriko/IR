According to the widely accepted statistical interpretation of black hole
entropy the mean separation between energy levels of black hole should be
exponentially small. But this sharply disagrees with the value obtained from
the quantization of black hole area. It is shown that the new statistical
interpretation of black hole entropy proposed in my paper arXiv:0911.5635 gives
the correct value.
