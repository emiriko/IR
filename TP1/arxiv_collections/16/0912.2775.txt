Uranium and thorium are the main heat producing elements in the earth. Their
quantities and distributions, which specify the flux of detectable
antineutrinos generated by the beta decay of their daughter isotopes, remain
unmeasured. Geological models of the continental crust and the mantle predict
different quantities and distributions of uranium and thorium. Many of these
differences are resolvable with precision measurements of the terrestrial
antineutrino flux. This precision depends on both statistical and systematic
uncertainties. An unavoidable background of antineutrinos from nuclear reactors
typically dominates the systematic uncertainty. This report explores in detail
the capability of various operating and proposed geo-neutrino detectors for
testing geological models.
