We study a superweakly interacting dark matter particle motivated by minimal
walking technicolor theories. Our WIMP is a mixture of a sterile state and a
state with the charges of a standard model fourth family neutrino. We show that
the model can give the right amount of dark matter over a range of the WIMP
mass and mixing angle. We compute bounds on the model parameters from the
current accelerator data including the oblique corrections to the precision
electroweak parameters, as well as from cryogenic experiments, Super-Kamiokande
and from the IceCube experiment. We show that consistent dark matter solutions
exist which satisfy all current constraints. However, almost the entire
parameter range of the model lies within the the combined reach of the next
generation experiments.
