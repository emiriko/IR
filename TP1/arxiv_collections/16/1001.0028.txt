We present the proof of the cyclic sieving conjectures for generalised
non-crossing partitions associated to well-generated complex reflection groups
due to Armstrong, respectively to Bessis and Reiner, for the 26 exceptional
well-generated complex reflection groups. The computational details are
provided in the manuscript "Cyclic sieving for generalised non-crossing
partitions associated to complex reflection groups of exceptional type - the
details" [arXiv:1001.0030].
