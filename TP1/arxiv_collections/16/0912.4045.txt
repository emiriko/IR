It is natural to ask: what kinds of matrices satisfy the Restricted
Eigenvalue (RE) condition? In this paper, we associate the RE condition
(Bickel-Ritov-Tsybakov 09) with the complexity of a subset of the sphere in
$\R^p$, where $p$ is the dimensionality of the data, and show that a class of
random matrices with independent rows, but not necessarily independent columns,
satisfy the RE condition, when the sample size is above a certain lower bound.
Here we explicitly introduce an additional covariance structure to the class of
random matrices that we have known by now that satisfy the Restricted Isometry
Property as defined in Candes and Tao 05 (and hence the RE condition), in order
to compose a broader class of random matrices for which the RE condition holds.
In this case, tools from geometric functional analysis in characterizing the
intrinsic low-dimensional structures associated with the RE condition has been
crucial in analyzing the sample complexity and understanding its statistical
implications for high dimensional data.
