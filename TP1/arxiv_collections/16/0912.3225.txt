We present a derivation of the classical SIR model through a mean-field
approximation from a discrete version of SIR. We then obtain a hyperbolic
forward Kolmogorov equation, and show that its projected characteristics
recover the standard SIR model. Moreover, we show that the long time limit of
the evolution will be a Dirac measure. The exact position will depend on the
well-know $R_0$ parameter, and it will be supported on the corresponding stable
SIR equilibrium.
