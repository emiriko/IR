In this lecture we apply a thermodynamic Green function formalism developed
in the context of nonrelativistic plasma physics for the case of heavy
quarkonia states in strongly correlated quark matter. Besides the traditional
explanation of charmonium suppresion by Debye screening of the strong
interaction, we discuss further effects of relevance when heavy quarkonia
states propagate in a medium where strong correlations persist in the form of
hadronic resonances. These effects may be absorbed in the definition of a
plasma Hamiltonian, which was the main result of this work. This plasma
Hamiltonian governs the in-medium modification of the bound state energy levels
as well as the lowering of the continuum edge which leads not only to the
traditional Mott effect for the dissociation of bound states in a plasma, but
can also be applied for a consistent calculation of the in-medium modification
of quarkonium dissociation rates.
