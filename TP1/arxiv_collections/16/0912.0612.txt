The radiative transition form factors of the pseudoscalar mesons {$\pi$,
$\eta$, $\eta'$} and the vector mesons {$\rho$, $\omega$, $\phi$} are restudied
with $\pi$-$\eta$-$\eta'$ and $\rho$-$\omega$-$\phi$ in tri-meson-mixing
pattern, which is described by tri-mixing matrices in the light-cone
constituent quark model. The experimental transition decay widths are better
reproduced with tri-meson-mixing than previous results in a two-mixing-angle
scenario of only two-meson $\eta$-$\eta'$ mixing and $\omega$-$\phi$ mixing.
