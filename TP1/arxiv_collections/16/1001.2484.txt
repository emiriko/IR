We present X-ray proper-motion measurements of the forward shock and
reverse-shocked ejecta in Tycho's supernova remnant, based on three sets of
archival Chandra data taken in 2000, 2003, and 2007. We find that the proper
motion of the edge of the remnant (i.e., the forward shock and protruding
ejecta knots) varies from 0".20 yr^{-1} (expansion index m=0.33, where R = t^m)
to 0".40 yr^{-1} (m=0.65) with azimuthal angle in 2000-2007 measurements, and
0".14 yr^{-1} (m=0.26) to 0".40 yr^{-1} (m=0.65) in 2003-2007 measurements. The
azimuthal variation of the proper motion and the average expansion index of
~0.5 are consistent with those derived from radio observations. We also find
proper motion and expansion index of the reverse-shocked ejecta to be
0".21-0".31 yr^{-1} and 0.43-0.64, respectively. From a comparison of the
measured m-value with Type Ia supernova evolutionary models, we find a
pre-shock ambient density around the remnant of <~0.2 cm^{-3}.
