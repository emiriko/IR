The Kepler Mission offers two options for observations -- either Long Cadence
(LC) used for the bulk of core mission science, or Short Cadence (SC) which is
used for applications such as asteroseismology of solar-like stars and transit
timing measurements of exoplanets where the 1-minute sampling is critical. We
discuss the characteristics of SC data obtained in the 33.5-day long Quarter 1
(Q1) observations with Kepler which completed on 15 June 2009. The truly
excellent time series precisions are nearly Poisson limited at 11th magnitude
providing per-point measurement errors of 200 parts-per-million per minute. For
extremely saturated stars near 7th magnitude precisions of 40 ppm are reached,
while for background limited measurements at 17th magnitude precisions of 7
mmag are maintained. We note the presence of two additive artifacts, one that
generates regularly spaced peaks in frequency, and one that involves additive
offsets in the time domain inversely proportional to stellar brightness. The
difference between LC and SC sampling is illustrated for transit observations
of TrES-2.
