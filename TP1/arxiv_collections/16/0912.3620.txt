A consistent description of the results of the neutrino oscillation
experiments carried out so far can be obtained from three basic properties of
neutrinos and the parameters of the Hamiltonian matrix. Using these basic
neutrino properties, an exact relation for the oscillation amplitudes of moving
neutrinos is derived.
