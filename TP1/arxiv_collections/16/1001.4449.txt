Single-photon entanglement is a simple form of entanglement that exists
between two spatial modes sharing a single photon. Despite its elementary form,
it provides a resource as useful as polarization-entangled photons and it can
be used for quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping operations. Here,
we report the first experiment where single-photon entanglement is purified
with a simple linear-optics based protocol. Besides its conceptual interest,
this result might find applications in long distance quantum communication
based on quantum repeaters.
