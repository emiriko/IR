Using multiscale analysis and methods of statistical physics, we show that a
solution to the N-atom Liouville Equation can be decomposed via an expansion in
terms of a smallness parameter epsilon, wherein the long scale time behavior
depends upon a reduced probability density that is a function of slow-evolving
order parameters. This reduced probability density is shown to satisfy the
Smoluchowski equation up to order epsilon squared for a given range of initial
conditions. Furthermore, under the additional assumption that the nanoparticle
momentum evolves on a slow time scale, we show that this reduced probability
density satisfies a Fokker-Planck equation up to the same order in epsilon.
This approach applies to a broad range of problems in the nanosciences.
