We measure the non-dissipative supercurrent in a single InAs self-assembled
quantum dot (QD) coupled to superconducting leads. The QD occupation is both
tuned by a back-gate electrode and lateral side-gate. The geometry of the
side-gate allows tuning of the QD-lead tunnel coupling in a region of constant
electron number with appropriate orbital state. Using the side-gate effect we
study the competition between Kondo correlations and superconducting pairing on
the QD, observing a decrease in the supercurrent when the Kondo temperature is
reduced below the superconducting energy gap in qualitative agreement with
theoretical predictions.
