We report on the high precision timing analysis of the pulsar-white dwarf
binary PSR J1012+5307. Using 15 years of multi-telescope data from the European
Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) network, a significant measurement of the variation
of the orbital period is obtained. Using this ideal strong-field gravity
laboratory we derive theory independent limits for both the dipole radiation
and the variation of the gravitational constant.
