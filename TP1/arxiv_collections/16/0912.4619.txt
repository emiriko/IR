CONTEXT: Most current radial velocity planet search programs have
concentrated on stars of one solar mass. Our knowledge on the frequency of
giant planets and brown dwarf companions to more massive stars is thus rather
limited. In the case of solar-like stars, the frequency of short-period brown
dwarf companions and very massive planets seems to be low. AIMS: Here we
present evidence for a substellar companion to 30 Ari B, an F-star of 1.16
$\pm$ 0.04 $\rm M_\odot$ that is a member of a hierarchical triple system.
METHODS: The companion was detected by means of precise radial velocity
measurements using the 2-m Alfred-Jensch telescope and its 'echelle
spectrograph. An iodine absorption cell provided the wavelength reference for
precise stellar radial velocity measurements. RESULTS: We analyzed our radial
velocity measurements and derived an orbit to the companion with period, P=
335.1+/-2.5 days, eccentricity e = 0.289+/-0.092, and mass function f(m) =
(6.1+/-1.7)*10E-7 Modot. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the radial velocity
variations of 30 Ari B are due to a companion with $m$ sin $i$ of $9.88\pm0.94$
$\rm M_{Jup}$ that is either a massive planet or a brown dwarf. {The object
thus belongs to the rare class of massive planets and brown dwarfs orbiting
main- sequence stars.
