The charge distribution in RFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$ (R=La, Sm) iron pnictides is
probed using As nuclear quadrupole resonance. Whereas undoped and
optimally-doped or overdoped compounds feature a single charge environment, two
charge environments are detected in the underdoped region. Spin-lattice
relaxation measurements show their coexistence at the nanoscale. Together with
the quantitative variations of the spectra with doping, they point to a local
electronic order in the iron layers, where low- and high-doping-like regions
would coexist. Implications for the interplay of static magnetism and
superconductivity are discussed.
