We give the approximate analytic solutions of the Dirac equations for the
Rosen-Morse potential including the spin-orbit centrifugal term. In the
framework of the spin and pseudospin symmetry concept, we obtain the analytic
bound state energy spectra and corresponding two-component upper- and
lower-spinors of the two Dirac particles, in closed form, by means of the
Nikiforov-Uvarov method. The special cases of the s-wave kappa=1,-1 (l=l bar=0)
Rosen-Morse potential, the Eckart-type potential, the PT-symmetric Rosen-Morse
potential and non-relativistic limits are briefly studied.
