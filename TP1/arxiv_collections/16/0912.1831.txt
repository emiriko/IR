An amicable pair for an elliptic curve E/Q is a pair of primes (p,q) of good
reduction for E satisfying #E(F_p) = q and #E(F_q) = p. In this paper we study
elliptic amicable pairs and analogously defined longer elliptic aliquot cycles.
We show that there exist elliptic curves with arbitrarily long aliqout cycles,
but that CM elliptic curves (with j not 0) have no aliqout cycles of length
greater than two. We give conjectural formulas for the frequency of amicable
pairs. For CM curves, the derivation of precise conjectural formulas involves a
detailed analysis of the values of the Grossencharacter evaluated at a prime
ideal P in End(E) having the property that #E(F_P) is prime. This is especially
intricate for the family of curves with j = 0.
