An asymptotic expansions for the grand partition function of ideal Bose gas
in the canonical ensemble with arbitrary number of particles is obtained. It is
shown that the expressions found are valid in the whole temperature region, the
critical temperature included. A comparison between the asymptotic formulas for
Bose-condensate fluctuations and the exact ones is carried out and their
quantitative agreement is established.
