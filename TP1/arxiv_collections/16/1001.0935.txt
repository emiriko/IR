Quarkonium at temperatures above deconfinement is modeled as an open quantum
system, whose dynamics is determined not just by a potential energy and mass,
but also by a drag coefficient which characterizes its interaction with the
medium. The reduced density matrix for a heavy particle experiencing
dissipative forces is expressed as an integral over paths in imaginary time and
evaluated numerically. We demonstrate that dissipation could affect the
Euclidean heavy-heavy correlators calculated in lattice simulations at
temperatures just above deconfinement.
