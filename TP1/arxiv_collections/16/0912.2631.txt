We discuss different parameterizations of the $C_5^A(q^2)$ $N\Delta$ axial
form factor, fitted to the old Argonne bubble chamber data for pion production
by neutrinos, and we use coherent pion production to test their low $q^2$
behavior. We find moderate effects that will be difficult to observe with the
accuracy of present experiments. We also discuss the use of the Rein-Sehgal
model for low energy coherent pion production. By comparison to a microscopic
calculation, we show the weaknesses of some of the approximations in that model
that lead to very large cross sections as well as to the wrong shapes for
differential ones. Finally we show that models based on the partial
conservation of the axial current hypothesis are not fully reliable for
differential cross sections that depend on the angle formed by the pion and the
incident neutrino.
