Formation of a defect face-centered cubic structure containing metal
vacancies in Ni-H and Pd-H alloys was observed experimentally at high
temperature annealing under high hydrogen pressure. Appearance of vacancies in
the fcc structure of the Pd hydride and several other metal hydrides can be
accounted for by electronic origin assuming that valence electron energy is
minimized due to Hume-Rothery effects.
