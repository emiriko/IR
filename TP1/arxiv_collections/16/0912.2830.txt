From consideration of the order-parameter distribution, we propose an
observable which makes a clear distinction between true and quasi long-range
orders in the two-dimensional generalized $q$-state clock model. Measuring this
quantity by Monte Carlo simulations for $q=8$, we construct a phase diagram and
identify critical properties across the phase-separation lines among the true
long-range order, quasi long-range order, and disorder. Our result supports the
theoretical prediction that there appears a discontinuous order-disorder
transition as soon as the two phase-separation lines merge.
