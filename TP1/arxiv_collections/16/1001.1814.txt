Phonon carrier interactions can have significant impact on device
performance. They can be probed by measuring the phonon lifetime, which
reflects the interaction strength of a phonon with other quasi-particles in
particular charge carriers as well as its companion phonons. The carrier phonon
and phonon-phonon contributions to the phonon lifetime can be disentangled from
temperature dependent studies. Here, we address the importance of phonon
carrier interactions in Joule-heated graphene constrictions in order to
contribute to the understanding of energy dissipation in graphene based
electronic devices. We demonstrate that gapless graphene grants electron phonon
interactions uncommon significance in particular at low carrier density. In
conventional semiconductors, the bandgap usually prevents the decay of phonons
through electron-hole generation and also in metals or other semimetals the
Fermi temperature is excessively large to enter the regime where electron
phonon coupling plays such a dominant role as in graphene in the investigated
phonon temperature regime from 300 to 1600 K.
