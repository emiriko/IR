We discuss the relevant progress that has been made in the last few years on
the microscopic theory of the pairing correlation in nuclei and the open
problems that still must be solved in order to reach a satisfactory description
and understanding of the nuclear pairing. The similarities and differences with
the nuclear matter case are emphasized and described by few illustrative
examples. The comparison of calculations of different groups on the same set of
nuclei show, besides agreements, also discrepancies that remain to be
clarified. The role of the many-body correlations, like screening, that go
beyond the BCS scheme, is still uncertain and requires further investigation.
