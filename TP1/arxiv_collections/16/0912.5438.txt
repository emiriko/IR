We define a new topological polynomial extending the Bollobas-Riordan one,
which obeys a four-term reduction relation of the deletion/contraction type and
has a natural behavior under partial duality. This allows to write down a
completely explicit combinatorial evaluation of the polynomials, occurring in
the parametric representation of the non-commutative Grosse-Wulkenhaar quantum
field theory. An explicit solution of the parametric representation for
commutative field theories based on the Mehler kernel is also provided.
