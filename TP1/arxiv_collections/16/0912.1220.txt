Vapor condensation with removing of latent heat by emission of characteristic
frequencies allows fast droplets formation in big volumes, which becomes
possible with spatial redistribution and spreading of condensation nuclei and
ions formed in long lightning traces. Droplets in the vertical Earth electric
fields will be polarized and dipoles will be oriented; at movements in the
Earth magnetic field they will be torqued into horizontal plane. The
estimations show that the teamwork of these phenomena leads to formation of
tropic cyclones, which can decay in regions with reduced fields and non
supersaturated vapor. The suggested theory can be verified by examination of
fields' intensity and radiations: the characteristic, mainly IR radiating of
latent heat and emission of the 150 kHz range at approaching of water dipoles
to drops.
