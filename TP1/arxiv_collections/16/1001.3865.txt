Two frequency combs can be used to measure the full complex response of a
sample in a configuration which can be alternatively viewed as the equivalent
of a dispersive Fourier transform spectrometer, infrared time domain
spectrometer, or a multiheterodyne laser spectrometer. This dual comb
spectrometer retains the frequency accuracy and resolution inherent to the comb
sources. We discuss, in detail, the specific design of our coherent dual-comb
spectrometer and demonstrate the potential of this technique by measuring the
first overtone vibration of hydrogen cyanide, centered at 194 THz (1545 nm). We
measure the fully normalized, complex response of the gas over a 9 THz
bandwidth at 220 MHz frequency resolution yielding 41,000 resolution elements.
The average spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 2,500 for both the
fractional absorption and the phase, with a peak SNR of 4,000 corresponding to
a fractional absorption sensitivity of 0.025% and phase sensitivity of 250
microradians. As the spectral coverage of combs expands, this dual-comb
spectroscopy could provide high frequency accuracy and resolution measurements
of a complex sample response across a range of spectral regions.
