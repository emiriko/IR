I acknowledge a flaw in the paper "A quantum solution to the arrow of time
dilemma": as pointed out by Jennings and Rudolph, (classical) mutual
information is not an appropriate measure of information. This can be traced
back to the quantum description underlying my analysis, where quantum mutual
information is the appropriate measure of information. The core argument of my
paper (summarized in its abstract) is not affected by this flaw. Nonetheless, I
point out that such argument may not be adequate to account for all phenomena:
it seems necessary to separately postulate a low entropy initial state.
