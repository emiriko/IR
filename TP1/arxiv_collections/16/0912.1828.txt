Search services have been developed rapidly in social Internet. It can help
web users easily to find their documents. So that, finding a best method search
is always an imagine. This paper would like introduce hybrid method of
LPageRank algorithm and Social Sim Rank algorithm. LPageRank is the method
using link structure to rank priority of page. It doesn't care content of page
and content of query. Therefore, we want to use benefit of social annotations
to create the latent semantic association between queries and annotations. This
model, we use algorithm SocialPageRank and LPageRank to enhance accuracy of
search system. To experiment and evaluate the proposed of the new model, we
have used this model for Music Machine Website with their web logs.
