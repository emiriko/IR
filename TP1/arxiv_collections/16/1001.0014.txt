Jet shapes are weighted sums over the four-momenta of the constituents of a
jet and reveal details of its internal structure, potentially allowing
discrimination of its partonic origin. In this work we make predictions for
quark and gluon jet shape distributions in N-jet final states in e+e-
collisions, defined with a cone or recombination algorithm, where we measure
some jet shape observable on a subset of these jets. Using the framework of
Soft-Collinear Effective Theory, we prove a factorization theorem for jet shape
distributions and demonstrate the consistent renormalization-group running of
the functions in the factorization theorem for any number of measured and
unmeasured jets, any number of quark and gluon jets, and any angular size R of
the jets, as long as R is much smaller than the angular separation between
jets. We calculate the jet and soft functions for angularity jet shapes \tau_a
to one-loop order (O(alpha_s)) and resum a subset of the large logarithms of
\tau_a needed for next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy for both cone and
kT-type jets. We compare our predictions for the resummed \tau_a distribution
of a quark or a gluon jet produced in a 3-jet final state in e+e- annihilation
to the output of a Monte Carlo event generator and find that the dependence on
a and R is very similar.
