By means of parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations we find strong
evidence for a finite-temperature spin-glass transition in a system of diluted
classical Heisenberg dipoles randomly placed on the sites of a simple cubic
lattice. We perform a finite-size scaling analysis of the spin-glass
susceptibility, $\chi_{{\rm SG}}$, and spin-glass correlation length,
$\xi_{L}$. For the available system sizes that can be successfully
equilibrated, the crossing of $\xi_{L}/L$ versus temperature is strongly
affected by corrections to scaling and possibly by a short-length scale
ferromagnetic spin blocking. Similarly to many studies of different three
dimensional spin-glass systems, we do not find a crossing of the spin glass
order parameter Binder ratio.
