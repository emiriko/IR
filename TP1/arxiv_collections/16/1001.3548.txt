The analytical treatment of the nonperturbative QCD dynamics is one of main
open questions of the strong interactions. Currently, it is only possible to
get some qualitative information about this regime considering other QCD-like
theories, as for example the N=4 super Yang-Mills (SYM), where one can perform
calculations in the nonperturbative limit of large 't Hooft coupling using the
Anti-de Sitter space/Conformal field theory (AdS/CFT). Recently, the high
energy scattering amplitude was calculated in the AdS/CFT approach, applied to
deep inelastic scattering (DIS) and confronted with the $F_2$ HERA data. In
this work we extend the nonperturbative AdS/CFT inspired model for diffractive
processes and compare its predictions with a perturbative approach based on the
Balitsky - Kovchegov (BK) equation. We demonstrate that the AdS/CFT inspired
model is not able to describe the current $F_2^{D(3)}$ HERA data and predicts a
similar behavior to that from BK equation in the range $10^{-7} \lesssim x_{IP}
\lesssim 10^{-4}$. At smaller values of $x_{IP}$ the diffractive structure
function is predicted to be energy independent.
