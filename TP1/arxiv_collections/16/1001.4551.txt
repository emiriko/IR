The behavior of the observed polarization amplitudes with spatial resolution
is a strong constraint on the nature and organization of solar magnetic fields
below the resolution limit. We study the polarization of the very quiet Sun at
different spatial resolutions using ground- and space-based observations. It is
shown that 80% of the observed polarization signals do not change with spatial
resolution, suggesting that, observationally, the very quiet Sun magnetism
remains the same despite the high spatial resolution of space-based
observations. Our analysis also reveals a cascade of spatial scales for the
magnetic field within the resolution element. It is manifest that the Zeeman
effect is sensitive to the microturbulent field usually associated to Hanle
diagnostics. This demonstrates that Zeeman and Hanle studies show complementary
perspectives of the same magnetism.
