The Keller-Segel system has been widely proposed as a model for bacterial
waves driven by chemotactic processes. Current experiments on {\em E. coli}
have shown precise structure of traveling pulses. We present here an
alternative mathematical description of traveling pulses at a macroscopic
scale. This modeling task is complemented with numerical simulations in
accordance with the experimental observations. Our model is derived from an
accurate kinetic description of the mesoscopic run-and-tumble process performed
by bacteria. This model can account for recent experimental observations with
{\em E. coli}. Qualitative agreements include the asymmetry of the pulse and
transition in the collective behaviour (clustered motion versus dispersion). In
addition we can capture quantitatively the main characteristics of the pulse
such as the speed and the relative size of tails. This work opens several
experimental and theoretical perspectives. Coefficients at the macroscopic
level are derived from considerations at the cellular scale. For instance the
stiffness of the signal integration process turns out to have a strong effect
on collective motion. Furthermore the bottom-up scaling allows to perform
preliminary mathematical analysis and write efficient numerical schemes. This
model is intended as a predictive tool for the investigation of bacterial
collective motion.
