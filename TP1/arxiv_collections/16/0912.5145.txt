We show the photodetachment cross sections of H near a metal surface can be
modified using a weak static electric field. The modification is possible
because the oscillatory part of the cross section near a metal surface is
directly connected with the transit-time and the action of the
detached-electron closed-orbit which can be changed systematically by varying
the static electric field strength. Photodetachment cross sections for various
photon energies and electric field values are calculated and displayed.
