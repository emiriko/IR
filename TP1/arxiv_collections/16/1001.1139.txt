The spatial search problem consists in minimizing the number of steps
required to find a given site in a network, under the restriction that only
oracle queries or translations to neighboring sites are allowed. In this paper,
a quantum algorithm for the spatial search problem on a honeycomb lattice with
$N$ sites and torus-like boundary conditions. The search algorithm is based on
a modified quantum walk on a hexagonal lattice and the general framework
proposed by Ambainis, Kempe and Rivosh is used to show that the time complexity
of this quantum search algorithm is $O(\sqrt{N \log N})$.
