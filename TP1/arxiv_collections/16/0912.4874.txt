For each nonnegative integer we find an open (4m+9)-dimensional
simply-connected manifold admitting complete nonnegatively curved metrics whose
souls are non-diffeomorphic, homeomorphic, and have codimension 2. We give a
diffeomorphism classification of the pairs (N, soul) when N is a nontrivial
complex line bundle over the product of 7-sphere and complex projective plane:
up to diffeomorphism there are precisely three such pairs, distinguished by
their non-diffeomorphic souls.
