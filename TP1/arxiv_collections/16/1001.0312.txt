We present a method for proving q-series identities by combinatorial
telescoping, in the sense that one can transform a bijection or a
classification of combinatorial objects into a telescoping relation. We shall
illustrate this method by giving a combinatorial proof of Watson's identity
which implies the Rogers-Ramanujan identities.
