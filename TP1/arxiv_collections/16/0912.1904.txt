This paper develops a deeper understanding of the structure and combinatorial
significance of the partition function for Hermitian random matrices. The
coefficients of the large N expansion of the logarithm of this partition
function,also known as the genus expansion, (and its derivatives) are
generating functions for a variety of graphical enumeration problems. The main
results are to prove that these generating functions are in fact specific
rational functions of a distinguished irrational (algebraic) function of the
generating function parameters. This distinguished function is itself the
generating function for the Catalan numbers (or generalized Catalan numbers,
depending on the choice of parameter). It is also a solution of the inviscid
Burgers equation for certain initial data. The shock formation, or caustic, of
the Burgers characteristic solution is directly related to the poles of the
rational forms of the generating functions.
  These results in turn provide new information about the asymptotics of
recurrence coefficients for orthogonal polynomials with respect to exponential
weights. One gains new insights into the relation between certain derivatives
of the genus expansion and the asymptotic expansion of the first Painleve
transcendent, related to the double-scaling limit. This work provides a precise
expression of the Painleve asymptotic coefficients directly in terms of the
coefficients of the partial fractions expansion of the rational form of the
generating functions established here. Moreover, these insights point toward a
more general program relating the first Painleve hierarchy and the higher order
structure of the double-scaling limit to the specific rational structure of
generating functions.
