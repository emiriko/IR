We have obtained deep Hubble Space Telescope far-UV images of 15 starburst
galaxies at z~1.3 in the GOODS fields to search for escaping Lyman continuum
photons. These are the deepest far-UV images m_{AB}=28.7, 3\sigma, 1" diameter)
over this large an area (4.83 arcmin^2) and provide the best escape fraction
constraints for any galaxy at any redshift. We do not detect any individual
galaxies, with 3\sigma limits to the Lyman Continuum (~700 \AA) flux 50--149
times fainter (in f_nu) than the rest-frame UV (1500 \AA) continuum fluxes.
Correcting for the mean IGM attenuation (factor ~2), as well as an intrinsic
stellar Lyman Break (~3), these limits translate to relative escape fraction
limits of f_{esc,rel}<[0.03,0.21]. The stacked limit is
f_{esc,rel}(3\sigma)<0.02. We use a Monte Carlo simulation to properly account
for the expected distribution of IGM opacities. When including constraints from
previous surveys at z~1.3 we find that, at the 95% confidence level, no more
than 8% of star--forming galaxies at z~1.3 can have relative escape fractions
greater than 0.50. Alternatively, if the majority of galaxies have low, but
non-zero, escaping Lyman Continuum, the escape fraction can not be more than
0.04. Both the stacked limits, and the limits from the Monte Carlo simulation
suggest that the average ionizing emissivity (relative to non-ionizing UV
emissivity) at z~1.3 is significantly lower than has been observed in Lyman
Break Galaxies (LBGs) at z~3. If the ionizing emissivity of star-forming
galaxies is in fact increasing with redshift, it would help to explain the high
photoionization rates seen in the IGM at z>4 and reionization of the
intergalactic medium at z>6. [Abridged]
