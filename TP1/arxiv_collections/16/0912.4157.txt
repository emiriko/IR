In this work, we report electronic structure calculations aimed at computing
the linear optical absorption spectrum, and static dipole polarizablity of a
newly proposed boron-based planar aromatic compound borozene (B_12H_6$. For the
purpose, we use the semiempirical INDO model Hamiltonian, accompanied by
large-scale correlation calculations using the multi-reference singles-doubles
configuration-interaction (MRSDCI) approach. We present detailed predictions
about the energetics, polarization properties, and the nature of many-particle
states contributing to various peaks in the linear absorption spectrum. Our
results can be used to characterize this material in future optical absorption
experiments. We also argue that one can deduce the aromaticity of the cluster
from the optical absorption and static polarizability results.
