According to a usual reading, decoherence is a process resulting from the
interaction between a small system and its large environment where information
and energy are dissipated. The particular models treated in the literature on
the subject reinforce this idea since, in general, the behavior of a particle
immersed in a large "bath" composed by many particles is studied. The aim of
this letter is to warn against this usual simplified reading. By means of the
analysis of a well-known model, we will show that decoherence may occur in a
system interacting with an environment consisting of only one particle.
