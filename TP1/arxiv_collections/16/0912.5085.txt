The optical and infrared spectra of a wide variety of `cool' astronomical
objects including the Sun, sunspots, K-, M- and S-type stars, carbon stars,
brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets are reviewed. The review provides the
necessary astronomical background for chemical physicists to understand and
appreciate the unique molecular environments found in astronomy. The
calculation of molecular opacities needed to simulate the observed spectral
energy distributions is discussed.
