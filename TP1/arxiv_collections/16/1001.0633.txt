In our present study, the observed linear polarization data of comet
Hyakutake are studied at wavelengths $\lambda=0.365\mu m$, $\lambda=0.485\mu m$
and 0.684$\mu m$ through simulations using Ballistic Particle-Cluster Aggregate
and Ballistic Cluster-Cluster Aggregate aggregates of 128 spherical monomers.
We first investigated that the size parameter of the monomer, $x$ $\sim$ 1.56
-- 1.70, turned out to be most suitable which provides the best fits to the
observed dust scattering properties at three wavelengths $\lambda = 0.365$$\mu
m$, 0.485$\mu m$ and 0.684$\mu m$. Thus the effective radius of the aggregate
(r) lies in the range $0.45 \mu m \le r \le 0.49 \mu m$ at $\lambda =
0.365$$\mu m$; $ 0.60 \mu m \le r \le 0.66 \mu m$ at $\lambda = 0.485$$\mu m$
and $0.88 \mu m \le r \le 0.94 \mu m$ at $\lambda = 0.684$$\mu m$. Now using
superposition \textsc{t-matrix} code and the power-law size distribution, $n(r)
\sim r^{-3}$, the best-fitting values of complex refractive indices are
calculated which can best fit the observed polarization data at the above three
wavelengths. The best-fitting complex refractive indices $(n,k)$ are found to
be (1.745, 0.095) at $\lambda = 0.365 $ $\mu m$, (1.743, 0.100) at $\lambda =
0.485 $ $\mu m$ and (1.695, 0.100) at $\lambda = 0.684$ $\mu m$. The refractive
indices coming out from the present analysis correspond to mixture of both
silicates and organics, which are in good agreement with the \textit{in situ}
measurement of comets by different spacecraft.
