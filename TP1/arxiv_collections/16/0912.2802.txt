In a class of direct gauge mediation with a perturbatively stable SUSY
breaking vacuum, gaugino masses vanish at the leading order of SUSY breaking
F-term. We study the allowed parameter space of the gauge mediation models. By
imposing a Tevatron bound on the lightest chargino mass m_{{\tilde \chi}^\pm_1}
> 270 GeV and a warm dark-matter mass bound on the light gravitino mass m_{3/2}
< 16 eV, we find that almost all the parameter space is excluded. Near future
experiments may completely exclude, or possibly discover, the scenario.
