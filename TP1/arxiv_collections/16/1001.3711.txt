Sub-wavelength dielectric gratings (SWG) have emerged recently as a promising
alternative to distributed-Bragg-reflection (DBR) dielectric stacks for
broadband, high-reflectivity filtering applications. A SWG structure composed
of a single dielectric layer with the appropriate patterning can sometimes
perform as well as thirty or forty dielectric DBR layers, while providing new
functionalities such as polarization control and near-field amplification. In
this paper, we introduce a remarkable property of grating mirrors that cannot
be realized by their DBR counterpart: we show that a non-periodic patterning of
the grating surface can give full control over the phase front of reflected
light while maintaining a high reflectivity. This new feature of dielectric
gratings could have a substantial impact on a number of applications that
depend on low-cost, compact optical components, from laser cavities to CD/DVD
read/write heads.
