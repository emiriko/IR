We discuss an effect of the electrostatic field on superconductivity near the
surface. First, we use the microscopic theory of de Gennes to show that the
electric field changes the boundary condition for the Ginzburg-Landau function.
Second, the effect of the electric field is evaluated in the vicinity of
$H_{\rm c3}$, where the boundary condition plays a crucial role. We predict
that the field effect on the surface superconductivity leads to a discontinuity
of the magnetocapacitance. We estimate that the predicted discontinuity is
accessible for nowadays experimental tools and materials. It is shown that the
magnitude of this discontinuity can be used to predict the dependence of the
critical temperature on the charge carrier density which can be tailored by
doping.
