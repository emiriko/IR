We obtain the projected mass distributions for two Subaru/Suprime-Cam fields
in the southwest region (r\simlt 60') of the Coma cluster (z=0.0236) by weak
lensing analysis and detect eight subclump candidates. We quantify the
contribution of background large-scale structure (LSS) on the projected mass
distributions using SDSS multi-bands and photometric data, under the assumption
of mass-to-light ratio for field galaxies. We find that one of eight subclump
candidates, which is not associated with any member galaxies, is significantly
affected by LSS lensing. The mean projected mass for seven subclumps extracted
from the main cluster potential is <M_2D^(corr)> = (5.06\pm1.30)10^12h^-1 M_sun
after a LSS correction. A tangential distortion profile over an ensemble of
subclumps is well described by a truncated singular-isothermal sphere model and
a truncated NFW model. A typical truncated radius of subclumps, r_t\simeq 35
h^-1 kpc, is derived without assuming any relations between mass and light for
member galaxies. The radius coincides well with the tidal radius, \sim42 h^-1
kpc, of the gravitational force of the main cluster. Taking into account the
incompleteness of data area, a projection effect and spurious lensing peaks, it
is expected that mass of cluster substructures account for 19 percent of the
virial mass, with 13 percent statistical error. The mass fraction of cluster
substructures is in rough agreement with numerical simulations.
