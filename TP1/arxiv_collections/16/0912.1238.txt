The Science Shop model was initiated in the Netherlands in the 1970s. Part of
the model is the modest scale of the operation. The crucial idea behind the
Science Shops involves a working relationship between knowledge-producing
institutions like universities and citizen groups that need relevant questions
answered. In providing this link, the relations between science and the public
can be stimulated by providing such groups with access to the university and by
offering active mediation of these questions. This research addresses the
question of the external visibility of Science Shop work in terms of
communications which reach beyond the local context of the participants. In
addition to the question of the effects of this specific type of communication
in terms of publications, institutional development, and curriculum
development, we study the communication of the results in the press, the
popular and grey literature, and other means of communication insofar as
retrievable on distance through the Internet.
