The rich acoustic oscillation spectrum in solar-type variables make these
stars particularly interesting for studying fluid-dynamical aspects of the
stellar interior. I present a summary of the properties of solar-like
oscillations, how they are excited and damped and discuss some of the recent
progress in using asteroseismic diagnostic techniques for analysing low-degree
acoustic modes. Also the effects of stellar-cycle variations in low-mass
main-sequence stars are addressed.
