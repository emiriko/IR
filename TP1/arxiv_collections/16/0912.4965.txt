The thermodynamics of the quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square
lattice is revisited through a linearized spin-wave theory which is well
defined at any finite temperature. We re-examine in details the temperature
dependence of the free energy, the internal energy, the entropy and the
specific heat. Most conclusions of the thermodynamics in previous studies can
be reproduced in our linearized spin-wave theory. Specially, our calculation at
low temperature $T<J$ agrees quantitatively with the numerical Quantum Monte
Carlo simulation and high temperature series expansions.
