An approach for simulating bionanosystems, such as viruses and ribosomes, is
presented. This calibration-free approach is based on an all-atom description
for bionanosystems, a universal interatomic force field, and a multiscale
perspective. The supramillion-atom nature of these bionanosystems prohibits the
use of a direct molecular dynamics approach for phenomena like viral structural
transitions or self-assembly that develop over milliseconds or longer. A key
element of these multiscale systems is the cross-talk between, and consequent
strong coupling of, processes over many scales in space and time. We elucidate
the role of interscale cross-talk and overcome bionanosystem simulation
difficulties with automated construction of order parameters (OPs) describing
supra-nanometer scale structural features, construction of OP dependent
ensembles describing the statistical properties of atomistic variables that
ultimately contribute to the entropies driving the dynamics of the OPs, and the
derivation of a rigorous equation for the stochastic dynamics of the OPs. Since
the atomic scale features of the system are treated statistically, several
ensembles are constructed that reflect various experimental conditions. The
theory provides a basis for a practical, quantitative bionanosystem modeling
approach that preserves the cross-talk between the atomic and nanoscale
features. A method for integrating information from nanotechnical experimental
data in the derivation of equations of stochastic OP dynamics is also
introduced.
