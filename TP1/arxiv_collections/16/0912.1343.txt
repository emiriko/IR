We aim at investigating potential biases in lensing and X-ray methods to
measure the cluster mass profiles. We do so by performing realistic simulations
of lensing and X-ray observations that are subsequently analyzed using
observational techniques. The resulting mass estimates are compared among them
and with the input models. Three clusters obtained from state-of-the-art
hydrodynamical simulations, each of which has been projected along three
independent lines-of-sight, are used for this analysis. We find that strong
lensing models can be trusted over a limited region around the cluster core.
Extrapolating the strong lensing mass models to outside the Einstein ring can
lead to significant biases in the mass estimates, if the BCG is not modeled
properly for example. Weak lensing mass measurements can be largely affected by
substructures, depending on the method implemented to convert the shear into a
mass estimate. Using non-parametric methods which combine weak and strong
lensing data, the projected masses within R200 can be constrained with a
precision of ~10%. De-projection of lensing masses increases the scatter around
the true masses by more than a factor of two due to cluster triaxiality. X-ray
mass measurements have much smaller scatter (about a factor of two smaller than
the lensing masses) but they are generally biased low by 5-20%. This bias is
ascribable to bulk motions in the gas of our simulated clusters. Using the
lensing and the X-ray masses as proxies for the true and the hydrostatic
equilibrium masses of the simulated clusters and averaging over the cluster
sample we are able to measure the lack of hydrostatic equilibrium in the
systems we have investigated.
