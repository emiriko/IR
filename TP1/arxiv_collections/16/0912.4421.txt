Alternative cosmologies, based on extensions of General Relativity, predict
modified thermal histories in the Early Universe during the pre Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis (BBN) era, epoch which is not directly constrained by
cosmological observations. When the expansion rate is enhanced with respect to
the standard case, thermal relics typically decouple with larger relic
abundances. The correct value of the relic abundance is therefore obtained for
larger annihilation cross--sections, as compared to standard cosmology. A
direct consequence is that indirect detection rates are enhanced. Extending
previous analyses of ours, we derive updated astrophysical bounds on the dark
matter annihilation cross sections and use them to constrain alternative
cosmologies in the pre--BBN era. We also determine the characteristics of these
alternative cosmologies in order to provide the correct value of relic
abundance for a thermal relic for the (large) annihilation cross--section
required to explain the PAMELA results on the positron fraction, therefore
providing a "cosmological boost" solution to the dark matter interpretation of
the PAMELA data.
