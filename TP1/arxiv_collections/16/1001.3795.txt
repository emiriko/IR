A non-Boolean extension of the classical probability model is proposed. The
non-Boolean probabilities reproduce typical quantum phenomena. The proposed
model is more general and more abstract, but easier to interpret, than the
quantum mechanical Hilbert space formalism and exhibits a particular phenomenon
(state-independent conditional probabilities) which may provide new
opportunities for an understanding of the quantum measurement process. Examples
of the proposed model are provided, using Jordan operator algebras.
