Results of the experiments on daemon detection performed in St-Petersburg in
March 2009 are presented. Adding the data obtained with the daemon-sensitive
FEU-167-1 PM tubes to the data amassed in our previous measurements (starting
from 2000) raises the confidence level of existence of the spring maximum in
NEACHO (near-Earth almost circular heliocentric orbit) daemon flux to ~5Sigma.
The first test experiments conducted with the "dark" electron multiplier tubes,
- TEU-167 with a thick (~0.5 um) Al coating over all of the inner surface of
the near-cathode multiplier section, including also its front screen, look
encouraging. They provide supportive evidence for the existence of diurnal
modulation of the daemon flux and offer ~3.4x10-7 cm-2s-1 for its lower limit
in March, in good agreement with our earlier estimates and measurements.
