We have carried out a Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) Cycle 1 guest
investigator program covering 56 square degrees near the Taurus T association
and 12 square degrees along the northern edge of the Upper Scorpius OB
association. We combined photometry in the GALEX FUV and NUV bands with data
from the Two Micron All Sky Survey to identify candidate young (<100 Myr old)
stars as those with an ultraviolet excess relative to older main sequence
stars. Follow-up spectroscopy of a partial sample of these candidates suggest 5
new members of Taurus, with 8-20 expected from additional observations, and 5
new members of Upper Scorpius, with 3-6 expected from additional observations.
These candidate new members appear to represent a distributed, non-clustered
population in either region, although our sample statistics are as of yet too
poor to constrain the nature or extent of this population. Rather, our study
demonstrates the ability of GALEX observations to identify young stellar
populations distributed over a wide area of the sky. We also highlight the
necessity of a better understanding of the Galactic ultraviolet source
population to support similar investigations. In particular, we report a large
population of stars with an ultraviolet excess but no optical indicators of
stellar activity or accretion, and briefly argue against several
interpretations of these sources.
