We compute gluon and quark propagators in 2-colour QCD at large baryon
chemical potential mu. The gluon propagator is found to be antiscreened in the
superfluid, confined phase and screened in the large-mu, deconfined phase. We
present the first attempt to determine corresponding electric and magnetic
gluon masses. The quark propagator undergoes dramatic modifications in the
superfluid region as a result of the formation of a superfluid gap. These
modifications include the appearance of zero crossings in the vector part of
the (normal) quark propagator, a large suppression of the scalar part, and the
emergence of anomalous propagation.
