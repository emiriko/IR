We derive a simple formula for the stopping distance for a high-energy quark
traveling through a weakly-coupled quark gluon plasma. The result is given to
next-to-leading-order in an expansion in inverse logarithms ln(E/T), where T is
the temperature of the plasma. We also define a stopping distance for gluons
and give a leading-log result. Discussion of stopping distance has a
theoretical advantage over discussion of energy loss rates in that stopping
distances can be generalized to the case of strong coupling, where one may not
speak of individual partons.
