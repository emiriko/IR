We assume gravity in a $d$-dimensional manifold $M$ and consider a splitting
of the form $M=M_{p}\times M_{q}$, with $d=p+q$. The most general two-block
metric associated with $M_{p}$ and $M_{q}$ is used to derive the corresponding
Einstein-Hilbert action $\mathcal{S}$. We focus on the special case of two
distinct conformal factors $\psi $ and $\phi $ ($\psi $ for the metric in
$M_{p}$ and $\phi $ for the metric in $M_{q}$), and we write the action
$\mathcal{S}$ in the form $\mathcal{S=S}_{p}\mathcal{+S}%_{q} $, where
$\mathcal{S}_{p}$ and $\mathcal{S}_{q}$ are actions associated with $M_{p}$ and
$M_{q}$, respectively. We show that a simplified action is obtained precisely
when $\psi =\phi ^{-1}$. In this case, we find that under the duality
transformation $\phi \leftrightarrow \phi ^{-1}$, the action $\mathcal{S}_{p}$
for the $M_{p}$-space or the action $\mathcal{S}%_{q}$ for the $M_{q}$-space
remain invariant, but not both. This result establishes an analogy between
Farkas property in oriented matroid theory and duality in general relativity.
Furthermore, we argue that our approach can be used in several physical
scenarios such as 2t physics and cosmology.
