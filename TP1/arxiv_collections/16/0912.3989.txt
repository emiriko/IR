The geometric nature of Euler fluids has been clearly identified and
extensively studied over the years, culminating with Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
descriptions of fluid dynamics where the configuration space is defined as the
volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, and Kelvin's circulation theorem is viewed
as a consequence of Noether's theorem associated with the particle relabeling
symmetry of fluid mechanics. However computational approaches to fluid
mechanics have been largely derived from a numerical-analytic point of view,
and are rarely designed with structure preservation in mind, and often suffer
from spurious numerical artifacts such as energy and circulation drift. In
contrast, this paper geometrically derives discrete equations of motion for
fluid dynamics from first principles in a purely Eulerian form. Our approach
approximates the group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms using a finite
dimensional Lie group, and associated discrete Euler equations are derived from
a variational principle with non-holonomic constraints. The resulting discrete
equations of motion yield a structure-preserving time integrator with good
long-term energy behavior and for which an exact discrete Kelvin's circulation
theorem holds.
