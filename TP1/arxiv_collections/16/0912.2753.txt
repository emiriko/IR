We summarize our recent work dealing with the construction of the
nucleon-nucleon potential and associated electromagnetic currents up to one
loop in chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT). The magnetic dipole
operators derived from these currents are then used in hybrid calculations of
static properties and low-energy radiative capture processes in few-body
nuclei. A preliminary set of results are presented for the magnetic moments of
the deuteron and trinucleons and thermal neutron captures on $p$, $d$, and
$^3$He.
