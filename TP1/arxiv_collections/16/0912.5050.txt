In this note we discuss some observations concerning the possible local
parity violation in heavy ion collisions recently announced by the STAR
Collaboration. Our results can be summarized as follows (i) the measured
correlations for same charge pairs are mainly in-plain and not out of plane,
(ii) if there is a parity violating component it is large and, surprisingly, of
the same magnitude as the background, and (iii) the observed dependence of the
signal on the transverse momentum (p_t) is consistent with a soft boost in p_t
and thus in line with expectations from the proposed chiral magnetic effect.
