This paper is a contribution to the theoretical foundations of strategies. We
first present a general definition of abstract strategies which is extensional
in the sense that a strategy is defined explicitly as a set of derivations of
an abstract reduction system. We then move to a more intensional definition
supporting the abstract view but more operational in the sense that it
describes a means for determining such a set. We characterize the class of
extensional strategies that can be defined intensionally. We also give some
hints towards a logical characterization of intensional strategies and propose
a few challenging perspectives.
