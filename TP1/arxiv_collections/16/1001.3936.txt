Repeated observations with high spectral resolution acquired in 1998-2008 are
used to study the temporal behavior of the spectral line profiles and velocity
field in the atmosphere and circumstellar envelope of the post-AGB star
V448Lac. Asymmetry of the profiles of the strongest absorption lines with
low-level excitation potentials less 1eV and time variations of these profiles
have been detected, most prominently the profiles of the resonance lines of
BaII, YII, LaII, SiII. The peculiarity of these profiles can be explained using
a superposition of stellar absorption line and shell emission lines. Emission
in the (0;1) 5635A Swan band of the C2 molecule has been detected in the
spectrum of V448Lac for the first time. The core of the Halpha line displays
radial velocity variations with an amplitude ~8 km/s. Radial velocity
variations displayed by weakest metallic lines with lower amplitudes, 1-2 km/s,
may be due to atmospheric pulsations. Differential line shifts, 0 -- 8 km/s,
have been detected on various dates. The position of the molecular spectrum is
stationary in time, indicating a constant expansion velocity of the
circumstellar shell, Vexp=15.2 km/s, as derived from the C2 and NaI lines.
