The magnetic ordering and crystal structure of iron pnictide SrFeAsF was
investigated by using neutron powder diffraction method. With decreasing
temperature, the tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition is found at 180 K,
while the paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase transition set in at 133 K.
Similar to the parent compound of other iron pnictide system, the striped Fe
magnetism is confirmed in antiferromagnetic phase and the Fe moment of 0.58(6)
uB aligned along long a axis. The thermal expansion of orthorhombic phase of
SrFeAsF is also investigated. Based on the Grueneisen approximation and Debye
approximation for internal energy, the volume of SrFeAsF can be well fitted
with Debye temperature of 347(5) K. The experimental atomic displacement
parameters for different crystallographic sites in SrFeAsF are analyzed with
Debye model. The results suggested that the expansion of FeAs layers plays an
important role in determining the thermal expansion coefficient.
