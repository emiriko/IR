We study the possibility of performing quantum state reconstruction from a
measurement record that is obtained as a sequence of expectation values of a
Hermitian operator evolving under repeated application of a single random
unitary map, U_0. We show that while this single-parameter orbit in operator
space is not informationally complete, it can be used to yield surprisingly
high-fidelity reconstruction. For a d-dimensional Hilbert space with the
initial observable in su(d), the measurement record lacks information about a
matrix subspace of dimension > d-2 out of the total dimension d^2-1. We
determine the conditions on U_0 such that the bound is saturated, and show they
are achieved by almost all pseudorandom unitary matrices. When we further
impose the constraint that the physical density matrix must be positive, we
obtain even higher fidelity than that predicted from the missing subspace. With
prior knowledge that the state is pure, the reconstruction will be perfect (in
the limit of vanishing noise) and for arbitrary mixed states, the fidelity is
over 0.96, even for small d, and reaching F > 0.99 for d > 9. We also study the
implementation of this protocol based on the relationship between random
matrices and quantum chaos. We show that the Floquet operator of the quantum
kicked top provides a means of generating the required type of measurement
record, with implications on the relationship between quantum chaos and
information gain.
