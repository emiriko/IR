A unit test is a method for verifying the accuracy and the proper functioning
of a portion of a program. This work consists to study the relation and the
approaches to test Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) programs and to propose a
metamodel that enables the programmer to write the tests while writing the
source code to be tested by exploiting the key features of OOP programming
languages such as inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
