This paper presents an analysis on nonstandard generalized Hopf bifurcation
in a class of switched systems where the lost of stability of linearized
systems is not due to the crossing of their complex conjugate eigenvalues but
relevant to the switching laws between the subslystems. Thus is remarkably
different from the mechanism of the Hopf bifurcation and the generalized Hopf
bifurcation studied in the literature.
