This paper investigates a family of dynamical systems arising from an
evolutionary re-interpretation of certain optimal control and optimization
problems. We focus particularly on the application in image registration of the
theory of \emph{metamorphosis}. Metamorphosis is a means of tracking the
optimal changes of shape that are necessary for registration of images with
various types of data structures, without requiring that the transformations of
shape be diffeomorphisms. This is a rich field whose possibilities are just
beginning to be developed. In particular, metamorphosis and its related
variants in the geometric approach to control and optimization can be expected
to produce many exciting opportunities for new applications and analysis in
geometric dynamics.
