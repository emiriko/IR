We construct a model of M-theory vacua using gauged S-duality and the
Chan-Paton symmetries by introducing an infinite number of open string charges.
In the Bechi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin formalism, the local description of the gauged
S-duality on its moduli space of vacua is fully determined by one physical
state condition on the vacua. We introduce the string probe of the spatial
degrees of freedom and define the increment of the cosmic time. The
dimensionality of space-time and the gauge group of the low energy effective
theory originate in the symmetries (with or without their breakdown) in our
model. This modeling leads to the derived category formulation of the quantum
mechanical world including gravity and to the concept of a non-linear potential
of gauged and affinized S-duality which specifies the morphism structure of
this derived category.
