We review recent experiments on dewetting thin films of evaporating colloidal
nanoparticle suspensions (nanofluids) and discuss several theoretical
approaches to describe the ongoing processes including coupled transport and
phase changes. These approaches range from microscopic discrete stochastic
theories to mesoscopic continuous deterministic descriptions. In particular, we
describe (i) a microscopic kinetic Monte Carlo model, (ii) a dynamical density
functional theory and (iii) a hydrodynamic thin film model.
  Models (i) and (ii) are employed to discuss the formation of polygonal
networks, spinodal and branched structures resulting from the dewetting of an
ultrathin 'postcursor film' that remains behind a mesoscopic dewetting front.
We highlight, in particular, the presence of a transverse instability in the
evaporative dewetting front, which results in highly branched fingering
structures. The subtle interplay of decomposition in the film and contact line
motion is discussed.
  Finally, we discuss a simple thin film model (iii) of the hydrodynamics on
the mesoscale. We employ coupled evolution equations for the film thickness
profile and mean particle concentration. The model is used to discuss the
self-pinning and depinning of a contact line related to the 'coffee-stain'
effect.
  In the course of the review we discuss the advantages and limitations of the
different theories, as well as possible future developments and extensions.
