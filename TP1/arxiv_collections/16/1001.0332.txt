Kerr-Schild (KS) geometry is based on a congruence of twistor null lines
which forms a holographic space-time determined by the Kerr theorem. We
describe in details integration of the non-stationary Debney-Kerr-Schild
equations for electromagnetic excitations of black-holes taking into account
the consistent back-reaction to metric. The exact KS solutions have the form of
singular beam-like pulses supported on twistor null lines of the Kerr
congruence. These twistor-beam pulses have very strong back reaction to metric
and BH horizon and produce a fluctuating holographic KS geometry which takes an
intermediate position between the Classical and Quantum gravity.
