We study superconductivity in the two-dimensional 16-band d-p model extracted
from a tight-binding fit to the band structure of LaFeAsO, using the random
phase approximation. When the intraorbital repulsion U is larger than the
interorbital one U', an extended s-wave (s+--wave) pairing with sign reversal
of order parameter is mediated by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations, while
when U<U' another kind of s-wave (s++-wave) pairing without sign reversal is
mediated by ferro-orbital fluctuations. The s++-wave pairing is enhanced due to
the electron-phonon coupling and then can be expanded over the realistic
parameter region with U>U'.
