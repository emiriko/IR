Bohmian trajectories have been used for various purposes, including the
numerical simulation of the time-dependent Schroedinger equation and the
visualization of time-dependent wave functions. We review the purpose they were
invented for: to serve as the foundation of quantum mechanics, i.e., to explain
quantum mechanics in terms of a theory that is free of paradoxes and allows an
understanding that is as clear as that of classical mechanics. Indeed, they
succeed in serving that purpose in the context of a theory known as Bohmian
mechanics, to which this article is an introduction.
