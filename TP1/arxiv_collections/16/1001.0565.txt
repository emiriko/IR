We suggest a new efficient way to constrain a certain class of large scale
modifications of gravity. We show that the scale-free relation between density
and size of Dark Matter halos, predicted within the LambdaCDM model with
Newtonian gravity, gets modified in a wide class of theories of modified
gravity.
