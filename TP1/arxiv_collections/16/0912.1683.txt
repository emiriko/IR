In recent works, we have proposed a possible dark matter in composite
messenger gauge mediation models. In this paper, we discuss the details of a
composite messenger model taking a possible supersymmetry breaking scenario and
show that the correct dark matter abundance and a successful gauge mediation
can be realized.
