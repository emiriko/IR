In order to generate prime implicants for a given cube (minterm), most of
minimization methods increase the dimension of this cube by removing one
literal from it at a time. But there are two problems of exponential
complexity. One of them is the selection of the order in which the literals are
to be removed from the implicant at hand. The latter is the mechanism that
checks whether a tentative literal removal is acceptable. The reduced Offset
concept has been developed to avoid of these problems. This concept is based on
positional-cube representation where each cube is represented by two n-bit
strings. We show that each reduced Off-cube may be represented by a single
n-bit string and propose a set of bitwise operations to be performed on such
strings. The experiments on single-output benchmarks show that this approach
can significantly speed up the minimization process, improve the quality of its
results and reduce the amount of memory required for this aim.
