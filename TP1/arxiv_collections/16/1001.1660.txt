The measurement of ultra-high energy cosmic rays is an unique way to study
article interactions at energies which are well above the capability of current
accelerators. Significant progress in this field has occurred during last
years, particularly due to the measurements made at the Pierre Auger
Observatory. The important results which were achieved during last years are
described here. Also future plans for the study of cosmic rays are presented.
