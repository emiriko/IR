We present Submillimeter Array observations of the GQ Lup system at 1.3
millimeters wavelength with $0\farcs4$ ($\sim$60 AU) resolution. Emission is
detected from the position of the primary star, GQ Lup A, and is marginally
resolved. No emission is detected from the substellar companion, GQ Lup B,
$0\farcs7$ away. These data, together with models of the spectral energy
distribution, suggest a compact disk around GQ Lup A with mass $\sim 3$
M$_{Jup}$, perhaps truncated by tidal forces. There is no evidence for a gap or
hole in the disk that might be the signature of an additional inner companion
body capable of scattering GQ Lup B out to $\sim100$ AU separation from GQ Lup
A. For GQ Lup B to have formed {\it in situ}, the disk would have to have been
much more massive and extended.
