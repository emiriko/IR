We present a model example of a quantum critical behavior of renormalized
single-particle Wannier function composed of Slater s-orbitals and represented
in an adjustable Gaussian STO-7G basis, which is calculated for cubic lattices
in the Gutzwiller correlated state near the metal-insulator transition (MIT).
The discussion is carried out within the extended Hubbard model and the method
of approach proposed earlier [cf. Eur. Phys. J. B {\bf 66}, 385 (2008)]. The
component atomic-wave-function size, the Wannier function maximum, as well as
the system energy, all scale with the increasing lattice parameter $R$ as
$[(R-R_{c})/R_{c}]^{s}$ with $s$ in the interval $[0.9,1.0]$. Such scaling law
is interpreted as evidence of a dominant role of the interparticle Coulomb
repulsion, which for $R>R_c$ is of intersite character. Relation of the
insulator-metal transition lattice-parameter value $R=R_{c}$ to the original
{\em Mott criterion} is also obtained. The method feasibility is tested by
comparing our results with the exact approach for the Hubbard chain, for which
the Mott-Hubbard transition is absent. In view of unique features of our
results, an extensive discussion in qualitative terms is also provided.
