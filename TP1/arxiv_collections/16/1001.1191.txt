A scheme for coupling superconducting charge qubits via a one-dimensional
superconducting transmission line resonator is proposed. The qubits are working
at their optimal points, where they are immune to the charge noise and possess
long decoherence time. Analysis on the dynamical time evolution of the
interaction is presented, which is shown to be insensitive to the initial state
of the resonator field. This scheme enables fast gate operation and is readily
scalable to multiqubit scenario.
