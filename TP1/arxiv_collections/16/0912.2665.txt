Let $G$ be a Lie Group with a left invariant connection such that its
connection function is skew-symmetric. Our main goal is to show a version of
Pluzhnikov's Theorem for this kind of connection. To this end, we use the
stochastic logarithm. More exactly, the stochastic logarithm gives
characterizations for Brownian motions and Martingales in $G$, and these
characterzations are used to prove Pluzhnikov's Theorem.
