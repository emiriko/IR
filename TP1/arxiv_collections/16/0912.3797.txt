The requirements of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) and correct thermal
relic density of Dark Matter (DM) predict large spin-independent direct
detection cross section in scalar DM models based on underlying SO(10)
non-supersymmetric GUT. Interpreting the CDMS signal events as DM recoil on
nuclei, we study implications of this assumption on EWSB, Higgs boson mass and
direct production of scalar DM at LHC experiments. We show that this
interpretation indicates relatively light DM, M_DM ~ O(100) GeV, with large
pair production cross section at LHC in correlation with the spin-independent
direct DM detection cross section. The next-to-lightest dark scalar S_NL is
predicted to be long-lived, providing distinctive experimental signatures of
displaced vertex of two leptons or jets plus missing transverse energy.
