In this paper we describe qualitatively some aspects of the holographic QCD.
Inspired by a successfull 4D description, we try to separate the Confinement
and the Chiral Symmetry Breaking dynamics. We also discuss the realization of
the baryons as skyrmions in Soft Wall Holographic QCD, and the issue of the
Vector Meson Dominance.
