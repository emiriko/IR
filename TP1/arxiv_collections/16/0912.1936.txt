We report observation of anisotropic surface plasmon-coupled emission (SPCE)
from structured PMMA films doped with Rhodamine B (RhB) and deposited on silver
films. For a given structure, it is observed that relative position of incident
laser spot to the structured PMMA and polarization properties of the laser beam
can be used to modulate the SPCE patterns. The proposed method enables
azimuthally controlling directional SPCE in a deterministic manner.
