The population of binary systems known to emit in the GeV and TeV bands
consists of only a few firmly identified Galactic sources. These rare objects
constitute extreme particle accelerators operating under varying, but regularly
repeating, conditions. As such, they provide access to a unique laboratory in
which to study particle acceleration, and the nature of gamma-ray production,
emission and absorption processes near compact objects. Here we review the
current observational status of the field, and discuss some of the recent
interpretations of the results.
