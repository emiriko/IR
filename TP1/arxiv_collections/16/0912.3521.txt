We investigate different neutrino signals from the decay of dark matter
particles to determine the prospects for their detection, and more specifically
if any spectral signature can be disentangled from the background in present
and future neutrino observatories. If detected, such a signal could bring an
independent confirmation of the dark matter interpretation of the dramatic rise
in the positron fraction above 10 GeV recently observed by the PAMELA satellite
experiment and offer the possibility of distinguishing between astrophysical
sources and dark matter decay or annihilation. In combination with other
signals, it may also be possible to distinguish among different dark matter
decay channels.
