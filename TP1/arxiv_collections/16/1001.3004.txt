The STEREO mission has been providing stereoscopic view of the filament
eruptions in EUV wavelengths. The most extended view during filament eruptions
is seen in He II 304 \AA observations, as the filament spine appears darker and
sharper. The projected filament width appears differently when viewed from
different angles by STEREO satellites. Here, we present a method for estimating
the width and inclination of the filament sheet using He II 304 \AA\
observations by STEREO-A and B satellites from the two viewpoints. The width of
the filament sheet, when measured from its feet to its apex, gives estimate of
filament height above the chromosphere.
