This chapter describes the main architectures proposed in the literature to
implement the channel decoders required by the WiMax standard, namely
convolutional codes, turbo codes (both block and convolutional) and LDPC. Then
it shows a complete design of a convolutional turbo code encoder/decoder system
for WiMax.
