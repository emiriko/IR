Launched on the 11th of June 2008, the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has
made several outstanding scientific contributions to the high energy
astrophysics community. One of these contributions was the high statistics
measurement of the Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) electron + positron spectrum from
20 GeV to 1 TeV. The Fermi satellite is in a nearly circular orbit with an
inclination of 25.6 degrees at an altitude of 565 km. Given this orbit it is
possible to measure the GCR electrons + positrons down to roughly 5 GeV.
However, this lower limit in energy is highly dependent on the orbital position
of the LAT in geomagnetic coordinates due to the rigidity cutoff. In order to
measure the spectrum down to these energies it is necessary to sample the
population of electrons + positrons in several different geomagnetic positions.
In this poster we present the analysis performed to extend the lower limit in
energy of the GCR electron + positron spectrum measured by the Fermi LAT.
