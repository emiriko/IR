The capillary-induced structural instability of an elastic circular tube
partially filled by a liquid is studied by combining theoretical analysis and
molecular dynamics simulations. The analysis shows that, associated with the
instability, there is a well-defined length scale (elasto-capillary length),
which exhibits a scaling relationship with the characteristic length of the
tube, regardless of the interaction details. We validate this scaling
relationship for a carbon nanotube partially filled by liquid iron. The
capillary-induced structural transformation could have potential applications
for nano-devices.
