Hyperon-nucleons interactions constructed by two frameworks, the
Kyoto-Niigata SU$_6$ quark model and the chiral effective field theory, are
compared by investigating equivalent interactions in a low-momentum space and
in addition by calculating hyperon single-particle potentials in the
lowest-order Brueckner theory in symmetric nuclear matter. Two descriptions are
shown to give similar matrix elements in most channels after renormalizing high
momentum components. Although the range of the $\Lambda N$ interaction is
different in two potentials, the $\Lambda$ single-particle potential in nuclear
matter is very similar. The $\Sigma$-nucleus and $\Xi$-nucleus potentials are
also found to be similar. These predictions are to be confronted with
forthcoming experimental data.
