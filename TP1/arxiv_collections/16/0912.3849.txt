As the deepest group V donor in Si, Bi has by far the largest hyperfine
interaction, and also a large I=9/2 nuclear spin. At zero field this splits the
donor ground state into states having total spin 5 and 4, which are fully
resolved in the photoluminescence spectrum of Bi donor bound excitons. Under a
magnetic field, the 60 expected allowed transitions cannot be individually
resolved, but the effects of the nuclear spin distribution, -9/2 <= I_z <= 9/2,
are clearly observed. A strong hyperpolarization of the nuclear spin, with sign
opposite to the expected equilibrium polarization, is observed to result from
the nonresonant optical excitation. This is very similar to the recently
reported optical hyperpolarization of P donors observed by EPR at higher
magnetic fields. We introduce a new model to explain this effect, and predict
that it may be very fast.
