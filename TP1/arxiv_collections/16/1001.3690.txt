We present an 880 micron Submillimeter Array (SMA) detection of the
submillimeter galaxy SXDF850.6. SXDF850.6 is a bright source (S(850 micron) = 8
mJy) detected in the SCUBA Half Degree Extragalactic Survey (SHADES), and has
multiple possible radio counterparts in its deep radio image obtained at the
VLA. Our new SMA detection finds that the submm emission coincides with the
brightest radio emission that is found ~8" north of the coordinates determined
from SCUBA. Despite the lack of detectable counterparts in deep UV/optical
images, we find a source at the SMA position in near-infrared and longer
wavelength images. We perform SED model fits to UV-optical-IR photometry (u, B,
V, R, i', z', J, H, K, 3.6 micron, 4.5 micron, 5.8 micron, and 8.0 micron) and
to submm-radio photometry (850 micron, 880 micron, 1100 micron, and 21 cm)
independently, and we find both are well described by starburst templates at a
redshift of z ~= 2.2 (+/- 0.3). The best-fit parameters from the UV-optical-IR
SED fit are a redshift of z = 1.87 (+0.15/-0.07), a stellar mass of M_star =
2.5 +2.2/-0.3 x 10^11 M_sun, an extinction of A_V = 3.0 (+0.3/-1.0) mag, and an
age of 720 (+1880/-210) Myr. The submm-radio SED fit provides a consistent
redshift of z ~ 1.8-2.5, an IR luminosity of L_IR = (7-26) x 10^12 L_sun, and a
star formation rate of 1300-4500 M_sun/yr. These results suggest that SXDF850.6
is a mature system already having a massive amount of old stellar population
constructed before its submm bright phase and is experiencing a dusty
starburst, possibly induced by major mergers.
