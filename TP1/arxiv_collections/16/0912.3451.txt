We consider a physical scenario for ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions
where, at the early stage, only transverse degrees of freedom of partons are
thermalized, while the longitudinal motion is described by free streaming. When
the energy density of the partonic system drops to a certain critical value,
the partons hadronize and the newly formed hadronic system freezes out. This
sudden change is described with the help of the Landau matching conditions
followed by the simulations done with THERMINATOR. The proposed scenario
reproduces well the transverse-momentum spectra, the elliptic flow coefficient
v2, and the HBT radii of pions and kaons studied at RHIC (Au+Au collisions at
the top beam energy). It also reproduces quite well the transverse-momentum
spectra of hyperons.
