We evaluate the optical reflectivity for a uniaxially strained graphene
single layer between a SiO2 substrate and air. A tight binding model for the
band dispersion of graphene is employed. As a function of the strain modulus
and direction, graphene may traverse one of several electronic topological
transitions, characterized by a change of topology of its Fermi line. This
results in features in the conductivity within the optical range, which might
be observable experimentally.
