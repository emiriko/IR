Realistic numerical 3D models of the outer solar atmosphere show two
different kind of spicule-like phenomena, as also observed on the solar limb.
The numerical models are calculated using the 2 types of spicules "observed" in
3D realistic models Oslo Staggered Code (OSC) to solve the full MHD equations
with non-grey and NLTE radiative transfer and thermal conduction along the
magnetic field lines. The two types of spicules arise as a natural result of
the dynamical evolution in the models. We discuss the different properties of
these two types of spicules, their differences from observed spicules and what
needs to be improved in the models.
