The exploration of atomic properties of strongly coupled partially degenerate
plasmas, also referred to as warm dense matter, is important in astrophysics,
since this thermodynamic regime is encountered for instance in Jovian planets'
interior. One of the most important issues is the need for accurate equations
of state and transport coefficients. The Ziman formula has been widely used for
the computation of the static (DC) electrical resistivity. Usually, the
calculations are based on the continuum wavefunctions computed in the
temperature and density-dependent self-consistent potential of a fictive atom,
representing the average ionization state of the plasma (average-atom model).
We present calculations of the electrical resistivity of a plasma based on the
superconfiguration (SC) formalism. In this modeling, the contributions of all
the electronic configurations are taken into account. It is possible to obtain
all the situations between the two limiting cases: detailed configurations (a
super-orbital is a single orbital) and detailed ions (all orbitals are gathered
in the same super-orbital). The ingredients necessary for the calculation are
computed in a self-consistent manner for each SC, using a density-functional
description of the electrons. Electron exchange-correlation is handled in the
local-density approximation. The momentum transfer cross-sections are
calculated by using the phase shifts of the continuum electron wavefunctions
computed, in the potential of each SC, by the Schroedinger equation with
relativistic corrections (Pauli approximation). Comparisons with experimental
data are also presented.
