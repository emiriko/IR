The classical bilinear-biquadratic nearest-neighbor Heisenberg
antiferromagnet on the pyrochlore lattice does not exhibit conventional
Neel-type magnetic order at any temperature or magnetic field. Instead spin
correlations decay algebraically over length scales r ~ \sqrt{T}, behavior
characteristic of a Coulomb phase arising from a strong local constraint.
Despite this, its thermodynamic properties remain largely unchanged if Neel
order is restored by the addition of a degeneracy-lifting perturbation, e.g.,
further neighbor interactions. Here we show how these apparent contradictions
can be resolved by a proper understanding of way in which long-range Neel order
emerges out of well-formed local correlations, and identify nematic and
vector-multipole orders hidden in the different Coulomb phases of the model. So
far as experiment is concerned, our results suggest that where long range
interactions are unimportant, the magnetic properties of Cr spinels which
exhibit half-magnetization plateaux may be largely independent of the type of
magnetic order present.
