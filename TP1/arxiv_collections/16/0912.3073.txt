We offer a method of correlations mapping on the full celestial sphere that
allows to check the quality of reconstructed maps, their non-Gaussianity and
conduct experiments in various frequency ranges. The method was evaluated on
the WMAP data, both on the reconstructed maps and foreground components, and on
the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) data. We detected a significant shift in the
correlation data of the dust component, which can be preconditioned by a more
complex dust model than the one currently in use for component separation.
While studying the NVSS correlation data, we demonstrated that the statistics
of the coinciding spots in the microwave background and in the NVSS survey
corresponds to the one expected in the $\Lambda$CDM model. This can testify for
a chance coincidence of the spots in the NVSS and WMAP data in the CMB Cold
Spot region. Our method is software-implemented in the GLESP package.
