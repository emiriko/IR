We review the status of our knowledge on supergiant fast X-ray transients
(SFXTs), a new hot topic in multi wavelength studies of binaries. We discuss
the mechanisms believed to power these transients and then highlight the unique
contribution Swift is giving to this field, and how new technology complements
and sometimes changes the view of things.
