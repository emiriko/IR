The MAGIC telescope is the largest single-dish Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov
Telescope (IACT) with the lowest energy threshold among the current generation
of IACTs as low as 25 GeV. Therefore, the MAGIC telescope is a perfect
instrument to study the galactic sources especially in the context of
observations with the satellite observatories Fermi and AGILE. This paper will
give an overview of the MAGIC results on the galactic sources including
detailed observations of binary systems, supernova remnants and the first
detection of the Crab pulsar above 25 GeV .
