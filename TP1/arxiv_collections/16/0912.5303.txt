An active stream of literature has followed up the idea of skew-elliptical
densities initiated by Azzalini and Capitanio (1999). Their original
formulation was based on a general lemma which is however of broader
applicability than usually perceived. This note examines new directions of its
use, and illustrates them with the construction of some probability
distributions falling outside the family of the so-called skew-symmetric
densities.
