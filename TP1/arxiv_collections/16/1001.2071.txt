Let $R$ be a commutative ring that is free of rank $k$ as an abelian group,
$p$ a prime, and $SL(n,R)$ the special linear group. We show that the Lie
algebra associated to the filtration of $SL(n,R)$ by $p$-congruence subgroups
is isomorphic to the tensor product
$\mathfrak{sl}_n(R\otimes_{\Z}\Z/p)\otimes_{\F_p}t\F_p[t]$, the Lie algebra of
polynomials with zero constant term and coefficients $n\times n$ traceless
matrices with entries polynomials in $k$ variables over $\F_p$.
  We use the Lie algebra structure along with the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre
spectral sequence to compute the $d^2$ homology differential for certain
central extensions involving quotients of $p$-congruence subgroups. We also use
the underlying group structure to obtain several homological results. For
example, we compute the first homology group of the level $p$-congruence
subgroup for $n\geq3$. We show that the cohomology groups of the level
$p^r$-congruence subgroup are not finitely generated for $n=2$ and $R=\Z[t]$.
Finally, we show that for $n=2$ and $R=\Z[i]$, the Gaussian integers, the
second cohomology group of the level $p^r$-congruence subgroup has dimension at
least two as an $\F_p$-vector space.
