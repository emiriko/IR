We report a measurement of high-p_T inclusive pi^0, eta, and direct photon
production in p+p and d+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV at midrapidity (0
< eta < 1). Photons from the decay pi^0 -> gamma gamma were detected in the
Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter of the STAR experiment at the Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider. The eta -> gamma gamma decay was also observed and
constituted the first eta measurement by STAR. The first direct photon cross
section measurement by STAR is also presented, the signal was extracted
statistically by subtracting the pi^0, eta, and omega(782) decay background
from the inclusive photon distribution observed in the calorimeter. The
analysis is described in detail, and the results are found to be in good
agreement with earlier measurements and with next-to-leading order perturbative
QCD calculations.
