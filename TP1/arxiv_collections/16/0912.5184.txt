Resonant interactions between ions and Alfv\'en/ion-cyclotron (A/IC) waves
may play an important role in the heating and acceleration of the fast solar
wind. Although such interactions have been studied extensively for "parallel"
waves, whose wave vectors ${\bf k}$ are aligned with the background magnetic
field ${\bf B}_0$, much less is known about interactions between ions and
oblique A/IC waves, for which the angle $\theta$ between ${\bf k}$ and ${\bf
B}_0$ is nonzero. In this paper, we present new numerical results on resonant
cyclotron interactions between protons and oblique A/IC waves in collisionless
low-beta plasmas such as the solar corona. We find that if some mechanism
generates oblique high-frequency A/IC waves, then these waves initially modify
the proton distribution function in such a way that it becomes unstable to
parallel waves. Parallel waves are then amplified to the point that they
dominate the wave energy at the large parallel wave numbers at which the waves
resonate with the particles. Pitch-angle scattering by these waves then causes
the plasma to evolve towards a state in which the proton distribution is
constant along a particular set of nested "scattering surfaces" in velocity
space, whose shapes have been calculated previously. As the distribution
function approaches this state, the imaginary part of the frequency of parallel
A/IC waves drops continuously towards zero, but oblique waves continue to
undergo cyclotron damping while simultaneously causing protons to diffuse
across these kinetic shells to higher energies. We conclude that oblique A/IC
waves can be more effective at heating protons than parallel A/IC waves,
because for oblique waves the plasma does not relax towards a state in which
proton damping of oblique A/IC waves ceases.
