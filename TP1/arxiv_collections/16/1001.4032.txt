The Onfp class of rotationally broadened, hot spectra was defined some time
ago in the Galaxy, where its membership to date numbers only eight. The
principal defining characteristic is a broad, centrally reversed He II
$\lambda$4686 emission profile; other emission and absorption lines are also
rotationally broadened. Recent surveys in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) have
brought the class membership there, including some related spectra, to 28. We
present a survey of the spectral morphology and rotational velocities, as a
first step toward elucidating the nature of this class. Evolved, rapidly
rotating hot stars are not expected theoretically, because the stellar winds
should brake the rotation. Luminosity classification of these spectra is not
possible, because the principal criterion (He II $\lambda$4686) is peculiar;
however, the MCs provide reliable absolute magnitudes, which show that they
span the entire range from dwarfs to supergiants. The Onfp line-broadening
distribution is distinct and shifted toward larger values from those of normal
O dwarfs and supergiants with >99.99% confidence. All cases with multiple
observations show line-profile variations, which even remove some objects from
the class temporarily. Some of them are spectroscopic binaries; it is possible
that the peculiar profiles may have multiple causes among different objects.
The origin and future of these stars are intriguing; for instance, they could
be stellar mergers and/or gamma-ray-burst progenitors.
