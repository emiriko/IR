We test two-dimensional TPSA of biphoton light emitted via ultrafast
spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) using the effect of
group-velocity dispersion in optical fibres. Further, we apply this technique
to demonstrate the engineering of biphoton spectral properties by acting on the
pump pulse shape.
