A bipartite state which is secretly chosen from a finite set of known
entangled pure states cannot be immediately useful in standard quantum
information processing tasks. To effectively make use of the entanglement
contained in this unknown state, we introduce a new way to locally manipulate
the original quantum system: either identify the state successfully or distill
some pure entanglement. Remarkably, if many copies are available, we show that
any finite set of entangled pure states, whatever orthogonal or not, can be
locally distinguished in this way, which further implies that pure entanglement
can be deterministically extracted from unknown pure entanglement. These
results make it clear why a large class of entangled bipartite quantum
operations including unitary operations and measurements that are globally
distinguishable can also be locally distinguishable: they can generate pure
entanglement consistently.
