In this paper, we propose a light-weight provably-secure authentication
protocol called the NLHB protocol, which is a variant of the HB protocol. The
HB protocol uses the complexity of decoding linear codes for security against
passive attacks. In contrast, security for the NLHB protocol is proved by
reducing passive attacks to the problem of decoding a class of non-linear codes
that are provably hard. We demonstrate that the existing passive attacks on the
HB protocol family, which have contributed to considerable reduction in its
effective key-size, are ineffective against the NLHB protocol.
  From the evidence, we conclude that smaller-key sizes are sufficient for the
NLHB protocol to achieve the same level of passive attack security as the HB
Protocol. Further, for this choice of parameters, we provide an implementation
instance for the NLHB protocol for which the Prover/Verifier complexity is
lower than the HB protocol, enabling authentication on very low-cost devices
like RFID tags. Finally, in the spirit of the HB$^{+}$ protocol, we extend the
NLHB protocol to the NLHB$^{+}$ protocol and prove security against the class
of active attacks defined in the DET Model.
