This brief paper summarizes a ``key general review'' with the same title
given at the IAU meeting in Rio de Janeiro. The intent of the review talk was
to give a broad and well-illustrated overview of recent work on the icy middle
and outer Solar system, in a style interesting for those astronomers whose gaze
is otherwise drawn to more distant realms. The intent of this written review is
the same.
