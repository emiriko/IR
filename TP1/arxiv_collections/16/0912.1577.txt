This paper is the second part of arXiv:0707.1766. We develope harmonic
analysis in some categories of filtered abelian groups and vector spaces over
the fields R or C. These categories contain as objects local fields and adelic
spaces arising from arithmetical surfaces. Some structure theorems are proven
for quotients of the adelic groups of algebraic and arithmetical surfaces.
