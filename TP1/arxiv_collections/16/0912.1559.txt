The recently developed theory of Schur rings over a finite cyclic group is
generalized to Schur rings over a ring R being a product of Galois rings of
coprime characteristics. It is proved that if the characteristic of R is odd,
then as in the cyclic group case any pure Schur ring over R is the tensor
product of a pure cyclotomic ring and Schur rings of rank 2 over non-fields.
Moreover, it is shown that in contrast to the cyclic group case there are
non-pure Schur rings over R that are not generalized wreath products.
