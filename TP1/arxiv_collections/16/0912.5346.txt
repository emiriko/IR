The low temperature variation of the London penetration depth for a number of
iron-pnictide and iron-chalcogenide superconductors is nearly quadratic,
$\Delta \lambda(T) = \beta T^n$ with $n\approx 2$. The coefficient in this
dependence shows a robust scaling, $\beta \propto 1/T_c^3$ across different
families of these materials. We associate the scaling with a strong
pair-breaking. The same mechanism have recently been suggested to explain the
scalings of the specific heat jump, $\Delta C \propto T_c^3$, and of the slopes
of the upper critical field, $dH_{c2}/dT\propto T_c$ in these materials. This
suggests that thermodynamic and electromagnetic properties of the iron-based
superconductors can be described within a strong pair-breaking scenario.
