In this paper, we study a model of a Brownian polymer in $\mathbb {R}_+\times
\mathbb {R}^d$, introduced by Rovira and Tindel [J. Funct. Anal. 222 (2005)
178--201]. Our investigation focuses mainly on the effect of strong spatial
correlation in the environment in that model in terms of free energy,
fluctuation exponent and volume exponent. In particular, we prove that under
some assumptions, very strong disorder and superdiffusivity hold at all
temperatures when $d\ge3$ and provide a novel approach to Petermann's
superdiffusivity result in dimension one [Superdiffusivity of directed polymers
in random environment (2000) Ph.D. thesis]. We also derive results for a
Brownian model of pinning in a nonrandom potential with power-law decay at
infinity.
