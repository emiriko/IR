We point out a strong influence of the pairing force on the size of the two
neutron Cooper pair in $^{11}$Li, and to a lesser extent also in $^6$He. It
seems that these are quite unique situations, since Cooper pair sizes of stable
superfluid nuclei are very little influenced by the intensity of pairing, as
recently reported. We explore the difference between $^{11}$Li and heavier
superfulid nuclei, and discuss reasons for the exceptional situation in
$^{11}$Li.
