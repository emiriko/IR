With an implicit Particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo model, capacitively coupled
plasmas are studied in two-dimensional and axisymmetric geometry. Self-bias dc
voltage effects are self-consistently considered. Due to finite length effects,
the self-bias dc voltages show sophisticating relations with the electrode
areas. Two-dimensional kinetic effects are also illuminated. Compare to the
fluid mode, PIC/MC model is numerical-diffusion-free and thus finer properties
of the plasmas are simulated.
