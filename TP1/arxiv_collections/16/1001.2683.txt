Some aspects of the interpretation of quantum theory are discussed. It is
emphasized that quantum theory is formulated in the Cartesian coordinate
system; in other coordinates the result obtained with the help of the
Hamiltonian formalism and commutator relations between 'canonically conjugated'
coordinate and momentum operators leads to a wrong version of quantum
mechanics. The origin of time is analyzed in detail by the example of atomic
collision theory. It is shown that for a closed system like the three-body (two
nuclei + electron) time-dependent Schroedinger equation has no physical meaning
since in the high impact energy limit it transforms into an equation with two
independent time-like variables; the time appears in the stationary
Schroedinger equation as a result of extraction of a classical subsystem (two
nuclei) from a closed three-body system. Following the Einstein-Rozen-Podolsky
experiment and Bell's inequality the wave function is interpreted as an actual
field of information in the elementary form. The relation between physics and
mathematics is also discussed.
