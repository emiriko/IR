We found that the differential topology of the lattice-system of Ising model
determines whether there can be the continuous phase transition, the geometric
topology of the space the lattice-system is embedded in determines whether the
system can become ordered. If the system becomes ordered it may not admit the
continuous phase transition. The spin-projection orientations are strongly
influenced by the geometric topology of the space the lattice-system is
embedded in.
