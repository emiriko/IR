A simple method of constructing a big stock of algebraic varieties with
trivial Makar-Limanov invariant is described, the Derksen invariant of some
varieties is computed, the generalizations of the Makar-Limanov and Derksen
invariants are introduced and discussed, and some results on the Jordan
property of automorphism groups of algebraic varieties are obtained.
