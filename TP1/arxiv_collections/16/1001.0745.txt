The Darwinian nature of Wojciech Zurek's theory of Quantum Darwinism is
evaluated against the criteria of a Darwinian process as understood within
Universal Darwinism. The characteristics of a Darwinian process are developed
including the consequences of accumulated adaptations resulting in adaptive
systems operating in accordance with Friston's free energy principle and
employing environmental simulations. Quantum theory, as developed in Zurek's
research program and encapsulated by his theory of Quantum Darwinism is
discussed from the view that Zurek's derivation of the measurement axioms
implies that the evolution of a quantum system entangled with environmental
entities is determined solely by the nature of the entangled system. There need
be no further logical foundation. Quantum Darwinism is found to conform to the
Darwinian paradigm in unexpected detail and is thus may be considered a theory
within the framework of Universal Darwinism. With the inclusion of Quantum
Darwinism within Universal Darwinism and the explanatory power of Darwinian
processes extended beyond biology and the social sciences to include the
creation and evolution of scientific subject matter within particle physics,
atomic physics and chemistry, it is suggested that Universal Darwinism may be
considered a candidate 'Theory of Everything' as anticipated by David Deutsch.
