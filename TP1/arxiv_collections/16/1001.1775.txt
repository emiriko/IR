We prove the neo-classical inequality with the optimal constant, which was
conjectured by T. J. Lyons [Rev. Mat. Iberoamericana 14 (1998) 215-310]. For
the proof, we introduce the fractional order Taylor's series with residual
terms. Their application to a particular function provides an identity that
deduces the optimal neo-classical inequality.
