Large extra dimensions are one of the constructions addressing the hierarchy
problem of the Standard Model. Their main theoretical and phenomenological
challenge is that already predicting LHC effects requires an ultraviolet
completion of TeV-scale gravity. In these lecture notes we first give a basic
introduction into TeV-scale gravity models and their collider effects and then
discuss possible ultraviolet completions, like string theory and fixed-point
gravity.
