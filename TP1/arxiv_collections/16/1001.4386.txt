Recoupling coefficients (3nj symbols) are unitary transformations between
binary coupled eigenstates of N=(n+1) mutually commuting SU(2) angular momentum
operators. They have been used in a variety of applications in spectroscopy,
quantum chemistry and nuclear physics and quite recently also in quantum
gravity and quantum computing. These coefficients, naturally associated to
cubic Yutsis graphs, share a number of intriguing combinatorial, algebraic, and
analytical features that make them fashinating objects to be studied on their
own. In this paper we develop a bottom--up, systematic procedure for the
generation of 3nj from 3(n-1)j diagrams by resorting to diagrammatical and
algebraic methods. We provide also a novel approach to the problem of
classifying various regimes of semiclassical expansions of 3nj coefficients
(asymptotic disentangling of 3nj diagrams) for n > 2 by means of combinatorial,
analytical and numerical tools.
