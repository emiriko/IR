A simple quantum defect model gives analytic expressions for the complex
scattering length and threshold collision rates of ultracold molecules. If the
probability of reaction in the short-range part of the collision is high, the
model gives universal rate constants for s- and p-wave collisions that are
independent of short-range dynamics. This model explains the magnitudes of the
recently measured rate constants for collisions of two ultracold 40K87Rb
molecules, or an ultracold 40K atom with the 40K87Rb molecule [Ospelkaus et
al., Science 327, 853 (2010)].
