Using a stochastic quantum approach, we study thermoelectric transport
phenomena at low temperatures in disordered electrical systems connected to
external baths. We discuss three different models of one-dimensional disordered
electrons, namely the Anderson model of random on-site energies, the
random-dimer model and the random-hopping model - also relevant for random-spin
models. We find that although the asymptotic behavior of transport in open
systems is closely related to that in closed systems for these noninteracting
models, the magnitude of thermoelectric transport strongly depends on the
boundary conditions and the baths spectral properties. This shows the
importance of employing theories of open quantum systems in the study of energy
transport.
