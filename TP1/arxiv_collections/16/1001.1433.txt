Relative complexity measures the complexity of a probability preserving
transformation relative to a factor being a sequence of random variables whose
exponential growth rate is the relative entropy of the extension. We prove
distributional limit theorems for the relative complexity of certain zero
entropy extensions: RWRSs whose associated random walks satisfy the
\alpha-stable CLT ($1<\alpha\le2$). The results give invariants for relative
isomorphism of these.
