We have obtained CCD UBVI_{KC} photometry down to V ~ 21.0 for the open
clusters Berkeley 26, Czernik 27, Melotte 72, NGC 2479 and BH 37. The latter
has never been studied before. Cluster stellar density profiles were obtained
from star counts in appropriate-sized boxes distributed throughout the entire
observed fields. Based on different measured indices, we estimate the ages of
Berkeley 26, Melotte 72 and NGC 2479. On the other hand, we indicate possible
solutions for the cluster fundamental parameters by matching theoretical
isochrones which reasonably reproduce the main cluster features in their CMDs.
In the case of NGC 2479, the cluster E(B-V) and E(V-I) colour excesses and
apparent distance modulus were estimated from the fit of the Zero-Age Main
Sequence (ZAMS) to the colour-colour and colour-magnitude diagrams,
respectively.
