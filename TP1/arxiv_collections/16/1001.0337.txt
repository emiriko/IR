Aim of this communication is to describe the first results of a
work-in-progress regarding the chemical properties of gas and stars in the
circumnuclear regions of nearby galaxies. Different techniques have been
employed to estimate the abundances of chemical elements in the gaseous and
stellar components of nuclear surroundings in different classes of galaxies
according to the level of activity of the nucleus (normal or passive, star
forming galaxies and AGNs).
