New high precision polarization measurements of the proton elastic form
factor ratio in the Q^2 range from 0.3 to 0.7 [GeV/c]^2 have been made. These
elastic H(e,e'p) measurements were done in Jefferson Lab's Hall A using 80%
longitudinally polarized electrons and recoil polarimetry. For Q^2 greater than
1 [GeV/c]^2, previous polarization data indicated a strong deviation of the
form factor ratio from unity which sparked renewed theoretical and experimental
interest in how two-photon diagrams have been taken into account. The new high
precision data indicate that the deviation from unity, while small, persists
even at Q^2 less than 1 [GeV/c]^2.
