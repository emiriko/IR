While performing knowledge-intensive tasks of professional nature, the
knowledge workers need to access and process large volume of information. Apart
from the quantity, they also require that the information received is of high
quality in terms of authenticity and details. This, in turn, requires that the
information delivered should also include argumentative support, exhibiting the
reasoning process behind their development and provenance to indicate their
lineage. In conventional document-centric practices for information management,
such details are difficult to capture, represent/archive and retrieve/deliver.
To achieve such capability we need to re-think some core issues of information
management from the above requirements perspective. In this paper we develop a
framework for comprehensive representation of information in archive, capturing
informational contents along with their context. We shall call it the
"Information Warehouse (IW)" framework of information archival. The IW is a
significant yet technologically realizable conceptual advancement which can
support efficiently some interesting classes of applications which can be very
useful to the knowledge workers.
