Tidal-charged black hole solutions localized on a three-brane in the
five-dimensional gravity scenario of Randall and Sundrum have been known for
some time. The solutions have been used to study the decay, and growth, of
black holes with initial mass of about 10 TeV. These studies are interesting in
that certain black holes, if produced at the Large Hadron Collider, could live
long enough to leave the detectors. I examine the production of tidal-charged
black holes at the Large Hadron Collider and show that it is very unlikely that
they will be produced during the lifetime of the accelerator.
