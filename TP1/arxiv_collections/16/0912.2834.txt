The high performance photometric data obtained with space mission CoRoT offer
the opportunity to efficiently constrain our models for the stellar interior of
solar-like pulsating stars. On the occasion of the analysis of the oscillations
of solar-like pulsator HD 49385, a G0-type star in an advanced stage of
evolution, we revisit the phenomenon of the avoided crossings.
Christensen-Dalsgaard proposed a simple analogy to describe an avoided crossing
between two modes. We here present an extension of this analogy to the case of
$n$ modes, and show that it should lead, in certain cases, to a characteristic
behavior of the eigenfrequencies, significantly different from the $n=2$ case.
This type of behavior seems to be observed in HD 49385, from which we infer
that the star should be in a Post Main Sequence phase.
