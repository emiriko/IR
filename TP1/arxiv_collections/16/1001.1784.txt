We have performed an extensive study of single-crystals of the
magneto-electric NdFe$_3$($^{11}$BO$_3$)$_4$ by means of a combination of
single-crystal neutron diffraction and spherical neutron polarimetry. Our
investigation did not detect significant deviations at low temperatures from
space group R32 concerning the chemical structure. With respect to magnetic
ordering our combined results demonstrate that in the commensurate magnetic
phase below T$_N$~30 K all three magnetic Fe moments and the magnetic Nd moment
are aligned ferromagnetically in the basal hexagonal plane but align
antiferromagnetically between adjacent planes. The phase transition to the
low-temperature incommensurate magnetic structure observed at T$_{IC}$~13.5 K
appears to be continuous. By means of polarized neutron studies it could be
shown that in the incommensurate magnetic phase the magnetic structure of
NdFe$_3$($^{11}$BO$_3$)$_4$ is transformed into a long-period antiferromagnetic
helix with single chirality. Close to the commensurate-incommensurate phase
transition third-order harmonics were observed which in addition indicate the
formation of magnetic solitons.
