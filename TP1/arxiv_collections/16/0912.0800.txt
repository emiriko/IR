We present experimental and numerical studies of localized terahertz surface
waves on a subwavelength-thick metamaterial film consisting of in-plane
split-ring resonators. A simple and intuitive model is derived that describes
the propagation of surface waves as guided modes in a waveguide filled with a
Lorentz-like medium. The effective medium model allows to deduce the dispersion
relation of the surface waves in excellent agreement with the numerical data
obtained from 3-D full-wave calculations. Both the accuracy of the analytical
model and the numerical calculations are confirmed by spectroscopic terahertz
time domain measurements.
