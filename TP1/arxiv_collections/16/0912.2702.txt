The band structures of strained graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are examined by a
tight binding Hamiltonian that is directly related to the type and strength of
strains. Compared to the two-dimensional graphene whose band gap remains close
to zero even if a large strain is applied, the band gap of graphene nanoribbon
(GNR) is sensitive to both uniaxial and shears strains. The effect of strain on
the electronic structure of a GNR strongly depends on its edge shape and
structural indices. For an armchair GNR, uniaxial weak strain changes the band
gap in a linear fashion, and for a large strain, it results in periodic
oscillation of the band gap. On the other hand, shear strain always tend to
reduce the band gap. For a zigzag GNR, the effect of strain is to change the
spin polarization at the edges of GNR, thereby modulate the band gap. A simple
analytical model is proposed to interpret the band gap responds to strain in
armchair GNR, which agrees with the numerical results.
