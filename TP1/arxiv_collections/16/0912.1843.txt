If K is a rationally null-homologous knot in a 3-manifold M, the rational
genus of K is the infimum of -\chi(S)/2p over all embedded orientable surfaces
S in the complement of K whose boundary wraps p times around K for some p
(hereafter: S is a p-Seifert surface for K). Knots with very small rational
genus can be constructed by "generic" Dehn filling, and are therefore extremely
plentiful. In this paper we show that knots with rational genus less than 1/402
are all geometric -- i.e. they may be isotoped into a special form with respect
to the geometric decomposition of M -- and give a complete classification. Our
arguments are a mixture of hyperbolic geometry, combinatorics, and a careful
study of the interaction of small p-Seifert surfaces with essential subsurfaces
in M of non-negative Euler characteristic.
