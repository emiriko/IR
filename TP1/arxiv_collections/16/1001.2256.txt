We continue the program of classification of normal Q-acyclic surfaces
defined over the field of complex numbers, so-called 'Q-homology planes'. Here
we show that if a Q-homology plane has negative Kodaira dimension then its
smooth locus is not of general type. This generalizes an earlier result of
Koras-Russell for contractible surfaces.
