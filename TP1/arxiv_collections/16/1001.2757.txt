Solar prominences are an important tool for studying the structure and
evolution of the coronal magnetic field. Here we consider so-called "hedgerow"
prominences, which consist of thin vertical threads. We explore the possibility
that such prominences are supported by tangled magnetic fields. A variety of
different approaches are used. First, the dynamics of plasma within a tangled
field is considered. We find that the contorted shape of the flux tubes
significantly reduces the flow velocity compared to the supersonic free fall
that would occur in a straight vertical tube. Second, linear force-free models
of tangled fields are developed, and the elastic response of such fields to
gravitational forces is considered. We demonstrate that the prominence plasma
can be supported by the magnetic pressure of a tangled field that pervades not
only the observed dense threads but also their local surroundings. Tangled
fields with field strengths of about 10 G are able to support prominence
threads with observed hydrogen density of the order of 10^(11) cm^(-3).
Finally, we suggest that the observed vertical threads are the result of
Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Simulations of the density distribution within a
prominence thread indicate that the peak density is much larger than the
average density. We conclude that tangled fields provide a viable mechanism for
magnetic support of hedgerow prominences.
