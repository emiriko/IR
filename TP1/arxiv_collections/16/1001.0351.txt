High contrast imaging can find and characterize gas giant planets around
nearby young stars and the closest M stars, complementing radial velocity and
astrometric searches by exploring orbital separations inaccessible to indirect
methods. Ground-based coronagraphs are already probing within 25 AU of nearby
young stars to find objects as small as ~ 3 Jupiter masses. This paper compares
near-term and future ground-based capabilities with high contrast imaging modes
of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Monte Carlo modeling reveals that
JWST can detect planets with masses as small as 0.2 MJup across a broad range
of orbital separations. We present new calculations for planet brightness as a
function of mass and age for specific JWST filters and extending to 0.1 MJup.
