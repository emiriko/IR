Contrary to transformation optics (TO), there exist many possibilities for
transformed relations of material property and field variable in case of
transformation acoustics (TA). To investigate the underlining mechanism and
develop a general method that can obtain the full transformed relations, an
alternative interpretation to the form-invariance is explored. We consider a
spatial transformation, with which a physical phenomenon described in an
initial space is transformed to a deformed space, and interpret the mapping by
local affine transformation point-by-point. Further, we postulate that the
transformed material property and field must rebuild the same physical process,
and that the energy must be conserved at each point during the transformation.
These conditions impose the constraint on the transformed relation for material
property and field. By establishing two local Cartesian frames defined uniquely
by the spatial transformation, any physical quantity is shown to first
experience a rigid rotation and then a stretch operation during the
transformation. We show that the constraint conditions are not enough to
determine completely the transformed relation for TA, leaving a possibility to
define them differently as found in the literature. New acoustic
transformations with constant density or modulus are also proposed and verified
by constructing a two-dimensional acoustic cloak. Finally, we show that the
transformed relation is uniquely determined for transformation optics, and
discuss how this method can be extended to other transformation physics.
