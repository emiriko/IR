Supernova remnants (SNRs) are among the strongest candidates to explain the
flux of cosmic rays below the knee around 10^15 eV. Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe),
synchrotron nebulae powered by the spin-down of energetic young pulsars,
comprise one of the most populous VHE gamma-ray source classes. Gamma-ray
studies in the GeV and TeV bands probe the nature (ions vs. electrons),
production, and diffusion of high-energy particles in SNRs and PWNe. For
sources that are visible across both the GeV and TeV bands, such as IC 443, the
spatial and spectral distribution of gamma rays can be studied over an
unprecedented energy range. This presentation will review recent VERITAS
results, including studies of Cassiopeia A, IC 443, PSR J1930+1852, and the SNR
G106.3+2.7/Boomerang region, and discuss prospects for complementary studies of
SNRs and PWNe in the Fermi and VHE gamma-ray bands.
