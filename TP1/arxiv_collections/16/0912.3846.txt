The aim of this paper is to present the analysis of influence of defects in
1D photonic crystal (PC) on the density of states and simultaneously
spontaneous emission, in both spatial and frequency domains. In our
investigations we use an analytic model of 1D PC with defects. Our analysis
reveals how presence of a defect causes a defect mode to appear. We show that a
defect in 1D PC has local character, being negligible in regions of PC situated
far from the defected elementary cell. We also analyze the effect of multiple
defects, which lead to photonic band gap splitting.
