We consider a model for a spin field-effect molecular transistor, where a
directed pure spin current is controlled by an external electric field.
Inelastic scattering effects of such molecular device are discussed within a
framework of full counting statistics for a multi-level molecular system. We
propose that the heating of the molecular junction can be controlled by
external electric and magnetic fields. Characteristic features of the model are
demonstrated by numerical calculations.
