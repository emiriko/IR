The cross section for photon production in association with at least one jet
containing a $b$-quark hadron has been measured in proton antiproton collisions
at $\sqrt{s}=1.96$ TeV. The analysis uses a data sample corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 340 pb$^{-1}$ collected with the CDF II detector. Both
the differential cross section as a function of photon transverse energy
$E_T^{\gamma}$, $d \sigma$($p \overline{p} \to \gamma + \geq 1 b$-jet)/$d
E_T^{\gamma}$ and the total cross section $\sigma$($p \overline{p} \to \gamma +
\geq 1 b$-jet; $E_T^{\gamma}> 20$ GeV) are measured. Comparisons to a
next-to-leading order prediction of the process are presented.
