We report observations of the flickering variability of the recurrent nova RS
Oph at quiescence on the basis of simultaneous observations in 5 bands (UBVRI).
RS Oph has flickering source with (U-B)_0=-0.62 \pm 0.07, (B-V)_0=0.15 \pm
0.10, (V-R)_0=0.25 \pm 0.05. We find for the flickering source a temperature
T_fl = 9500 \pm 500 K, and luminosity L_fl = 50 - 150 L_sun (using a distance
of d=1.6kpc). We also find that on a (U-B) vs (B-V) diagram the flickering of
the symbiotic stars differs from that of the cataclysmic variables. The
possible source of the flickering is discussed. The data are available upon
request from the authors and on the web
