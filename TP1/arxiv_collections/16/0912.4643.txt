We theoretically analyze Ramsey interference experiments in one dimensional
quasi-condensates and obtain explicit expressions for the time evolution of
full distribution functions of fringe contrast. We show that distribution
functions contain unique signatures of the many-body mechanism of decoherence.
We argue that Ramsey interference experiments provide a powerful tool for
analyzing strongly correlated nature of 1D interacting systems.
