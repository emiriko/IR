We present results from monitoring the multi-waveband flux, linear
polarization, and parsec-scale structure of the quasar PKS 1510-089,
concentrating on eight major gamma-ray flares that occurred during the interval
2009.0-2009.5. The gamma-ray peaks were essentially simultaneous with maxima at
optical wavelengths, although the flux ratio of the two wavebands varied by an
order of magnitude. The optical polarization vector rotated by 720 degrees
during a 5-day period encompassing six of these flares. This culminated in a
very bright, roughly 1 day, optical and gamma-ray flare as a bright knot of
emission passed through the highest-intensity, stationary feature (the "core")
seen in 43 GHz Very Long Baseline Array images. The knot continued to propagate
down the jet at an apparent speed of 22c and emit strongly at gamma-ray
energies as a months-long X-ray/radio outburst intensified. We interpret these
events as the result of the knot following a spiral path through a mainly
toroidal magnetic field pattern in the acceleration and collimation zone of the
jet, after which it passes through a standing shock in the 43 GHz core and then
continues downstream. In this picture, the rapid gamma-ray flares result from
scattering of infrared seed photons from a relatively slow sheath of the jet as
well as from optical synchrotron radiation in the faster spine. The 2006-2009.7
radio and X-ray flux variations are correlated at very high significance; we
conclude that the X-rays are mainly from inverse Compton scattering of infrared
seed photons by 20-40 MeV electrons.
