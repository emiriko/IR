Circuit-QED has demonstrated very strong coupling between individual
microwave photons trapped in a superconducting coplanar resonator and nearby
superconducting qubits. In this work we show how, by designing a novel
interconnect, one can strongly connect the superconducting resonator, via a
magnetic interaction, to a small number (perhaps single), of electronic spins.
By choosing the electronic spin to be within a Nitrogen Vacancy centre in
diamond one can perform optical readout, polarization and control of this
electron spin using microwave and radio frequency irradiation. More
importantly, by utilising Nitrogen Vacancy centres with nearby 13C nuclei,
using this interconnect, one has the potential build a quantum device where the
nuclear spin qubits are connected over centimeter distances via the Nitrogen
Vacancy electronic spins interacting through the superconducting bus.
