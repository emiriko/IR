We analyze a class of multicomponent nonlinear Schrodinger equations (MNLS)
related to the symmetric BD.I-type symmetric spaces and their reductions. We
briefly outline the direct and the inverse scattering method for the relevant
Lax operators and the soliton solutions. We use the Zakharov-Shabat dressing
method to obtain the two-soliton solution and analyze the soliton interactions
of the MNLS equations and some of their reductions.
