We discuss the direct determination of the running top-quark mass from
measurements of the total cross section of hadronic top-quark pair-production.
The theory predictions in the MSbar scheme are very stable under scale
variations and show rapid apparent convergence of the perturbative expansion.
These features are explained by studying the underlying parton dynamics.
