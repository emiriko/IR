We report the results of an analysis to identify candidates for very high
energy (VHE; E > 100 GeV) emission from high-latitude (|b|>10) unassociated
sources in the year-1 catalog under development by the Fermi large area
telescope (LAT) team. These are sources with no known counterparts at other
wavelengths. Since VHE instruments are pointed instruments with small fields of
view and low duty cycles, their observing programs need to be planned carefully
to identify the most promising targets for observation. The scientific
potential of combined Fermi and VHE observations has already been demonstrated
with a number of joint VHE-Fermi papers. The goal of this work is to select the
most promising unassociated Fermi sources for joint observations with Fermi and
the VHE instruments.
