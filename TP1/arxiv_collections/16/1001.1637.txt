We present our first experimental determination of the magnetic noise of a
superspinglass made of < 1 pico-liter frozen ferrofluid. The measurements were
performed with a local magnetic field sensor based on Hall microprobes operated
with the spinning current technique. The results obtained, though preliminary,
qualitatively agree with the theoretical predictions of Fluctuation-Dissipation
theorem (FDT) violation [1].
