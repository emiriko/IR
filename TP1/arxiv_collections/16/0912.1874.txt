We examine the jamming transition in a two-dimensional granular polymer
system using compressional simulations. The jamming density \phi_c decreases
with increasing length of the granular chain due to the formation of loop
structures, in excellent agreement with recent experiments. The jamming density
can be further reduced in mixtures of granular chains and granular rings, also
as observed in experiment. We show that the nature of the jamming in granular
polymer systems has pronounced differences from the jamming behavior observed
for polydisperse two-dimensional disk systems at Point J. This result provides
further evidence that there is more than one type of jamming transition.
