We prove that the separated curve complex of a closed orientable surface of
genus g is (g-3)-connected. We also obtain a connectivity property for a
separated curve complex of the open surface that is obtained by removing a
finite set from a closed one, but it is then assumed that the removed set is
endowed with a partition and that the separating curves respect that partition.
These connectivity statements have implications for the algebraic topology of
the moduli space of curves.
