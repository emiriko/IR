Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) for Bose-Einstein condensates cannot
treat phase off-diagonal effects, and thus not explain Bell inequality
violations. We describe another situation that is beyond a SSB treatment: an
experiment where particles from two (possibly macroscopic) condensate sources
are used for conjugate measurements of the relative phase and populations.
Off-diagonal phase effects are characterized by a "quantum angle" and observed
via "population oscillations", signaling quantum interference of
macroscopically distinct states (QIMDS).
