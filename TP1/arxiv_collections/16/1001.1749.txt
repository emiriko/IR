The rising cosmic ray positron fraction reported by the PAMELA collaboration
has lead to a great deal of interest in astrophysical sources of energetic
electrons and positrons, including pulsars. In this paper, we calculate the
spectrum of synchrotron emission from electrons and positrons injected from 376
young pulsars (<10^6 years) contained in the ATNF catalog, and compare our
results to observations. We find that if objects such as the Vela and Crab
pulsars have injected ~10^48 erg or more in energetic electrons and/or
positrons, they are expected to produce bright and distinctive features in the
synchrotron sky. Intriguingly, we predict hard synchrotron emission from these
regions of the sky which is qualitatively similar to that observed by WMAP.
