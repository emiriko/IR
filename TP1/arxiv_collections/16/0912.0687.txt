The LHC is the perfect environment for the study of new physics in the top
quark sector. We study the possibility of detecting signals of heavy
color-octet vector resonances, through the charge asymmetry, in top-antitop+jet
events. Besides contributions with the top-antitop pair in a color-singlet
state, the asymmetry gets also contributions which are proportional to the
color factor f_{abc}^2. This process is particularly interesting for
extra-dimensional models, where the inclusive charge asymmetry generated by
Kaluza-Klein excitations of the gluon vanishes at the tree level. We find that
the statistical significance for the measurement of such an asymmetry is
sizable for different values of the coupling constants and already at low
energies.
