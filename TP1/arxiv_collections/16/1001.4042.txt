We analyse the Anderson-Higgs mechanism of photon mass acquisition in a
plasma and study the contribution to the mass from the orbital angular momentum
acquired by a beam of photons when it crosses a spatially structured charge
distribution. To this end we apply Proca-Maxwell equations in a static plasma
with a particular spatial distribution of free charges, notably a plasma
vortex, that is able to impose orbital angular momentum (OAM) onto light. In
addition to the mass acquisition of the conventional Anderson-Higgs mechanism,
we find that the photon acquires an additional mass from the OAM and that this
mass reduces the Proca photon mass.
