Using the techniques of [arXiv:0911.4271], upper bounds for a given
confidence level are modified in an optimal fashion to incorporate the a priori
information that the parameter being estimated is non-negative. A paradox with
different confidence intervals for the same confidence level is clarified. The
"lossy compression" nature of the device of confidence intervals is discussed
and a "lossless" option to present results is pointed out.
