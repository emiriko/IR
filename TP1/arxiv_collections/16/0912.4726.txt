Dramatic rise of mutators has been found to accompany adaptation of bacteria
in response to many kinds of stress. Two views on the evolutionary origin of
this phenomenon emerged: the pleiotropic hypothesis positing that it is a
byproduct of environmental stress or other specific stress response mechanisms
and the second order selection which states that mutators hitchhike to fixation
with unrelated beneficial alleles. Conventional population genetics models
could not fully resolve this controversy because they are based on certain
assumptions about fitness landscape. Here we address this problem using a
microscopic multiscale model, which couples physically realistic molecular
descriptions of proteins and their interactions with population genetics of
carrier organisms without assuming any a priori fitness landscape. We found
that both pleiotropy and second order selection play a crucial role at
different stages of adaptation: the supply of mutators is provided through
destabilization of error correction complexes or fluctuations of production
levels of prototypic mismatch repair proteins (pleiotropic effects), while rise
and fixation of mutators occur when there is a sufficient supply of beneficial
mutations in replication-controlling genes. This general mechanism assures a
robust and reliable adaptation of organisms to unforeseen challenges. This
study highlights physical principles underlying physical biological mechanisms
of stress response and adaptation.
