We consider an undirected graph $G = (VG, EG)$ with a set $T \subseteq VG$ of
terminals, and with nonnegative integer capacities $c(v)$ and costs $a(v)$ of
nodes $v\in VG$. A path in $G$ is a \emph{$T$-path} if its ends are distinct
terminals. By a \emph{multiflow} we mean a function $F$ assigning to each
$T$-path $P$ a nonnegative rational \emph{weight} $F(P)$, and a multiflow is
called \emph{feasible} if the sum of weights of $T$-paths through each node $v$
does not exceed $c(v)$. The \emph{value} of $F$ is the sum of weights $F(P)$,
and the \emph{cost} of $F$ is the sum of $F(P)$ times the cost of $P$ w.r.t.
$a$, over all $T$-paths $P$.
  Generalizing known results on edge-capacitated multiflows, we show that the
problem of finding a minimum cost multiflow among the feasible multiflows of
maximum possible value admits \emph{half-integer} optimal primal and dual
solutions. Moreover, we devise a strongly polynomial algorithm for finding such
optimal solutions.
