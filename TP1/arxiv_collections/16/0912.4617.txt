We investigate the entanglement dynamics and coherence of two two-level atoms
interacting with two coherent fields of two spatially separated and dissipative
cavities. It is in particular shown that entanglement sudden death is obtained
within a short interacting time. However, after a long interaction time a
long-lived entanglement is shown, that is, the initial entanglement of two
atoms could be partially preserved. In addition, the coherence of the two atoms
will not be lost during the evolution.
