In this study, the partially entangled neural networks is used to transfer
information between two neurons, where the original teleportation protocol is
employed this for this purpose. The effect of the network strength on the
fidelity of the transported information is investigated. We show that as the
strength of the network increases, the accuracy of the transformed information
increases. As a practical application, we consider the spread of swine flu
virus between two equivalent tranches of the community. In this treatment two
factors are considered, one for humanity and the other for influence factor.
  The likelihood of infection between different age group is investigated,
where we show that the strength of the neural network and the degree of
infection plays an important role on transferring infection between different
age group. From theoretical point of view, we show that it is possible to
control the spread of the virus by controlling the network parameter. Also, by
using local rotation, one can decrease the rate of infection between the young.
