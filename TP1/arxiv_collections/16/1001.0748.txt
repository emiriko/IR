We study a modified frustrated dipolar array recently proposed by M\"{o}ller
and Moessner [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{96}, 237202 (2006)], which is based on
an array manufactured lithographically by Wang \emph{et al.} [Nature (London)
\textbf{439}, 303 (2006)] and consists of introducing a height offset $h$
between islands (dipoles) pointing along the two different lattice directions.
The ground-states and excitations are studied as a function of $h$. We have
found, in qualitative agreement with the results of M\"{o}ller and Moessner,
that the ground-state changes for $h>h_{1}$, where $h_{1}= 0.444a$ ($a$ is the
lattice parameter or distance between islands). In addition, the excitations
above the ground-state behave like magnetic poles but confined by a string,
whose tension decreases as $h$ increases, in such a way that for $h\approx h_1$
its value is around 20 times smaller than that for $h=0$. The system exhibits
an anisotropy in the sense that the string tension and magnetic charge depends
significantly on the directions in which the monopoles are separated. In turn,
the intensity of the magnetic charge abruptly changes when the monopoles are
separated along the direction of the longest axis of the islands. Such a gap is
attributed to the transition from the anti to the ferromagnetic ground-state
when $h=h_1$.
