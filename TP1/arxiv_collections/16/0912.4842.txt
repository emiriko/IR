The stationary current induced by a strong running potential wave in
one-dimensional system is studied. Such a wave can result from illumination of
a straight quantum wire with special grating or spiral quantum wire by
circular-polarized light. The wave drags electrons in the direction correlating
with the direction of the system symmetry and polarization of light. In a pure
system the wave induces minibands in the accompanied system of reference. We
study the effect in the presence of impurity scattering. The current is an
interplay between the wave drag and impurity braking. It was found that the
drag current is quantized when the Fermi level gets into energy gaps.
