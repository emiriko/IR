We contrast the impact of Higgs mediated flavor changing neutral currents on
epsilon_K in the framework of a warped extra dimension that was recently
calculated by Azatov et al. with the older results for Kaluza-Klein gluon
induced corrections to that observable. We find that the most stringent
constraint on the KK scale for a Higgs field localized on the infrared brane
for reasonable additional assumptions comes from KK gluon exchange. In the case
of a bulk Higgs field we show that for certain scenarios the Higgs contribution
can in fact exceed the KK gluon contribution. In the course of this analysis we
also describe in detail the different renormalization procedures that have to
be employed in the KK gluon and Higgs cases to relate the new physics at high
energies to low energy observables.
