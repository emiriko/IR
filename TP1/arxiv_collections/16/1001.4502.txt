Stability of electro-hydrodynamic processes between ion-exchange membranes is
investigated. Solutions of the equilibrium problem are commonly described in
the one-dimensional (1D) steady-state approximation. In the present work, a
novel class of 1D unsteady self-similar equilibrium solutions is developed,
whose existence is supported by recent experiments. 1D unsteady two-parametric
family of self-similar equilibrium solutions and their stability are studied
both asymptotically in small dimensionless Debye length, and numerically. The
self-similar solutions and marginal stability curves obtained in both
approaches are in a fair agreement with each other at intermediately large
times for which the dimensionless distance between membranes is large.
