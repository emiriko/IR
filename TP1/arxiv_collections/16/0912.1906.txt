An electronic oscillator is shown to support an envelope soliton pulse. The
oscillator comprises a loop, formed by a nonlinear transmission line, an
amplifier, a bandpass filter and a saturable absorber. The soliton is suitable
for ultra-wideband radio-frequency communication; its existence and stability
are demonstrated with simulations.
