We investigate how the polarization correlations of entangled photons
described by wave packets are modified when measured by moving detectors. For
this purpose, we analyze the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt Bell inequality as a
function of the apparatus velocity. Our analysis is motivated by future
experiments with entangled photons designed to use satellites. This is a first
step towards the implementation of quantum information protocols in a global
scale.
