We discuss various mechanisms of catalysis of black holes/wormholes (BH/WH)
formation in particles collisions. The current paradigm suggests that BH/WH
formation in particles collisions will happen when center of mass energies of
colliding particles is sufficiently above the Planck scale (the transplanckian
region). To estimate the BH/WH production we use the classical geometrical
cross section. We confirm the classical geometrical cross section of the BH
production reconsidering the process of two transplanckian particles collision
in the rest frame of one of incident particles. This consideration permits to
use the standard Thorne's hoop conjecture for a matter compressed into a region
to prove a variant of the conjecture dealing with a total amount of compressed
energy in the case of colliding particles. We calculate geometrical cross
sections for different processes and for different background, in particular,
for (A)dS. We show that results are in agreement with closed trapped surface
(CTS) estimations though there are no general theorems providing that the BH
formation follows from CTS's formation. We show that the process of BH
formation is catalyzed by the negative cosmological constant and by a
particular scalar matter, namely dilaton, while it is relaxed by the positive
cosmological constant and at a critical value just turns off. Also we note that
the cross section is sensible to the compactification of extra dimensions and
to the particular brane model.
