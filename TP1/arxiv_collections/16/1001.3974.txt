The use of floating bipolar electrodes in electrowinning cells of copper
constitutes a nonconventional technology that promises economic and operational
impacts. This paper presents a computational tool for the simulation and
analysis of such electrochemical cells. A new model is developed for floating
electrodes and a method of finite difference is used to obtain the
threedimensional distribution of the potential and the field of current density
inside the cell. The analysis of the results is based on a technique for the
interactive visualization of three-dimensional vectorial fields as lines of
flow.
