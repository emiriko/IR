Several Authors have demonstrated that substituting computer simulations for
real experiments conducted in a lab may help to improve students' understanding
of the material. In the present work we try to understand the reasons for this
intriguing finding and investigate possible prerequisites necessary to achieve
this outcome. The study was conducted in an introductory college-level physics
class in Germany. All simulations were performed using PSPICE.
