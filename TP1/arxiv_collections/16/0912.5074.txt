The 16th magnitude quasar 3C 345 (redshift z=0.5928) shows structural and
emission variability on parsec scales around a compact unresolved radio core.
For the last three decades it has been closely monitored with very long
baseline interferometry (VLBI), yielding a wealth of information about the
physics of relativistic outflows and dynamics of the central regions in AGN. We
present here preliminary results for the long-term jet evolution, based on the
15 GHz monitoring data collected by the MOJAVE survey and various other groups
over the last ~14 years and combined with data from earlier VLBI observations
of 3C 345 which started in 1979. We discuss the trajectories, kinematics, and
flux density evolution of enhanced emission regions embedded in the jet and
present evidence for geometrical (e.g. precession) and physical (e.g.
relativistic shocks and plasma instability) factors determining the morphology
and dynamics of relativistic flows on parsec scales.
