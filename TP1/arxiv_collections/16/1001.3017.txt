We revisit the 3-pass code-based identification scheme proposed by Stern at
Crypto'93, and give a new 5-pass protocol for which the probability of the
cheater is 1/2 (instead of 2/3 in the original Stern's proposal). Furthermore,
we propose to use quasi-cyclic construction in order to dramatically reduce the
size of the public key. The proposed scheme is zero-knowledge and relies on an
NP-complete problem coming from coding theory (namely the q-ary Syndrome
Decoding problem). Taking into account a recent study of a generalization of
Stern's information-set-decoding algorithm for decoding linear codes over
arbitrary finite fields Fq we suggest parameters so that the public key be
34Kbits while those of Stern's scheme is about 66Kbits. This provides a very
practical identification (and possibly signature) scheme which is mostly
attractive for light-weight cryptography
