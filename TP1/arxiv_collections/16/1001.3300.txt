Using an effective Lagrangian approach we analyze a generic Higgsless model
with composite heavy fermions, transforming as SU(2)_{L+R} Doublets. Assuming
that the Standard Model fermions acquire mass through mixing with the new heavy
fermions, we constrain the free parameters of the effective Lagrangian studying
Flavour Changing Neutral Current processes. In so doing we obtain bounds that
can be applied to a wide range of models characterized by the same fermion
mixing hypothesis.
