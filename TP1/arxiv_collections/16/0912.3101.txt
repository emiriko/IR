We use entropy statistics in this paper to measure the synergies of knowledge
exploration, knowledge exploitation, and organizational control in the
Hungarian innovation system. Our data consists of high- and medium-tech firms
and knowledge-intensive services categorized by sub-regions (proxy for
geography), industrial sectors (proxy for technology) and firm size (proxy for
organization). Configurational information along these three dimensions is used
as an indicator of reduction of uncertainty or, in other words, the synergy
across the knowledge functions. Our results indicate that three regimes have
been created during the Hungarian transition with very different dynamics: (1)
Budapest and its agglomeration emerge as a knowledge-based innovation system on
every indicator; (2) the north-western part of the country, where foreign-owned
companies have induced a shift in knowledge-organization; while (3) the system
in the eastern and southern part of the country seems to be organized as a
response to government expenditure. The national level no longer adds to the
synergy across these regional innovation systems.
