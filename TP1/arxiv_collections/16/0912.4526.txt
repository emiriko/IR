Molecular dynamics simulations of ionic solutions depend sensitively on the
force fields employed for the ions. To resolve the fine differences between
ions of the same valence and roughly similar size and in particular to
correctly describe ion-specific effects, it is clear that accurate force fields
are necessary. In the past, optimization strategies for ionic force fields
either considered single-ion properties (such as the solvation free energy at
infinite dilution or the ion-water structure) or ion-pair properties (in the
form of ion-ion distribution functions). In this paper we investigate
strategies to optimize ionic force fields based on single-ion and ion-pair
properties simultaneously. To that end, we simulate five different salt
solutions, namely CsCl, KCl, NaI, KF, and CsI, at finite ion concentration. The
force fields of these ions are systematically varied under the constraint that
the single-ion solvation free energy matches the experimental value, which
reduces the two-dimensional $\{\sigma,\epsilon\}$ parameter space of the
Lennard Jones interaction to a one dimensional line for each ion. From the
finite-concentration simulations, the pair-potential is extracted and the
osmotic coefficient is calculated, which is compared to experimental data. We
find a strong dependence of the osmotic coefficient on the force field, which
is remarkable as the single-ion solvation free energy and the ion-water
structure remain invariant under the parameter variation. Optimization of the
force field is achieved for the cations Cs$^+$ and K$^+$, while for the anions
I$^-$ and F$^-$ the experimental osmotic coefficient cannot be reached. This
suggests that in the long run, additional parameters might have to be
introduced into the modeling, for example by modified mixing rules.
