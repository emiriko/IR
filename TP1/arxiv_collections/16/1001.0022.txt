Motivated by large nu_mu-nu_tau flavor mixing, we consider mu-tau production
at hadron colliders via dimension-6 effective operators, which can be
attributed to new physics in the flavor sector at a higher scale Lambda.
Current bounds on many of these operators from low energy experiments are very
weak or nonexistent, and they may lead to clean mu+tau- and mu-tau+ signals at
hadron colliders. At the Tevatron with 8 inverse femtobarns, one can exceed
current bounds for most operators, with most 2 sigma sensitivities being in the
6-24 TeV range. We find that at the LHC with 1 (100) inverse femtobarns
integrated luminosity, one can reach a 2 sigma sensitivity for Lambda \sim 3-10
TeV (Lambda =\sim 6-21 TeV), depending on the Lorentz structure of the
operator. For some operators, an improvement of several orders of magnitude in
sensitivity can be obtained with only a few tens of inverse picobarns at the
LHC.
