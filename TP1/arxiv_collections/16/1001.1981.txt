Particles with resonant short-range interactions have universal properties
that do not depend on the details of their structure or their interactions at
short distances. In the three-body system, these properties include the
existence of a geometric spectrum of three-body Efimov states and a discrete
scaling symmetry leading to log-periodic dependence of observables on the
scattering length. Similar universal properties appear in the four-body system
and possibly higher-body systems as well. For example, universal four-body
states have recently been predicted and observed in experiment. These phenomena
are often referred to as "Efimov Physics". We review their theoretical
description and discuss applications in different areas of physics with a
special emphasis on nuclear and particle physics.
