The results on amplifying either radially or azimuthally polarized light with
a fiber amplifier are presented. Experimental results reveal that more than 85%
polarization purity can be retained at the output even with 40dB amplification,
and that efficient conversion of the amplified light to linear polarization can
be obtained.
