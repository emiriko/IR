In today's world the art of sending & displaying the hidden information
especially in public places, has received more attention and faced many
challenges. Therefore, different methods have been proposed so far for hiding
information in different cover media. In this paper a method for hiding of
information on the billboard display is presented. It is well known that
encryption provides secure channels for communicating entities. However, due to
lack of covertness on these channels, an eavesdropper can identify encrypted
streams through statistical tests and capture them for further cryptanalysis.
In this paper we propose a new form of steganography, on-line hiding of
information on the output screens of the instrument. This method can be used
for announcing a secret message in public place. It can be extended to other
means such as electronic advertising board around sports stadium, railway
station or airport. This method of steganography is very similar to image
steganography and video steganography. Private marking system using symmetric
key steganography technique and LSB technique is used here for hiding the
secret information.
