The evaluation of the top quark mass suppressed terms to the Higgs production
cross section in gluon fusion at next-to-next-to-leading order is reported on.
In the region below threshold, the Feynman diagrams are evaluated using
asymptotic expansions. The result is then matched to the high-energy limit
derived from kT factorization. The result shows that the heavy-top limit used
so far approximates the full result to better than 1%.
