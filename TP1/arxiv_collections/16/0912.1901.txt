We present a detailled timed automata model of the clock synchronization
algorithm that is currently being used in a wireless sensor network (WSN) that
has been developed by the Dutch company Chess. Using the Uppaal model checker,
we establish that in certain cases a static, fully synchronized network may
eventually become unsynchronized if the current algorithm is used, even in a
setting with infinitesimal clock drifts.
