In operator algebra theory, a conditional expectation is usually assumed to
be a projection map onto a sub-algebra. In the paper, a further type of
conditional expectation and an extension of the Lueders - von Neumann
measurement to observables with continuous spectra are considered; both are
defined for a single operator and become a projection map only if they exist
for all operators. Criteria for the existence of the different types of
conditional expectation and of the extension of the Lueders - von Neumann
measurement are presented, and the question whether they coincide is studied.
All this is done in the general framework of Jordan operator algebras. The
examples considered include the type I and type II operator algebras, the
standard Hilbert space model of quantum mechanics, and a no-go result
concerning the conditional expectation of observables that satisfy the
canonical commutator relation.
