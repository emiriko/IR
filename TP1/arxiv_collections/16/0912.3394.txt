We consider an inflationary curvaton scenario, where the curvaton decays into
two non-interacting relativistic fluids and later during the cosmological
evolution one of them becomes non-relativistic, forming dark matter component
of the universe. We study the thermic properties and the generation of
non-gaussianity in this three fluid curvaton model. By solving the evolution of
the system and using several cosmological conditions we find that the allowed
parameter space is strongly constrained. The naturalness of this curvaton
scenario is also discussed.
