The decoherence induced on a single qubit by its interaction with the
environment is studied. The environment is modelled as a scalar two-level boson
system that can go through either first order or continuous excited state
quantum phase transitions, depending on the values of the control parameters. A
mean field method based on the Tamm-Damkoff approximation is worked out in
order to understand the observed behaviour of the decoherence. Only the
continuous excited state phase transition produces a noticeable effect in the
decoherence of the qubit. This is maximal when the system-environment coupling
brings the environment to the critical point for the continuous phase
transition. In this situation, the decoherence factor (or the fidelity) goes to
zero with a finite size scaling power law.
