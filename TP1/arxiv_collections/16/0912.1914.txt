In the present paper, we propose integrable semi-discrete and full-discrete
analogues of the short pulse (SP) equation. The key of the construction is the
bilinear forms and determinant structure of solutions of the SP equation. We
also give the determinant formulas of N-soliton solutions of the semi-discrete
and full-discrete analogues of the SP equations, from which the multi-loop and
multi-breather solutions can be generated. In the continuous limit, the
full-discrete SP equation converges to the semi-discrete SP equation, then to
the continuous SP equation. Based on the semi-discrete SP equation, an
integrable numerical scheme, i.e., a self-adaptive moving mesh scheme, is
proposed and used for the numerical computation of the short pulse equation.
