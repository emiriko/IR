We present an alternative quantization procedure for the one-dimensional
non-relativistic quantum mechanics. We show that, for the case of a free
particle and a particle in a box, the complete classical and quantum
correspondence can be obtained using this formulation. The resulting wave
packets do not disperse and strongly peak on the classical paths. Moreover, for
the case of the free particle, they satisfy minimum uncertainty relation.
