We consider the sample covariance matrices of large data matrices which have
i.i.d. complex matrix entries and which are non-square in the sense that the
difference between the number of rows and the number of columns tends to
infinity. We show that the second-order correlation function of the
characteristic polynomial of the sample covariance matrix is asymptotically
given by the sine kernel in the bulk of the spectrum and by the Airy kernel at
the edge of the spectrum. Similar results are given for real sample covariance
matrices.
