Using a precursor superconductivity scenario for the cuprates we present a
theory for the temperature dependent behavior of the spectral gaps associated
with four distinct spectroscopies: angle resolved photoemission (ARPES),
differential conductance $dI/dV$, quasi-particle interference spectroscopy, and
the autocorrelated ARPES pattern. We find good agreement for a range of
existing experiments and make predictions for others. Our theory, which
incorporates the necessary (observed) contrast between the nodal and anti-nodal
response, shows how different nodal gap shapes are associated with these
alternative spectroscopies.
