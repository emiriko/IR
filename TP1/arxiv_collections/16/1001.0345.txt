Atomic magnetometers have very high absolute precision and sensitivity to
magnetic fields but suffer from a fundamental problem: the vectorial or
tensorial interaction of light with atoms leads to "dead zones", certain
orientations of magnetic field where the magnetometer loses its sensitivity. We
demonstrate a simple polarization modulation scheme that simultaneously creates
coherent population trapping (CPT) in orientation and alignment, thereby
eliminating dead zones. Using $^{87}$Rb in a 10 Torr buffer gas cell we measure
narrow, high-contrast CPT transparency peaks in all orientations and also show
absence of systematic effects associated with non-linear Zeeman splitting.
