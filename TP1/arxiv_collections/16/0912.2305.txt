The one-dimensional Oslo model is studied under self-organized criticality
(SOC) conditions and under absorbing state (AS) conditions. While the activity
signals the phase transition under AS conditions by a sudden increase, this is
not the case under SOC conditions. The scaling parameters of the activity are
found to be identical under SOC and AS conditions, but in SOC the activity
lacks a pickup.
