Mach's Principle says that a particle's inertia is due to some interaction of
that particle with all the other masses in the universe. Here we explore the
possibility of the gravitational interaction energy of the background quantum
vacuum energy playing the role of a global Higg's field (described by a varying
cosmological constant) entirely contributing to the local inertial masses of
particles in the spirit of Mach's principle.
