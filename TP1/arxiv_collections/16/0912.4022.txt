A general experimental technique for high resolution studies of nucleon
transfer reactions using radioactive beams is briefly described, together with
the first new physics results that have been obtained with the new TIARA array.
These first results from TIARA are for the reaction 24Ne(d,p)25Ne, studied in
inverse kinematics with a pure radioactive beam of 100,000 pps from the SPIRAL
facility at GANIL. The reaction probes the energies of neutron orbitals
relevant to very neutron rich nuclei in this mass region and the results
highlight the emergence of the N=16 magic number for neutrons and the
associated disappearance of the N=20 neutron magic number for the very neutron
rich neon isotopes.
