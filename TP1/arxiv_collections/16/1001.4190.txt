Speech signals of the letter 'zha' in Tamil language of 3 males and 3 females
were coded using an improved version of Linear Predictive Coding (LPC). The
sampling frequency was at 16 kHz and the bit rate was at 15450 bits per second,
where the original bit rate was at 128000 bits per second with the help of wave
surfer audio tool. The output LPC cepstrum is implemented in first order three
state Hidden Markov Model(HMM) chain.
