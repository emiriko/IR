The present work involves the discrete modelling of corrosion induced
cracking and its influence on the bond between reinforcement and concrete. A
lattice approach is used to describe the mechanical interaction of a corroding
reinforcement bar, the surrounding concrete and the interface between steel
reinforcement and concrete. The cross-section of the ribbed reinforcement bar
is taken to be circular, assuming that the interaction of the ribs of the
deformed reinforcement bar and the surrounding concrete is included in a
cap-plasticity interface model. The expansion of the corrosion product is
represented by an eigenstrain in the lattice elements forming the interface.
The lattice modelling approach is applied to the analysis of corrosion induced
cracking and its influence of the bond strength. The model capabilities are
assessed by comparing results of analyses with those from unconfined pull-out
tests reported in the literature. Future work will investigate the influence of
the stiffness of interface elements and the effect of lateral confinement on
corrosion induced cracking.
