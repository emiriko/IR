Detailed electronic many-body configurations are extracted from
quantitatively measured timeresolved nonlinear absorption spectra of resonantly
excited GaAs quantum wells. The microscopic theory assigns the observed
spectral changes to a unique mixture of electron-hole plasma, exciton, and
polarization effects. Strong transient gain is observed only under co-circular
pump-probe conditions and is attributed to the transfer of pump-induced
coherences to the probe.
