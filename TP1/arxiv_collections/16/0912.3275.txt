Using mobile robots for autonomous patrolling of environments to prevent
intrusions is a topic of increasing practical relevance. One of the most
challenging scientific issues is the problem of finding effective patrolling
strategies that, at each time point, determine the next moves of the patrollers
in order to maximize some objective function. In the very last years this
problem has been addressed in a game theoretical fashion, explicitly
considering the presence of an adversarial intruder. The general idea is that
of modeling a patrolling situation as a game, played by the patrollers and the
intruder, and of studying the equilibria of this game to derive effective
patrolling strategies. In this paper we present a game theoretical formal
framework for the determination of effective patrolling strategies that extends
the previous proposals appeared in the literature, by considering environments
with arbitrary topology and arbitrary preferences for the agents. The main
original contributions of this paper are the formulation of the patrolling game
for generic graph environments, an algorithm for finding a deterministic
equilibrium strategy, which is a fixed path through the vertices of the graph,
and an algorithm for finding a non-deterministic equilibrium strategy, which is
a set of probabilities for moving between adjacent vertices of the graph. Both
the algorithms are analytically studied and experimentally validated, to assess
their properties and efficiency.
