We present chromospheric cloud modeling on the basis of H-alpha
profile-sampling images taken with the Interferometric Bidimensional
Spectrometer (IBIS) at the Dunn Solar Telescope (DST). We choose the required
reference background profile by using theoretical NLTE profile synthesis. The
resulting cloud parameters are converted into estimates of physical parameters
(temperature and various densities). Their mean values compare well with the
VAL-C model.
