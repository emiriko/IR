Graphene has shown impressive properties for nanoelectronics applications
including a high mobility and a width-dependent bandgap. Use of graphene in
nanoelectronics would most likey be in the form of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs)
where the ribbon width is expected to be less than 20 nm. Many theoretical
projections have been made on the impact of edge-scattering on carrier
transport in GNRs - most studies point to a degradation of mobility (of GNRs)
as well as the on/off ratio (of GNR FETs). This study provides the first clear
experimental evidence of the onset of size-effect in patterned GNRs; it is
shown that for W<60 nm, carrier mobility in GNRs is limited by edge-scattering.
