We theoretically investigate the collective modes of imbalanced two component
one-dimensional Fermi gases with attractive interactions. This is done for
trapped and untrapped systems both at zero and non-zero temperature, using
self-consistent mean-field theory and the random phase approximation. We
discuss how the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state can be detected
and the periodicity of the associated density modulations determined from its
collective mode spectrum. We also investigate the accuracy of the single mode
approximation for low-lying collective excitations in a trap by comparing
frequencies obtained via sum rules with frequencies obtained from direct
collective mode calculations. It is found that, for collective excitations
where the atomic clouds of the two spin species oscillate largely in phase, the
single mode approximation holds well for a large parameter regime. Finally we
investigate the collective mode spectrum obtained by parametric modulation of
the coupling constant.
