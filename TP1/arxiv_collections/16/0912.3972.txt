The purposes of this paper have to discuss issues related to Network Traffic
Management. A relatively new category of network management is fast becoming a
necessity in converged business Networks. Mid-sized and large organizations are
finding they must control network traffic behavior to assure that their
strategic applications always get the resources they need to perform optimally.
Controlling network traffic requires limiting bandwidth to certain
applications, guaranteeing minimum bandwidth to others, and marking traffic
with high or low priorities. This exercise is called Network Traffic
Management.
