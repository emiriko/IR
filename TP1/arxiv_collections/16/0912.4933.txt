The simplest nonlinear Schrodinger equation that contains the time derivative
of the probability density is investigated. This equation has the same
stationary solutions as its linear counterpart, and these solutions are the
eigenstates of the corresponding linear Hamiltonian. The equation leads to the
usual continuity equation and thus maintains the unitarity of the wave
function. For the non-stationary solutions, numerical calculations are carried
out for the one-dimensional infinite square-well potential and for several
time-dependent potentials that tend to the former as time increases. Results
show that for various initial states, the wave function always evolves into
some eigenstate of the corresponding linear Hamiltonian of the one-dimensional
infinite square-well potential. For a small time-dependent perturbation
potential, solutions present the process similar to the spontaneous transition
between stationary states. For a periodical potential with an appropriate
frequency, solutions present the process similar to the stimulated transition.
This nonlinear Schrodinger equation thus presents the state evolution similar
to the wave-function reduction.
