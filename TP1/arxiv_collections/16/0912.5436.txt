In the framework of the theory of open systems based on completely positive
quantum dynamical semigroups, we study the continuous variable entanglement for
a system consisting of two independent harmonic oscillators interacting with a
general environment. We solve the Kossakowski-Lindblad master equation for the
time evolution of the considered system and describe the entanglement in terms
of the covariance matrix for an arbitrary Gaussian input state. Using
Peres-Simon necessary and sufficient criterion for separability of two-mode
Gaussian states, we show that for certain values of diffusion and dissipation
coefficients describing the environment, the state keeps for all times its
initial type: separable or entangled. In other cases, entanglement generation,
entanglement sudden death or a periodic collapse and revival of entanglement
take place. We analyze also the time evolution of the logarithmic negativity,
which characterizes the degree of entanglement of the quantum state.
