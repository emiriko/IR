Design and physical operation principles of new microchannel avalanche
photodiode (MC APD) with gain up to 10^5 and linearity range improved an order
of magnitude compared to known similar devices. A distinctive feature of the
new device is a directly biased p-n junction under each pixel which plays role
of an individual quenching resistor. This allows increasing pixel density up to
40000 per mm^2 and making entire device area sensitive.
