Using our recent proposal for defining gauge invariant averages we give a
general-covariant formulation of the so-called cosmological "backreaction". Our
effective covariant equations allow us to describe in explicitly gauge
invariant form the way classical or quantum inhomogeneities affect the average
evolution of our Universe.
