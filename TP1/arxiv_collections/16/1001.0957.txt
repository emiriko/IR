High-Tc superconductivity in layered cuprates is described in a BCS-BEC
formalism with linearly-dispersive s- and d-wave Cooper pairs moving in
quasi-2D finite-width layers about the CuO_2 planes. This yields a closed
formula for Tc determined by the layer width, the Debye frequency, the pairing
energy, and the in-plane penetration depth. The new formula reasonably
reproduces empirical values of superconducting Tc's for seven different
compounds among the LSCO, YBCO, BSCCO and TBCCO layered cuprates.
