TANAMI (Tracking Active Galactic Nuclei with Austral Milliarcsecond
Interferometry) is a monitoring program to study the parsec-scale structures
and dynamics of relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei (AGN) of the
Southern Hemisphere with the Long Baseline Array and associated telescopes.
Extragalactic jets south of -30 degrees declination are observed at 8.4 GHz and
22 GHz every two months at milliarcsecond resolution. The initial TANAMI sample
is a hybrid radio and gamma-ray selected sample since the combination of VLBI
and gamma-ray observations is crucial to understand the broadband emission
characteristics of AGN.
