New CCD photometric observations in V, R and I filters of the eclipsing
binary AV CMi have been obtained. The complete light curves are analyzed with
the Wilson-Devinney code and new geometric and photometric elements are
derived. Moreover, 2-year systematic observations of the system revealed the
existence of a third body orbiting around one of the components with an
approximate period of 0.52 days. The first light elements for this additional
component are given and its nature is discussed.
