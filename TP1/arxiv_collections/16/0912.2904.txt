Inclusions, or defects, moving at constant velocity through free classical
fields are shown to be subject to a drag force which depends on the field
dynamics and the coupling of the inclusion to the field. The results are used
to predict the drag exerted on inclusions, such as proteins, in lipid membranes
due to their interaction with height and composition fluctuations. The force,
measured in Monte Carlo simulations, on a point like magnetic field moving
through an Ising ferromagnet is also well explained by these results.
