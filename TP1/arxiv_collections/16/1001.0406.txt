Rigorous quantum electrodynamical calculation is presented for energy levels
of the 1^1S, 2^1S, 2^3S, 2^1P_1, and 2^3P_{0,1,2} states of helium-like ions
with the nuclear charge Z=3...12. The calculational approach accounts for all
relativistic, quantum electrodynamical, and recoil effects up to orders
m\alpha^6 and m^2/M\alpha^5, thus advancing the previously reported theory of
light helium-like ions by one order in \alpha.
