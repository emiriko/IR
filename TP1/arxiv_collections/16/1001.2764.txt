We consider the double affine Hecke algebra
$H=H(k_0,k_1,k^\vee_0,k^\vee_1;q)$ associated with the root system
$(C^\vee_1,C_1)$. We display three elements $x$, $y$, $z$ in $H$ that satisfy
essentially the $Z_3$-symmetric Askey-Wilson relations. We obtain the relations
as follows. We work with an algebra $\hat H$ that is more general than $H$,
called the universal double affine Hecke algebra of type $(C_1^\vee,C_1)$. An
advantage of $\hat H$ over $H$ is that it is parameter free and has a larger
automorphism group. We give a surjective algebra homomorphism ${\hat H} \to H$.
We define some elements $x$, $y$, $z$ in $\hat H$ that get mapped to their
counterparts in $H$ by this homomorphism. We give an action of Artin's braid
group $B_3$ on $\hat H$ that acts nicely on the elements $x$, $y$, $z$; one
generator sends $x\mapsto y\mapsto z \mapsto x$ and another generator
interchanges $x$, $y$. Using the $B_3$ action we show that the elements $x$,
$y$, $z$ in $\hat H$ satisfy three equations that resemble the $Z_3$-symmetric
Askey-Wilson relations. Applying the homomorphism ${\hat H}\to H$ we find that
the elements $x$, $y$, $z$ in $H$ satisfy similar relations.
