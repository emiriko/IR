Modern graphics processing units (GPUs) provide impressive computing
resources, which can be accessed conveniently through the CUDA programming
interface. We describe how GPUs can be used to considerably speed up molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations for system sizes ranging up to about 1 million
particles. Particular emphasis is put on the numerical long-time stability in
terms of energy and momentum conservation, and caveats on limited
floating-point precision are issued. Strict energy conservation over 10^8 MD
steps is obtained by double-single emulation of the floating-point arithmetic
in accuracy-critical parts of the algorithm. For the slow dynamics of a
supercooled binary Lennard-Jones mixture, we demonstrate that the use of
single-floating point precision may result in quantitatively and even
physically wrong results. For simulations of a Lennard-Jones fluid, the
described implementation shows speedup factors of up to 80 compared to a serial
implementation for the CPU, and a single GPU was found to compare with a
parallelised MD simulation using 64 distributed cores.
