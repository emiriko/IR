In the recently proposed dark left-right gauge model of particle
interactions, the left-handed fermion doublet $(\nu,e)_L$ is connected to its
right-handed counterpart $(n,e)_R$ through a scalar bidoublet, but $\nu_L$
couples to $n_R$ only through $\phi_1^0$ which has no vacuum expectation value.
The usual R parity, i.e. $R = (-)^{3B+L+2j}$, can be defined for this
nonsupersymmetric model so that both $n$ and $\Phi_1$ are odd together with
$W_R^\pm$. The lightest $n$ is thus a viable dark-matter candidate (scotino).
Here we explore the phenomenology associated with the $SU(2)_R$ gauge group of
this model, which allows it to appear at the TeV energy scale. The exciting
possibility of $Z' \to 8$ charged leptons is discussed.
