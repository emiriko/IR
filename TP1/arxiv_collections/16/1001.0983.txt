We present an analysis of the XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray data of the young
Type Ia supernova remnant 0519-69.0 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We used data
from both the Chandra ACIS and XMM-Newton EPIC-MOS instruments, and high
resolution X-ray spectra obtained with the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating
Spectrometer. The Chandra data show that there is a radial stratification of
oxygen, intermediate mass elements and iron, with the emission from more
massive elements more toward the center. Using a deprojection technique we
measure a forward shock radius of 4.0(3) pc and a reverse shock radius of
2.7(4) pc. We took the observed stratification of the shocked ejecta into
account in the modeling of the X-ray spectra with multi-component NEI models,
with the components corresponding to layers dominated by one or two elements.
An additional component was added in order to represent the ISM, which mostly
contributed to the continuum emission. This model fits the data well, and was
also employed to characterize the spectra of distinct regions extracted from
the Chandra data. From our spectral analysis we find that the fractional masses
of shocked ejecta for the most abundant elements are: M(O)=32%, M(Si/S)=7%/5%,
M(Ar+Ca)=1%, and M(Fe) = 55%. From the continuum component we derive a
circumstellar density of nH= 2.4(2)/cm^3. This density, together with the
measurements of the forward and reverse shock radii suggest an age of 450+/-200
yr,somewhat lower than, but consistent with the estimate based on the optical
light echo (600+/-200 yr). From the RGS spectra we measured a Doppler
broadening of sigma=1873+/-50 km/s, from implying a forward shock velocity of
vS = 2770+/-500 km/s. We discuss the results in the context of single
degenerate explosion models, using semi-analytical and numerical modeling, and
compare the characteristics of 0519-69.0 with those of other Type Ia supernova
remnants.
