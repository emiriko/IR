Multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) study of the sub-pc
scale jet of 3C 84 is presented. We carried out 14-epoch VLBI observations
during 2006-2009 with the Japanese VLBI Network (JVN) and the VLBI Exploration
of Radio Astrometry (VERA), immediately following the radio outburst that began
in 2005. We confirmed that the outburst was associated with the central ~1 pc
core, accompanying the emergence of a new component. This is striking evidence
of the recurrence of jet activity. The new component became brighter during
2008, in contrast to the constant gamma-ray emission that was observed with the
Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope during the same time. We found that the
projected speed of the new component is 0.23c from 2007/297 (2007 October 24)
to 2009/114 (2009 April 24). The direction of movement of this component
differs from that of the pre-existing component by ~40 degree. This is the
first measurement of kinematics of a sub-pc jet in a gamma-ray active phase.
Possible detection of jet deceleration and the jet kinematics in connection
with the gamma-ray emission is discussed.
