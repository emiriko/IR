We demonstrate a technique to tune the optical properties of micropillar
cavities by creating small defects on the sample surface near the cavity region
with an intense focused laser beam. Such defects modify strain in the
structure, changing the birefringence in a controllable way. We apply the
technique to make the fundamental cavity mode polarization-degenerate and to
fine tune the overall mode frequencies, as needed for applications in quantum
information science.
