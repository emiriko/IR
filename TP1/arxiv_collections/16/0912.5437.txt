We have studied the conductance distribution function of two-dimensional
disordered noninteracting systems in the crossover regime between the diffusive
and the localized phases. The distribution is entirely determined by the mean
conductance, g, in agreement with the strong version of the single-parameter
scaling hypothesis. The distribution seems to change drastically at a critical
value very close to one. For conductances larger than this critical value, the
distribution is roughly Gaussian while for smaller values it resembles a
log-normal distribution. The two distributions match at the critical point with
an often appreciable change in behavior. This matching implies a jump in the
first derivative of the distribution which does not seem to disappear as system
size increases. We have also studied 1/g corrections to the skewness to
quantify the deviation of the distribution from a Gaussian function in the
diffusive regime.
