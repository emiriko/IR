We propose that in some pulsars the magnetosphere has different states with
different geometries or/and different distributions of currents, it
occasionally switches between them. These states have different spindown rates
and emission beams, in some of the states no radioemission is produced at all.
Switching into a different state manifests as a mode change when we see
different parts of the emission beam or the beams in different states have
significantly different geometries, it manifests as nulling when we either miss
the new beam or no radioemission is generated in the new state. We show that
modest variations in the beam shape can be accompanied by large variations in
the pulsar spindown rate W - the dependence of W on the opening angle of the
emission beam $\alpha$ can be as strong as W\propto\alpha^4. We speculate about
physical mechanisms which may cause reconfiguration of the magnetosphere.
