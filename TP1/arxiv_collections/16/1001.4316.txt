We present a gauge-field extension of the Bose condensate model that
describes $T\approx0$ superfluid turbulence generated by the macroscopic motion
of the superfluid. We first establish that the condensate model is dual to the
short-range interacting loop gas model, wherein the loops represent quantum
vortex lines. Vortex lines form, interact and proliferate as a result of the
superfluid motion. Our extension is based on incorporating the Biot-Savart
interaction between vortex lines, which is lacking in the loop gas model. We
show that the extended loop gas is dual to a Ginzburg-Landau model, wherein the
gauge coupling is between the macroscopic velocity field of the superfluid and
the condensate. Applying the model to cylindrical and pipe flows, we describe
how turbulence transitions with and without intermediate vortex flow,
respectively.
