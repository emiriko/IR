We introduce a system of phenomenological equations for Bose-Einstein
condensates of magnons in the one-dimensional setting. The nonlinearly coupled
equations, written for amplitudes of the right-and left-traveling waves,
combine basic features of the Gross-Pitaevskii and complex Ginzburg-Landau
models. They include localized source terms, to represent the microwave
magnon-pumping field. With the source represented by the $\delta $-functions,
we find analytical solutions for symmetric localized states of the magnon
condensates. We also predict the existence of asymmetric states with unequal
amplitudes of the two components. Numerical simulations demonstrate that all
analytically found solutions are stable. With the $\delta $-function terms
replaced by broader sources, the simulations reveal a transition from the
single-peak stationary symmetric states to multi-peak ones, generated by the
modulational instability of extended nonlinear-wave patterns. In the
simulations, symmetric initial conditions always converge to symmetric
stationary patterns. On the other hand, asymmetric inputs may generate
nonstationary asymmetric localized solutions, in the form of traveling or
standing waves. Comparison with experimental results demonstrates that the
phenomenological equations provide for a reasonably good model for the
description of the spatiotemporal dynamics of magnon condensates.
