The publication of new tables of calibration of some fundamental parameters
of Galactic B0-B5 supergiants in the two classes $Ia$ and $Ib$ allow to
particularize the eight parameters conjecture that model five fundamental
parameters. The numerical expression for visual magnitude, radius, mass,
luminosity and surface gravity are derived for supergiants in the range of
temperature between 29700 and 15200. The presence of accurate tables of
calibration allows us to introduce the efficiency of the derived formulas.
