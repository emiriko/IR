We consider a general class of vector-tensor theories of gravity and show
that solutions with accelerated expansion and a future type III singularity are
a common feature in these models. We also show that there are only six
vector-tensor theories with the same small scales behavior as General
Relativity and, in addition, only two of them can be made completely free from
instabilities. Finally, two particular models as candidates for dark energy are
proposed: on one hand, a cosmic vector that allows to alleviate the usual
naturalness and coincidence problems and, on the other hand, the
electromagnetic field is shown to give rise to an effective cosmological
constant on large scales whose value can be explained in terms of inflation at
the electroweak scale.
