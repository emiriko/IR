In this paper we consider some issues about the statistical model of the
hadronization in a holographic approach. We introduce a Rindler like horizon in
the bulk and we understand the string breaking as a tunneling event under this
horizon. We calculate the hadron spectrum and we get a thermal, and so
statistical, shape for it.
