Binary collisions of the gyrating charged particles in an external magnetic
field are considered within a classical second-order perturbation theory, i.e.,
up to contributions which are quadratic in the binary interaction, starting
from the unperturbed helical motion of the particles. The calculations are done
with the help of a binary collisions treatment which is valid for any strength
of the magnetic field and involves all harmonics of the particles cyclotron
motion. The energy transfer is explicitly calculated for a regularized and
screened potential which is both of finite range and nonsingular at the origin.
The validity of the perturbation treatment is evaluated by comparing with
classical trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC) calculations which also allow to
investigate the strong collisions with large energy and velocity transfer at
low velocities. For large initial velocities on the other hand, only small
velocity transfers occur. There the nonperturbative numerical CTMC results
agree excellently with the predictions of the perturbative treatment.
