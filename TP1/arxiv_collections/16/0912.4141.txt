This paper proposes an indicator of journals' scientific prestige, the SJR
indicator, for ranking scholarly journals based on citation weighting schemes
and eigenvector centrality to be used in complex and heterogeneous citation
networks such Scopus. Its computation methodology is described and the results
after implementing the indicator over Scopus 2007 dataset are compared to an
ad-hoc Journal Impact Factor both generally and inside specific scientific
areas. The results showed that SJR indicator and JIF distributions fitted well
to a power law distribution and that both metrics were strongly correlated,
although there were also major changes in rank. There was an observable general
trend that might indicate that SJR indicator values decreased certain JIF
values whose citedeness was greater than would correspond to their scientific
influence.
