This articles presents a simulation study of the applicability of the
Rosenfeld entropy scaling to the systems which can not be approximated by
effective hard spheres. Three systems are studied: Herzian spheres, Gauss Core
Model and soft repulsive shoulder potential. These systems demonstrate the
diffusion anomalies at low temperatures: the diffusion increases with
increasing density or pressure. It is shown that for the first two systems
which belong to the class of bounded potentials the Rosenfeld scaling formula
is valid only in the infinite temperature limit where there are no anomalies.
For the soft repulsive shoulder the scaling formula is valid already at
sufficiently low temperatures, however, out of the anomaly range.
