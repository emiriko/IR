Although not designed as an astrometric instrument, Kepler is expected to
produce astrometric results of a quality appropriate to support many of the
astrophysical investigations enabled by its photometric results. On the basis
of data collected during the first few months of operation, the astrometric
precision for a single 30 minute measure appears to be better than 4
milliarcseconds (0.001 pixel). Solutions for stellar parallax and proper
motions await more observations, but the analysis of the astrometric residuals
from a local solution in the vicinity of a star have already proved to be an
important tool in the process of confirming the hypothesis of a planetary
transit.
