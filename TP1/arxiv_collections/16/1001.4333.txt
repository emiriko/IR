Schietinger et al. (Nano Lett. 2009, 9, 2477-2481) observed single
nanoparticle emission from NaYF4:Er3+,Yb3+ and noted unusual changes in the
intensities of red and green emissions with particle size. We show that the
documented changes are due to instrumental artifacts and that the explanations
given for the changes are incorrect.
