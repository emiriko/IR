We report detailed magnetic measurements on history and metastability effects
in the intermediate state of mesoscopic cylinders of type I superconducting
Indium. This includes the observation of topological hysteresis with the
signature occurrence of different critical fields during flux entry and flux
exit. We show the existence of a plethora of metastable configuration and
recipes to access them. We also demonstrate the manifestation of superheating
and supercooling of superconducting and normal states, respectively across the
superconductivity transition.
