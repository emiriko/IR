We provide a summary of our current knowledge of the phase structure of very
dense quark matter. We concentrate on the question how the ground state at
asymptotically high density -- color-flavor-locked (CFL) matter -- is modified
as the density is lowered. We discuss the nature of the quasi-particle
excitations, and present work on the transport properties of dense QCD matter.
