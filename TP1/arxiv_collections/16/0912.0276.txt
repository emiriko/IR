A new model is proposed for the strong ferromagnetism associated with
partially localized orbitals in the Fe16N2 metallic system which draws
substantially from models of heavy fermion metals. We demonstrated that an
unusual correlation effect is brought up within the Fe-N octahedral cluster
region and the effective on-site 3d-3d Coulomb interaction increases due to a
substantial 3d electrons charge density difference between the clusters and its
surroundings, which leads to a partially localized high spin electron
configuration with a long range ferromagnetic order. First principle
calculation based on LDA+U method shows that giant magnetic moment can be
achieved at sufficiently large Hubbard U value. The feature of the coexistence
of the localized and itinerant electron states plays a key role on the
formation of the giant saturation magnetization.
