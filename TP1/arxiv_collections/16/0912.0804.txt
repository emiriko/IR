We show the initial and final parameter space for SNe Ia in a ($\log P^{\rm
i}, M_{\rm 2}^{\rm i}$) plane and find that the positions of some famous
recurrent novae, as well as a supersoft X-ray source (SSS), RX J0513.9-6951,
are well explained by our model. The model can also explain the space velocity
and mass of Tycho G, which is now suggested to be the companion star of Tycho's
supernova. Our study indicates that the SSS, V Sge, might be the potential
progenitor of supernovae like SN 2002ic if the delayed dynamical-instability
model due to Han & Podsiadlowski (2006) is appropriate. Following the work of
Meng, Chen & Han (2009), we found that the SD model (WD + MS) with an optically
thick wind can explain the birth rate of supernovae like SN 2006X and reproduce
the distribution of the color excess of SNe Ia. The model also predicts that at
least 75% of all SNe Ia may show a polarization signal in their spectra.
