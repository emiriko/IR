Discussed is mechanics of objects with internal degrees of freedom in
generally non-Euclidean spaces. Geometric peculiarities of the model are
investigated detailly. Discussed are also possible mechanical applications,
e.g., in dynamics of structured continua, defect theory and in other fields of
mechanics of deformable bodies. Elaborated is a new method of analysis based on
non-holonomic frames. We compare our results and methods with those of other
authors working in nonlinear dynamics (many of them refer to our papers [20],
[21], [49], [50]). Simple examples of completely integerable models are
presented.
