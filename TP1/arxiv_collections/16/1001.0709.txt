SPICA (Space Infrared Telescope for Cosmology and Astrophysics) is a JAXA led
observatory that will operate in the mid and far infrared wavelength range
(5-210 micron) with unprecedented sensitivity, thanks to the 3.5 m (current
baseline) cold telescope (< 6 K) and advanced instruments. SPICA will carry a
mid infrared camera, mid infrared spectrometers and a mid infrared coronagraph
(built by JAXA institutes), a far infrared imaging spectrometer (SAFARI,
provided by a European/Canadian consortium), and a far infrared/sub-millimetre
spectrometer (proposed by U.S.). The contribution from ESA consists of the
telescope assembly, a collaboration in the ground segment and the interface
management to JAXA of the European instrument SAFARI. The SPICA observatory
will be open to the worldwide community and will provide unique and
ground-breaking answers to fundamental questions in planetary formation and
formation and evolution of galaxies through cosmic history. The target launch
year of SPICA is 2018. SPICA was selected in October 2007 as a candidate
M-class mission for the ESA Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 Plan, with the character of
"mission of opportunity". This report presents the science case of SPICA,
describes the mission and summarises the outcome of the ESA Assessment Study.
