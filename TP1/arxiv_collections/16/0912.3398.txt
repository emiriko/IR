NetEvo is a computational framework designed to help understand the evolution
of dynamical complex networks. It provides flexible tools for the simulation of
dynamical processes on networks and methods for the evolution of underlying
topological structures. The concept of a supervisor is used to bring together
both these aspects in a coherent way. It is the job of the supervisor to rewire
the network topology and alter model parameters such that a user specified
performance measure is minimised. This performance measure can make use of
current topological information and simulated dynamical output from the system.
Such an abstraction provides a suitable basis in which to study many
outstanding questions related to complex system design and evolution.
