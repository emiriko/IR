We have performed a theoretical study of electronic transport in single and
bilayer graphene based on the standard linear-response (Kubo) formalism and
continuum-model descriptions of the graphene band structure. We are focusing
especially on the interband contribution to the optical conductivity.
Analytical results are obtained for a variety of situations, which allow clear
identification of features in the conductivity that are associated with
relevant electronic energy scales. Our work extends previous numerical studies
and elucidates ways to infer electronic properties of graphene samples from
optical-conductivity measurements.
