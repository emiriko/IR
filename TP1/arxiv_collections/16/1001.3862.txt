In the strong field molecular tunneling ionization theory of Tong et al.
[Phys. Rev. A 66, 033402 (2002)], the ionization rate depends on the asymptotic
wavefunction of the molecular orbital from which the electron is removed. The
orbital wavefunctions obtained from standard quantum chemistry packages in
general are not good enough in the asymptotic region. Here we construct a
one-electron model potential for several linear molecules using density
functional theory (DFT). We show that the asymptotic wavefunction can be
improved with an iteration method and after one iteration accurate asymptotic
wavefunctions and structure parameters are determined. With the new parameters
we examine the alignment-dependent tunneling ionization probabilities for
several molecules and compare with other calculations and with recent
measurements, including ionization from inner molecular orbitals.
