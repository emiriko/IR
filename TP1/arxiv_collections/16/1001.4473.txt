The discovery of non-thermal X-ray emission from the jets of some X-ray
binaries, and especially the discovery of GeV-TeV gamma-rays in some of them,
provide a clear evidence of very efficient acceleration of particles to
multi-TeV energies in these systems. The observations demonstrate the richness
of non-thermal phenomena in compact galactic objects containing relativistic
outflows or winds produced near black holes and neutron stars. We review here
some of the main observational results on the non-thermal emission from X-ray
binaries as well as some of the proposed scenarios to explain the production of
high-energy gamma-rays.
