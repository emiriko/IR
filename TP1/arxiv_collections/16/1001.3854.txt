Equations of motion for free higher-spin gauge fields of any symmetry can be
formulated in terms of linearised curvatures. On the other hand, gauge
invariance alone does not fix the form of the corresponding actions which, in
addition, either contain higher derivatives or involve inverse powers of the
d'Alembertian operator, thus introducing possible subtleties in degrees of
freedom count. We suggest a path to avoid ambiguities, starting from local,
unconstrained Lagrangians previously proposed, and integrating out the
auxiliary fields from the functional integral, thus generating a unique
non-local theory expressed in terms of curvatures.
