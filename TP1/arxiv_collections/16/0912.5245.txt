Practical implementations of quantum computing are always done in the
presence of decoherence. Geometric phase is useful in the context of quantum
computing as a tool to achieve fault tolerance. Recent experimental progresses
on coherent control of single electron have suggested that electron in quantum
dot systems is a promising candidate of qubit in future quantum information
processing devices. In this paper, by considering a feasible quantum dot model,
we calculate the geometric phase of the quantum dot system in nonunitary
evolution and investigate the effect of environment parameters on the phase
value.
