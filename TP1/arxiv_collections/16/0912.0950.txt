Human fingerprints are reliable characteristics for personnel identification
as it is unique and persistence. A fingerprint pattern consists of ridges,
valleys and minutiae. In this paper we propose Fingerprint Verification based
on Gabor Filter Enhancement (FVGFE) algorithm for minutiae feature extraction
and post processing based on 9 pixel neighborhood. A global feature extraction
and fingerprints enhancement are based on Hong enhancement method which is
simultaneously able to extract local ridge orientation and ridge frequency. It
is observed that the Sensitivity and Specificity values are better compared to
the existing algorithms.
