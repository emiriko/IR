We propose that general D-dimensional quantum field theories are dual to
(D+1)-dimensional local quantum theories which in general include objects with
spin two or higher. Using a general prescription, we construct a
(D+1)-dimensional theory which is holographically dual to the D-dimensional
O(N) vector model. From the holographic theory, the phase transition and
critical properties of the model in dimensions D>2 are described.
