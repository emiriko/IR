The stable configurations of non-rotating and rotating hybrid stars composed
of colour superconducting quark matter core are constructed using several
equations of state (EOSs). We use a set of diverse EOSs for the nuclear matter
which represents the low density phase. The EOSs at higher densities correspond
to the quark matter in the colour superconducting phase and are computed within
the NJL-like model for different values of the scalar diquark and vector
current couplings strengths. The phase transition to the quark matter is
computed by a Maxwell construction. We find that the stability of the hybrid
stars are mainly governed by the behaviour of the EOSs for the colour
superconducting quark matter. However the compositions of hybrid star are
sensitive to the EOS of the nuclear matter. The value of the critical rotation
frequency for the hybrid star depends strongly on the EOS of the nuclear matter
as well as that for the colour superconducting quark matter. Our results
indicate that the EOS for the colour superconducting quark matter can be
obtained, by adjusting the parameters of the NJL model, to yield the stable
configurations of the hybrid star having the maximum mass $\sim 1.5M_\odot$ in
the non-rotating limit and the critical rotation frequency $\sim 1$ kHz.
