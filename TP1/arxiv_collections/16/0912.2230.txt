Let $\pi:(E,\nabla^{E}) \to (M,g)$ be an affine submersion with horizontal
distribution, where $\nabla^{E}$ is a symmetric connection and $M$ is a
Riemannian manifold. Let $\sigma$ be a section of $\pi$, namely, $\pi \circ
\sigma = Id_{M}$. It is possible to study the harmonic property of section
$\sigma$ in two ways. First, we see $\sigma$ as a harmonic map. Second, we see
$\sigma$ as harmonic section. In the Riemannian context, it means that $\sigma$
is a critical point of the vertical functional energy. Our main goal is to find
conditions to the assertion: $\sigma$ is a harmonic map if and only if $\sigma$
is a harmonic section.
