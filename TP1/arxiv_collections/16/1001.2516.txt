We study the evolution of the neutrinos system in rotating matter. Neutrinos
are supposed to be mixed massive particles interacting with background fermions
by means of the electroweak forces. First we find the solutions of wave
equations for the neutrino mass eigenstates in matter. Then we study the
behavior of neutrino flavor eigenstates in background matter. The problems of
neutrino bound states and neutrino flavor oscillations are discussed. We also
derive the analog of the quantum mechanical evolution equation for the system
of two flavor neutrinos in rotating matter and analyze its solution for the
particular initial condition for neutrino flavor eigenstates.
