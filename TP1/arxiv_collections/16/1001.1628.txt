A new experiment to measure the muon g-2 factor is proposed. We suppose the
sensitivity of this experiment to be about 0.03 ppm. The developed experiment
can be performed on an ordinary storage ring with a noncontinuous field created
by usual magnets. When the total length of straight sections of the ring is
appropriate, the spin rotation frequency becomes almost independent of the
particle momentum. In this case, a high-precision measurement of an average
magnetic field can be carried out with polarized proton beams. A muon beam
energy can be arbitrary. Possibilities to avoid a betatron resonance are
analyzed and corrections to the g-2 frequency are considered.
