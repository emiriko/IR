We construct a Backlund transformation for the trigonometric classical Gaudin
magnet starting from the Lax representation of the model. The Darboux dressing
matrix obtained depends just on one set of variables because of the so-called
spectrality property introduced by E. Sklyanin and V. Kuznetsov. In the end we
mention some possibly interesting open problems.
