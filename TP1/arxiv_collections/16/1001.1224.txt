This work expands recent investigations in the field of spin-polarized
tritium (T$\downarrow$) clusters . We report the results for the ground state
energy and structural properties of large T$\downarrow$ cl usters consisting of
up to 320 atoms. All calculations have been performed with variational and
diffusi on Monte Carlo methods, using an accurate {\it ab initio} interatomic
potential. Our results for $N \le q 40$ are in good agreement with results
obtained by other groups. Using a liquid-drop expression for t he energy per
particle, we estimate the liquid equilibrium density, which is in good
agreement with our recently obtained results for bulk T$\downarrow$. In
addition, the calculations of the energy for larg e clusters have allowed for
an estimation of the surface tension. From the mean-square radius of the dr op,
determined using unbiased estimators, we determine the dependence of the radii
on the size of the c luster and extract the unit radius of the T$\downarrow$
liquid.
