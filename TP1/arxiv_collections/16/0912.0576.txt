We sketch a proof of the abundance conjecture that the Kodaira dimension of a
compact complex algebraic manifold equals its numerical Kodaira dimension. The
proof consists of the following three parts: (i) the case of numerical Kodaira
dimension zero, (ii) the general case under the assumption of the coincidence
of the numerically trivial foliation and fibration for the canonical bundle,
and (iii) the verification of the coincidence of the numerically trivial
foliation and fibration for the canonical bundle. Besides the use of standard
techniques such as the L2 estimates of d-bar, the first part uses Simpson's
method of replacing the flat line bundle in a nontrivial flatly twisted
canonical section by a torsion flat line bundle. Simpson's method relies on the
technique of Gelfond-Schneider for the solution of the seventh problem of
Hilbert. The second part uses the semi-positivity of the direct image of a
relative pluricanonical bundle. The third part uses the technique of the First
Main Theorem of Nevanlinna theory and its use is related to the technique of
Gelfond-Schneider in the first part.
