The electron-phonon interaction in monolayer graphene is investigated by
using density functional perturbation theory. The results indicate that the
electron-phonon interaction strength is of comparable magnitude for all four
in-plane phonon branches and must be considered simultaneously. Moreover, the
calculated scattering rates suggest an acoustic phonon contribution that is
much weaker than previously thought, revealing the role of optical phonons even
at low energies. Accordingly it is predicted, in good agreement with a recent
measurement, that the intrinsic mobility of graphene may be more than an order
of magnitude larger than the high values reported in suspended samples.
