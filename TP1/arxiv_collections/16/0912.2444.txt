We establish the existence of free energy limits for several combinatorial
models on Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph $\mathbb {G}(N,\lfloor cN\rfloor)$ and
random $r$-regular graph $\mathbb {G}(N,r)$. For a variety of models, including
independent sets, MAX-CUT, coloring and K-SAT, we prove that the free energy
both at a positive and zero temperature, appropriately rescaled, converges to a
limit as the size of the underlying graph diverges to infinity. In the zero
temperature case, this is interpreted as the existence of the scaling limit for
the corresponding combinatorial optimization problem. For example, as a special
case we prove that the size of a largest independent set in these graphs,
normalized by the number of nodes converges to a limit w.h.p. This resolves an
open problem which was proposed by Aldous (Some open problems) as one of his
six favorite open problems. It was also mentioned as an open problem in several
other places: Conjecture 2.20 in Wormald [In Surveys in Combinatorics, 1999
(Canterbury) (1999) 239-298 Cambridge Univ. Press]; Bollob\'{a}s and Riordan
[Random Structures Algorithms 39 (2011) 1-38]; Janson and Thomason [Combin.
Probab. Comput. 17 (2008) 259-264] and Aldous and Steele [In Probability on
Discrete Structures (2004) 1-72 Springer].
