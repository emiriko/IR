A pedagogical introduction to color superconductivity in the weak coupling
limit is given. The focus is on the basic tools of thermal field theory
necessary to compute observables of color superconductivity. The rich symmetry
structure and symmetry breaking patterns are analyzed on the basis of the
Anderson-Higgs mechanism. Some techniques can also be applied for computing
neutrino processes in compact stars. As an example, we show how to obtain the
neutrino emissivity for Urca processes in neutron stars by computing the
polarization tensor of the W-boson. We also illustrate how a spin-1 color
superconducting phase generates an anisotropic neutrino emissions in compact
stars.
