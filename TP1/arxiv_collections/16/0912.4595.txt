We consider the multi-cell uplink (network MIMO) where M base-stations (BSs)
communicate simultaneously with M user terminals (UTs). Although the potential
benefit of multi-cell cooperation increases with M, the overhead related to
learning the uplink channels will rapidly dominate the uplink resource. In
other words, there exists a non-trivial tradeoff between the performance gains
of network MIMO and the related overhead in channel estimation for a finite
coherence time. We use a close approximation of the ergodic capacity to study
this tradeoff by taking some realistic aspects into account such as unreliable
backhaul links and different path losses between the BSs and UTs. Our results
provide some insight into practical limitations as well as realistic dimensions
of network MIMO systems.
