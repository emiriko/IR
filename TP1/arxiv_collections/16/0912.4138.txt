Setting up an empirical model of optical sensing to exploit the circular
Bragg phenomenon displayed by chiral sculptured thin films (CSTFs), we
considered a CSTF with and without a central twist defect of $\pi/2$ radians.
The circular Bragg phenomenon of the defect-free CSTF, and the spectral hole in
the co-polarized reflectance spectrum of the CSTF with the twist defect, were
both found to be acutely sensitive to the refractive index of a fluid which
infiltrates the void regions of the CSTF. These findings bode well for the
deployment of CSTFs as optical sensors.
