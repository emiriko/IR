We study experimentally demonstrated single-electron ${}^{12}$C CNT QD with
significant spin-orbit interaction as a scalable quantum computer candidate.
Both electron spin and orbital angular momentum can serve as a logical qubit
for quantum processing. We introduce macroscopic quantum memory for the system
in a form of injected either magnetic or spin carrying atomic ensemble into the
nanotube. CNT provides with a stable atomic trap in finite temperature and with
one-dimensional nuclear spin lattice in an external magnetic field. The
electron is coupled to the atomic ensemble through either magnetic or hyperfine
interaction. Easy electron and nuclear spin read-out procedure for this system
is possible.
