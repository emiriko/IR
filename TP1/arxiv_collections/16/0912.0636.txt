We present detailed temperature dependent optical data on
BaFe$_{2-x}$Co$_{x}$As$_{2}$ (BCFA), with x = 0.14, between 4 meV and 6.5 eV.
We analyze our spectra to determine the main optical parameters and show that
in this material the interband conductivity already starts around 10 meV. We
determine the superfluid density to be 2.2 10^{7}$ cm^{-2}, which places
optimally doped BFCA close to the Uemura line. Our experimental data shows
clear signs of a superconducting gap with 2$\Delta_{1}$ = 6.2 $\pm$ 0.8 meV. In
addition we show that the optical spectra are consistent with the presence of
an additional band of strongly scattered carriers with a larger gap,
2$\Delta_{2}$ = 14 $\pm$ 2 meV.
