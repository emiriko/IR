A highly favoured mechanism of planetesimal formation is collisional growth.
Single dust grains, which follow gas flows in the protoplanetary disc, hit each
other, stick due to van der Waals forces and form fluffy aggregates up to
centimetre size. The mechanism of further growth is unclear since the outcome
of aggregate collisions in the relevant velocity and size regime cannot be
investigated in the laboratory under protoplanetary disc conditions. Realistic
statistics of the result of dust aggregate collisions beyond decimetre size is
missing for a deeper understanding of planetary growth. Joining experimental
and numerical efforts we want to calibrate and validate a computer program that
is capable of a correct simulation of the macroscopic behaviour of highly
porous dust aggregates. After testing its numerical limitations thoroughly we
will check the program especially for a realistic reproduction of various
benchmark experiments. We adopt the smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH)
numerical scheme with extensions for the simulation of solid bodies and a
modified version of the Sirono porosity model. Experimentally measured
macroscopic material properties of silica dust are implemented. We calibrate
and test for the compressive strength relation and the bulk modulus. SPH has
already proven to be a suitable tool to simulate collisions at rather high
velocities. In this work we demonstrate that its area of application can not
only be extended to low-velocity experiments and collisions. It can also be
used to simulate the behaviour of highly porous objects in this velocity regime
to a very high accuracy.The result of the calibration process in this work is
an SPH code that can be utilised to investigate the collisional outcome of
porous dust in the low-velocity regime.
