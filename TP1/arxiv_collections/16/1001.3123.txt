We report on the study of soft gluon effects in the production of squarks and
gluinos at hadron colliders. Close to production threshold, the emission of
soft gluon results in the appearence of large logarithmic corrections in the
theoretical expressions. In order to resum these corrections at
next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy appropriate one-loop anomalous dimensions
have to be calculated. We present the calculation of the anomalous dimensions
for all production channels of squarks and gluinos and provide numerical
predictions for the Tevatron and the LHC.
