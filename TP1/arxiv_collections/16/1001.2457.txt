Recall that a homomorphism of $R$-modules $\pi: G\to H$ is called a {\it
cellular cover} over $H$ if $\pi$ induces an isomorphism $\pi_*:
\Hom_R(G,G)\cong \Hom_R(G,H),$ where $\pi_*(\varphi)= \pi \varphi$ for each
$\varphi \in \Hom_R(G,G)$ (where maps are acting on the left). In this paper we
show that every cotorsion-free module $K$ of finite rank can be realized as the
kernel of a cellular cover of some cotorsion-free module of rank 2. In
particular, every free abelian group of any finite rank appears then as the
kernel of a cellular cover of a cotorsion-free abelian group of rank 2. This
situation is best possible in the sense that cotorsion-free abelian groups of
rank 1 do not admit cellular covers with free kernel except for the trivial
ones. This work comes motivated by an example due to Buckner and Dugas, and
recent results obtained by G\"obel--Rodr\'iguez--Str\"ungmann, and
Fuchs--G\"obel.
