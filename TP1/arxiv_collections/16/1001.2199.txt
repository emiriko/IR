In type-1.5 superconductors, vortices emerge in clusters, which grow in size
with increasing magnetic field. These novel vortex clusters and their field
dependence are directly visualized by scanning SQUID microscopy at very low
vortex densities in MgB2 single crystals. Our observations are elucidated by
simulations based on a two-gap Ginzburg-Landau theory in the type-1.5 regime.
