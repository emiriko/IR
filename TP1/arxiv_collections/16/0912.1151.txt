To study if the angular momentum gain for each member of a galaxy pair was
the result of tidal torques imprinted by the same tidal field, we search for
correlations between the spin in pairs of spiral galaxies identified using the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find a weak, but statistically significant
correlation between the spin magnitude of neighbouring galaxies. We show that
events such as close interactions with neighbours play an important role in the
value of the spin for the final configuration, as we find these interactions
tend to reduce the value of the $\lambda$ spin parameter of late-type galaxies
considerably. This implies that the original tidal field for each pair could
have been similar, but the redistribution of angular momentum at later stages
of evolution is important
