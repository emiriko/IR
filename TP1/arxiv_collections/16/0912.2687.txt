We derive a novel model-independent result for the pion susceptibility in QCD
via the isovector-pseudoscalar vacuum polarisation. In the neighbourhood of the
chiral-limit, the pion susceptibility can be expressed as a sum of two
independent terms. The first expresses the pion-pole contribution. The second
is identical to the vacuum chiral susceptibility, which describes the response
of QCD's ground-state to a fluctuation in the current-quark mass. In this
result one finds a straightforward explanation of a mismatch between extant
estimates of the pion susceptibility.
