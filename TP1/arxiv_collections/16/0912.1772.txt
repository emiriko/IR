In this work, we calculate the self-similar longitudinal velocity correlation
function and the statistical properties of velocity difference using the
results of the Lyapunov analysis of the fully developed isotropic homogeneous
turbulence just presented by the author in a previous work (arXiv:0911.1463).
There, a closure of the von Karman-Howarth equation is proposed and the
statistics of velocity difference is determined through a specific analysis of
the Fourier-transformed Navier-Stokes equations.
  The correlation functions correspond to steady-state solutions of the von
Karman-Howarth equation under the self-similarity hypothesis introduced by von
Karman. These solutions are numerically determined with the statistics of
velocity difference. The obtained results adequately describe the several
properties of the fully developed isotropic turbulence.
