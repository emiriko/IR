This paper studies the Yang-Lee edge singularity of 2-dimensional (2D) Ising
model based on a quantum spin chain and transfer matrix measurements on the
cylinder. Based on finite-size scaling, the low-lying excitation spectrum is
found at the Yang-Lee edge singularity. Based on transfer matrix techniques,
the single structure constant is evaluated at the Yang-Lee edge singularity.
The results of both types of measurements are found to be fully consistent with
the predictions for the (A4;A1)minimal conformal field theory, which was
previously identified with this critical point.
