The Swift Gamma-Ray Burst satellite has detected a largely unbiased towards
absorption sample of local ($<z> \approx 0.03$) AGN, based solely on their
14--195 keV flux. In the first 9 months of the survey, 153 AGN sources were
detected. The X-ray properties in the 0.3--10 keV band have been compiled and
presented based on analyses with XMM-Newton, Chandra, Suzaku, and the Swift XRT
(Winter et al. 2009). Additionally, we have compiled a sub-sample of sources
with medium resolution optical ground-based spectra from the SDSS or our own
observations at KPNO. In this sample of 60 sources, we have classified the
sources using standard emission line diagnostic plots, obtained masses for the
broad line sources through measurement of the broad H$\beta$ emission line, and
measured the [OIII] 5007\AA luminosity of this sample. Based on continuum fits
to the intrinsic absorption features, we have obtained clues about the stellar
populations of the host galaxies. We now present the highlights of our X-ray
and optical studies of this unique sample of local AGNs, including a comparison
of the 2--10 keV and 14--195 keV X-ray luminosities with the [OIII] 5007\AA
luminosity and the implications of our results towards measurements of
bolometric luminosities.
