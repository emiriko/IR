We compute, for the first time, the order alpha_s^4 contributions to the
Bjorken sum rule for polarized electron-nucleon scattering and to the
(non-singlet) Adler function for the case of a generic colour gauge group. We
confirm at the same order a (generalized) Crewther relation which provides a
strong test of the correctness of our previously obtained results: the QCD
Adler function and the five-loop beta-function in quenched QED. In particular,
the appearance of an irrational contribution proportional to zeta_3 in the
latter quantity is confirmed. We obtain the commensurate scale equation
relating the effective strong coupling constants as inferred from the Bjorken
sum rule and from the Adler function at order alpha_s^4.
