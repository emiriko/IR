A rigorous algebraic description of the notion of realization, specialized in
the case of Lie superalgebras is given. The idea of the Relative Parabose set
$P_{BF}$ is recalled together with some recent developments and its braided
group structure is established together with an extended discussion of its
($\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$)-grading. The final result of the paper
employs $P_{BF}$ in order to realize an arbitrary Lie superalgebra. It is
furthermore shown that the constructed realization is a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-graded
Hopf algebra homomorphism. Virtual applications in pure mathematics and
theoretical physics as well are outlined.
