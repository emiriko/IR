We report herein fabrication and characterization of a thin-film transistor
(TFT) using single-crystalline, epitaxial SrTiO3 film, which was grown by a
pulsed laser deposition technique followed by the thermal annealing treatment
in an oxygen atmosphere. Although TFTs on the polycrystalline epitaxial SrTiO3
films (as-deposited) exhibited poor transistor characteristics, the annealed
single-crystalline SrTiO3 TFT exhibits transistor characteristics comparable
with those of bulk single-crystal SrTiO3 FET: an on/off current ratio >10^5,
sub-threshold swing ~2.1 V/decade, and field-effect mobility ~0.8 cm^2/Vs. This
demonstrates the effectiveness of the appropriate thermal annealing treatment
of epitaxial SrTiO3 films.
