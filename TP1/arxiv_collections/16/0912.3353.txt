We report our measurement on longitudinal spin transfer, $D_{LL}$, from high
energy polarized protons to $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ hyperons in
proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 200GeV$ with the STAR detector at RHIC.
The measurements cover $\Lambda$, $\bar\Lambda$ pseudorapidity $|\eta| < 1.2$
and transverse momenta $p_T$ up to $4GeV/c$. The longitudinal spin transfer is
found to be $D_{LL}= -0.03\pm 0.13(stat) \pm 0.04(syst)$ for inclusive
$\Lambda$ and $D_{LL} = -0.12 \pm 0.08(stat) \pm 0.03(syst)$ for inclusive
$\bar{\Lambda}$ hyperons with $<\eta> = 0.5$ and $<p_T> = 3.7GeV/c$. The
prospect on transverse spin transfer measurement is also given.
