In the quantum mechanical Hilbert space formalism, the probabilistic
interpretation is a later ad-hoc add-on, more or less enforced by the
experimental evidence, but not motivated by the mathematical model itself. A
model involving a clear probabilistic interpretation from the very beginning is
provided by the quantum logics with unique conditional probabilities. It
includes the projection lattices in von Neumann algebras and here probability
conditionalization becomes identical with the state transition of the Lueders -
von Neumann measurement process. This motivates the definition of a hierarchy
of five compatibility and comeasurability levels in the abstract setting of the
quantum logics with unique conditional probabilities. Their meanings are: the
absence of quantum interference or influence, the existence of a joint
distribution, simultaneous measurability, and the independence of the final
state after two successive measurements from the sequential order of these two
measurements. A further level means that two elements of the quantum logic
(events) belong to the same Boolean subalgebra. In the general case, the five
compatibility and comeasurability levels appear to differ, but they all
coincide in the common Hilbert space formalism of quantum mechanics, in von
Neumann algebras, and in some other cases.
