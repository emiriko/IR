We investigate spin dynamics of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensates
with weak Josephson coupling. Analytical expressions of atom-number squeezing
and bipartite entanglement are presented for atom-atom repulsive interactions.
For attractive interactions, there is no number squeezing; however, the
squeezing parameter is still useful to recognize the appearance of
Schr\"{o}dinger's cat state.
