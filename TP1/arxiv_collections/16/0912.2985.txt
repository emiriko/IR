A succinct statement and justification of all the principles necessary to
understand and evaluate interpretations of quantum mechanics is given. These
principles provide strong constraints on interpretations. They imply the
particle-like properties of mass, energy, momentum, spin, charge, and locality
are actually properties of the wave function, and this in turn implies there is
no evidence for the existence of particles. In addition, there is currently no
experimental evidence for collapse, and a theory of collapse encounters
significant hurdles. Further, the probability law is found to rule out the
many-worlds interpretation, so all three major interpretations encounter
serious to fatal problems. An interpretation which conforms to all the
principles is given.
