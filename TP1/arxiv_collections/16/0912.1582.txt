The polarizations of one relation of degree five and two relations of degree
six minimally generate the ideal of relations among a minimal generating system
of the algebra of multisymmetric polynomials in an arbitrary number of
three-dimensional vector variables. In the general case of $n$-dimensional
vector variables, a relation of degree $2n$ among the polarized power sums is
presented such that it is not contained in the ideal generated by lower degree
relations.
