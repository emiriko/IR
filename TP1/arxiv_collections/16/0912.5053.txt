We deal here with the application of the Nuclear Born Oppenheimer (NBO)
method to the description of nuclear rotations. As an edifying illustration, we
apply the NBO formalism to study the rotational motion of nuclei which are
axially-symmetric and even, but whose shells are not closed. We focus, in
particular, on the derivation of expressions for the rotational energy and for
the moment of inertia. Additionally, we examine the connection between the NBO
method and the self-consistent cranking (SCC) model. Finally, we compare the
moment of inertia generated by the NBO method with the Thouless-Valantin
formula and hence establish a connection between the NBO method and the large
body of experimental data.
