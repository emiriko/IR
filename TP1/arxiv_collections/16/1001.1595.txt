We have studied the centrality dependence of charged particle
forward-backward multiplicity correlation strength in Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV with a parton and hadron cascade model, PACIAE, based
on PYTHIA. The calculated results are compared with the STAR data. The
experimentally observed correlation strength characters: (1) the approximately
flat pseudorapidity dependence in central collisions and (2) the monotonous
decrease with decreasing centrality are well reproduced. However the
theoretical results are bigger than the STAR data for the peripheral
collisions. A discussion is given for the comparison among the different models
and STAR data.
