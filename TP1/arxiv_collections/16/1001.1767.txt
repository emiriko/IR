Inspired by the recent identification of the first candidate BH-WD X-ray
binaries, where the compact accretors may be stellar-mass black hole candidates
in extragalactic globular clusters, we explore how such binaries could be
formed in a dynamical environment. We provide analyses of the formation rates
via well known formation channels like binary exchange and physical collisions
and propose that the only possibility to form BH-WD binaries is via coupling
these usual formation channels with subsequent hardening and/or triple
formation. Indeed, we find that the most important mechanism to make a BH-WD
X-ray binary from an initially dynamically formed BH-WD binary is triple
induced mass transfer via the Kozai mechanism. Even using the most optimistic
estimates for the formation rates, we cannot match the observationally inferred
production rates if black holes undergo significant evaporation from the
cluster or form a completely detached subcluster of black holes. We estimate
that at least 1% of all formed black holes, or presumably 10% of the black
holes present in the core now, must be involved in interactions with the rest
of the core stellar population.
