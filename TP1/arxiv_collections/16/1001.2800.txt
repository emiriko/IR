The 1-loop corrected decay widths of sparticles (charginos, neutralinos,
gluino and sfermions) in the framework of the MSSM are calculated
systematically using GRACE/SUSY-loop, which is the program package for the
automatic calculation of the MSSM amplitudes in the 1-loop order. We present
the renormalization scheme used in our system and show some numerical results
of decay widths of sfermions and gluino using the SPS1a' parameter set and
other SUSY parameter sets.
