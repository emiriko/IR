The z=3 deformed Horava-Lifshitz gravity with coupling constants \omega and
\epsilon leads to a nonrelativistic "mixmaster" cosmological model. The
potential of theory is given by the sum of IR and UV potentials in the ADM
Hamiltonian formalism. It turns out that the presence of the UV-potential
cannot suppress chaotic behaviors existing in the IR-potential, which comes
from curvature anisotropy.
