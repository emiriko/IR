In this talk we discuss recent progress concerning precise predictions for
hadron colliders. We show results of two applications of tensor reduction using
GOLEM methods: the next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections to $pp \to ZZ+$jet
as an important background for Higgs particle and new physics searches at
hadron colliders, and the NLO corrections to graviton plus jet
hadro-production, which is an important channel for graviton searches at the
Tevatron and the LHC.
