We briefly review the recent programme to construct, systematically and
algorithmically, large classes of heterotic vacua, as well as the search for
the MSSM therein. Specifically, we outline the monad construction of vector
bundles over complete intersection Calabi-Yau threefolds, their classification,
stability, equivariant cohomology and subsequent relevance to string
phenomenology. It is hoped that this top-down algorithmic approach will isolate
special corners in the heterotic landscape.
