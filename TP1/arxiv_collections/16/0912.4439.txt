The nonlinear propagation of two-dimensional (2D) quantum ion-acoustic waves
(QIAWs) is studied in a quantum electron-ion plasma. By using a 2D quantum
hydrodynamic model and the method of multiple scales, a new set of coupled
nonlinear partial differential equations is derived which governs the slow
modulation of the 2D QIAW packets. The oblique modulational instability (MI) is
then studied by means of a corresponding nonlinear Schroedinger equation
derived from the coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. It is shown
that the quantum parameter H (proportional to $\hbar$), associated with the
Bohm potential, shifts the MI domains around the $k\theta$-plane, where $k$ is
the carrier wave number and $\theta$ is the angle of modulation. In particular,
the ion-acoustic wave (IAW), previously known to be stable under parallel
modulation in classical plasmas, is shown to be unstable in quantum plasmas.
The growth rate of the MI is found to be quenched by the obliqueness of
modulation. The modulation of 2D QIAW packets along $\mathbf{k}$ is shown to be
described by a set of Davey-Stewartson-like equations. The latter can be
studied for the 2D wave collapse in dense plasmas. The predicted results, which
could be important to look for stable wave propagation in laboratory
experiments as well as in dense astrophysical plasmas, thus generalize the
theory of MI of IAW propagations both in classical and quantum electron-ion
plasmas.
