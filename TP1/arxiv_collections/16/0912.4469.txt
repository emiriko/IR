In this work it is studied the Hopfield fermionic spin glass model which
allows interpolating from trivial randomness to a highly frustrated regime.
Therefore, it is possible to investigate whether or not frustration is an
essential ingredient which would allow this magnetic disordered model to
present naturally inverse freezing by comparing the two limits, trivial
randomness and highly frustrated regime and how different levels of frustration
could affect such unconventional phase transition. The problem is expressed in
the path integral formalism where the spin operators are represented by
bilinear combinations of Grassmann variables. The Grand Canonical Potential is
obtained within the static approximation and one-step replica symmetry breaking
scheme. As a result, phase diagrams temperature {\it versus} the chemical
potential are obtained for several levels of frustration. Particularly, when
the level of frustration is diminished, the reentrance related to the inverse
freezing is gradually suppressed.
