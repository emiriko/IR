We review recent results concerning the all-order structure of infrared and
collinear divergences in massless gauge theory amplitudes. While the
exponentiation of these divergences for nonabelian gauge theories has been
understood for a long time, in the past couple of years we have begun to
unravel the all-order structure of the anomalous dimensions that build up the
perturbative exponent. In the large-Nc limit, all infrared and collinear
divergences are determined by just three functions; one of them, the cusp
anomalous dimension, plays a key role also for non-planar contributions.
Indeed, all infrared and collinear divergences of massless gauge theory
amplitudes with any number of hard partons may be captured by a surprisingly
simple expression constructed as a sum over color dipoles. Potential
corrections to this expression, correlating four or more hard partons at three
loops or beyond, are tightly constrained and are currently under study.
