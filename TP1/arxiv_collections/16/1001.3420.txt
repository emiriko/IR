Kepler photometry has revealed two unusual transiting companions orbiting an
early A-star and a late B-star. In both cases the occultation of the companion
is deeper than the transit. The occultation and transit with follow-up optical
spectroscopy reveal a 9400 K early A-star, KOI-74 (KIC 6889235), with a
companion in a 5.2 day orbit with a radius of 0.08 Rsun and a 10000 K late
B-star KOI-81 (KIC 8823868) that has a companion in a 24 day orbit with a
radius of 0.2 Rsun. We infer a temperature of 12250 K for KOI-74b and 13500 K
for KOI-81b.
  We present 43 days of high duty cycle, 30 minute cadence photometry, with
models demonstrating the intriguing properties of these object, and speculate
on their nature.
