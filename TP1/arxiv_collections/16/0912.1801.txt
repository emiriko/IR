We discuss some interesting physical features stemming from our previous
analytical study of a simple model of a fluid with dipolar-like interactions of
very short range in addition to the usual isotropic Baxter potential for
adhesive spheres. While the isotropic part is found to rule the global
structural and thermodynamical equilibrium properties of the fluid, the weaker
anisotropic part gives rise to an interesting short-range local ordering of
nearly spherical condensation clusters, containing short portions of chains
having nose-to-tail parallel alignment which runs antiparallel to adjacent
similar chains.
