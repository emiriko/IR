The flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS 2052-47 experienced an optical flare in
July-August, 2009. On August 9, the LAT detector onboard Fermi observed a flare
from the source, which reached its active phase in the following two months. To
further investigate the physics and emission mechanisms during the flaring
state of this source, we arranged a multiwavelength campaign from radio to
gamma-ray to study its spectral energy distribution (SED) and its brightness
variations across the spectrum. Here we present the first results of this
multiwavelength campaign.
