We present an analysis of the kinematics and physical properties of the Class
I driven jet HH46-47 based on IR medium and low resolution spectroscopy
obtained with ISAAC on VLT. Our aim is to study the gas physics as a function
of the velocity and distance from the source and compare the results with
similar studies performed on other Class I and CTTS jets, as well as with
existing models for the jet formation and excitation. The ratios and
luminosities of several important diagnostic lines have been used to derive
physical parameters. [FeII] and H2 Position Velocity Diagrams (PVDs) have been
in addition constructed to study the kinematics. Within 1000-2000 AU from the
source the atomic gas presents a wide range of radial velocities. Only the gas
component at the highest velocity (HVC) survives at large distances. The H2,
shows, close to the source, only a single velocity component at almost zero
velocity, while it reaches higer velocities further downstream. Electron
densities (ne) and mass ejection fluxes (Mjet) have been measured separately
for the HVC and LVC from the [FeII] lines. ne increases with decreasing
velocities, while the opposite occurs for Mjet. The mass flux carried out by
the molecular component, measured from the H2 lines flux, is ~4 10^-9 Msun/yr.
We have estimated that the Fe gas phase abundance is significantly lower than
the solar value, with ~88% of iron still depleted onto dust grains in the
internal jet region. The derived densities and mass flux values are typical of
Class I objects or very active TTauri stars. However, the spatial extent of the
LVC and the velocity dependence of the electron density have been so far
observed only in another Class I jet, the HH34 jet, and are not explained by
the current models of jet launching.
