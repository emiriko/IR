The Large Area Telescope (LAT), Fermi's main instrument, is providing a new
view of the local energetic pulsar population. In addition to identifying a
pulsar origin of a large fraction of the bright unidentified Galactic EGRET
sources, the LAT results provide a great opportunity to study a sizable
population of high-energy pulsars. Correlations of their physical properties,
such as the trend of the luminosity versus the rotational energy loss rate,
help identify global features of the gamma-ray pulsar population. Several lines
of evidence, including the light curve and spectral features, suggest that
gamma-ray emission from the brightest pulsars arises largely in the outer
magnetosphere.
