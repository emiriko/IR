We present extensive observations of the radio emission from the remnant of
SN 1987A made with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), since the
first detection of the remnant in 1990. The radio emission has evolved in time
providing unique information on the interaction of the supernova shock with the
circumstellar medium. We particularly focus on the monitoring observations at
1.4, 2.4, 4.8 and 8.6 GHz, which have been made at intervals of 4-6 weeks. The
flux density data show that the remnant brightness is now increasing
exponentially, while the radio spectrum is flattening. The current spectral
index value of -0.68 represents an 18+/-3% increase over the last 8 years. The
exponential trend in the flux is also found in the ATCA imaging observations at
9 GHz, which have been made since 1992, approximately twice a year, as well as
in the 843 MHz data set from the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope from
1987 to March 2007. Comparisons with data at different wavelengths (X-ray,
H\alpha) are made. The rich data set that has been assembled in the last 22
years forms a basis for a better understanding of the evolution of the
supernova remnant.
