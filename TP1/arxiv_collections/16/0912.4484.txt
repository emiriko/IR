In a recent work, a model of gauge mediation with sequestered supersymmetry
(SUSY) breaking was proposed. In this model, the mass of the gravitino is
O(100) GeV without causing the flavor-changing neutral-current problem. In
contrast to traditional gauge mediation, the gravitino is not the lightest SUSY
particle and the neutralino is the candidate of the dark matter. In this paper,
we investigate phenomenological aspects of this model and discuss the
possibility of the direct detection of the dark matter. In particular, we focus
on the light neutralino case and find that the light-Higgsino scenario such as
the focus point is interesting, taking account of the recent CDMS result.
