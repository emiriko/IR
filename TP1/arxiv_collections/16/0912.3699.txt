Non-linear effects on driven oscillations are important in many fields of
physics, ranging from applied mechanics to optics. They are instrumental for
quantum applications. A limitation is that the non-linearities known up to now
are featureless functions of the number of photons N in the oscillator. Here we
show that the non-linearities found in an oscillator where superconducting
inductance is subject to coherent phase-slips, are more interesting. They
oscillate as a function of number of photons N with a period of the order of
square root of N, which is the spread of the coherent state. We prove that such
non-linearities result in multiple metastable states encompassing few photons
and study oscillatory dependence of various responses of the resonator. The
experimental realization of our proposal can deliver an unambiguous
verification of coherent quantum phase-slips.
