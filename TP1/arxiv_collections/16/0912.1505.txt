We report on calculation of the $\Lambda$ - hypernuclear production induced
by the stopped $K^-$. The calculation was performed within the framework of the
distorted wave impulse approximation and employed chirally motivated model for
the microscopic description of the elementary $K^-$-nucleon process. The
sensitivity of the calculation was tested with various wave functions of both
the kaon in the initial state and the pion in the final state. Our results are
closer to the experimental values then the results of previous calculations.
