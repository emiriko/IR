We consider the chemical freeze-out of $\Xi$, $\overline\Xi$ and $\phi$
multistrange hadrons within a Statistical Hadronization Model inspired
approach. We study particle yields across a wide range of reaction energy and
centrality from NA49 at SPS and STAR at RHIC experiments. We constrain the
physical conditions present in the fireball source of strange hadrons, and
anticipate results expected at LHC.
