Rotational misalignment of two stacked honeycomb lattices produces a moir\'e
pattern that is observable in scanning tunneling microscopy as a small
modulation of the apparent surface height. This is known from experiments on
highly-oriented pyrolytic graphite. Here, we observe the combined effect of
three-layer moir\'e patterns in multilayer graphene grown on SiC
($000\bar{1}$). Small-angle rotations between the first and third layer are
shown to produce a "double-moir\'e" pattern, resulting from the interference of
moir\'e patterns from the first three layers. These patterns are strongly
affected by relative lattice strain between the layers. We model the moir\'e
patterns as a beat-period of the mismatched reciprocal lattice vectors and show
how these patterns can be used to determine the relative strain between
lattices, in analogy to strain measurement by optical moir\'e interferometry.
