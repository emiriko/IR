A current can be induced in a closed device by changing control parameters.
The amount $Q$ of particles that are transported via a path of motion, is
characterized by its expectation value $<Q>$, and by its variance $Var(Q)$. We
show that quantum mechanics invalidates some common conceptions about this
statistics. We first consider the process of a double path crossing, which is
the prototype example for counting statistics in multiple path non-trivial
geometry. We find out that contrary to the common expectation, this process
does not lead to partition noise. Then we analyze a full stirring cycle that
consists of a sequence of two Landau-Zener crossings. We find out that quite
generally counting statistics and occupation statistics become unrelated, and
that quantum interference affects them in different ways.
