n this paper we study the asymptotic behavior for a nonlocal heat equation in
an inhomogenous medium: $$\rho(x)u_t=J\ast u-u \text{in}\mathbb{R}^N\times
(0,\infty)\,,$$ where $\rho$ is a continous positive function, $u$ is
nonnegative and $J$ is a probability measure having finite second-order
momentum. Depending on integrability conditions on the initial data $u_0$ and
$\rho$, we prove various isothermalisation results, i.e. $u(t)$ converges to a
constant state in the whole space.
