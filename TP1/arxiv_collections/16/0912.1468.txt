We study the dynamics of quantum correlations of two coupled double quantum
dots containing two excess electrons. The dissipation is included through the
contact with an oscillator bath. We solve the Redfield master equation in order
to determine the dynamics of the quantum discord and the entanglement of
formation. Based on our results, we find that the quantum discord is more
resistant to dissipation than the entanglement of formation for such a system.
We observe that this characteristic is related to whether the oscillator bath
is common to both qubits or not and to the form of the interaction Hamiltonian.
Moreover, our results show that the quantum discord might be finite even for
higher temperatures in the asymptotic limit.
