We analyze the properties of the clusters of galaxies in the region of the
Ursa Major (UMa) supercluster using observational data from SDSS and 2MASS
catalogs. The region studied includes a supercluster (with a galaxy and cluster
overdensity of 3 and 15, respectively) and field clusters inside the 150 Mpc
diameter surrounding region. The total dynamical mass of 10 clusters of
galaxies in UMa is equal to 2.25 10^15 M_sun, and the mass of 11 clusters of
galaxies in the UMa neighborhood is equal to 1.70 10^15 M_sun. The fraction of
early-type galaxies brighter than M_K*+1 in the virialized regions of clusters
is, on the average, equal to 70%, and it is virtually independent on the mass
of the cluster. The fraction of these galaxies and their average photometric
parameters are almost the same both for UMa clusters and for the clusters
located in its surroundings. Parameters of the clusters of galaxies, such as
infrared luminosities up to a fixed magnitude, the mass-to-luminosity ratio,
and the number of galaxies have almost the same correlations with the cluster
mass as in other samples of galaxies clusters. However, the scatter of these
parameters for UMa member clusters is twice smaller than the corresponding
scatter for field clusters, possibly, due to the common origin of UMa clusters
and synchronized dynamical evolution of clusters in the supercluster.
