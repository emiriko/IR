SS73 17 was an innocuous Mira-type symbiotic star until Integral and Swift
discovered its bright hard X-ray emission, adding it to the small class of
"hard X-ray emitting symbiotics." Suzaku observations in 2006 then showed it
emits three bright iron lines as well, with little to no emission in the 0.3-2
keV bandpass. We present here followup observations with the Chandra HETG and
Suzaku that confirm the earlier detection of strong emission lines of Fe Kalpha
fluorescence, Fe XXV and Fe XXVI but also show significantly more soft X-ray
emission. The high resolution spectrum also shows emission lines of other
highly ionized ions as Si XIV and possibly S XVI. In addition, a reanalysis of
the 2006 Suzaku data using the latest calibration shows that the hard (15-50
keV) X-ray emission is brighter than previously thought and remains constant in
both the 2006 and 2008 data.
  The G ratio calculated from the Fe XXV lines shows that these lines are
thermal, not photoionized, in origin. With the exception of the hard X-ray
emission, the spectra from both epochs can be fit using thermal radiation
assuming a differential emission measure based on a cooling flow model combined
with a full and partial absorber. We show that acceptable fits can be obtained
for all the data in the 1-10 keV band varying only the partial absorber. Based
on the temperature and accretion rate, the thermal emission appears to be
arising from the boundary layer between the accreting white dwarf and the
accretion disk.
