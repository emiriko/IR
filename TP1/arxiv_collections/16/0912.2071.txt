We report the identification of a source coincident with SN 2009kr in HST
pre-explosion images. The object appears to be a single point source with an
intrinsic colour V-I = 1.1 and M_V = -7.6. If this is a single star it would be
a yellow supergiant of log L/L_{sol} \sim 5.1 and a mass of 15 (+5/-4) M_{sol}.
The spatial resolution does not allow us yet to definitively determine if the
progenitor object is a single star, a binary system, or a compact cluster. We
show that the early lightcurve is flat, similar to IIP SNe, but that the the
spectra are somewhat peculiar, displaying unusual P-Cygni profiles. The
evolution of the expanding ejecta will play an important role in understanding
the progenitor object.
