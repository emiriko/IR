We calculate the neutral pion ($\pi^0$) to off-shell two photon
($\gamma^*\gamma^*$) transition form factor in lattice QCD. The transition form
factor can be extracted from the three-point function of the form
(axial-vector)-(vector)-(vector) as a function of off-shell two-photon
momentum. Since the axial-anomaly plays an important role in the
$\pi^0\to\gamma\gamma$ decay process, we employ the overlap fermion, which
preserves the exact chiral symmetery on the lattice. After extrapolating to the
chiral and the vanishing photon momentum limit with a fit function based on
vector meson dominance (VMD) model, we find that the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly
is correctly reproduced.
