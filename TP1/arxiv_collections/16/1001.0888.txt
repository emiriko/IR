Numerical simulations of the solar chromosphere have become increasingly
realistic over the past 5 years. However, many observed chromospheric
structures and behavior are not reproduced. Current models do not show fibrils
in Ca II 8542, and neither reproduce the Ca II 8542 bisector. The emergent
H-alpha line core intensity computed from the models show granulation instead
of chromospheric shocks or fibrils. I discuss these deficiencies and speculate
about what physics should be included to alleviate these shortcomings.
