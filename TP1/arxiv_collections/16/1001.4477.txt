We discuss exact analytical solutions of a variety of statistical models
recently obtained for finite systems by a novel powerful mathematical method,
the Laplace-Fourier transform. Among them are a constrained version of the
statistical multifragmentation model, the Gas of Bags Model and the Hills and
Dales Model of surface partition. Thus, the Laplace-Fourier transform allows
one to study the nuclear matter equation of state, the equation of state of
hadronic and quark gluon matter and surface partitions on the same footing. A
complete analysis of the isobaric partition singularities of these models is
done for finite systems. The developed formalism allows us, for the first time,
to exactly define the finite volume analogs of gaseous, liquid and mixed phases
of these models from the first principles of statistical mechanics and
demonstrate the pitfalls of earlier works. The found solutions may be used for
building up a new theoretical apparatus to rigorously study phase transitions
in finite systems. The strategic directions of future research opened by these
exact results are also discussed.
