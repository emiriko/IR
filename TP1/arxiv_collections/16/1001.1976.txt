Multiplication is an arithmetic operation that is mostly used in Digital
Signal Processing (DSP) and communication applications. Efficient
implementation of the multipliers is required in many applications. The design
and analysis of Spurious Switching Suppression Technique (SSST) equipped low
power multiplier with hybrid encoding is presented in this paper. The proposed
encoding technique reduces the number of switching activity and dynamic power
consumption by analyzing the bit patterns in the input data. In this proposed
encoding scheme, the operation is executed depends upon the number of 1s and
its position in the multiplier data. The architecture of the proposed
multiplier is designed using a low power full adder which consumes less power
than the other adder architectures. The switching activity of the proposed
multiplier has been reduced by 86 percent and 46percent compared with
conventional and Booth multiplier respectively. It is observed from the device
level simulation using TANNER 12.6 EDA that the power consumption of the
proposed multiplier has been reduced by 87 percent and 26 percent compared with
conventional and Booth multiplier.
