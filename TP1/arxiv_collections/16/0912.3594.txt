We propose a general approach to characterise fluctuations of measured cross
sections of nuclear giant resonances. Simulated cross sections are obtained
from a particular, yet representative self-energy which contains all
information about fragmentations. Using a wavelet analysis, we demonstrate the
extraction of time scales of cascading decays into configurations of different
complexity of the resonance. We argue that the spreading widths of collective
excitations in nuclei are determined by the number of fragmentations as seen in
the power spectrum. An analytic treatment of the wavelet analysis using a
Fourier expansion of the cross section confirms this principle. A simple rule
for the relative life times of states associated with hierarchies of different
complexity is given.
