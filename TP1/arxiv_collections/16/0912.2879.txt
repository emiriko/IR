The non-Markovianity is a recently proposed characterization of the
non-Markovian behavior in an open quantum system, based on which we first
present a practical idea for directly measuring the non-Markovian character of
a single qubit coupled to a zero-temperature bosonic reservoir, and then extend
to investigate the dynamics of two noninteracting qubits subject to two
reservoirs respectively with a lower bound of non-Markovianity. Our scheme,
with no need of optimization procedures and quantum state tomography, is
helpful for experimental implementation.
