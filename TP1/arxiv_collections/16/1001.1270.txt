Using H. Donnelly result from the article "Eta Invariants for G-Spaces" we
calculate the eta invariants of the signature operator for almost all
7-dimensional flat manifolds with cyclic holonomy group. In all cases this eta
invariants are an integer numbers. The article was motivated by D. D. Long and
A. Reid article "On the geometric boundaries of hyperbolic 4-manifolds, Geom.
