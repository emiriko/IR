We calculate the three-point correlation function of the comoving curvature
perturbation generated during an inflationary epoch driven by false vacuum
energy. We get a novel false vacuum shape bispectrum, which peaks in the
equilateral limit. Using this result, we propose a scenario which we call "old
curvaton". The shape of the resulting bispectrum lies between the local and the
false vacuum shapes. In addition we have a large running of the spectral index.
