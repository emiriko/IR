The GeV light curve of a pulsar is an important probe to detect acceleration
regions in its magnetosphere. Motivated by the recent reports on the
observations of pulsars by {\it Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT), we restudy
the two-pole caustic model and revise it to investigate the properties of the
light curves in the GeV band. In the revised model, although acceleration gaps
can extend from the star surface to the light cylinder along near the last open
field lines, the extension of the gaps along the azimuthal direction is limited
because of photon-photon pair production process. In such gaps, high-energy
photons are emitted uniformly and tangentially to the field lines but cannot be
efficiently produced along these field lines where the distances to the null
charge surface are larger than $\sim0.9$ times of the distance of the light
cylinder, and the effective azimuth extension of the gaps is about $230^\circ$.
The model is applied to the four pulsars Vela, PSR J1028-5819, PSR J0205+6449,
and PSR J2021+3651 whose light curves obtained with {\it Fermi} have been
recently released. The model is successful in reproducing the general feature
of the light curves for the four pulsars, and the radial distances of the radio
pulse for the four pulsars are estimated.
