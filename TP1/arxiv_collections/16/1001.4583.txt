Recent neutron and x-ray scattering measurements show intrinsic localized
modes (ILMs) in metallic uranium and ionic sodium iodide. Here, the role ILMs
play in the behavior of these materials is examined. With the thermal
activation of ILMs, thermal expansion is enhanced, made more anisotropic, and,
at a microscopic level, becomes inhomogeneous. Interstitial diffusion, ionic
conductivity, the annealing rate of radiation damage, and void growth are all
influenced by ILMs. The lattice thermal conductivity is suppressed above the
ILM activation temperature while no impact is observed in the electrical
conductivity. This complement of transport properties suggests that ILMs could
improve thermoelectric performance. Ramifications also include thermal
ratcheting, a transition from brittle to ductile fracture, and possibly a phase
transformation in uranium.
