The well known Hellmann-Feynman theorem of Quantum Mechanics connected with
the derivative of the eigenvalues with respect to a parameter upon which the
Hamiltonian depends, is generalized to include cases in which the domain of
definition of the Hamiltonian of the system also depends on that parameter.
