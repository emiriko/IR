At present there are two vastly different ab initio approaches to the
description of the the many-body dynamics: the Density Functional Theory (DFT)
and the functional integral (path integral) approaches. On one hand, if
implemented exactly, the DFT approach can allow in principle the exact
evaluation of arbitrary one-body observable. However, when applied to Large
Amplitude Collective Motion (LACM) this approach needs to be extended in order
to accommodate the phenomenon of surface-hoping, when adiabaticity is strongly
violated and the description of a system using a single (generalized) Slater
determinant is not valid anymore. The functional integral approach on the other
hand does not appear to have such restrictions, but its implementation does not
appear to be straightforward endeavor. However, within a functional integral
approach one seems to be able to evaluate in principle any kind of observables,
such as the fragment mass and energy distributions in nuclear fission. These
two radically approaches can likely be brought brought together by formulating
a stochastic time-dependent DFT approach to many-body dynamics.
