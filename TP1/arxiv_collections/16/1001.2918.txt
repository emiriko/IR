The critical properties of the spin-1 two-dimensional Blume-Capel model on
directed and undi- rected random lattices with quenched connectivity disorder
is studied through Monte Carlo simulations. The critical temperature, as well
as the critical point exponents are obtained. For the undi- rected case this
random system belongs to the same universality class as the regular
two-dimensional model. However, for the directed random lattice one has a
second-order phase transition for q < qc and a first-order phase transition for
q > qc, where qc is the critical rewiring probability. The critical exponents
for q < qc was calculated and they do not belong to the same universality class
as the regular two-dimensional ferromagnetic model.
