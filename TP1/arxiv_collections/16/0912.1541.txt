Motivated by the work of Granda and Oliveros [L.N. Granda, A. Oliveros, Phys.
Lett. B {\bf 671}, 199 (2009)], we generalize their work to the non-flat case.
We study the correspondence between the quintessence, tachyon, K-essence and
dilaton scalar field models with the new holographic dark energy model in the
non-flat FRW universe. We reconstruct the potentials and the dynamics for these
scalar field models, which describe accelerated expansion of the universe. In
the limiting case of a flat universe, i.e. $k = 0$, all results given in [L.N.
Granda, A. Oliveros, Phys. Lett. B {\bf 671}, 199 (2009)] are obtained.
