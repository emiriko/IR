InAs quantum well heterostructures are of considerable interest for
mesoscopic device applications such as scanning probe and magnetic recording
sensors, which require the channel to be close to the surface. Here we report
on magnetotransport measurements of AlSb/InAs/AlSb Hall bars at a shallow depth
of 20 nm. Analysis of the observed Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and modeling
show that spin splitting energies in excess of 2.3 meV occur at zero magnetic
field. We conclude that the spin-splitting results from the Rashba effect due
to the band bending in the quantum well. This is caused by substantial electron
transfer from the surface to the quantum well and becomes significant when the
quantum well is located near the surface.
