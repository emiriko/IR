This note analyses one of the existing space efficient secret sharing schemes
and suggests vulnerabilities in its design. We observe that the said algorithm
fails for certain choices of the set of secrets and there is no reason for
preferring this particular scheme over alternative schemes. The paper also
elaborates the adoption of a scheme proposed by Hugo Krawczyk as an extension
of Shamir's scheme, for a set of secrets. Such an implementation is space
optimal and works for all choices of secrets. We also propose two new methods
of attack which are valid under certain assumptions and observe that it is the
elimination of random values that facilitates these kinds of attacks.
