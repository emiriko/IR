We introduce moduli spaces of abelian varieties which are arithmetic models
of Shimura varieties attached to unitary groups of signature (n-1, 1). We
define arithmetic cycles on these models and study their intersection
behaviour. In particular, in the non-degenerate case, we prove a relation
between their intersection numbers and Fourier coefficients of the derivative
at s=0 of a certain incoherent Eisenstein series for the group U(n, n). This is
done by relating the arithmetic cycles to their formal counterpart from Part I
via non-archimedean uniformization, and by relating the Fourier coefficients to
the derivatives of representation densities of hermitian forms. The result then
follows from the main theorem of Part I and a counting argument.
