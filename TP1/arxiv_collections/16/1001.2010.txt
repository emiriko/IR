When we are fortunate enough to view an exoplanetary system nearly edge-on,
the star and planet periodically eclipse each other. Observations of eclipses
(transits and occultations) provide a bonanza of information that cannot be
obtained from radial-velocity data alone, such as the relative dimensions of
the planet and its host star, as well as the orientation of the planet's orbit
relative to the sky plane and relative to the stellar rotation axis. The
wavelength-dependence of the eclipse signal gives clues about the the
temperature and composition of the planetary atmosphere. Anomalies in the
timing or other properties of the eclipses may betray the presence of
additional planets or moons. Searching for eclipses is also a productive means
of discovering new planets. This chapter reviews the basic geometry and physics
of eclipses, and summarizes the knowledge that has been gained through eclipse
observations, as well as the information that might be gained in the future.
