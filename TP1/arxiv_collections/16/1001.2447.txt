We consider the problem of demodulating M-ary optical PPM (pulse-position
modulation) waveforms, and propose a structured receiver whose mean probability
of symbol error is smaller than all known receivers, and approaches the quantum
limit. The receiver uses photodetection coupled with optimized phase-coherent
optical feedback control and a phase-sensitive parametric amplifier. We present
a general framework of optical receivers known as the conditional pulse nulling
receiver, and present new results on ultimate limits and achievable regions of
spectral versus photon efficiency tradeoffs for the single-spatial-mode
pure-loss optical communication channel.
