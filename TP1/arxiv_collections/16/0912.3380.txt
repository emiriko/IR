The relations between TMDs and PDFs are obtained from the symmetry
requirement: relativistic covariance combined with rotationally symmetric
parton motion in the nucleon rest frame. This requirement is applied in the
covariant parton model. Using the usual PDFs as an input, we are obtaining
predictions for some polarized and unpolarized TMDs.
