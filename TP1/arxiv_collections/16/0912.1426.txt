We prove the global existence and uniqueness of classical solutions around an
equilibrium to the Boltzmann equation without angular cutoff in some Sobolev
spaces. In addition, the solutions thus obtained are shown to be non-negative
and $C^\infty$ in all variables for any positive time. In this paper, we study
the Maxwellian molecule type collision operator with mild singularity. One of
the key observations is the introduction of a new important norm related to the
singular behavior of the cross section in the collision operator. This norm
captures the essential properties of the singularity and yields precisely the
dissipation of the linearized collision operator through the celebrated
H-theorem.
