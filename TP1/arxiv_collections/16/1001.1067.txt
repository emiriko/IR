We calculate the dimensionless Fermi liquid parameters (FLPs),
$F_{0,1}^{sym}$ and $F_{0,1}^{asym}$, for spin asymmetric dense quark matter.
In general, the FLPs are infrared divergent due to the exchange of massless
gluons. To remove such divergences, the Hard Density Loop (HDL) corrected gluon
propagator is used. The FLPs so determined are then invoked to calculate
magnetic properties such as magnetization $\langle M\rangle$ and magnetic
susceptibility $\chi_M$ of spin polarized quark matter. Finally, we investigate
the possibility of magnetic instability by studying the density dependence of
$\langle M\rangle$ and $\chi_M$.
