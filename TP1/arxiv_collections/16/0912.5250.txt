The process of pair creation by a photon in a constant and homogeneous
electric field is investigated basing on the polarization operator in the
field. The total probability of the process is found in a relatively simple
form. At high energy the quasiclassical approximation is valid. The corrections
to the standard quasiclassical approximation (SQA) are calculated. In the
region relatively low photon energies, where SQA is unapplicable, the new
approximation is used. It is shown that in this energy interval the probability
of pair creation by a photon in electric field exceeds essentially the
corresponding probability in a magnetic field. This approach is valid at the
photon energy much larger than "vacuum" energy in electric field: $\omega\gg
eE/m$. For smaller photon energies the low energy approximation is developed.
At $\omega\ll eE/m$ the found probability describes the absorption of soft
photon by the particles created by an electric field.
