In this paper we present soliton solutions of two coupled nonlinear
Schodinger equations modulated in the bspace and time. The approach allows us
to obatin solitons with large variety of solutions depending on the
nonlinearity and the potential profiles. As examples we show three cases with
soliton solution in such system, one of them with potential varying between
repulsive and attractive behavior and the others with nonlinearity localized
and delocalized, respectively.
