The TANAMI program has been monitoring the parsec-scale radio jets of
southern gamma-ray bright AGN with VLBI techniques simultaneously with
Fermi/LAT monitoring of their gamma-ray emission. Here we present the gamma-ray
properties of the TANAMI sources based on an analysis of the preliminary 1-year
LAT source list. We present upper limits on the gamma-ray flux for TANAMI
sources not detected by LAT.
