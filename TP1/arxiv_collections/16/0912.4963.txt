In article "Limits on a nucleon-nucleon monopole-dipole (axionlike)
P,T-noninvariant interaction from spin relaxation of polarized 3He" Yu. N.
Pokotilovski arXiv:0902.1682v2 [nucl-ex] 12 Feb 2009 it was presented new
constraints for the product of the scalar, pseudo-scalar dimensionless
constants: gs*gp < 1*10^-17 for the parameter lam about 10^-4 cm, determining
the range of forces. In this comment it is shown that the real constraint for
the same parameter lam from the same experimental data is about 2*10^-11. It is
worse in about one hundred times that the constraint from UCN depolarization
and can not be considered as a new limit on a nucleon-nucleon monopole-dipole
(axionlike) P,T-noninvariant interaction.
