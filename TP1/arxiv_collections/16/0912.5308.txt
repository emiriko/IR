The static pair correlation (distribution) function and the structure factor
of particle distributions in three-dimensional homogeneous isotropic systems
are explicitly restored from two-dimensional data observed in a thin slab
sliced out from original systems. The result is given as an expansion with
respect to the thickness of the slab and applied to the critical density
fluctuations.
