This article addresses broad trends in interdisciplinary research in physics
where interactions with colleagues in fields such as computer science, ecology,
or economics can often be derailed by unintentional clashes of methodologies
and perspectives on the core science. Key causes of such breakdowns in
interdisciplinary work are detailed and solutions offered.
