The purpose of the following paper is to demonstrate that the "limits of
physics" are in a very important way determined by the conceptual framework and
language of discourse that we use to describe physical reality. In this paper
we examine three areas where the structure of discourse has been particularly
difficult. In this regard we examine three problems, the problem of time (which
is discussed in two sections of the paper), the problem of non-locality in
quantum mechanics and some related general difficulties of interpretation
specific to the Copenhagen school, and the concept of maximality as it is
employed with respect to cosmic inflation in general relativity and quantum
cosmology.
