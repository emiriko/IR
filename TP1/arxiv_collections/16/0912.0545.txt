NGC1275, the central galaxy in the Perseus cluster, is the host of gigantic
hot bipolar bubbles inflated by AGN jets observed in the radio as Perseus A. It
presents a spectacular $H{\alpha}$-emitting nebulosity surrounding NGC1275,
with loops and filaments of gas extending to over 50 kpc. The origin of the
filaments is still unknown, but probably correlates with the mechanism
responsible for the giant buoyant bubbles. We present 2.5 and 3-dimensional MHD
simulations of the central region of the cluster in which turbulent energy,
possibly triggered by star formation and supernovae (SNe) explosions is
introduced. The simulations reveal that the turbulence injected by massive
stars could be responsible for the nearly isotropic distribution of filaments
and loops that drag magnetic fields upward as indicated by recent observations.
Weak shell-like shock fronts propagating into the ICM with velocities of
100-500 km/s are found, also resembling the observations. The isotropic outflow
momentum of the turbulence slows the infall of the intracluster medium, thus
limiting further starburst activity in NGC1275. As the turbulence is subsonic
over most of the simulated volume, the turbulent kinetic energy is not
efficiently converted into heat and additional heating is required to suppress
the cooling flow at the core of the cluster. Simulations combining the MHD
turbulence with the AGN outflow can reproduce the temperature radial profile
observed around NGC1275. While the AGN mechanism is the main heating source,
the supernovae are crucial to isotropize the energy distribution.
