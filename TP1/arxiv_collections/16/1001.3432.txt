We investigate the exclusive rare $B_c\to D_{(s)}\nu_{\ell}\bar{\nu_{\ell}}$
and $B\to D_{(s)}\ell^+\ell^-$ ($\ell=e,\mu,\tau$) decays within the standard
model and the light-front quark model constrained by the variational principle
for the QCD motivated effective Hamiltonian. The form factors $f_{\pm}(q^2)$
and $f_T(q^2)$ are obtained from the analytic continuation method in the
$q^+=0$ frame. While the form factors $f_+(q^2)$ and $f_T(q^2)$ are free from
the zero-mode, the form factor $f_-(q^2)$ is not free from the zero-mode in the
$q^+=0$ frame. We discuss the covariance(i.e. frame-independence) of our model
calculation and quantify the zero-mode contributions to $f_-(q^2)$ for $B_c\to
D_{(s)}$ decays. The branching ratios and the longitudinal lepton polarization
asymmetries are calculated with and without the long-distance contributions.
Our numerical results for the non-resonant branching ratios for $B_c\to
D(D_s)\sum\nu_{\ell}\bar{\nu_{\ell}}$ and $B_c\to D(D_s)\ell^+\ell^-$ are in
the order of $10^{-8} (10^{-7})$ and $10^{-9} (10^{-8})$, respectively. The
averaged values of the lepton polarization asymmetries obtained from the linear
(harmonic oscillator) potential parameters are found to be $-0.99 (-0.99)$ for
$B_c\to D\mu^+\mu^-$ and $-0.16 (-0.15)$ for $B_c\to D\tau^+\tau^-$, and $-0.98
(-0.98)$ for $B_c\to D_s\mu^+\mu^-$ and $-0.14 (-0.12)$ for $B_c\to
D_s\tau^+\tau^-$, respectively.
