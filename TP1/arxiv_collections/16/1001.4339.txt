Coupled split-ring-resonator metamaterials have previously been shown to
exhibit large coupling effects, which are a prerequisite for obtaining large
effective optical activity. By a suitable lateral arrangement of these building
blocks, we completely eliminate linear birefringence and obtain pure optical
activity and connected circular optical dichroism. Experiments at around
100-THz frequency and corresponding modeling are in good agreement. Rotation
angles of about 30 degrees for 205nm sample thickness are derived.
