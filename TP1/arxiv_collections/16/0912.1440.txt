In the paper "New Results on Frame-Proof Codes and Traceability Schemes" by
Reihaneh Safavi-Naini and Yejing Wang [IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, vol. 47, no.
7, pp. 3029-3033, Nov. 2001], there are lower bounds for the maximal number of
codewords in binary frame-proof codes and decoders in traceability schemes.
There are also existence proofs using a construction of binary frame-proof
codes and traceability schemes. Here it is found that the main results in the
referenced paper do not hold.
