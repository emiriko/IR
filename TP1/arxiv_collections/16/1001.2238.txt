Using CLEO data, we report on the confirmation of the eta_b(1S0) ground state
of bottomonium in the radiative decay Upsilon(3S) -> gamma eta_b. We determine
its mass to be M(eta_b) = 9391.8 +- 6.6 +- 2.1 MeV, which corresponds to the
hyperfine splitting Delta M_hf(1S) = 68.5 +- 6.6 +- 2.0 MeV, and the branching
fraction B(Upsilon(3S) -> gamma eta_b) = (7.1 +- 1.8 +- 1.1) x 10^-4. These
results agree with those previously reported by BaBar.
