We consider the dynamic response functions of interacting one dimensional
spin-1/2 fermions at arbitrary momenta. We build a non-perturbative
zero-temperature theory of the threshold singularities using mobile impurity
Hamiltonians. The interaction induced low-energy spin-charge separation and
power-law threshold singularities survive away from Fermi points. We express
the threshold exponents in terms of the spinon spectrum.
