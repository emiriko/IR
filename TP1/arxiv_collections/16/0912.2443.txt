The moon is receding from earth at an average rate of 3.8 cm/yr
[6][7][9][12].This anomaly cannot be attributed to the well-known tidal
exchange of angular momentum between earth and moon [8]. A secular change in
the astronomical unit AU is definitely a concern, it is reportedly increasing
by about 15 cm/yr [9][10], in this letter; the concept of macroscopic
quantization of gravity is introduced to account for these anomalies on
theoretical basis. Interestingly, it was found useful in measuring the speed of
gravity! What is more interesting is the fact that this concept is based on
solid well known classical physics with no modifications to any standard model.
It was found that the speed of gravity cg is in the range 10^4 c < cg < 10^5 c.
