We continue our investigation of massive gravity in the massless limit of
vanishing graviton mass. From gauge invariance we derive the most general
coupling between scalar matter and gravity. We get further couplings beside the
standard coupling to the energy-momentum tensor. On the classical level this
leads to a further modification of general relativity.
