Using the Brans-Dicke theory of gravitation we put under investigation a
hypothetical universe filled with a fermionic field (with a self interaction
potential) and a matter constituent ruled by a barotropic equation of state. It
is shown that the fermionic field (in combination with the Brans-Dicke scalar
field) could be responsible for a final accelerated era, after an initial
matter dominated period.
