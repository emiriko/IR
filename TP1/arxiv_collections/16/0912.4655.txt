The up to 150 day uninterrupted high-precision photometry of about 100000
stars - provided so far by the exoplanet channel of the CoRoT space telescope -
gave a new perspective on the planet population of our galactic neighbourhood.
The seven planets with very accurate parameters widen the range of known planet
properties in almost any respect. Giant planets have been detected at low
metallicity, rapidly rotating and active, spotted stars. CoRoT-3 populated the
brown dwarf desert and closed the gap of measured physical properties between
standard giant planets and very low mass stars. CoRoT extended the known range
of planet masses down to 5 Earth masses and up to 21 Jupiter masses, the radii
to less than 2 Earth radii and up to the most inflated hot Jupiter found so
far, and the periods of planets discovered by transits to 9 days. Two CoRoT
planets have host stars with the lowest content of heavy elements known to show
a transit hinting towards a different planet-host-star-metallicity relation
then the one found by radial-velocity search programs. Finally the properties
of the CoRoT-7b prove that terrestrial planets with a density close to Earth
exist outside the Solar System. The detection of the secondary transit of
CoRoT-1 at the $10^{-5}$-level and the very clear detection of the 1.7 Earth
radii of CoRoT-7b at $3.5 10^{-4}$ relative flux are promising evidence of
CoRoT being able to detect even smaller, Earth sized planets.
