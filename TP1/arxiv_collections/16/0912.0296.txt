We show that temperature of a current (I = 20 mA) carrying manganite
(Nd0.5Ca0.5Mn0.93Ni0.07O3) in presence of a magnetic field (H) decreases
abruptly as much as deltaT = 45 K (7 K) accompanied by a step like decrease in
magnetoresistance at a critical value of H when the base temperature is 40 K
(100 K). The magnitude of deltaT and the position of magnetoresistance step
decrease towards lower H with decreasing amplitude of the current. We discuss
possible origins of the current and magnetic- field driven temperature change
which may find applications in magnetothermal refrigeration besides
magnetocaloric effect.
