We develop an effective low-energy, long-wavelength theory of a bulk
supersolid--a putative phase of matter with simultaneous crystallinity and Bose
condensation. Using conservation laws and general symmetry arguments we derive
an effective action that correctly describes the coupling between the Bose
condensation and the elasticity of the solid. We use our effective action to
calculate the correlation and response functions for the supersolid, and we
show that the onset of supersolidity produces peaks in the response function,
corresponding to propagating second sound modes in the solid. Throughout our
work we make connections to existing work on effective theories of superfluids
and normal solids, and we underscore the importance of conservation laws and
symmetries in determining the number and character of the collective modes.
