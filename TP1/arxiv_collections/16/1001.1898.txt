Hydrodynamic interactions between particles confined in a liquid-filled
linear channel are known to be screened beyond a distance comparable to the
channel width. Using a simple analytical theory and lattice-Boltzmann
simulations, we show that the hydrodynamic screening is qualitatively modified
when the time-dependent response and finite compressibility of the host liquid
are taken into account. Diffusive compression modes in the confined liquid
cause the particles to have velocity correlations of unbounded range, whose
amplitude decays with time only as $t^{-3/2}$.
