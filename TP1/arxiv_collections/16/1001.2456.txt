Although many computational methods for rare event sampling exist, this type
of calculation is not usually practical for general nonequilibrium conditions,
with macroscopically irreversible dynamics and away from both stationary and
metastable states. A novel method for calculating the time-series of the
probability of a rare event is presented which is designed for these
conditions. The method is validated for the cases of the Glauber-Ising model
under time-varying shear flow, the Kawasaki-Ising model after a quench into the
region between nucleation dominated and spinodal decomposition dominated phase
change dynamics, and the parallel open asymmetric exclusion process (p-o ASEP).
The method requires a subdivision of the phase space of the system: it is
benchmarked and found to scale well for increasingly fine subdivisions, meaning
that it can be applied without detailed foreknowledge of the physically
important reaction pathways.
