We report the measurement of the transverse momentum dependence of inclusive
J/psi polarization in p+p collisions at sqrt(s)=200 GeV performed by the PHENIX
Experiment at RHIC. The polarization is studied in the helicity,
Gottfried-Jackson, and Collins-Soper frames for p_T < 5 GeV/c and |y| < 0.35.
The J/psi polarization in the helicity and Gottfried-Jackson frames is
consistent with zero for all transverse momenta, with a slight (1.8 sigma)
trend towards longitudinal polarization for transverse momenta above 2 GeV/c.
No conclusion is allowed due to the limited acceptance in the Collins-Soper
frame and the uncertainties of the current data. The results are compared to
observations for other collision systems and center of mass energies and to
different quarkonia production models.
