We present the results of a ground-based search for the secondary eclipse of
the 3.3 Mjup transiting planet CoRoT-2b. We performed near infrared photometry
using the LIRIS instrument on the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope, in the H
and K_s filters. We monitored the star around two expected secondary eclipses
in two nights under very good observing conditions. For the depth of the
secondary eclipse we find in H-band a 3 sigma upper limit of 0.17%, whereas we
detected a tentative eclipse with a depth of 0.16+-0.09% in the K_s-band. These
depths can be translated into brightness temperatures of T_H<2250 K and T_{K_s}
= 1890(+260-350) K, which indicate an inefficient re-distribution of the
incident stellar flux from the planet's dayside to its nightside. Our results
are in agreement with the CoRoT optical measurement (Alonso et al. 09) and with
Spitzer 4.5 and 8 micron results (Gillon et al. 09c).
