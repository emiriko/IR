We study the K* polarization states in the exclusive 4-body B meson decay B
to K* (to K pi) l+ l- in the low dilepton mass region working in the framework
of QCDF. We review the construction of the CP conserving transverse and
transverse/longitudinal observables AT2, AT3, and AT4. We focus here, on
analyzing their behaviour at large recoil energy in presence of right-handed
currents.
