A geometric approach is used to study a family of higher-order nonlinear Abel
equations. The inverse problem of the Lagrangian dynamics is studied in the
particular case of the second-order Abel equation and the existence of two
alternative Lagrangian formulations is proved, both Lagrangians being of a
non-natural class (neither potential nor kinetic term). These higher-order Abel
equations are studied by means of their Darboux polynomials and Jacobi
multipliers. In all the cases a family of constants of the motion is explicitly
obtained. The general n-dimensional case is also studied.
