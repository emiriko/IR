We prove a general statement which implies the coincidence of the Azumaya and
smooth loci of the center of an algebra in positive characteristic, provided
that the spectrum of its associated graded algebra has a large symplectic leaf.
In particular, we show that for a symplectic reflection algebra smooth and the
Azumaya loci coincide.
