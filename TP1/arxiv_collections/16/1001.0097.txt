When the Moon was formed it was much closer to the Earth than it is today. It
just needed about 20 days then to go around the Earth. Now it takes the Moon
29.5 days to make one revolution. In order to follow the conservation of
angular momentum the Moon had to either move closer to the Earth or recede from
Earth. The data from the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment confirms it to be
moving away and the velocity of recession of the Moon have been found to be 3.8
cm/year. This rate is not constant though. At present the Moon's orbit has a
radius of 384,000km. But what is not yet known to all is that the orbital
motion of the moon is actually a spiral motion. The moon is spiralling out and
a very simple mathematical equation can describe the actual spiral motion of
the Moon. The generalisation of this differential equation is the basic aim of
this paper here.
