Spin and polarization effects and correlations between them in the processes
of pair production by a photon and synchrotron radiation in a magnetic field
are considered. Expressions for the probabilities of the processes with
arbitrary polarizations of the particles are obtained. These expressions are
analyzed in detail in both the lowest Landau levels and ultrarelativistic
approximations.
