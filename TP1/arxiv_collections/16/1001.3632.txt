Starting from the central density slope-anisotropy theorem of An and Evans
(2006), recent investigations have shown that the involved density
slope-anisotropy inequality holds not only at the center, but at all radii
(i.e. globally) in a very large class of spherical systems with positive
phase-space distribution function. Here we present some additional analytical
cases that further extend the validity of the global density slope-anisotropy
inequality. These new results, several numerical evidences, and the absence of
known counter-examples, lead us to conjecture that the global density
slope-anisotropy inequality could actually be a universal property of spherical
systems with positive distribution function.
