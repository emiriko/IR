We study the possibility that the three mass states of the ordinary active
neutrinos actually split into pairs of quasi-degenerate states, with $\Delta
m^2_{kk'} \sim 10^{-12}$ eV$^2$ or less, as a result of mixing of active
neutrinos with sterile neutrinos. Although these quasi-degenerate pairs will
look in laboratory experiment identical to single active states, the CP phase
factors associated with active-sterile mixing might cause cancellations in the
effective electron neutrino mass $m_{ee}$ measured in the neutrinoless double
beta decay experiments thereby revealing the split nature of states.
