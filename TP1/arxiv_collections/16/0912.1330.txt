Sudden death of entanglement is a well-known effect resulting from the finite
volume of separable states. We study the case when the observer has a limited
measurement capability and analyse the effective entanglement, i.e.
entanglement minimized over the output data. We show that in the well defined
system of two quantum dots monitored by single electron transistors, one may
observe a sudden death of effective entanglement when real, physical
entanglement is still alive. For certain measurement setups, this occurs even
for initial states for which sudden death of physical entanglement is not
possible at all. The principles of the analysis may be applied to other
analogous scenarios, such as etimation of the parameters arising from quantum
process tomography.
