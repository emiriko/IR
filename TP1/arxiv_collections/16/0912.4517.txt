By taking into account a running of the gravitational coupling constant with
an ultra violet fixed point, an improvement of classical black hole space-times
in extra dimensions is studied. It is found that the thermodynamic properties
in this framework allow for an effective description of the black hole
evaporation process. Phenomenological consequences of this approach are
discussed and the LHC discovery potential is estimated.
