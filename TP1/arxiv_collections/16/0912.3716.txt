Massive and massless vector particles, in the framework of generalized
Weinberg-Tucker-Hammer equations, are considered in the Petiau-Duffin-Kemmer
formalism. We obtain solutions of equations in the form of matrix-dyads. The
Lagrangian is defined in the matrix form and the conserved electric current and
the energy-momentum tensor are obtained. The canonical quantization is
performed and the propagator of massive fields is found in the formalism
considered.
