In a recent paper the authors presented an extended study aiming at
simulating the classical meteorological parameters and the optical turbulence
at Dome C during the winter with the atmospherical mesoscale model Meso-NH. A
statistical analysis has been presented and the conclusions of that paper have
been very promising. Wind speed and temperature fields revealed to be very well
reconstructed by the Meso-NH model with better performances than what has been
achieved with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF)
global model, especially near the surface. All results revealed to be
resolution-dependent and it has been proved that a grid-nesting configuration
(3 domains) with a high horizontal resolution (1km) for the innermost domain is
necessary to reconstruct all the optical turbulence features with a good
correlation to measurements. High resolution simulations provided an averaged
surface layer thickness just ~14 m higher than what is estimated by
measurements, the seeing in the free atmosphere showed a dispersion from the
observed one of just a few hundredths of an arcsecond (~0.05"). The unique
limitation of the previous study was that the optical turbulence in the surface
layer appeared overestimated by the model in both low and high resolution
modes. In this study we present the results obtained with an improved numerical
configuration. The same 15 nights have been simulated, and we show that the
model results now match almost perfectly the observations in all their
features: the surface thickness, the seeing in the free atmosphere as well as
in the surface layer. This result permits us to investigate now other antarctic
sites using a robust numerical model well adapted to the extreme polar
conditions (Meso-NH).
