The currently favored method for estimating radii and other parameters of
transiting-planet host stars is to match theoretical models to observations of
the stellar mean density rho_*, the effective temperature T_eff, and the
composition parameter [Z]. This explicitly model-dependent approach is based on
readily-available observations, and results in small formal errors. Here I use
two calibration samples of stars (eclipsing binaries and stars for which
asteroseismic analyses are available) having well-determined masses and radii
to estimate the accuracy and systematic errors inherent in the rho_* method.
When matching to the Yonsei-Yale stellar evolution models, I find the most
important systematic error results from selection bias favoring
rapidly-rotating (hence probably magnetically active) stars among the eclipsing
binary sample. If unaccounted for, this bias leads to a mass-dependent
underestimate of stellar radii by as much as 4% for stars of 0.4 M_sun,
decreasing to zero for masses above about 1.4 M_sun. The asteroseismic sample
suggests (albeit with significant uncertainty) that systematic errors are small
for slowly-rotating, inactive stars. Systematic errors arising from failings of
the Yonsei-Yale models of inactive stars probably exist, but are difficult to
assess because of the small number of well-characterized comparison stars
having low mass and slow rotation. Poor information about [Z] is an important
source of random error, and may be a minor source of systematic error as well.
With suitable corrections for rotation, it is likely that systematic errors in
the rho_* method can be comparable to or smaller than the random errors,
yielding radii that are accurate to about 2% for most stars.
