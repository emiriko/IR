The development of IT and WWW provides different teaching strategies, which
are chosen by teachers. Students can acquire knowledge through different
learning models. The problem based learning is a popular teaching strategy for
teachers. Based on the educational theory, students increase their learning
motivation, which can increase learning effectiveness. In this paper, we
propose a concept map for each student and staff. This map finds the result of
the subjects and also recommends a sequence of remedial teaching. Here, rough
set theory is used for dealing with uncertainty in the hidden pattern of data.
For each competence the lower and upper approximations are calculated based on
the brainstorm maps.
