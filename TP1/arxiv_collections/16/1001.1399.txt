It is proposed that the ability of humans to flourish in diverse environments
and evolve complex cultures reflects the following two underlying cognitive
transitions. The transition from the coarse-grained associative memory of Homo
habilis to the fine-grained memory of Homo erectus enabled limited
representational redescription of perceptually similar episodes, abstraction,
and analytic thought, the last of which is modeled as the formation of states
and of lattices of properties and contexts for concepts. The transition to the
modern mind of Homo sapiens is proposed to have resulted from onset of the
capacity to spontaneously and temporarily shift to an associative mode of
thought conducive to interaction amongst seemingly disparate concepts, modeled
as the forging of conjunctions resulting in states of entanglement. The fruits
of associative thought became ingredients for analytic thought, and vice versa.
The ratio of associative pathways to concepts surpassed a percolation threshold
resulting in the emergence of a self-modifying, integrated internal model of
the world, or worldview.
