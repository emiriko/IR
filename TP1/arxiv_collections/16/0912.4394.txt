We examine the relation between different electronic transport phenomena in a
Fabry-Perot interferometer in the fractional quantum Hall regime. In
particular, we study the way these phenomena reflect the statistics of quantum
Hall quasi-particles. For two series of states we examine, one abelian and one
non-abelian, we show that the information that may be obtained from
measurements of the lowest order interference pattern in an open Fabry-Perot
interferometer is identical to the one that may be obtained from the
temperature dependence of Coulomb blockade peaks in a closed interferometer. We
argue that despite the similarity between the experimental signatures of the
two series of states, interference and Coulomb blockade measurements are likely
to be able to distinguish between abelian and non-abelian states, due to the
sensitivity of the abelian states to local perturbations, to which the
non-abelian states are insensitive.
