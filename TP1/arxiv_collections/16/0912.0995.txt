We irradiated an rf-SQUID qubit with large-amplitude and high frequency
electromagnetic field. Population transitions between macroscopic distinctive
quantum states due to Landau-Zener transitions at energy-level avoided
crossings were observed. The qubit population on the excited states as a
function of flux detuning and microwave power exhibits interference patterns.
Some novel features are found in the interference and a model based on rate
equations can well address the features.
