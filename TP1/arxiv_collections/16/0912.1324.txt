We investigate the prospects for indirect detection of right-handed sneutrino
dark matter at the IceCube neutrino telescope in a $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of
the MSSM. The capture and annihilation of sneutrinos inside the Sun reach
equilibrium, and the flux of produced neutrinos is governed by the
sneutrino-proton elastic scattering cross section, which has an upper bound of
$8 \times 10^{-9}$ pb from the $Z^{\prime}$ mass limits in the $B-L$ model.
Despite the absence of any spin-dependent contribution, the muon event rates
predicted by this model can be detected at IceCube since sneutrinos mainly
annihilate into leptonic final states by virtue of the fermion $B-L$ charges.
These subsequently decay to neutrinos with 100% efficiency. The Earth muon
event rates are too small to be detected for the standard halo model
irrespective of an enhanced sneutrino annihilation cross section that can
explain the recent PAMELA data. For modified velocity distributions, the Earth
muon events increase substantially and can be greater than the IceCube
detection threshold of 12 events $\mathrm{km}^{-2}$ $\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$.
However, this only leads to a mild increase of about 30% for the Sun muon
events. The number of muon events from the Sun can be as large as roughly 100
events $\mathrm{km}^{-2}$ $\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for this model.
