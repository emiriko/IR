We study flavor oscillations of low energy neutrinos propagating in dense
matter of a rotating neutron star. On the basis of the exact solutions of the
wave equations for neutrinos mass eigenstates we derive the transition
probability for neutrinos having big initial angular momentum. It is found that
flavor oscillations of neutrinos with energies of several electron-Volts can be
resonancely enhanced.
