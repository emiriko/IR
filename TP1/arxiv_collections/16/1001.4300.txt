New Completely Integrable (2+1)-System is studied. It is based on the
so-called L-A-B-triples $L_t=[H,L]-fL$ where L is a 2D Schrodinger Operator.
This approach was invented by S.Manakov and B.Dubrovin, I.Krichever,
S.Novikov(DKN) in the works published in 1976. A nonstandard reduction for the
2D Schrodinger Operator (completely different from the one found by S.Novikov
and A.Veselov in 1984) compatible with time dynamics of the new Nonlinear
System, is studied here. It can be naturally treated as a 2D extension of the
famous Burgers System. The Algebro-Geometric (AG) Periodic Solutions here are
very specific and unusual (for general and reduced cases). The reduced system
is linearizable like Burgers. However, the general one (and probably the
reduced one also) certainly lead in the stationary AG case to the nonstandard
examples of algebraic curves $\Gamma\subset W$ in the full complex 2D manifold
of Bloch-Floquet functions W for the periodic elliptic 2D operator H where
$H\psi(x,y,P)=\lambda(P)\psi(x,y,P),P\in \Gamma$. However, in the nontrivial
case the operators are nonselfadjoint. A Conjecture is formulated that for the
nontrivial selfadjoint elliptic 2D Schrodinger operators H with periodic
coefficients The Whole 2D Complex Manifolds W cannot not contain any Zariski
open part of algebraic curve $\Gamma$ except maybe one selected level
$H\psi=const$ found in 1976 by DKN. Version 2 contains new results. It also
corrects some non-accurate claims; in particular, the non-reduced system is
non-linearizable in any trivial sense. In version 3 a misprint in the
formulation of Theorem 1 was corrected.
