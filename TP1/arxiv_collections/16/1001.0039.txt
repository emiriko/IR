The recently released Chandra Transmission Grating Catalog and Archive,
TGCat, presents a fully dynamic on-line catalog allowing users to browse and
categorize Chandra gratings observations quickly and easily, generate custom
plots of resulting response corrected spectra on-line without the need for
special software and to download analysis ready products from multiple
observations in one convenient operation. TGCat has been registered as a VO
resource with the NVO providing direct access to the catalogs interface. The
catalog is supported by a back-end designed to automatically fetch newly public
data, process, archive and catalog them, At the same time utilizing an advanced
queue system integrated into the archive's MySQL database allowing large
processing projects to take advantage of an unlimited number of CPUs across a
network for rapid completion. A unique feature of the catalog is that all of
the high level functions used to retrieve inputs from the Chandra archive and
to generate the final data products are available to the user in an ISIS
written library with detailed documentation. Here we present a structural
overview of the Systems, Design, and Accessibility features of the catalog and
archive.
