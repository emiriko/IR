The zero-error capacity of a channel is the rate at which it can send
information perfectly, with zero probability of error, and has long been
studied in classical information theory. We show that the zero-error capacity
of quantum channels exhibits an extreme form of non-additivity, one which is
not possible for classical channels, or even for the usual capacities of
quantum channels. By combining probabilistic arguments with algebraic geometry,
we prove that there exist channels E1 and E2 with no zero-error classical
capacity whatsoever, C_0(E1) = C_0(E2) = 0, but whose joint zero-error quantum
capacity is positive, Q_0(E1 x E2) >= 1. This striking effect is an extreme
from of the superactivation phenomenon, as it implies that both the classical
and quantum zero-error capacities of these channels can be superactivated
simultaneously, whilst being a strictly stronger property of capacities.
Superactivation of the quantum zero-error capacity was not previously known.
