We discuss theoretical and experimental preparations for an indirect new
physics search using the rare decay B to K*0 (to K pi) l+ l- focusing on CP
violating observables. The separation of new physics effects and hadronic
uncertainties is the key issue when using flavour observables in a new-physics
search. Our analysis is based on QCD factorization and soft-collinear effective
theory and critically examines the new physics reach of those observables via a
detailed error analysis due to scale dependences, form factors, and other input
parameters; we also explore the experimental sensitivities at LHCb using a
full-angular fit method; finally, we make the impact of the unknown Lambda/mb
corrections manifest in our theoretical predictions.
