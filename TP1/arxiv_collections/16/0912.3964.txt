A novel channel coding scheme for progressive transmission of large images is
proposed. The transmission time, low distortion reconstructed image and low
complexity are most concerned in this paper. In the case of medical data
transmission, it is vital to keep the distortion level under control as in most
of the cases certain clinically important regions have to be transmitted
without any visible error. The proposed system significantly reduces the
transmission time and error. The progressive transmission is based on the
process that the input image is decomposed into many subblocks each to be
coded, compressed, and transmitted individually. Therefore, firstly the image
is segmented into a number of subblocks and then the discrete wavelet transform
decomposes each subblock into different time-frequency components. Finally the
components are coded for error control and transmitted. The complete system is
coded in VHDL. In the proposed system, we choose a 3-level Haar wavelet
transform to perform the wavelet transform for each subblock. It is simple,
faster and easier to implement when compared with other transform method. The
channel coding used here is Hamming code which is a simpler and efficient
forward error control code.
