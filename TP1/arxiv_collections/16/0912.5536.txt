In a scenario of Higgs portal dark matter, Higgs exchange processes are
essential for both dark matter annihilation in the early Universe and direct
search experiments. The CDMS II collaboration has recently released their final
results on direct dark matter searches. We study a scalar dark matter model
with multi-Higgs doublets under the constraint from the CDMS II results and
also from the WMAP data. We find that the possible maximal value for the
branching ratio of the invisible decay of the Higgs boson can be significantly
greater than that in the Higgs portal model with one Higgs doublet, in
particular, for the case of the so-called Type-X Yukawa interaction. Therefore,
the search for the invisible decay of the Higgs boson at the CERN Large Hadron
Collider and future collider experiments would provide useful information not
only for the nature of dark matter but also for the structure of the Higgs
sector even without directly detecting any extra scalar boson.
