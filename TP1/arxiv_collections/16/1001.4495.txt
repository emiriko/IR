We perform an update of the next-to-leading order calculation of the rate for
Higgs boson production in association with two jets. Our new calculation
incorporates the full analytic result for the one-loop virtual amplitude. This
new theoretical information allows us to construct a code including the decay
of the Higgs boson without incurring a prohibitive penalty in computer running
time. Results are presented for the Tevatron, where implications for the Higgs
search are sketched, and also for a range of scenarios at the LHC.
