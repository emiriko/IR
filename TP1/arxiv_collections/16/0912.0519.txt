We analyse cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include
observationally-constrained prescriptions for galactic outflows. If these
simulated winds accurately represent winds in the real Universe, then material
previously ejected in winds provides the dominant source of gas infall for new
star formation at redshifts z<1. This recycled wind accretion, or wind mode,
provides a third physically distinct accretion channel in addition to the "hot"
and "cold" modes emphasised in recent theoretical studies. Because of the
interaction between outflows and gas in and around halos, the recycling
timescale of wind material (t_rec) is shorter in higher-mass systems, which
reside in denser gaseous environments. In these simulations, this differential
recycling plays a central role in shaping the present-day galaxy stellar mass
function (GSMF). If we remove all particles that were ever ejected in a wind,
then the predicted GSMFs are much steeper than observed; galaxy masses are
suppressed both by the direct removal of gas and by the hydrodynamic heating of
their surroundings, which reduces subsequent infall. With wind recycling
included, the simulation that incorporates our favoured momentum-driven wind
scalings reproduces the observed GSMF for stellar masses 10^9 < M < 5x10^10
Msolar. At higher masses, wind recycling leads to excessive galaxy masses and
excessive star formation rates relative to observations. In these massive
systems, some quenching mechanism must suppress the re-accretion of gas ejected
from star-forming galaxies. In short, as has long been anticipated, the form of
the GSMF is governed by outflows; the unexpected twist here for our simulated
winds is that it is not primarily the ejection of material but how the ejected
material is re-accreted that governs the GSMF.
