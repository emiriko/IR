The c-axis transport properties of a high-pressure synthesized PrFeAsO0.7
single crystal are studied using s-shaped junctions. Resistivity anisotropy of
about 120 detected at 50 K shows the presence of strong anisotropy in the
electronic states. The obtained critical current density for the c-axis of
2.9*10^5 A/cm^2 is two orders of magnitude larger than that in
Bi2Sr1.6La0.4CuO6+d. The appearance of a hysteresis in the current-voltage
curve below T_c is the manifestation of the intrinsic Josephson effect similar
to that in cuprate superconductors. The suppression of the critical
current-normal resistance (I_cR_n) product is explained by an inspecular
transport in s_pm-wave pair potential.
