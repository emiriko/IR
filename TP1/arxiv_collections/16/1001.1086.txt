We report the discovery of a quasar close to SDSS J0927+2943 (z = 0.713),
which is a massive binary / recoiling black hole candidate. The companion
quasar is at a projected distance of 125 h_70^{-1} kpc and exhibits a radial
velocity difference of ~1400 km/s with respect to the known quasar. We discuss
the nature of this peculiar quasar pair and the properties of its environment.
We propose that the overall system is caught in the process of ongoing
structure formation.
