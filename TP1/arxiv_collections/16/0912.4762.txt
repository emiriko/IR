We study transport properties of alkaline-earth atoms governed by the Kondo
Lattice Hamiltonian plus a harmonic confining potential, and suggest simple
dynamical probes of several different regimes of the phase diagram that can be
implemented with current experimental techniques. In particular, we show how
Kondo physics at strong coupling, low density, and in the heavy fermion phase
is manifest in the dipole oscillations of the conduction band upon displacement
of the trap center.
