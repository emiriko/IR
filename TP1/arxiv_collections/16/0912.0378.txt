We report on double-differential inclusive cross-sections of the production
of secondary protons, charged pions, and deuterons, in the interactions with a
5% nuclear interaction length thick stationary lead target, of proton and pion
beams with momentum from +/-3 GeV/c to +/-15 GeV/c. Results are given for
secondary particles with production angles 20 to 125 degrees. Cross-sections on
lead nuclei are compared with cross-sections on beryllium, copper, and tantalum
nuclei.
