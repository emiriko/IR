There is an enormous potential in applying conjugated polymers in novel
organic opto-electronic devices such as light emitting diodes and solar cells.
Although prototypes and first products exist, a comprehensive understanding of
the fundamental processes and energetics involved during photoexcitation is
still lacking and limits further device optimisations. Here we report on a
unique analysis of the excited states involved in charge generation by
photoexcitation. On the model system poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), we
demonstrate the general applicability of our novel approach. From photoemission
spectroscopy of occupied and unoccupied states we determine the transport gap
to 2.6 eV, which we show to be in agreement with the onset of photoconductivity
by spectrally resolved photocurrent measurements. For photogenerated singlet
exciton at the absorption edge, 0.7 eV of excess energy are required to
overcome the binding energy; the intermediate charge transfer state is situated
only 0.3 eV above the singlet exciton. Our results give direct evidence of
energy levels involved in the photogeneration and charge transport within
conjugated polymers.
