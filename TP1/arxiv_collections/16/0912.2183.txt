We theoretically investigate the heating rate and spin flip lifetimes due to
near field noise for atoms trapped close to layered superconducting structures.
In particular, we compare the case of a gold layer deposited above a
superconductor with the case of a bare superconductor. We study a niobium-based
and a YBCO-based chip. For both niobium and YBCO chips at a temperature of 4.2
K, we find that the deposition of the gold layer can have a significant impact
on the heating rate and spin flip lifetime, as a result of the increase of the
near field noise. At a chip temperature of 77 K, this effect is less pronounced
for the YBCO chip.
