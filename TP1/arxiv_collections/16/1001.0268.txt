The Kepler Mission, launched on Mar 6, 2009 was designed with the explicit
capability to detect Earth-size planets in the habitable zone of solar-like
stars using the transit photometry method. Results from just forty-three days
of data along with ground-based follow-up observations have identified five new
transiting planets with measurements of their masses, radii, and orbital
periods. Many aspects of stellar astrophysics also benefit from the unique,
precise, extended and nearly continuous data set for a large number and variety
of stars. Early results for classical variables and eclipsing stars show great
promise. To fully understand the methodology, processes and eventually the
results from the mission, we present the underlying rationale that ultimately
led to the flight and ground system designs used to achieve the exquisite
photometric performance. As an example of the initial photometric results, we
present variability measurements that can be used to distinguish dwarf stars
from red giants.
