We consider the general scenario of an excited level |i> of a quantum system
that can decay via two channels: (i) via a single-quantum jump to an
intermediate, resonant level |bar m>, followed by a second single-quantum jump
to a final level |f>, and (ii) via a two-quantum transition to a final level
|f>. Cascade processes |i> -> |bar m> -> | f> and two-quantum transitions |i>
-> |m> -> |f> compete (in the latter case, |m> can be both a nonresonant as
well as a resonant level). General expressions are derived within second-order
time-dependent perturbation theory, and the cascade contribution is identified.
When the one-quantum decay rates of the virtual states are included into the
complex resonance energies that enter the propagator denominator, it is found
that the second-order decay rate contains the one-quantum decay rate of the
initial state as a lower-order term. For atomic transitions, this implies that
the differential-in-energy two-photon transition rate with complex resonance
energies in the propagator denominators can be used to good accuracy even in
the vicinity of resonance poles.
