We demonstrate that the transient non-autonomous dynamics of a spin torque
nano-oscillator (STNO) under a radio-frequency (rf) driving signal is
qualitatively different from the dynamics described by the Adler model. If the
external rf current $I_{rf}$ is larger than a certain critical value $I_{cr}$
(determined by the STNO bias current and damping) strong oscillations of the
STNO power and phase develop in the transient regime. The frequency of these
oscillations increases with $I_{rf}$ as $\propto\sqrt{I_{rf} - I_{cr}}$ and can
reach several GHz, whereas the damping rate of the oscillations is almost
independent of $I_{rf}$. This oscillatory transient dynamics is caused by the
strong STNO nonlinearity and should be taken into account in most STNO rf
applications.
