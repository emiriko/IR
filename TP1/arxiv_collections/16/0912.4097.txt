For a positive integer $k$ and a non-negative integer $t$ a class of
simplicial complexes, to be denoted by $k$-${\rm CM}_t$, is introduced. This
class generalizes two notions for simplicial complexes: being
$k$-Cohen-Macaulay and $k$-Buchsbaum. In analogy with the Cohen-Macaulay and
Buchsbaum complexes, we give some characterizations of ${\rm CM}_t(=$1-${\rm
CM}_t)$ complexes, in terms of vanishing of some homologies of its links and,
in terms of vanishing of some relative singular homologies of the geometric
realization of the complex and its punctured space. We show that a complex is
$k$-${\rm CM}_t$ if and only if the links of its nonempty faces are $k$-${\rm
CM}_{t-1}$. We prove that for an integer $s\le d$, the $(d-s-1)$-skeleton of a
$(d-1)$-dimensional $k$-${\rm CM}_t$ complex is $(k+s)$-${\rm CM}_t$. This
result generalizes Hibi's result for Cohen-Macaulay complexes and Miyazaki's
result for Buchsbaum complexes.
