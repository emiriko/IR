Based on mutually unbiased measurements, an optimal tomographic scheme for
the multiqutrit states is presented explicitly. Because the reconstruction
process of states based on mutually unbiased states is free of information
waste, we refer to our scheme as the optimal scheme. By optimal we mean that
the number of the required conditional operations reaches the minimum in this
tomographic scheme for the states of qutrit systems. Special attention will be
paid to how those different mutually unbiased measurements are realized; that
is, how to decompose each transformation that connects each mutually unbiased
basis with the standard computational basis. It is found that all those
transformations can be decomposed into several basic implementable single- and
two-qutrit unitary operations. For the three-qutrit system, there exist five
different mutually unbiased-bases structures with different entanglement
properties, so we introduce the concept of physical complexity to minimize the
number of nonlocal operations needed over the five different structures. This
scheme is helpful for experimental scientists to realize the most economical
reconstruction of quantum states in qutrit systems.
