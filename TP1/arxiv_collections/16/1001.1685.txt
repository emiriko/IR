Assessing cognitive load on web search is useful for characterizing search
system features and search tasks with respect to their demands on the
searcher's mental effort. It is also helpful for examining how individual
differences among searchers (e.g. cognitive abilities) affect the search
process. We examined cognitive load from the perspective of primary and
secondary task performance. A controlled web search study was conducted with 48
participants. The primary task performance components were found to be
significantly related to both the objective and the subjective task difficulty.
However, the relationship between objective and subjective task difficulty and
the secondary task performance measures was weaker than expected. The results
indicate that the dual-task approach needs to be used with caution.
