In 1996, Ricardo Ricardo Ma\~n\'e discovered that Mather measures are in fact
the minimizers of a "universal" infinite dimensional linear programming
problem. This fundamental result has many applications, one of the most
important is to the estimates of the generic number of Mather measures.
Ma\~n\'e obtained the first estimation of that sort by using finite dimensional
approximations. Recently, we were able with Gonzalo Contreras to use this
method of finite dimensional approximation in order to solve a conjecture of
John Mather concerning the generic number of Mather measures for families of
Lagrangian systems. In the present paper we obtain finer results in that
direction by applying directly some classical tools of convex analysis to the
infinite dimensional problem. We use a notion of countably rectifiable sets of
finite codimension in Banach (and Frechet) spaces which may deserve independent
interest.
