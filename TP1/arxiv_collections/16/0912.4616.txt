We report on observations of TeV-selected AGN made during the first 5.5
months of observations with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on-board the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi). In total, 28 TeV AGN were selected for
study. The Fermi observations show clear detections of 21 of these TeV-selected
objects. Most can be described with a power law of spectral index harder than
2, with a spectral break generally required to accommodate the TeV
measurements. Evidence for systematic evolution of the gamma-ray spectrum with
redshift is presented and discussed in the context of the EBL.
