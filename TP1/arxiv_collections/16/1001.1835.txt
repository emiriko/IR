Star-forming disc galaxies such as the Milky Way need to accrete $\gsim$ 1
$M_{\odot}$ of gas each year to sustain their star formation. This gas
accretion is likely to come from the cooling of the hot corona, however it is
still not clear how this process can take place. We present simulations
supporting the idea that this cooling and the subsequent accretion are caused
by the passage of cold galactic-fountain clouds through the hot corona. The
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability strips gas from these clouds and the stripped gas
causes coronal gas to condense in the cloud's wake. For likely parameters of
the Galactic corona and of typical fountain clouds we obtain a global accretion
rate of the order of that required to feed the star formation.
