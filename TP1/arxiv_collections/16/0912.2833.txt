A unified approach valid for any wavenumber, frequency, and temperature is
presented for uniform ideal quantum gases allowing for a comprehensive study of
number density and particle-current density response functions. Exact
analytical expressions are obtained for spectral functions in terms of
polylogarithms. Also, particle-number and particle-current static
susceptibilities are presented which, for fugacity less than unity,
additionally involve Kummer functions. The wavenumber and temperature dependent
transverse-current static susceptibility is used to show explicitly that
current correlations are of a long range in a Bose-condensed uniform ideal gas
but for bosons above the critical temperature and for Fermi and Boltzmann gases
at all temperatures these correlations are of short range. Contact repulsive
interactions for systems of neutral quantum particles are considered within the
random-phase approximation. The expressions for particle-number and
transverse-current susceptibilities are utilized to discuss the existence or
nonexistence of superfluidity in the systems under consideration.
