New results for the strength of the symmetry energy are presented which
illustrate the complementary aspects encountered in reactions probing nuclear
densities below and above saturation. A systematic study of isotopic effects in
spectator fragmentation was performed at the ALADIN spectrometer with 124Sn
primary and 107Sn and 124La secondary beams of 600 MeV/nucleon incident energy.
The analysis within the Statistical Fragmentation Model shows that the
symmetry-term coefficient entering the liquid-drop description of the emerging
fragments decreases significantly as the multiplicity of fragments and light
particles from the disintegration of the produced spectator systems increases.
Higher densities were probed in the FOPI/LAND study of nucleon and
light-particle flows in central and mid-peripheral collisions of 197Au+197Au
nuclei at 400 MeV/nucleon incident energy. From the comparison of the measured
neutron and hydrogen squeeze-out ratios with predictions of the UrQMD model a
moderately soft symmetry term with a density dependence of the potential term
proportional to (rho/rho_0)^{gamma} with gamma = 0.9 +- 0.3 is favored.
