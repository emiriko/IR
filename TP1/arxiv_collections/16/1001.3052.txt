The Banzhaf power index was introduced in cooperative game theory to measure
the real power of players in a game. The Banzhaf interaction index was then
proposed to measure the interaction degree inside coalitions of players. It was
shown that the power and interaction indexes can be obtained as solutions of a
standard least squares approximation problem for pseudo-Boolean functions.
Considering certain weighted versions of this approximation problem, we define
a class of weighted interaction indexes that generalize the Banzhaf interaction
index. We show that these indexes define a subclass of the family of
probabilistic interaction indexes and study their most important properties.
Finally, we give an interpretation of the Banzhaf and Shapley interaction
indexes as centers of mass of this subclass of interaction indexes.
