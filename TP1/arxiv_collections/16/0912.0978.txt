We report the growth of undoped and Fe (2 and 5 at. percentage) doped
molybdenum oxide thin films on c-plane of sapphire substrate using pulsed laser
ablation. X-ray diffraction results show that the films are oriented in (100)
direction and have monoclinic structure based on MoO2 phase as also supported
by Raman spectroscopy. The x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals chemical
state of Fe is +2, which favors the substitutional occupancy of Fe ion in the
MoO2 matrix. The room temperature resistivity of all the films are very low
(approx.100 microohm-cm). The Fe doped samples show ferromagnetic behavior at
room temperature.
