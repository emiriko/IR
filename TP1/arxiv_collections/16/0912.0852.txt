The most efficient way to pack equally sized spheres isotropically in 3D is
known as the random close packed state, which provides a starting point for
many approximations in physics and engineering. However, the particle size
distribution of a real granular material is never monodisperse. Here we present
a simple but accurate approximation for the random close packing density of
hard spheres of any size distribution, based upon a mapping onto a
one-dimensional problem. To test this theory we performed extensive simulations
for mixtures of elastic spheres with hydrodynamic friction. The simulations
show a general (but weak) dependence of the final (essentially hard sphere)
packing density on fluid viscosity and on particle size, but this can be
eliminated by choosing a specific relation between mass and particle size,
making the random close packed volume fraction well-defined. Our theory agrees
well with the simulations for bidisperse, tridisperse and log-normal
distributions, and correctly reproduces the exact limits for large size ratios.
