We use a many-body rate-equation approach to calculate the thermopower of a
quantum dot in the presence of an exchange interaction. At temperatures much
smaller than the single-particle level spacing, the known quantum jumps
(discontinuities) in the thermopower are split by the exchange interaction. The
origin and nature of the splitting are elucidated with a simple physical
argument based on the nature of the intermediate excited state in the
sequential tunneling approach. We show that this splitting is sensitive to the
number parity of electrons in the dot and the dot's ground-state spin. These
effects are suppressed when cotunneling dominates the electrical and thermal
conductances. We calculate the thermopower in the presence of elastic
cotunneling, and show that some signatures of exchange correlations should
still be observed with current experimental methods. In particular, we propose
a method to determine the strength of the exchange interaction from
measurements of the thermopower.
