We show that if a groupoid graded ring has a certain nonzero ideal property,
then the commutant of the center of the principal component of the ring has the
ideal intersection property, that is it intersects nontrivially every nonzero
ideal of the ring. Furthermore, we show that for skew groupoid algebras with
commutative principal component, the principal component is maximal commutative
if and only if it has the ideal intersection property.
