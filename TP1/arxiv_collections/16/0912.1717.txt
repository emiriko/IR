A systematic and quantitative validation of the K and L shell X-ray
transition probability calculations according to different theoretical methods
has been performed against experimental data. This study is relevant to the
optimization of data libraries used by software systems, namely Monte Carlo
codes, dealing with X-ray fluorescence. The results support the adoption of
transition probabilities calculated according to the Hartree-Fock approach,
which manifest better agreement with experimental measurements than
calculations based on the Hartree-Slater method.
