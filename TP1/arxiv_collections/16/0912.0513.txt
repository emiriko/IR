In this paper, we compare the relative sensitivities of gamma-ray and
neutrino observations to the dark matter annihilation cross section in
leptophilic models such as have been designed to explain PAMELA data. We
investigate whether the high energy neutrino telescope IceCube will be
competitive with current and upcoming searches by gamma-ray telescopes, such as
the Atmospheric Cerenkov Telescopes (ACTs) (HESS, VERITAS and MAGIC), or the
Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope, in detecting or constraining dark matter
particles annihilating in dwarf spheroidal galaxies. We find that after ten
years of observation of the most promising nearby dwarfs, IceCube will have
sensitivity comparable to the current sensitivity of gamma-ray telescopes only
for very heavy (m_X > 7 TeV) or relatively light (m_X < 200 GeV) dark matter
particles which annihilate primarily to mu+mu-. If dark matter particles
annihilate primarily to tau+tau-, IceCube will have superior sensitivity only
for dark matter particle masses below the 200 GeV threshold of current ACTs. If
dark matter annihilations proceed directly to neutrino-antineutrino pairs a
substantial fraction of the time, IceCube will be competitive with gamma-ray
telescopes for a much wider range of dark matter masses.
