We propose a method to directly measure the temperature of a gas of weakly
interacting fermionic atoms loaded into an optical lattice. This technique
relies on Raman spectroscopy and is applicable to experimentally relevant
temperature regimes. Additionally, we show that a similar spectroscopy scheme
can be used to obtain information on the quasiparticle properties and Hubbard
bands of the metallic and Mott-insulating states of interacting fermionic spin
mixtures. These two methods provide experimentalists with novel probes to
accurately characterize fermionic quantum gases confined to optical lattices.
