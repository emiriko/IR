The Mock LISA Data Challenges are a program to demonstrate LISA data-analysis
capabilities and to encourage their development. Each round of challenges
consists of one or more datasets containing simulated instrument noise and
gravitational waves from sources of undisclosed parameters. Participants
analyze the datasets and report best-fit solutions for the source parameters.
Here we present the results of the third challenge, issued in Apr 2008, which
demonstrated the positive recovery of signals from chirping Galactic binaries,
from spinning supermassive--black-hole binaries (with optimal SNRs between ~ 10
and 2000), from simultaneous extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (SNRs of 10-50), from
cosmic-string-cusp bursts (SNRs of 10-100), and from a relatively loud
isotropic background with Omega_gw(f) ~ 10^-11, slightly below the LISA
instrument noise.
