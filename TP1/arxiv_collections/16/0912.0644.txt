The laser induced fluorescence (LIF) spectra A1Sigma ~ b3Pi --> X1Sigma+ of
KCs dimer were recorded in near infrared region by Fourier Transform
Spectrometer with a resolution of 0.03 cm-1. Overall more than 200 LIF spectra
were rotationally assigned to 39K133Cs and 41K133Cs isotopomers yielding with
the uncertainty of 0.003-0.01 cm-1 more than 3400 rovibronic term values of the
strongly mixed singlet A1Sigma+ and triplet b3Pi states. Experimental data
massive starts from the lowest vibrational level v_A=0 of the singlet and
nonuniformly cover the energy range from 10040 to 13250 cm-1 with rotational
quantum numbers J from 7 to 225. Besides of the dominating regular A1Sigma+ ~
b3P Omega=0 interactions the weak and local heterogenous A1S+ ~ b3P Omega=1
perturbations have been discovered and analyzed. Coupled-channel deperturbation
analysis of the experimental 39K133Cs e-parity termvalues of the A1S+ ~ b3P
complex was accomplished in the framework of the phenomenological 4 x 4
Hamiltonian accounting implicitly for regular interactions with the remote
states manifold. The resulting diabatic potential energy curves of the
interacting states and relevant spin-orbit coupling matrix elements defined
analytically by Expanded Morse Oscillators model reproduce 95% of experimental
data field of the 39K133Cs isotopomer with a standard deviation of 0.004 cm-1
which is consistent with the uncertainty of the experiment. Reliability of the
derived parameters was additionally confirmed by a good agreement between the
predicted and experimental termvalues of 41K133Cs isotopomer. Calculated
intensity distributions in the A ~ b --> X LIF progressions are also consistent
with their experimental counterparts.
