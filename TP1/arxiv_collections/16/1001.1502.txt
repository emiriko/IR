The abundance of potassium is derived from X-ray lines observed during flares
by the RESIK instrument on the solar mission CORONAS-F between 3.53 A and 3.57
A. The lines include those emitted by He-like K and Li-like K dielectronic
satellites, which have been synthesized using the CHIANTI atomic code and newly
calculated atomic data. There is good agreement of observed and synthesized
spectra, and the theoretical behavior of the spectra with varying temperature
estimated from the ratio of the two GOES channels is correctly predicted. The
observed fluxes of the He-like K resonance line per unit emission measure gives
log A(K) = 5.86 (on a scale log A(H) = 12), with a total range of a factor 2.9.
This is higher than photospheric abundance estimates by a factor 5.5, a
slightly greater enhancement than for other elements with first ionization
potential (FIP) less than about 10 eV. There is, then, the possibility that
enrichment of low-FIP elements in coronal plasmas depends weakly on the value
of the FIP which for K is extremely low (4.34 eV). Our work also suggests that
fractionation of elements to form the FIP effect occurs in the low chromosphere
rather than higher up, as in some models.
