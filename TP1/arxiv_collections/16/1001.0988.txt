Bloch oscillations (BOs) of polychromatic beams in circularly-curved optical
waveguide arrays are smeared out owing to the dependence of the BO spatial
period on wavelength. Here it is shown that restoring of the self-imaging
property of the array and approximate BOs over relatively broad spectral ranges
can be achieved by insertion of suitable lumped phase slips uniformly applied
across the array.
