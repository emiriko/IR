Slow feature analysis (SFA) is a method for extracting slowly varying
features from a quickly varying multidimensional signal. An open source
Matlab-implementation sfa-tk makes SFA easily useable. We show here that under
certain circumstances, namely when the covariance matrix of the nonlinearly
expanded data does not have full rank, this implementation runs into numerical
instabilities. We propse a modified algorithm based on singular value
decomposition (SVD) which is free of those instabilities even in the case where
the rank of the matrix is only less than 10% of its size. Furthermore we show
that an alternative way of handling the numerical problems is to inject a small
amount of noise into the multidimensional input signal which can restore a
rank-deficient covariance matrix to full rank, however at the price of
modifying the original data and the need for noise parameter tuning.
