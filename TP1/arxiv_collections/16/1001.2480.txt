I report recent results on the kinematics of the inner few hundred parsecs
(pc) around nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN) at a sampling of a few pc to a
few tens of pc, using optical and near-infrared (near-IR) integral field
spectroscopy obtained with the Gemini telescopes. The stellar kinematics of the
hosts - comprised mostly of spiral galaxies - are dominated by circular
rotation in the plane of the galaxy. Inflows with velocities of ~ 50 km/s have
been observed along nuclear spiral arms in (optical) ionized gas emission for
low-luminosity AGN and in (near-IR) molecular gas emission for
higher-luminosity AGN. We have also observed gas rotating in the galaxy plane,
sometimes in compact (few tens of pc) disks which may be fuelling the AGN.
Outflows have been observed mostly in ionized gas emission from the narrow-line
region, whose flux distributions and kinematics frequently correlate with radio
flux distributions. Channel maps along the emission-line profiles reveal
velocities as high as ~ 600 km/s. Mass outflow rates in ionized gas range from
0.01 to 0.001 solar masses per year and are 10-100 times larger than the mass
accretion rates to the AGN, supporting an origin for the bulk of the outflow in
gas from the galaxy plane entrained by a nuclear jet or accretion disk wind.
