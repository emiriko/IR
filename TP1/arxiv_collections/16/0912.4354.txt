We present preliminary results from a multi-wavelength study of a merger
candidate, NGC3801, hosting a young FR I radio galaxy, with a Z-shaped
structure. Analysing archival data from the VLA, we find two HI emission blobs
on either side of the host galaxy, suggesting a 30 kpc sized rotating gas disk
aligned with stellar rotation, but rotating significantly faster than the
stars. Broad, faint, blue-shifted absorption wing and an HI absorption clump
associated with the shocked shell around the eastern lobe are also seen,
possibly due to an jet-driven outflow. While 8.0 um dust and PAH emission, from
Spitzer and near and far UV emission from GALEX is seen on a large scale in an
S-shape, partially coinciding with the HI emission blobs, it reveals a ~2 kpc
radius ring-like, dusty, starforming structure in the nuclear region,
orthogonal to the radio jet axis. Its similarities with Kinematically Decoupled
Core galaxies and other evidences have been argued for a merger origin of this
young, bent jet radio galaxy.
