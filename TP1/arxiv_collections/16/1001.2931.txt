We propose using trace-based assessment of the performance of distributed
file systems (DFS) under transactional IO load. The assessment includes
simulations and experiments using the IO traces. Our experiments suggest that
DFS, and specifically XtreemFS have a good potential to support transactional
IO load in distributed environments: they demonstrate good performance, high
availability and scalability, while at the same time opening the way to TCO
reduction.
