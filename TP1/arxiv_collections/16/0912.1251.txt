The rounding of first order phase transitions by quenched randomness is
stated in a form which is applicable to both classical and quantum systems: The
free energy, as well as the ground state energy, of a spin system on a
$d$-dimensional lattice is continuously differentiable with respect to any
parameter in the Hamiltonian to which some randomness has been added when $d
\leq 2$. This implies absence of jumps in the associated order parameter, e.g.,
the magnetization in case of a random magnetic field. A similar result applies
in cases of continuous symmetry breaking for $d \leq 4$. Some questions
concerning the behavior of related order parameters in such random systems are
discussed.
