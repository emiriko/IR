We introduce a new approach for investigating the weak field limit of vacuum
field equations in $f(R)$ gravity and we find the weak field limit of
$f(R)=R+\mu ^4/R$ gravity. Furthermore, we study the strong gravity regime in
$R+\mu^{4}/R$ model of $f(R)$ gravity. We show the existence of strong
gravitational field in vacuum for such model.
  We find out in the limit $\mu\rightarrow 0$, the weak field limit and the
strong gravitational field can be regarded as a perturbed Schwarzschild metric.
