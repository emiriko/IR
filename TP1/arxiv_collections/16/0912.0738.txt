We have been using Keck laser guide star adaptive optics to monitor the
orbits of ultracool binaries, providing dynamical masses at lower luminosities
and temperatures than previously available and enabling strong tests of
theoretical models. We have identified three specific problems with theory: (1)
We find that model color-magnitude diagrams cannot be reliably used to infer
masses as they do not accurately reproduce the colors of ultracool dwarfs of
known mass. (2) Effective temperatures inferred from evolutionary model radii
are typically inconsistent with temperatures derived from fitting atmospheric
models to observed spectra by 100-300 K. (3) For the only known pair of field
brown dwarfs with a precise mass (3%) and age determination (~25%), the
measured luminosities are ~2-3x higher than predicted by model cooling rates
(i.e., masses inferred from Lbol and age are 20-30% larger than measured). To
make progress in understanding the observed discrepancies, more mass
measurements spanning a wide range of luminosity, temperature, and age are
needed, along with more accurate age determinations (e.g., via
asteroseismology) for primary stars with brown dwarf binary companions. Also,
resolved optical and infrared spectroscopy are needed to measure lithium
depletion and to characterize the atmospheres of binary components in order to
better assess model deficiencies.
