We focus on D-brane models in presence of closed string background fluxes.
These fluxes modify the effective interactions on Dirichlet and Euclidean
branes, in particular inducing fermionic masses. We show how they can create
new non-perturbative superpotential terms in presence of gauge and exotic
instantons in SQCD-like models.
