In an earlier paper we developed a Parton Bubble Model (PBM) for RHIC,
high-energy heavy-ion collisions. PBM was based on a substructure of a ring of
localized bubbles (gluonic hot spots) which initially contain 3-4 partons
composed of almost entirely gluons. The bubbles emitted correlated particles at
kinetic freezeout, leading to a lumpy fireball surface. For a selection of
charged particles (0.8 GeV/c $<$ $p_t$ $<$ 4.0 GeV/c), the PBM reasonably
quantitatively (within a few percent) explained high precision RHIC
experimental correlation analyses in a manner which was consistent with the
small observed HBT source size in this transverse momentum range. We
demonstrated that surface emission from a distributed set of surface sources
(as in the PBM) was necessary to obtain this consistency. In this paper we give
a review of the above comparison to central Au Au collisions. The bubble
formation can be associated with gluonic objects predicted by a Glasma Flux
Tube Model (GFTM) that formed longitudinal flux tubes in the transverse plane
of two colliding sheets of Color Glass Condensate (CGC), which pass through one
another. These sheets create boost invariant flux tubes of longitudinal color
electric and magnetic fields. A blast wave gives the tubes near the surface
transverse flow in the same way it gave transverse flow to the bubbles in the
PBM. In the GFTM the longitudinal color electric and magnetic fields have a
non-zero topological charge density $F \widetilde F$. These fields cause a
local strong CP violation which effects charged particle production coming from
quarks and anti-quarks created in the tube or bubble.
