We introduce the new IR-improved
Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi-Callan-Symanzik (DGLAP-CS) kernels
recently developed by one of us into the HERWIG6.5 to generate a new MC,
HERWIRI1.0(31), for hadron-hadron scattering at high energies. We use MC data
to compare the parton shower generated by the standard DGLAP-CS kernels and
that generated by the new IR-improved DGLAP-CS kernels. The seamless interface
to MC@NLO, MC@NLO/HERWIRI, is illustrated. We show comparisons with FNAL data
and we discuss some possible LHC phenomenology implications.
