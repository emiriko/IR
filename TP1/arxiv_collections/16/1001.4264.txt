We present numerical evidence of a novel propagation mode for superfast
impact ionization fronts in high-voltage Si $p^+$-$n$-$n^+$ structures. In
nonlinear dynamics terms, this mode corresponds to a pulled front propagating
into an unstable state in the regime of nonlocalized initial conditions. Before
the front starts to travel, field-ehanced emission of electrons from deep-level
impurities preionizes initially depleted $n$ base creating spatially nonuniform
free carriers profile. Impact ionization takes place in the whole high-field
region. We find two ionizing fronts that propagate in opposite directions with
velocities up to 10 times higher than the saturated drift velocity.
