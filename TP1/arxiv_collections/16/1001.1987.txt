Magnetohydrodynamic instabilities can be responsible for the formation of
structures with various scales in astrophysical jets. We consider the stability
properties of jets containing both the azimuthal and axial field of subthermal
strength. A magnetic field with complex topology in jets is suggested by
theoretical models and is consistent with recent observations. Stability is
discussed by means of a linear analysis of the ideal magnetohydrodynamic
equations. We argue that in azimuthal and axial magnetic fields the jet is
always unstable to non-axisymmetric perturbations. Stabilization does not occur
even if the strengths of these field components are comparable. If the axial
field is weaker than the azimuthal one, instability occurs for perturbations
with any azimuthal wave number $m$, and the growth rate reaches a saturation
value for low values of $m$. If the axial field is stronger than the toroidal
one, the instability shows for perturbations with relatively high $m$.
