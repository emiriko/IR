Quantum mechanics has enjoyed a multitude of successes since its formulation
in the early twentieth century. At the same time, it has generated puzzles that
persist to this day. These puzzles have inspired a large literature in physics
and philosophy. There are two distinct approaches. One is to assume that
quantum theory is exact, but that the interpretive postulates need
modification, to eliminate apparent contradictions. The second approach is to
assume that quantum mechanics is not exact, but instead is a very accurate
approximation to a deeper level theory, which reconciles the deterministic and
probabilistic aspects. We will focus on this second approach.
