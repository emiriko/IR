Conductance is related to dynamical correlation functions which can be
calculated with \textit{time-dependent} methods. Using boundary conformal field
theory, we relate the conductance tensors of quantum junctions of multiple
wires to static correlation functions in a finite system. We then propose a
general method for determining the conductance through
\textit{time-independent} calculations alone. Applying the method to a
Y-junction of interacting quantum wires, we numerically verify the theoretical
prediction for the conductance of the chiral fixed-point of the Y-junction and
then calculate the thus far unknown conductance of its M fixed point with
time-independent density matrix renormalization group method.
