For matrix analogues of embedded surfaces we define discrete curvatures and
Euler characteristics, and a non-commutative Gauss--Bonnet theorem is shown to
follow. We derive simple expressions for the discrete Gauss curvature in terms
of matrices representing the embedding coordinates, and provide a large class
of explicit examples illustrating the new notions.
