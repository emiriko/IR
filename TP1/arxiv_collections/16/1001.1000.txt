A quantum theory of light propagation in two optical channel waveguides
tunnelling-coupled to a common continuum of modes (such as those of a slab
waveguide) is presented, and classical and quantum interference effects are
investigated. For classical light, the photonic system realizes an optical
analogue of coherent population trapping in the continuum encountered in atomic
physics, where destructive interference between different light leakage
channels leads to the appearance of a trapped state embedded in the continuum.
For nonclassical light, two-photon interference effects are predicted, such as
the tendency of photon pairs to bunch when decaying into the continuum.
