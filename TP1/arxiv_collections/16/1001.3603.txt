We experimentally map the transverse profile of diffraction-limited beams
using photon-number-resolving detectors. We observe strong compression of
diffracted beam profiles for high detected photon number. This effect leads to
higher contrast than a conventional irradiance profile between two Airy
disk-beams separated by the Rayleigh criterion.
