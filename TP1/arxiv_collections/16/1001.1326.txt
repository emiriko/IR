We report on the optical properties of a newly developed site-controlled
InGaAs Dots in GaAs barriers grown in pre-patterned pyramidal recesses by
metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy. The inhomogeneous broadening of excitonic
emission from an ensemble of quantum dots is found to be extremely narrow, with
a standard deviation of 1.19 meV. A dramatic improvement in the spectral purity
of emission lines from individual dots is also reported (18-30 ueV) when
compared to the state-of-the-art for site controlled quantum dots.
