We propose a simple analytical model of a metal-oxide-semiconductor
field-effect transistor with a lateral resonant gate based on the coupled
electromechanical equations, which are self-consistently solved in time. All
charge densities according to the mechanical oscillations are evaluated. The
only input parameters are the physical characteristics of the device. No extra
mathematical parameters are used to fit the experimental results. Theoretical
results are in good agreement with the experimental data in static and dynamic
operation. Our model is comprehensive and may be suitable for any
electromechanical device based on the field-effect transduction.
