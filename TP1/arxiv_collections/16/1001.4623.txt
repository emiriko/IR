We theoretically describe the charge ordering (CO) metal-insulator transition
based on a quasi-one-dimensional extended Hubbard model, and investigate the
finite temperature ($T$) properties across the transition temperature, $T_{\rm
CO}$. In order to calculate $T$ dependence of physical quantities such as the
spin susceptibility and the electrical resistivity, both above and below
$T_{\rm CO}$, a theoretical scheme is developed which combines analytical
methods with numerical calculations. We take advantage of the renormalization
group equations derived from the effective bosonized Hamiltonian, where Lanczos
exact diagonalization data are chosen as initial parameters, while the CO order
parameter at finite-$T$ is determined by quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The
results show that the spin susceptibility does not show a steep singularity at
$T_{\rm CO}$, and it slightly increases compared to the case without CO because
of the suppression of the spin velocity. In contrast, the resistivity exhibits
a sudden increase at $T_{\rm CO}$, below which a characteristic $T$ dependence
is observed. We also compare our results with experiments on molecular
conductors as well as transition metal oxides showing CO.
