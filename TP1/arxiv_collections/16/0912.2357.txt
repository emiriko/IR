We describe a weak value inspired phase amplification technique in a Sagnac
interferometer. We monitor the relative phase between two paths of a slightly
misaligned interferometer by measuring the average position of a split-Gaussian
mode in the dark port. Although we monitor only the dark port, we show that the
signal varies linearly with phase and that we can obtain similar sensitivity to
balanced homodyne detection. We derive the source of the amplification both
with classical wave optics and as an inverse weak value.
