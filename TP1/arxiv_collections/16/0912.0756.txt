We present an analytical, simulation, and experimental-based study of
beamforming Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) systems. We analyze the
performance of beamforming MISO systems taking into account implementation
complexity and effects of imperfect channel estimate, delayed feedback, real
Radio Frequency (RF) hardware, and imperfect timing synchronization. Our
results show that efficient implementation of codebook-based beamforming MISO
systems with good performance is feasible in the presence of channel and
implementation-induced imperfections. As part of our study we develop a
framework for Average Error Vector Magnitude Squared (AEVMS)-based analysis of
beamforming MISO systems which facilitates comparison of analytical,
simulation, and experimental results on the same scale. In addition, AEVMS
allows fair comparison of experimental results obtained from different wireless
testbeds. We derive novel expressions for the AEVMS of beamforming MISO systems
and show how the AEVMS relates to important system characteristics like the
diversity gain, coding gain, and error floor.
