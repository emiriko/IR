When W is a finite Coxeter group of classical type (A, B, or D), noncrossing
partitions associated to W and compatibility of almost positive roots in the
associated root system are known to be modeled by certain planar diagrams. We
show how the classical-type constructions of planar diagrams arise uniformly
from projections of small W-orbits to the Coxeter plane. When the construction
is applied beyond the classical cases, simple criteria are apparent for
noncrossing and for compatibility for W of types H_3 and I_2(m) and less simple
criteria can be found for compatibility in types E_6, F_4 and H_4. Our
construction also explains why simple combinatorial models are elusive in the
larger exceptional types.
