In this note cosmological models coming out of the String Field Theory (SFT)
in application to the Dark Energy are reviewed. A way of constructing solutions
in the case of linear models is outlined, cosmological perturbations and
observational evidences of such models are explored. We explicitly demonstrate
the stability of the system at the linear order in the most typical
configuration.
