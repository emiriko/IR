We reanalyze constraints on the mass spectrum of the chiral fourth generation
fermions and the Higgs bosons for the standard model (SM4) and the two Higgs
doublet model (THDM). We find that the Higgs mass in the SM4 should be larger
than roughly the fourth generation up-type quark mass, while the light CP even
Higgs mass in the THDM can be smaller. Various mass spectra of the fourth
generation fermions and the Higgs bosons are allowed. The phenomenology of the
fourth generation models is still rich.
