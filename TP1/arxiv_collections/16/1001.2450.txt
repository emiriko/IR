We present the Swift observations of the supergiant fast X-ray transient
(SFXT) SAX J1818.6-1703 collected during the most recent outburst, which
occurred on May 6 2009. In particular, we present broad-band spectroscopic and
timing analysis as well as a Swift/XRT light curve that spans more than two
weeks of observations. The broad-band spectral models and length of the
outburst resemble those of the prototype of the SFXT class, XTE J1739-302,
further confirming SAX J1818.6-1703 as a member of this class.
