We summarize our latest observations of the nuclear star cluster in the
central parsec of the Galaxy with the adaptive optics assisted, integral field
spectrograph SINFONI on the ESO/VLT, which result in a total sample of 177 bona
fide early-type stars. We find that most of these Wolf Rayet (WR), O- and B-
stars reside in two strongly warped eccentric (<e> = 0.36+/-0.06) disks between
0.8" and 12" from SgrA*, as well as a central compact concentration (the S-star
cluster) centered on SgrA*. The later type B stars (mK>15) in the radial
interval between 0.8" and 12" seem to be in a more isotropic distribution
outside the disks. We observe a dearth of late-type stars in the central few
arcseconds, which is puzzling. The stellar mass function of the disk stars is
extremely top-heavy with a best fit power law of dN/dm~m^(-0.45+/-0.3). Since
at least the WR/O-stars were formed in situ in a single star formation event ~6
Myrs ago, this mass function probably reflects the initial mass function (IMF).
The mass functions of the S-stars inside 0.8" and of the early-type stars at
distances beyond 12" differ significantly from the disk IMF; they are
compatible with a standard Salpeter/Kroupa IMF (best fit power law of
dN/dm~m^(-2.15+/-0.3).
