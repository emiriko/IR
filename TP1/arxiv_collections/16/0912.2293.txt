Security has become ubiquitous in every domain today as newly emerging
malware pose an ever-increasing perilous threat to systems. Consequently,
honeypots are fast emerging as an indispensible forensic tool for the analysis
of malicious network traffic. Honeypots can be considered to be traps for
hackers and intruders and are generally deployed complimentary to Intrusion
Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) in a network.
They help system administrators perform a rigorous analysis of external and
internal attacks on their networks. They are also used by security firms and
research labs to capture the latest variants of malware. However, honeypots
would serve a slightly different purpose in our proposed system. We intend to
use honeypots for generating and broadcasting instant cures for new and unknown
malware in a network. The cures which will be in the form of on-the-fly
anti-malware signatures would spread in a fashion that is similar to the way
malware spreads across networks. The most striking advantage of implementing
this technology is that an effective initial control can be exercised on
malware. Proposed system would be capable of providing cures for new fatal
viruses which have not yet been discovered by prime security firms of the
world.
