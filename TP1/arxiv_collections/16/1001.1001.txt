I argue that one should attempt to understand the solar chromosphere not only
for its own sake, but also if one is interested in the physics of: the corona;
astrophysical dynamos; space weather; partially ionized plasmas; heliospheric
UV radiation; the transition region. I outline curious observations which I
personally find puzzling and deserving of attention.
