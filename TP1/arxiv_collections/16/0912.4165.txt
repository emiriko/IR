Current mass-loss rate estimates imply that main sequence winds are not
sufficient to strip away the H-rich envelope to yield Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars.
The rich transitional population of Westerlund 1 (Wd 1) provides an ideal
laboratory to observe mass-loss processes throughout the transitional phase of
stellar evolution. An analysis of deep radio continuum observations of Wd 1 is
presented. We detect 18 cluster members. The radio properties of the sample are
diverse, with thermal, non-thermal and composite thermal/non-thermal sources
present. Mass-loss rates are ~10^{-5} solar mass/year across all spectral
types, insufficient to form WRs during a massive star lifetime, and the stars
must undergo a period of enhanced mass loss. The sgB[e] star W9 may provide an
example, with a mass-loss rate an order of magnitude higher than the other
cluster members, and an extended nebula of density ~3 times the current wind.
This structure is reminiscent of luminous blue variables, and one with evidence
of two eras of high, possibly eruptive, mass loss. Three OB supergiants are
detected, implying unusually dense winds. They also may have composite spectra,
suggesting binarity. Spatially resolved nebulae are associated with three of
the four RSGs and three of the six YHGs in the cluster, which are due to
quiescent mass loss rather than outbursts. For some of the cool star winds, the
ionizing source may be a companion star though the cluster radiation density is
sufficiently high to provide the necessary ionizing radiation. Five WR stars
are detected with composite spectra, interpreted as arising in colliding-wind
binaries.
