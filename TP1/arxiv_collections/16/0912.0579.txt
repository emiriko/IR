In this paper, we describe a multidatabase system as 4tiered Client-Server
DBMS architectures. We discuss their functional components and provide an
overview of their performance characteristics. The first component of this
proposed system is a web based interface or Graphical User Interface, which
resides on top of the Client Application Program, the second component of the
system is a client Application program running in an application server, which
resides on top of the Global Database Management System, the third component of
the system is a Global Database Management System and global schema of the
multidatabase system server, which resides on top of the distributed
heterogeneous local component database system servers, and the fourth component
is remote heterogeneous local component database system servers. Transaction
submitted from client interface to a multidatabase system server through an
application server will be decomposed into a set of sub queries and will be
executed at various remote heterogeneous local component database servers and
also in case of information retrieval all sub queries will be composed and will
get back results to the end users.
