We discuss different ways that neutron stars can generate gravitational
waves, describe recent improvements in modelling the relevant scenarios in the
context of improving detector sensitivity, and show how observations are
beginning to test our understanding of fundamental physics. The main purpose of
the discussion is to establish promising science goals for third-generation
ground-based detectors, like the Einstein Telescope, and identify the various
challenges that need to be met if we want to use gravitational-wave data to
probe neutron star physics.
