The polarization observable I^s, a feature exclusive to the acoplanar
kinematics of multi-meson final states produced via linearly polarized photons,
has been measured for the first time. Results for the reaction g p -> p pi0 eta
are presented for incoming photon energies between 970 MeV and 1650 MeV along
with the beam asymmetry I^c. The comparably large asymmetries demonstrate a
high sensitivity of I^s to the dynamics of the reaction. Fits using
Bonn-Gatchina partial wave analysis demonstrate that the new polarization
observables carry significant information on the contributing partial waves.
