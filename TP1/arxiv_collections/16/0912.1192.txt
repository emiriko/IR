The numerical simulation of strongly first-order phase transitions has
remained a notoriously difficult problem even for classical systems due to the
exponentially suppressed (thermal) equilibration in the vicinity of such a
transition. In the absence of efficient update techniques, a common approach to
improve equilibration in Monte Carlo simulations is to broaden the sampled
statistical ensemble beyond the bimodal distribution of the canonical ensemble.
Here we show how a recently developed feedback algorithm can systematically
optimize such broad-histogram ensembles and significantly speed up
equilibration in comparison with other extended ensemble techniques such as
flat-histogram, multicanonical or Wang-Landau sampling. As a prototypical
example of a strong first-order transition we simulate the two-dimensional
Potts model with up to Q=250 different states on large systems. The optimized
histogram develops a distinct multipeak structure, thereby resolving entropic
barriers and their associated phase transitions in the phase coexistence region
such as droplet nucleation and annihilation or droplet-strip transitions for
systems with periodic boundary conditions. We characterize the efficiency of
the optimized histogram sampling by measuring round-trip times tau(N,Q) across
the phase transition for samples of size N spins. While we find power-law
scaling of tau vs. N for small Q \lesssim 50 and N \lesssim 40^2, we observe a
crossover to exponential scaling for larger Q. These results demonstrate that
despite the ensemble optimization broad-histogram simulations cannot fully
eliminate the supercritical slowing down at strongly first-order transitions.
