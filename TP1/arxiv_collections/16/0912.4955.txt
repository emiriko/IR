An eikonalized elastic proton-proton and proton-antiproton scattering
amplitude F(s,t), calculated from QCD as a finite sum of gluon ladders, is
compared with the existing experimental data on the total cross section and the
ratio \rho(s,0)=Re F(s,0)/Im F(s,0) of the real part to the imaginary part of
the forward amplitude. Predictions for the expected LHC energies are given.
