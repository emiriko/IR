We report the discovery and confirmation of Kepler-7b, a transiting planet
with unusually low density. The mass is less than half that of Jupiter, Mp =
0.43 Mj, but the radius is fifty percent larger, Rp = 1.48 Rj. The resulting
density, 0.17 g/cc, is the second lowest reported so far for an extrasolar
planet. The orbital period is fairly long, P = 4.886 days, and the host star is
not much hotter than the Sun, Teff = 6000 K. However, it is more massive and
considerably larger than the sun, Mstar = 1.35 Msun and Rstar = 1.84 Rsun, and
must be near the end of its life on the Main Sequence.
