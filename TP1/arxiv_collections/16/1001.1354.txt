VLA 1.4 GHz (rms noise ~0.012 mJy) and MIPS 24 and 70 micron (rms noise ~0.02
and ~1.7 mJy, respectively) observations covering the 2 square degree COSMOS
field are combined with an extensive multi-wavelength data set to study the
evolution of the IR-radio relation at intermediate and high redshift. With
~4500 sources -- of which ~30% have spectroscopic redshifts -- the current
sample is significantly larger than previous ones used for the same purpose.
Both monochromatic IR/radio flux ratios (q24 & q70), as well as the ratio of
the total IR and the 1.4 GHz luminosity (qTIR) are used as indicators for the
IR/radio properties of star forming galaxies and AGN.
  Using a sample jointly selected at IR and radio wavelengths in order to
reduce selection biases, we provide firm support for previous findings that the
IR-radio relation remains unchanged out to at least z~1.4. Moreover, based on
data from ~150 objects we also find that the local relation likely still holds
at 2.5<z<5. At redshift z<1.4 we observe that radio-quiet AGN populate the
locus of the IR-radio relation in similar numbers as star forming sources. In
our analysis we employ the methods of survival analysis in order to ensure a
statistically sound treatment of flux limits arising from non-detections. We
determine the observed shift in average IR/radio properties of IR- and radio-
selected populations and show that it can reconcile apparently discrepant
measurements presented in the literature. Finally, we also investigate
variations of the IR/radio ratio with IR and radio luminosity and find that it
hardly varies with IR luminosity but is a decreasing function of radio
luminosity.
