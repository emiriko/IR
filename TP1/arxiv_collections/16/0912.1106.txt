In suitable states, the modular group of local algebras associated with
unions of disjoint intervals in chiral conformal quantum field theory acts
geometrically. We translate this result into the setting of boundary conformal
QFT and interpret it as a relation between temperature and acceleration. We
also discuss aspects ("mixing" and "charge splitting") of geometric modular
action for unions of disjoint intervals in the vacuum state.
