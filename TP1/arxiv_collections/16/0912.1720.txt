Dusty protoplanetary disks surrounding young low-mass stars are the
birthplaces of planets. Studies of the evolutionary timescales of such disks
provide important constraints on the timescales of planet formation. Binary
companions, however, can influence circumstellar disk evolution through tidal
interactions. In order to trace protoplanetary disks and their properties in
young binary systems, as well as to study the effect of binarity on
circumstellar disk lifetimes, we have carried out spatially resolved
spectroscopy for several low-mass binaries in the well-known Orion Nebula
Cluster. Br$_{\gamma}$ emission, which we detect in several systems, is used as
a tracer for the presence of an active accretion disk around a binary
component. We find a paucity of actively accreting secondaries, and hence,
evidence that in a binary system it is the lower mass component that disperses
its disk faster.
