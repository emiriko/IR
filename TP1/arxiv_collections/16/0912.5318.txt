We consider the motion of charged particles in the vacuum magnetospheres of
rotating neutron stars with a strong surface magnetic field, B>10^(12) G. The
electrons and positrons falling into the magnetosphere or produced in it are
shown to be captured by the force-free surface EB=0. Using the Dirac-Lorentz
equation, we investigate the dynamics of particle capture and subsequent motion
near the force-free surface. The particle energy far from the force-free
surface has been found to be determined by the balance between the power of the
forces of an accelerating electric field and the intensity of curvature
radiation. When captured, the particles perform adiabatic oscillations along
the magnetic field lines and simultaneously move along the force-free surface.
We have found the oscillation parameters and trajectories of the captured
particles. We have calculated the characteristic capture times and energy
losses of the particles through the emission of both bremsstrahlung and
curvature photons by them. The capture of particles is shown to lead to a
monotonic increase in the thickness of the layer of charged plasma accumulating
near the force-free surface. The time it takes for a vacuum magnetosphere to be
filled with plasma has been estimated.
