Following an extremely interesting idea \cite{R1}, published long ago, the
work function at the outer crust region of a strongly magnetized neutron star
is obtained using relativistic version of Thomas-Fermi type model. In the
present scenario, the work function becomes anisotropic; the longitudinal part
is an increasing function of magnetic field strength, whereas the transverse
part diverges. An approximate estimate of the electron density in the
magnetosphere due to field emission and photo emission current, from the polar
cap region are obtained.
