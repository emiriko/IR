Recently, strong coupling regimes of superconducting qubits or quantum dots
inside a micro-wave circuit cavity and BEC atoms inside an optical cavity were
achieved experimentally. The strong coupling regimes in these systems were
described by the Dicke model. Here, we solve the Dicke model by a $ 1/N $
expansion. In the normal state, we find a $ \sqrt{N} $ behavior of the
collective Rabi splitting. In the superradiant phase, we identify an important
Berry phase term which has dramatic effects on both the ground state and the
excitation spectra of the strongly interacting system. The single photon
excitation spectrum has a low energy quantum phase diffusion mode in {\sl
imaginary time} with a large spectral weight and also a high energy optical
mode with a low spectral weight. The photons are in a number squeezed state
which may have wide applications in high sensitive measurements and quantum
information processing. Comparisons with exact diagonization studies are made.
Possible experimental schemes to realize the superradiant phase are briefly
discussed.
