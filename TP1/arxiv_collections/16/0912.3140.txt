The non-equilibrium transition from a fluid-like state to a disordered
solid-like state, known as the jamming transition, occurs in a wide variety of
physical systems, such as colloidal suspensions and molecular fluids, when the
temperature is lowered or the density increased. Shear stress, as temperature,
favors the fluid-like state, and must be also considered to define the system
'jamming phase diagram' [1-4]. Frictionless athermal systems [1], for instance,
can be described by the zero temperature plane of the jamming diagram in the
temperature, density, stress space. Here we consider the jamming of athermal
frictional systems [8-13] such as granular materials, which are important to a
number of applications from geophysics to industry. At constant volume and
applied shear stress[1, 2], we show that while in absence of friction a system
is either fluid-like or jammed, in the presence of friction a new region in the
density shear-stress plane appears, where new dynamical regimes are found. In
this region a system may slip, or even flow with a steady velocity for a long
time in response to an applied stress, but then eventually jams. Jamming in
non-thermal frictional systems is described here by a phase diagram in the
density, shear-stress and friction space.
