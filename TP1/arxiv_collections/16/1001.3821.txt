Stochastic processes are proposed whose master equations coincide with
classical wave, telegraph, and Klein-Gordon equations. Similar to predecessors
based on the Goldstein-Kac telegraph process, the model describes the motion of
particles with constant speed and transitions between discreet allowed velocity
directions. A new ingredient is that transitions into a given velocity state
depend on spatial derivatives of other states populations, rather than on
populations themselves. This feature requires the sacrifice of the
single-particle character of the model, but allows to imitate the Huygens'
principle and to recover wave equations in arbitrary dimensions.
