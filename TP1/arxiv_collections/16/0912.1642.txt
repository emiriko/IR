We extend the formalism of entanglement renormalization to the study of
boundary critical phenomena. The multi-scale entanglement renormalization
ansatz (MERA), in its scale invariant version, offers a very compact
approximation to quantum critical ground states. Here we show that, by adding a
boundary to the scale invariant MERA, an accurate approximation to the critical
ground state of an infinite chain with a boundary is obtained, from which one
can extract boundary scaling operators and their scaling dimensions. Our
construction, valid for arbitrary critical systems, produces an effective chain
with explicit separation of energy scales that relates to Wilson's RG
formulation of the Kondo problem. We test the approach by studying the quantum
critical Ising model with free and fixed boundary conditions.
