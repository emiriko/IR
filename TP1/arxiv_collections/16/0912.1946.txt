The hierarchy of fermion masses and EW symmetry breaking without elementary
Higgs is studied on the basis of strong gauge field distributions governing the
EW dynamics. The mechanism of symmetry breaking due to quark bilinears
condensation is generalized to the case, when higher field correlators are
present in the EW vacuum. Resulting wave functional yields several minima of
quark bilinears, giving masses of three (or more) generations. Mixing is
suggested to be due to kink solutions of the same wave functional. For a
special form of this mixing ("coherent mixing") a realistic hierarhy of masses
and of CKM coefficients is obtained and arguments in favor of the fourth
generation are given. Possible important role of topological charges for CP
violating phases and small masses of the first generation is stressed.
