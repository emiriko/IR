We investigate the behavior of the light pulse in $Lambda$-type cold atomic
gases with two counterpropagating control lights with equal strength by
directly simulating the dynamic equations and exploring the dispersion
relation. Our analysis shows that, depending on the length $L_0$ of the stored
wave packet and the decay rate $\gamma$ of ground-spin coherence, the recreated
light can behave differently. For long $L_0$ and/or large $\gamma$, a
stationary light pulse is produced, while two propagating light pulses appear
for short $L_0$ and/or small $\gamma$. In the $\gamma \to 0$ limit, the light
always splits into two propagating pulses for sufficiently long time. This
scenario agrees with a recent experiment [Y.-W.Lin, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.
102, 213601(2009)] where two propagating light pulses are generated in
laser-cooled cold atomic ensembles.
