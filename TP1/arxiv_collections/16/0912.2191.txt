The shear ($\eta$) and bulk ($\zeta$) viscosities are calculated in a
quasiparticle relaxation time approximation for a hadron matter described
within the relativistic mean-field based model with scaled hadron masses and
couplings. Comparison with results of other models is presented. We demonstrate
that a small value of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio required for
explaining a large elliptic flow observed at RHIC may be reached in the hadron
phase. Large values of the bulk viscosity are noted in case of the baryon
enriched matter.
