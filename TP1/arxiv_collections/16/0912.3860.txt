We report on a preliminary analysis of the diffuse gamma-ray observations of
local giant molecular clouds Orion A and B with the Large Area Telescope
onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The gamma-ray emission of the
clouds is well explained by hadronic and electromagnetic interactions between
cosmic rays and nuclei in the clouds. In consequence, we obtain the total
masses of the Orion A and B clouds to be (80.6 +/- 7.5 +/- 4.8) x 10^3 Msun and
(39.5 +/- 5.2 +/- 2.6) x 10^3 Msun, respectively, for the distance to the
clouds of 400 pc and the Galactic CR spectrum predicted by GALPROP on the local
observations of CRs. The structure of molecular clouds have been extensively
studied by radio telescopes, especially using the line intensity of CO
molecules (WCO) and a constant conversion factor from Wco to N (H_2) (= Xco).
However, this factor is found to be significantly different for Orion A and B:
1.76 +/- 0.04 +/- 0.02 and 1.27 +/- 0.06 +/- 0.01, respectively.
