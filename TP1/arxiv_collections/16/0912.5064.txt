In a recent paper we have proposed a method to estimate the prompt production
cross section of X(3872) at the Tevatron assuming that this particle is a
loosely bound molecule of a D and a D*bar meson. Under this hypothesis we find
that it is impossible to explain the high prompt production cross section found
by CDF at sigma(X(3872)) \sim 30-70 nb as our theoretical prediction is about
300 times smaller than the measured one. Following our work, Artoisenet and
Braaten, have suggested that final state interactions in the DD*bar system
might be so strong to push the result we obtained for the cross section up to
the experimental value. Relying on their conclusions we show that the
production of another very narrow loosely bound molecule, the X_s=D_s D_s*bar,
could be similarly enhanced. X_s should then be detectable at CDF with a mass
of 4080 MeV and a prompt production cross section of sigma(X_s) \sim 1-3 nb.
