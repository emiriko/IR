The origin and composition of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Ray Events (UHECRs)
are under debate. Here we improve constraints on the source population(s) and
compositions of UHECRs by accounting for UHECR deflections within existing
Galactic magnetic field models (GMFs). We used Monte Carlo simulations for
UHECRs detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory and AGASA in order to determine
their outside-the-Galaxy arrival directions, and compared these with Galactic
and extragalactic sources. The simulations, which used UHECR compositions from
protons to Iron and seven models of the ordered GMF, include uncertainties in
the GMF and a turbulent magnetic field. The correlation between UHECRs and
nearby extended radiogalaxies (Nagar & Matulich 2008) remains valid, even
strengthened, within several GMF models. Both the nearest radiogalaxy CenA, and
the nearest radio-extended BL Lac, CGCG 413-019, are likely sources of multiple
UHECRs. The correlation appears to be linked to the presence of the extended
radio source rather than a tracer of an underlying population. It is possible,
but unlikely, that all UHECRs originate in the nearby radiogalaxy CenA. For
light UHECRs about a third of UHECRs can be "matched" to nearby galaxies with
extended radio jets. The remaining UHECRs could also be explained as
originating in extended radiogalaxies if one has at least one of: a large UHECR
mean free path, a high cluster and/or intergalactic magnetic field, a heavy
composition for two-thirds of the detected UHECRs. Several UHECRs have
trajectories which pass close to Galactic magnetars and/or microquasars.
  If extended radiogalaxies are, or trace, UHECR sources, the most consistent
models for the ordered GMF are the BS-S and BS-A models; the GMF models of Sun
et al. 2008 are acceptable if a dipole component is added.
