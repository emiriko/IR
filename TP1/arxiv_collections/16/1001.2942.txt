Rotation symmetric Boolean functions have important applications in the
design of cryptographic algorithms. In this paper, the Conjecture about
rotation symmetric Boolean functions (RSBFs) of degree 3 proposed by Cusik and
St\u{a}nic\u{a} is proved. As a result, the nonlinearity of such kind of
functions is determined.
