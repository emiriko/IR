Four years of BOOTES-1B GRB follow-up history are summarised for the first
time in the form of a table. The successfully followed events are described
case by case.
  Further, the data are used to show the GRB trigger rate in Spain on a
per-year basis, resulting in an estimate of 18 triggers and about 51 h of
telescope time per year for real time triggers. These numbers grow to about 22
triggers and 77 h per year if we include also the GRBs observable within 2
hours after the trigger.
