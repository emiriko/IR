In the present paper we consider the possibility of observationally testing
Horava gravity at the scale of the Solar System, by considering the classical
tests of general relativity (perihelion precession of the planet Mercury,
deflection of light by the Sun and the radar echo delay) for the
Kehagias-Sfetsos asymptotically flat black hole solution of Horava-Lifshitz
gravity. All these gravitational effects can be fully explained in the
framework of the vacuum solution of Horava gravity, and it is shown that the
analysis of the classical general relativistic tests severely constrain the
free parameter of the solution.
