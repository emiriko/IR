In this paper, a new efficient feature extraction method based on the
adaptive threshold of wavelet package coefficients is presented. This paper
especially deals with the assessment of autonomic nervous system using the
background variation of the signal Heart Rate Variability HRV extracted from
the wavelet package coefficients. The application of a wavelet package
transform allows us to obtain a time-frequency representation of the signal,
which provides better insight in the frequency distribution of the signal with
time. A 6 level decomposition of HRV was achieved with db4 as mother wavelet,
and the above two bands LF and HF were combined in 12 specialized frequencies
sub-bands obtained in wavelet package transform. Features extracted from these
coefficients can efficiently represent the characteristics of the original
signal. ANOVA statistical test is used for the evaluation of proposed
algorithm.
