We consider a N-dot-S junction in the Kondo regime in the limit where the
superconducting gap is much smaller than the Kondo temperature. A
generalization of the floating of the Kondo resonance is proposed and many body
corrections to the average subgap current are calculated. The zero frequency
noise is computed and the Fano factor sticks to the value 10/3 for all voltages
below the gap. Implications for finite frequency noise are briefly discussed.
