We calculate the number and energy densities of a quasi-2D Bose-Einstein gas
constrained within a thin region of infinite extent but of finite width d. The
BEC critical transition temperature then becomes an explicit function of d. We
use this result to construct a model of high-Tc superconductivity in cuprates
with a periodic layered atomic structure. The predicted behavior of the BEC Tc
agrees with recent experimental findings in severely underdoped cuprates.
