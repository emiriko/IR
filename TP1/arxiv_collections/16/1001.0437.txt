Kepler's primary mission is a search for earth-size exoplanets in the
habitable zone of late-type stars using the transit method. To effectively
accomplish this mission, Kepler orbits the Sun and stares nearly continuously
at one field-of-view which was carefully selected to provide an appropriate
density of target stars. The data transmission rates, operational cycles, and
target management requirements implied by this mission design have been
optimized and integrated into a comprehensive plan for science operations. The
commissioning phase completed all critical tasks and accomplished all
objectives within a week of the pre-launch plan. Since starting science, the
nominal data collection timeline has been interrupted by two safemode events,
several losses of fine point, and some small pointing adjustments. The most
important anomalies are understood and mitigated, so Kepler's technical
performance metrics have improved significantly over this period and the
prognosis for mission success is excellent. The Kepler data archive is
established and hosting data for the science team, guest observers, and public.
The first data sets to become publicly available include the monthly full-frame
images, dropped targets, and individual sources as they are published. Data are
released through the archive on a quarterly basis; the Kepler Results Catalog
will be released annually starting in 2011.
