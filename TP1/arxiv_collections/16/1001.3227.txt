The mass transfer rate in SS Cyg at quiescence, estimated from the observed
luminosity of the hot spot, is log\dotM_tr=16.8+/-0.3. This is safely below the
critical mass transfer rates of log\dotM_crit=18.1 (corresponding to
logT^o_crit=3.88) or log\dotM_crit=17.2 (corresponding to the "revised value of
logT^o_crit=3.65). The mass transfer rate during outbursts is strongly
enhanced.
