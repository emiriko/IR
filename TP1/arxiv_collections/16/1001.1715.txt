A superconducting rod with a magnetic moment on top develops vortices
obtained here through 3D calculations of the Ginzburg-Landau theory. The
inhomogeneity of the applied field brings new properties to the vortex patterns
that vary according to the rod thickness. We find that for thin rods (disks)
the vortex patterns are similar to those obtained in presence of a homogeneous
magnetic field instead because they consist of giant vortex states. For thick
rods novel patterns are obtained as vortices are curve lines in space that exit
through the lateral surface.
