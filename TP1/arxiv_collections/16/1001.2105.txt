We show that exoplanets in the M31 galaxy may be detected with the
pixel-lensing method by using telescopes making high cadence observations of an
ongoing microlensing event. Although the mean mass for detectable exoplanets is
about $2 M_{\rm {J}}$, even small mass exoplanets ($M_{\rm P} < 20 M_{\oplus}$)
can cause significant deviations, which are observable with large telescopes.
We reanalysed the POINT-AGAPE microlensing event PA-99-N2. First, we test the
robustness of the binary lens conclusion for this light curve. Second, we show
that for such long duration and bright microlensing events, the efficiency for
finding planetary-like deviations is strongly enhanced.
