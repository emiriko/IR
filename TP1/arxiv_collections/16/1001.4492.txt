A geometrical invariant for regular asymptotically Euclidean data for the
vacuum Einstein field equations is constructed. This invariant vanishes if and
only if the data correspond to a slice of the Kerr black hole spacetime --thus,
it provides a measure of the non-Kerr-like behavior of generic data. In order
to proceed with the construction of the geometric invariant, we introduce the
notion of approximate Killing spinors.
