We report on effective generation of continuous-wave squeezed light and
second harmonics with a periodically poled MgO:LiNbO$_{\mathrm{3}}$ (PPMgLN)
crystal which enables us to utilize the large nonlinear optical coefficient
$d_{\mathrm{33}}$. We achieved the squeezing level of $-7.60 \pm 0.15$dB at 860
nm by utilizing a subthreshol optical parametric oscillator with a PPMgLN
crystal. We also generated 400 mW of second harmonics at 430 nm from 570 mW of
fundamental waves with 70% of conversion efficiency by using a PPMgLN crystal
inside an external cavity.
