This paper is the next step of an ambitious program to develop conformally
equivariant quantization on supermanifolds. This problem was considered so far
in (super)dimensions 1 and 1|1. We will show that the case of several odd
variables is much more difficult. We consider the supercircle $S^{1|2}$
equipped with the standard contact structure. The conformal Lie superalgebra
$\mathcal{K}(2)$ of contact vector fields on $S^{1|2}$ contains the Lie
superalgebra osp(2|2). We study the spaces of linear differential operators on
the spaces of weighted densities as modules over osp(2|2). We prove that, in
the non-resonant case, the spaces of second order differential operators are
isomorphic to the corresponding spaces of symbols as osp(2|2)-modules. We also
prove that the conformal equivariant quantization map is unique and calculate
its explicit formula.
