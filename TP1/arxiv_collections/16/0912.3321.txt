In the present paper, we study Lotka-Volterra (LV) type operators defined in
finite dimensional simplex. We prove that any LV type operator is a surjection
of the simplex. After, we introduce a new class of LV-type operators, called
$M$LV type. We prove convergence of their trajectories and study certain its
properties. Moreover, we show that such kind of operators have totaly different
behavior than ${\mathbf{f}}$-monotone LV type operators.
