Implicit Regularization is a 4-dimensional regularization initially conceived
to treat ultraviolet divergences. It has been successfully tested in several
instances in the literature, more specifically in those where Dimensional
Regularization does not apply. In the present contribution we extend the method
to handle infrared divergences as well. We show that the essential steps which
rendered Implicit Regularization adequate in the case of ultraviolet
divergences have their counterpart for infrared ones. Moreover we show that a
new scale appears, typically an infrared scale which is completely independent
of the ultraviolet one. Examples are given.
