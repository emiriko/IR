We investigate the angular distribution of photons in the coherent
bremsstrahlung process by high-energy electrons in a periodically deformed
single crystal with a complex base. The formula for the corresponding
differential cross-section is derived for an arbitrary deformation field. The
case is considered in detail when the electron enters into the crystal at small
angles with respect to a crystallographic axis. The results of the numerical
calculations are presented for SiO2 single crystal and Moliere parameterization
of the screened atomic potentials in the case of the deformation field
generated by the acoustic wave of S -type.
