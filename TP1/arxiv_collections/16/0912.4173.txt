One considers linearly thermoelastic composite media, which consist of a
homogeneous matrix containing a statistically homogeneous random set of
ellipsoidal uncoated or coated inclusions. Effective properties (such as
compliance and thermal expansion) as well as the first statistical moments of
stresses in the phases are estimated for the general case of nonhomogeneity of
the thermoelastic inclusion properties. At first, one shortly reproduces both
the basic assumptions and propositions of micromechanics used in most popular
methods, namely: effective field hypothesis, quasi-crystallite approximation,
and the hypothesis of "ellipsoidal symmetry". The explicit new representations
of the effective thermoelastic properties and stress concentration factor are
expressed through some building blocks described by numerical solutions for
both the one and two inclusions inside the infinite medium subjected to both
the homogeneous and inhomogeneous remote loading. The method uses as a
background the new general integral equation proposed in the accompanied paper
and makes it possible to abandon the basic concepts of micromechanics mentioned
above. The results of this abandonment are quantitatively estimated for some
modeled composite reinforced by aligned continously inhomogeneous fibers. Some
new effects are detected that are impossible in the framework of a classical
background of micromechanics.
