Measurement of at least three independent parameters, for example, mass,
radius and spin frequency, of a neutron star is probably the only way to
understand the nature of its supranuclear core matter. Such a measurement is
extremely difficult because of various systematic uncertainties. The lack of
knowledge of several system parameter values gives rise to such systematics.
Low-mass X-ray binaries, which contain neutron stars, provide a number of
methods to constrain the stellar parameters. Joint application of these methods
has a great potential to significantly reduce the systematic uncertainties, and
hence to measure three independent neutron star parameters accurately. Here we
review the methods based on (1) thermonuclear X-ray bursts; (2)
accretion-powered millisecond-period pulsations; (3) kilohertz quasi-periodic
oscillations; (4) broad relativistic iron lines; (5) quiescent emissions; and
(6) binary orbital motions.
