We discuss a self-consistent solution for a fermion coupled to static scalar
field in the form of a kink (domain wall). In particular, we study the case
when the fermion occupies an excited non-zero frequency level in the presence
of the domain wall field. The effect of the domain wall profile distortion is
calculated analytically.
