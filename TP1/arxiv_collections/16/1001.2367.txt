We have performed detailed imaging and analyses of SMA observations in 230
GHz continuum, 12CO (2-1), 13CO (2-1), and C18O (2-1) emission toward B335, a
Bok globule with an embedded Class 0 source (Lbol ~ 1.5 Lsun). We report the
first discover of high-velocity 12CO jets with a size of ~ 900 AU x 1500 AU
along the E-W direction in B335. The estimated mass-loss rate (~ 2.3 x 10^-7
Msun yr^-1) and the momentum flux (~ 3.7 x 10^-5 Msun yr^-1 km s^-1) of the
12CO jets in B335 are one order of magnitude lower than those of other 12CO
jets in more luminous sources such as HH 211 (Lbol ~ 3.6 Lsun) and HH 212 (Lbol
~ 14 Lsun). The weaker jet activity in B335 could be due to the lower active
accretion onto the central protostar. The C18O emission shows a compact (~ 1500
AU) condensation associated with the central protostar, and it likely traces
the protostellar envelope around B335. The envelope exhibits a velocity
gradient from the east (blueshifted) to west (redshifted) that can be
interpreted as an infalling motion. The estimated central stellar mass, the
mass infalling rate, and the accretion luminosity are 0.04 Msun, 6.9 x 10^-6
Msun yr^-1, and 2.1 Lsun, respectively. On the other hand, there is no clear
velocity gradient perpendicular to the outflow axis in the C18O envelope,
suggesting little envelope rotation on a hundred-AU scale. The upper limits of
the rotational velocity and specific angular momentum were estimated to be 0.04
km s^-1 and 7.0 x 10^-5 km s^-1 pc at a radius of 370 AU, respectively. The
specific angular momentum and the inferred Keplerian radius (~ 6 AU) in B335
are 1 - 2 orders of magnitude smaller than those in other more-evolved sources.
Possible scenarios to explain the lower specific angular momentum in B335 are
discussed.
