High flux expansion divertor studies have been carried out in the National
Spherical Torus Experiment using steady-state X-point height variations from 22
to 5-6 cm. Small-ELM H-mode confinement was maintained at all X-point heights.
Divertor flux expansions from 6 to 26-28 were obtained, with associated
reduction in X-point connection length from 5-6 m to 2 m. Peak divertor heat
flux was reduced from 7-8 MW/m$^2$ to 1-2 MW/m$^2$. In low X-point
configuration, outer strike point became nearly detached. Among factors
affecting deposition of parallel heat flux in the divertor, the flux expansion
factor appeared to be dominant
