Many clustering schemes have been proposed for ad hoc networks. A systematic
classification of these clustering schemes enables one to better understand and
make improvements. In mobile ad hoc networks, the movement of the network nodes
may quickly change the topology resulting in the increase of the overhead
message in topology maintenance. Protocols try to keep the number of nodes in a
cluster around a pre-defined threshold to facilitate the optimal operation of
the medium access control protocol. The clusterhead election is invoked
on-demand, and is aimed to reduce the computation and communication costs. A
large variety of approaches for ad hoc clustering have been developed by
researchers which focus on different performance metrics. This paper presents a
survey of different clustering schemes.
