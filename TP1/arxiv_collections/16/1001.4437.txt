We propose a generalized version of context-sensitivity in term rewriting
based on the notion of "forbidden patterns". The basic idea is that a rewrite
step should be forbidden if the redex to be contracted has a certain shape and
appears in a certain context. This shape and context is expressed through
forbidden patterns. In particular we analyze the relationships among this novel
approach and the commonly used notion of context-sensitivity in term rewriting,
as well as the feasibility of rewriting with forbidden patterns from a
computational point of view. The latter feasibility is characterized by
demanding that restricting a rewrite relation yields an improved termination
behaviour while still being powerful enough to compute meaningful results.
Sufficient criteria for both kinds of properties in certain classes of rewrite
systems with forbidden patterns are presented.
