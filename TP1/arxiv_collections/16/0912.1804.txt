We present a method to encode a \textit{dressed} qubit into the product state
of an electron spin localized in quantum dot and its surrounding nuclear spins
via a dressing transformation. In this scheme, the hyperfine coupling and a
portion of nuclear dipole dipole interaction become logic gates, while they are
the sources of decoherence in electron spin qubit proposals. We discuss errors
and corrections for the dressed qubits. Interestingly, the effective
Hamiltonian of nuclear spins is equivalent to a pairing Hamiltonian, which
provides the microscopic mechanism to protect dressed qubits against
decoherence.
