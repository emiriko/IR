We detected the transit of HAT-P-6b at HJD 2454698.3908 +/- 0.0011 and that
of WASP-1b at HJD 2454774.3448 +/- 0.0023. The updated orbital periods of the
planets are 3.852992 +/- 0.000005 days (HAT-P-6b) and 2.519970 +/- 0.000003
days (WASP-1b). There is no indication of any departures from constant orbital
period in these systems.
