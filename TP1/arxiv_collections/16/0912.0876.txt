High purity epitaxial FeSe0.5Te0.5 thin films with different thickness were
grown by Pulsed Laser Ablation on different substrates. By varying the film
thickness, Tc up to 21K were observed, significantly larger than the bulk
value. Structural analyses indicated that the a axis changes significantly with
the film thickness and is linearly related to the Tc. The latter result
indicates the important role of the compressive strain in enhancing Tc. Tc is
also related to both the Fe-(Se,Te) bond length and angle, suggesting the
possibility of further enhancement.
