Magnetic fields are at the heart of the observed stellar activity in
late-type stars, and they are presumably generated by a dynamo mechanism at the
interface layer between the radiative and the convective stellar regions. Since
dynamo models are based on the interaction between differential rotation and
convective motions, the introduction of rotation in the ATON 2.3 stellar code
allows for explorations regarding a physically consistent treatment of magnetic
effects in stellar structure and evolution, even though there are formidable
mathematical and numerical challenges involved. As examples, we present
theoretical estimates for both the local (tau_c) and global (tau_g) convective
turnover times for rotating pre-main sequence solar-type stars, based on
up-to-date input physics for stellar models. Our theoretical predictions are
compared with the previous ones available in the literature. In addition, we
investigate the dependence of the convective turnover time on convection
regimes, the presence of rotation and atmospheric treatment. Those estimates,
this quantities can be used to calculate the Rossby number, Ro, which is
related to the magnetic activity strength in dynamo theories and, at least for
main-sequence stars, shows an observational correlation with stellar activity.
More important, they can also contribute for testing stellar models against
observations. Our theoretical values of tau_c, tau_g and Ro qualitatively agree
with those published by Kim & Demarque (1996). By increasing the convection
efficiency, tau_g decreases for a given mass. FST models show still lower
values. The presence of rotation shifts tau_g towards slightly higher values
when compared with non-rotating models. The use of non-gray boundary conditions
in the models yields values of tau_g smaller than in the gray approximation.
