We present the new open-source spherically-symmetric general-relativistic
(GR) hydrodynamics code GR1D. It is based on the Eulerian formulation of GR
hydrodynamics (GRHD) put forth by Romero-Ibanez-Gourgoulhon and employs
radial-gauge, polar-slicing coordinates in which the 3+1 equations simplify
substantially. We discretize the GRHD equations with a finite-volume scheme,
employing piecewise-parabolic reconstruction and an approximate Riemann solver.
GR1D is intended for the simulation of stellar collapse to neutron stars and
black holes and will also serve as a testbed for modeling technology to be
incorporated in multi-D GR codes. Its GRHD part is coupled to various
finite-temperature microphysical equations of state in tabulated form that we
make available with GR1D. An approximate deleptonization scheme for the
collapse phase and a neutrino-leakage/heating scheme for the postbounce epoch
are included and described. We also derive the equations for effective rotation
in 1D and implement them in GR1D. We present an array of standard test
calculations and also show how simple analytic equations of state in
combination with presupernova models from stellar evolutionary calculations can
be used to study qualitative aspects of black hole formation in failing
rotating core-collapse supernovae. In addition, we present a simulation with
microphysical EOS and neutrino leakage/heating of a failing core-collapse
supernova and black hole formation in a presupernova model of a 40 solar mass
zero-age main-sequence star. We find good agreement on the time of black hole
formation (within 20%) and last stable protoneutron star mass (within 10%) with
predictions from simulations with full Boltzmann neutrino radiation
hydrodynamics.
