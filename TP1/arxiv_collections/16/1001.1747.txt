We report on a series of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of
active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet propagation in realistic models of magnetized
galaxy clusters. We are primarily interested in the details of energy transfer
between jets and the intracluster medium (ICM) to help clarify what role such
flows could have in the reheating of cluster cores. Our simulated jets feature
a range of intermittency behaviors, including intermittent jets that
periodically switch on and off and one model jet that shuts down completely,
naturally creating a relic plume. The ICM into which these jets propagate
incorporates tangled magnetic field geometries and density substructure
designed to mimic some likely features of real galaxy clusters. We find that
our jets are characteristically at least 60% efficient at transferring thermal
energy to the ICM. Irreversible heat energy is not uniformly distributed,
however, instead residing preferentially in regions very near the jet/cocoon
boundaries. While intermittency affects the details of how, when, and where
this energy is deposited, all of our models generically fail to heat the
cluster cores uniformly. Both the detailed density structure and nominally weak
magnetic fields in the ICM play interesting roles in perturbing the flows,
particularly when the jets are non-steady. Still, this perturbation is never
sufficient to isotropize the jet energy deposition, suggesting that some other
ingredient is required for AGN jets to successfully reheat cluster cores.
