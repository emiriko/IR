This paper studies interacting massive particles on the de Sitter background.
It is found that the vacuum acts as an inversely populated medium which is able
to generate stimulated radiation. Without back reaction (not considered in this
paper) this effect leads to the explosion. It is expected that the proposed
"cosmic laser" mechanism depletes the curvature and may help to solve the
cosmological constant problem.
