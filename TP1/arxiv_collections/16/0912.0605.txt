With an orbital period of about 3.078 days, the double-lined spectroscopic
binary HD 48099 is, still now, the only short-period O+O system known in the
Mon OB2 association. Even though an orbital solution has already been derived
for this system, few information are available about the individual stars. We
present, in this paper, the results of a long-term spectroscopic campaign. We
derive a new orbital solution and apply a disentangling method to recover the
mean spectrum of each star. To improve our knowledge concerning both
components, we determine their spectral classifications and their projected
rotational velocities. We also constrain the main stellar parameters of both
stars by using the CMFGEN atmosphere code and provide the wind properties for
the primary star through the study of IUE spectra. This investigation reveals
that HD 48099 is an O5.5 V((f))+O9 V binary with M_1 sin^3 i = 0.70 M_{\sun}
and M_2 sin^3 i = 0.39 M_{\sun}, implying a rather low orbital inclination.
This result, combined with both a large effective temperature and log g,
suggests that the primary star (v sini ~ 91 km s^-1) is actually a fast rotator
with a strongly clumped wind and a nitrogen abundance of about 8 times the
solar value.
