Suppose that even the highest energy cosmic rays (CRs) observed on Earth are
protons accelerated in local Milky Way Galaxy sources, with few if any from
more distant sources. In this paper we treat the problem that supernovae
remnants likely produce protons with energies up to about a PeV, but CRs with
100s of EeV energy are observed. We assume with minimal comment the idea that
`new physics' is at work and we accept that a CR's collision energy at the
Earth exceeds its kinetic energy as it travels through the Galaxy. There is
some evidence that the collision energy-kinetic energy difference has been seen
at the Tevatron and LHC, but it is small enough to attribute to standard
physics. This sets the threshold for energy bifurcation. Based on this
threshold and the CR spectrum endpoint, a formula for collision energy as a
function of kinetic energy is derived. With the function and the observed CR
spectrum we can predict the average spectrum of CR sources. Also we can
estimate the collision energies of proton beams as terrestrial particle
accelerators advance and produce beams with higher kinetic energies.
