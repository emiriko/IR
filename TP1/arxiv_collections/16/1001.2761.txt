We show that any pair of real symmetric tensors $\BGve$ and $\BGm$ can be
realized as the effective electric permittivity and effective magnetic
permeability of a metamaterial at a given fixed frequency. The construction
starts with two extremely low loss metamaterials, with arbitrarily small
microstructure, whose existence is ensured by the work of Bouchitt{\'e} and
Bourel and Bouchitt\'e and Schweizer, one having at the given frequency a
permittivity tensor with exactly one negative eigenvalue, and a positive
permeability tensor, and the other having a positive permittivity tensor, and a
permeability tensor having exactly one negative eigenvalue. To achieve the
desired effective properties these materials are laminated together in a
hierarchical multiple rank laminate structure, with widely separated length
scales, and varying directions of lamination, but with the largest length scale
still much shorter than the wavelengths and attenuation lengths in the
macroscopic effective medium.
