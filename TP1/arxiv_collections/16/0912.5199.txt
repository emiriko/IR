Swimming micro-organisms such as bacteria or spermatozoa are typically found
in dense suspensions, and exhibit collective modes of locomotion qualitatively
different from that displayed by isolated cells. In the dilute limit where
fluid-mediated interactions can be treated rigorously, the long-time
hydrodynamics of a collection of cells result from interactions with many other
cells, and as such typically eludes an analytical approach. Here we consider
the only case where such problem can be treated rigorously analytically, namely
when the cells have spatially confined trajectories, such as the spermatozoa of
some marine invertebrates. We consider two spherical cells swimming, when
isolated, with arbitrary circular trajectories, and derive the long-time
kinematics of their relative locomotion. We show that in the dilute limit where
the cells are much further away than their size, and the size of their circular
motion, a separation of time scale occurs between a fast (intrinsic) swimming
time, and a slow time where hydrodynamic interactions lead to change in the
relative position and orientation of the swimmers. We perform a multiple-scale
analysis and derive the effective dynamical system - of dimension two -
describing the long-time behavior of the pair of cells. We show that the system
displays one type of equilibrium, and two types of rotational equilibrium, all
of which are found to be unstable. A detailed mathematical analysis of the
dynamical systems further allows us to show that only two cell-cell behaviors
are possible in the limit of $t\to\infty$, either the cells are attracted to
each other (possibly monotonically), or they are repelled (possibly
monotonically as well), which we confirm with numerical computations.
