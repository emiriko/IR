We study normalising reduction strategies for infinitary Combinatory
Reduction Systems (iCRSs). We prove that all fair, outermost-fair, and
needed-fair strategies are normalising for orthogonal, fully-extended iCRSs.
These facts properly generalise a number of results on normalising strategies
in first-order infinitary rewriting and provide the first examples of
normalising strategies for infinitary lambda calculus.
