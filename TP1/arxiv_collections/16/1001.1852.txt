We present more than 1000-day long photometry of EY Draconis in BV(RI)C
passbands. The changes in the light curve are caused by the spottedness of the
rotating surface. Modelling of the spotted surface shows that there are two
large active regions present on the star on the opposite hemispheres. The
evolution of the surface patterns suggests a flip-flop phenomenon. Using
Fourier analysis, we detect a rotation period of P_rot=0.45875d, and an
activity cycle with P~350d, similar to the 11-year long cycle of the Sun. This
cycle with its year-long period is the shortest one ever detected on active
stars. Two bright flares are also detected and analysed.
