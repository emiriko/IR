We investigate supersymmetric boundary conditions in both the Bagger-Lambert
and the ABJM theories of interacting membranes. We find boundary conditions
associated to the fivebrane, the ninebrane and the M-theory wave. For the ABJM
theory we are able to understand the enhancement of supersymmetry to produce
the (4,4) supersymmetry of the self-dual string. We also include supersymmetric
boundary conditions on the gauge fields that cancel the classical gauge anomaly
of the Chern-Simons terms.
