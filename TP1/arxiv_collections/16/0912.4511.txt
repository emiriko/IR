The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search recently announced the observation of two
signal events with a 77% confidence level. Although statistically inconclusive,
it is nevertheless suggestive. In this work we present a model-independent
analysis on the implication of a positive signal in dark matter scattering off
nuclei. Assuming the interaction between (scalar, fermion or vector) dark
matter and the standard model induced by unknown new physics at the scale
$\Lambda$, we examine various dimension-6 tree-level induced operators and
constrain them using the current experimental data, e.g. the WMAP data of the
relic abundance, CDMS II direct detection of the spin-independent scattering,
and indirect detection data (Fermi LAT cosmic gamma-ray), etc. Finally, the LHC
reach is also explored.
