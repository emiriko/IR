Impurities, inevitably present in all samples, induce elastic transitions
between quasiparticle states on the contours of constant energy. These
transitions may be seen in Fourier transformed scanning tunneling spectroscopy
experiments, sorted by their momentum transfer. In a superconductor, anomalous
scattering in the pairing channel may be introduced by magnetic field. When a
magnetic field is applied, vortices act as additional sources of scattering.
These additional transition may enhance or suppress the impurity-induced
scattering. We find that the vortex contribution to the transitions is
sensitive to the momentum-space structure of the pairing function. In the
iron-based superconductors there are both electron and hole pockets at
different regions of the Brillouin zone. Scattering processes therefore
represent intrapocket or interpocket transitions, depending on the momentum
transfer in the process. In this work we show that while in a simple s-wave
superconductors all transitions are enhanced by vortex scattering, in an s+-
superconductor only intra-pocket transitions are affected. We suggest this
effect as a probe for the existence of the sign change of the order parameter.
