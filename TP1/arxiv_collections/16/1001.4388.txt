We review the manifestation of the Brout-Englert-Higgs effect in general
relativity interacting with point-like and extended objects (p-branes including
string for p=1 and membrane for p=2), which manifests itself in the appearance
of the brane source in the Einstein equation while the graviton remains
massless (hep-th/0112207, hep-th/0507197 and refs therein), and discuss briefly
its relation and differences with the model for massive spin 2 field proposed
recently by G. t'Hooft in [arXiv:0708.3184 [hep-th]].
