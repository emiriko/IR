We propose a method to realize a $\phi$ Josephson junction by combining
alternating 0 and $\pi$ parts (sub junctions) with an intrinsically
non-sinusoidal current-phase relation (CPR). Conditions for the realization of
the $\phi$ ground state are analyzed. It is shown that taking into account the
non-sinusoidal CPR for a "clean junction with a ferromagnetic (F) barrier, one
can significantly enlarge the domain (regime of suitable F-layer thicknesses)
of the $\phi$ ground state and make the practical realization of $\phi$
Josephson junctions feasible. Such junctions may also have two different stable
solutions, such as 0 and $\pi$, 0 and $\phi$, or $\phi$ and $\pi$.
