In a system of noisy self-propelled particles with interactions that favor
directional alignment, collective motion will appear if the density of
particles increases beyond a certain threshold. In this paper, we argue that
such a threshold may depend also on the profiles of the perturbation in the
particle directions. Specifically, we perform mean-field, linear stability,
perturbative and numerical analyses on an approximated form of the
Fokker-Planck equation describing the system. We find that if an angular
perturbation to an initially homogeneous system is large in magnitude and
highly localized in space, it will be amplified and thus serves as an
indication of the onset of collective motion. Our results also demonstrate that
high particle speed promotes collective motion.
