Nanoscale biosystems are widely used in numerous medical applications. The
approaches for structure and function of the nanomachines that are available in
the cell (natural nanomachines) are discussed. Molecular simulation studies
have been extensively used to study the dynamics of many nanomachines including
ribosome. Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) serve as prototypes for biological channels
such as Aquaporins (AQPs). Recently, extensive investigations have been
performed on the transport of biological nanosystems through CNTs. The results
are utilized as a guide in building a nanomachinary such as nanosyringe for a
needle free drug delivery.
