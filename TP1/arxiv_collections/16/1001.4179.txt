The relative velocity correlation function of pairs of intermediate mass
fragments has been studied for d+Au collitions at 4.4 GeV. Experimental
correlation functions are compared to that obtained by multibody Coulomb
trajectory calculations under the assumption of various decay timees of the
fragmenting system. The combined approach with the empirically modified
intranuclear cascade code followed by the statistical multifragmentation model
was used to generate the starting conditions for these calculations. The
fragment emossion time is found to be less than 40 fm/c.
