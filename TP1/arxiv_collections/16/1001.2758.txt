At the 1927 Solvay conference, three different theories of quantum mechanics
were presented; however, the physicists present failed to reach a consensus.
Today, many fundamental questions about quantum physics remain unanswered. One
of the theories presented at the conference was Louis de Broglie's pilot-wave
dynamics. This work was subsequently neglected in historical accounts; however,
recent studies of de Broglie's original idea have rediscovered a powerful and
original theory. In de Broglie's theory, quantum theory emerges as a special
subset of a wider physics, which allows non-local signals and violation of the
uncertainty principle. Experimental evidence for this new physics might be
found in the cosmological-microwave-background anisotropies and with the
detection of relic particles with exotic new properties predicted by the
theory.
