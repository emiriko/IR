We are developing a purely commensal survey experiment for fast (<5s)
transient radio sources. Short-timescale transients are associated with the
most energetic and brightest single events in the Universe. Our objective is to
cover the enormous volume of transients parameter space made available by
ASKAP, with an unprecedented combination of sensitivity and field of view. Fast
timescale transients open new vistas on the physics of high brightness
temperature emission, extreme states of matter and the physics of strong
gravitational fields. In addition, the detection of extragalactic objects
affords us an entirely new and extremely sensitive probe on the huge reservoir
of baryons present in the IGM. We outline here our approach to the considerable
challenge involved in detecting fast transients, particularly the development
of hardware fast enough to dedisperse and search the ASKAP data stream at or
near real-time rates. Through CRAFT, ASKAP will provide the testbed of many of
the key technologies and survey modes proposed for high time resolution science
with the SKA.
