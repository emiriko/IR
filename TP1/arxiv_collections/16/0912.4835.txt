We demonstrate a new method for locally probing the edge states in the
quantum Hall regime utilizing a side coupled quantum dot positioned at an edge
of a Hall bar. By measuring the tunneling of electrons from the edge states
into the dot, we acquire information on the local electrochemical potential and
electron temperature of the edge states. Furthermore, this method allows us to
observe the spatial modulation of the electrostatic potential at the edge state
due to many-body screening effect.
