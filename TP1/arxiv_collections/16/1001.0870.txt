We examined the variability of three ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) in
the 2003, 110 ks XMM-Newton observation of NGC253. Remarkably, we discovered
ULX1 to be three times more variable than ULX2 in the 0.3--10 keV band, even
though ULX2 is brighter. Indeed, ULX1 exhibits a power density spectrum that is
consistent with the canonical high state or very high/steep power law state,
but not the canonical low state. The 0.3--10 keV emission of ULX1 is
predominantly non-thermal, and may be related to the very high state. We also
fitted the ULX spectra with disc blackbody, slim disc and convolution
Comptonization (SIMPL x DISKBB) models. The brightest ULX spectra are usually
described by a two emission components (disc blackbody + Comptonized
component); however, the SIMPL model results in a single emission component,
and may help determine whether the well known soft excess is a feature of ULX
spectra or an artifact of the two-component model. The SIMPL models were
rejected for ULX3 (and also for the black hole + Wolf-Rayet binary IC10 X-1);
hence, we infer that the observed soft-excesses are genuine features of ULX
emission spectra. We use an extended corona scenario to explain the soft excess
seen in all the highest quality ULX spectra, and provide a mechanism for
stellar mass black holes to exhibit super-Eddington luminosities while
remaining locally sub-Eddington.
