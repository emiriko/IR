We propose a scenario in which Roper octet can mix with a putative
antidecuplet of exotic baryons and predict the properties of its strange
members. We show that 1795 MeV < M_Sigma_{\bar{10}} <1830 MeV and 1900 MeV <
M_Xi_{\bar{10}}<1970 MeV. We also estimate total widths: 10 MeV <
Gamma_\Sigma_{\bar{10}}< 30 MeV} and Gamma_\Xi_{\bar{10}}\sim 10 MeV and
branching ratios for different decay modes.
