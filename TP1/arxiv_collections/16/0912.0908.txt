Covariant density functional theory is used to analyze the evolution of
low-lying M1 strength in superfluid deformed nuclei in the framework of the
self-consistent Relativistic Quasiparticle Random Phase Approximation (RQRPA).
In nuclei with a pronounced neutron excess two scissor modes are found. Besides
the conventional scissor mode, where the deformed proton and neutron
distributions oscillate against each other, a new soft M1 mode is found, where
the deformed neutron skin oscillates in a scissor like motion against a
deformed proton-neutron core.
