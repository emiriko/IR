In order to investigate the metallic state in high-mobility Si-MOS
structures, we have further developed and precised the dipole trap model which
was originally proposed by B.L. Altshuler and D.L. Maslov [Phys. Rev. Lett.\
82, 145 (1999)]. Our additional numerical treatment enables us to drop several
approximations and to introduce a limited spatial depth of the trap states
inside the oxide as well as to include a distribution of trap energies. It
turns out that a pronounced metallic state can be caused by such trap states at
appropriate energies whose behavior is in good agreement with experimental
observations.
