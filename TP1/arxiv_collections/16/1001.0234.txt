We use integral-field and long-slit spectroscopy to study the bright extended
nebulosity discovered in the isolated lenticular galaxy NGC 4460 during a
recent H-alpha survey of nearby galaxies. An analysis of archival SDSS, GALEX,
and HST images indicates that current star formation is entirely concentrated
in the central kiloparsec of the galaxy disc. The observed ionized gas
parameters (morphology, kinematics and ionization state) can be explained by a
gas outflow above the plane of the galaxy caused by a star formation in the
circumnuclear region. Galactic wind parameters in NGC 4460: outflow velocity,
total kinetic energy - are several times smaller comparing with the known
galactic wind in NGC 253, which is explained substantially lower total star
formation rate. We discuss the cause of the star formation processes in NGC
4460 and in two other known isolated S0 and E galaxies of the Local volume: NGC
404 and NGC 855. We provide evidence suggesting that feeding of isolated
galaxies by intergalactic gas on a cosmological time scale is a steady process
without significant variations.
