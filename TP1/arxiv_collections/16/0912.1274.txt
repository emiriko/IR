In lattice QCD, a confining potential for a static quark-antiquark pair can
be computed with the Wilson loop technique. This potential, dominated by a
linear potential at moderate distances, is consistent with the confinement with
a flux tube, an extended and scalar system also directly observable in lattice
QCD. Quantized flux tubes have also been observed in another class of
confinement, the magnetic confinement in type II superconductors. On the other
hand the solution of Schwinger Dyson Equations, say with the Landau gauge
fixing and the truncation of the series of Feynman diagrams, already at the
rainbow level for the self energy and at the ladder level for the Bethe
Salpeter equation, provides a signal of a possible inverse quartic potential in
momentum space derived from one gluon and one ghost exchange, consistent with
confinement. Here we address the successes, difficulties and open problems of
the matching of these two different perspectives of confinement, the
Schwinger-Dyson perspective versus the flux tube perspective.
