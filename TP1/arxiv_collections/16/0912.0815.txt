Clifford indices for semistable vector bundles on a smooth projective curve
of genus at least 4 were defined in a previous paper of the authors. The
present paper studies bundles which compute these Clifford indices. We show
that under certain conditions on the curve all such bundles and their Serre
duals are generated.
