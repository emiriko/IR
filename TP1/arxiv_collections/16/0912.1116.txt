We experimentally study the fluctuations of the work done by an external
Gaussian random force on two different stochastic systems coupled to a thermal
bath: a colloidal particle in an optical trap and an atomic force microscopy
cantilever. We determine the corresponding probability density functions for
different random forcing amplitudes ranging from a small fraction to several
times the amplitude of the thermal noise. In both systems for sufficiently weak
forcing amplitudes the work fluctuations satisfy the usual steady state
fluctuation theorem. As the forcing amplitude drives the system far from
equilibrium, deviations of the fluctuation theorem increase monotonically. The
deviations can be recasted to a single master curve which only depends on the
kind of stochastic external force.
