The model of dark matter is presented where the dark matter is a
\emph{classical} gauge field. A spherical symmetric solution of Yang-Mills
equation is obtained. The asymptotic behavior of the gauge fields and matter
density is investigated. It is shown that the distribution of the matter
density allows us interpret it as the dark matter. The fitting of a typical
rotational curve with the rotational curve created by the spherical solution of
SU(3) Yang-Mills equation is made.
