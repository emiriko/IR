Physical meaning and a duality of concepts of wave function, action
functional, entropy, the Pointing vector, the Einstein tensor and so on can be
disclosed by investigating the state of material systems such as thermodynamic
and gas dynamic systems, systems of charged particles, cosmologic systems and
others. These concepts play a same role in mathematical physics. They are
quantities that specify a state of material systems and also characteristics of
physical fields. The duality of these concepts reveals in the fact that they
can at once be both functionals and state functions or potentials. As
functionals they are defined on nonintegrable manifold (for example, on tangent
one), and as a state function they are defined on integrable manifold (for
example, on cotangent one). The transition from functionals to state functions
dicribes the mechanism of physical structure origination. The properties of
these concepts can be studied by the example of entropy and action. The role of
these concepts in mathematical physics and field theory will be demonstrated.
  Such results have been obtained by using skew-symmetric forms. In addition to
exterior forms, the skew-symmetric forms, which are obtained from differential
equations and, in distinction to exterior forms, are evolutionary ones and are
defined on nonintegrable manifolds, were used.
