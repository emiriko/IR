(Abridged) Classical Be stars occasionally transition from having a gaseous
circumstellar disk (''Be phase'') to a state in which all observational
evidence for the presence of these disks disappears (''normal B-star phase'').
We present one of the most comprehensive spectropolarimetric views to date of
such a transition for two Be stars, pi Aquarii and 60 Cygni. 60 Cyg's disk loss
episode was characterized by a monotonic decrease in emission strength over a
time-scale of 1000 days, consistent with the viscous time-scale of the disk,
assuming alpha is 0.14. pi Aqr's disk loss was episodic in nature and occurred
over a time-scale of 2440 days. An observed time lag between the behavior of
the polarization and H-alpha in both stars indicates the disk clearing
proceeded in an ''inside-out'' manner. We determine the position angle of the
intrinsic polarization to be 166.7 +/- 0.1 degrees for pi Aqr and 107.7 +/- 0.4
degrees for 60 Cyg, and model the observed polarization during the quiescent
diskless phase of each star to determine the interstellar polarization along
the line of sight. Minor outbursts observed during the quiescent phase of each
star shared similar lifetimes as those previously reported for mu Cen,
suggesting that the outbursts represent the injection and subsequent viscous
dissipation of individual blobs of material into the inner circumstellar
environments of these stars. We also observe deviations from the mean intrinsic
polarization position angle during polarization outbursts in each star,
indicating deviations from axisymmetry. We propose that these deviations might
be indicative of the injection (and subsequent circularization) of new blobs
into the inner disk, either in the plane of the bulk of the disk material or in
a slightly inclined (non-coplanar) orbit.
