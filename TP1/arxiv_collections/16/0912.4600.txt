Following the basic prescriptions of the Tsallis' nonextensive relativistic
thermodynamics, we investigate the relevance of nonextensive statistical
effects on the relativistic nuclear and subnuclear equation of state. In this
framework, we study the first order phase transition from hadronic to
quark-gluon plasma phase by requiring the Gibbs conditions on the global
conservation of the electric and the baryon charges. The relevance of small
deviations from the standard extensive statistics is investigated in the
context of intermediate and high energy heavy-ion collisions.
