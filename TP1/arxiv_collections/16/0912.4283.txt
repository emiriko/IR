Cells of human buccal epithelium of 6 male donors were exposed to microwave
radiation (frequency f=36,64 GHz, power density E = 10, 100, and 400 mcW/cm^2).
Exposure time in all experiments was 10 seconds. Heterochromatin was stained by
2% orcein in 45 % acetic acid. The stainability of cells with trypan blue (0,5
%) and indigocarmine (5 mM) after 5 min of staining was investigated.
Irradiation induced chromatin condensation (increase of number of
heterochromatin granules) and increase of membrane permeability to vital dyes
trypan blue and indigocarmine. Isolated human buccal cells had shown the
ability to recover these changes. Number of heterochromatin granules lowered to
initial level after 0,5 hour (E = 10 mcW/cm^2) and 2 hours (E = 100, and 400
mcW/cm^2) after irradiation. Cell plasma membrane permeability recovered a bit
later, in correspondence, after 1 hour and 3 hours after irradiation.
