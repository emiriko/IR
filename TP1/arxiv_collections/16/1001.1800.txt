Finding a new control parameter for magnetic domain wall (DW) motion in
magnetic nanostructures is important in general and in particular for the
spintronics applications. Here, we show that a circularly polarized magnetic
field (CPMF) at GHz frequency (microwave) can efficiently drive a DW to
propagate along a magnetic nanowire. Two motion modes are identified: rigid-DW
propagation at low frequency and oscillatory propagation at high frequency.
Moreover, DW motion under a CPMF is equivalent to the DW motion under a uniform
spin current in the current perpendicular to the plane magnetic configuration
proposed recently by Khvalkovskiy et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 067206 (2009)],
and the CPMF frequency plays the role of the current.
