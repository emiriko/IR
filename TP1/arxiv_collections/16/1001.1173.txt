Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) may be powered by the rotational energy
of a millisecond magnetar. I argue that the GRB-driving magnetars lie at the
high end of the distribution of magnetic field strengths of magnetars. The
field of GRB magnetars decays on timescale of hundreds of years and can power
SGR-like flares up to ~100 times more powerful than the 2004 event of SGR
1806--20. A few of these flares per year may have been observed by {\it BATSE}
and classified as short-duration GRBs. Association of one of these superflares
with a nearby d_L\simless 250 Mpc galaxy and the discovery of a, coincident in
space, 100-year-old GRB afterglow (observed in the radio) will be the
characteristic signature of the magnetar model for GRBs.
