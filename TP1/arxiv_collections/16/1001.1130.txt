In a recent work [10], Poulin and one of us presented a quantum algorithm for
preparing thermal Gibbs states of interacting quantum systems. This algorithm
is based on Grovers's technique for quantum state engineering, and its running
time is dominated by the factor D/Z(\beta), where D and Z(\beta) denote the
dimension of the quantum system and its partition function at inverse
temperature \beta, respectively.
  We present here a modified algorithm and a more detailed analysis of the
errors that arise due to imperfect simulation of Hamiltonian time evolutions
and limited performance of phase estimation (finite accuracy and nonzero
probability of failure). This modfication together with the tighter analysis
allows us to prove a better running time by the effect of these sources of
error on the overall complexity. We think that the ideas underlying of our new
analysis could also be used to prove a better performance of quantum Metropolis
sampling by Temme et al. [12].
