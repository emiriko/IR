A popular theory of self-organized criticality relates driven dissipative
systems to systems with conservation. This theory predicts that the stationary
density of the abelian sandpile model equals the threshold density of the
fixed-energy sandpile. We refute this prediction for a wide variety of
underlying graphs, including the square grid. Driven dissipative sandpiles
continue to evolve even after reaching criticality. This result casts doubt on
the validity of using fixed-energy sandpiles to explore the critical behavior
of the abelian sandpile model at stationarity.
