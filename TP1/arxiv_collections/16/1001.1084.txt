Evidence has been accumulating for the existence of significant intrinsic
non-perturbative five-quark components in various baryons. The inclusion of the
five-quark components gives a natural explanation of the excess of $\bar d$
over $\bar u$, significant quark orbital angular momentum in the proton, the
problematic mass and decay pattern of the lowest $1/2^-$ baryon nonet, etc.. A
breathing mode of $qqq\leftrightarrow qqqq\bar q$ is suggested for the lowest
$1/2^-$ baryon octet. Evidence of a predicted member of the new scheme,
$\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ around 1380 MeV, is introduced.
