Equivariant quantization is a new theory that highlights the role of
symmetries in the relationship between classical and quantum dynamical systems.
These symmetries are also one of the reasons for the recent interest in
quantization of singular spaces, orbifolds, stratified spaces... In this work,
we prove existence of an equivariant quantization for orbifolds. Our
construction combines an appropriate desingularization of any Riemannian
orbifold by a foliated smooth manifold, with the foliated equivariant
quantization that we built in \cite{PoRaWo}. Further, we suggest definitions of
the common geometric objects on orbifolds, which capture the nature of these
spaces and guarantee, together with the properties of the mentioned foliated
resolution, the needed correspondences between singular objects of the orbifold
and the respective foliated objects of its desingularization.
