We present a theory for the formation of a mesa shaped phonon pulse in
superfluid $^4$He. Starting from the hydrodynamic equations of superfluid
helium, we obtain the system of equations which describe the evolution of
strongly anisotropic phonon systems. Such systems can be created
experimentally. The solution of the equations are simple waves, which
correspond to second sound in the moving phonon pulse. Using these exact
solutions, we describe the expansion of phonon pulses in superfluid helium at
zero temperature. This theory gives an explanation for the mesa shape observed
in the measured phonon angular distributions. Almost all dependencies of the
mesa shape on the system parameters can be qualitatively understood.
