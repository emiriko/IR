We prove that, for n=3 and 4, the minimal nonabelian finite factor group of
the outer automorphism group Out F_n of a free group of rank n is the linear
group PSL_n(Z_2) (conjecturally, this may remain true for arbitrary rank n >
2). We also discuss some computational results on low index subgroups of Aut
F_n and Out F_n, for n = 3 and 4, using presentations of these groups.
