Weak scale supersymmetry is a highly motivated extension of the Standard
Model that has a strong degree of support from data. It provides several viable
dark matter candidates: the lightest neutralino (a WIMP), the gravitino, and
the axion/axino supermultiplet. The LHC turn-on is imminent. The discovery of
supersymmetry at the LHC will go a long way towards establishing the nature of
dark matter. I present arguments why mainly axion cold dark matter is a better
fit for supersymmetric models than neutralinos. I also argue that
Yukawa-unified SUSY GUT theories based on SO(10) with mixed axion/axino cold
dark matter are extremely compelling, and present distinctive signatures for
gluino pair production at the LHC.
