Recently proposed experiments consider creating and observing the quantum
superposition of small living organisms. Those proposed experiments are
examined here for feasibility on the basis of results of earlier studies
identifying a boundary separating obligatory classical behavior from quantum
behavior. It appears that the proposed experiments may be expected to succeed
for the case of viruses, but most probably fail for the case of the appreciably
larger organisms that are also considered.
