Taking only the characteristics as absolute, in the spirit of Arnold's
"Geometrical Methods in the Theory of Ordinary Differential Equations"
(Springer, 1988), we give an independent of coordinates formulation of general
variational entropy inequalities for quasilinear equations of first order, that
locally read as Kruzhkov inequalities, in terms of certain "entropy densities",
and in the case of the equation of 2D flat projective structure we get the
expression of the general entropy density from its abstract Rankine-Hugoniot
rule for shocks using the projective geometry of the plane.
