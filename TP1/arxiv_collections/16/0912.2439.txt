The dynamical equations of clarinet-like systems are known to be reducible to
a non-linear iterated map within reasonable approximations. This leads to time
oscillations that are represented by square signals, analogous to the Raman
regime for string instruments. In this article, we study in more detail the
properties of the corresponding non-linear iterations, with emphasis on the
geometrical constructions that can be used to classify the various solutions
(for instance with or without reed beating) as well as on the periodicity
windows that occur within the chaotic region. In particular, we find a regime
where period tripling occurs and examine the conditions for intermittency. We
also show that, while the direct observation of the iteration function does not
reveal much on the oscillation regime of the instrument, the graph of the high
order iterates directly gives visible information on the oscillation regime
(characterization of the number of period doubligs, chaotic behaviour, etc.).
