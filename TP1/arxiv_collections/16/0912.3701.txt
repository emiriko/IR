We review some facts about the representation theory of the Hecke algebra. We
adapt for the Hecke algebra case the approach of Okounkov and Vershik which was
developed for the representation theory of symmetric groups. We justify an
explicit construction of the idempotents in the Hecke algebra in terms of
Jucys-Murphy elements. Ocneanu's traces for these idempotents (which can be
interpreted as q-dimensions of corresponding irreducible representations of
quantum linear groups) are presented.
