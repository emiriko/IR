In this talk I make a review on the theoretical and experimental situation
around the deeply bound kaon clusters, the possible bound kaonic states of
nuclear, rather than atomic nature. At the same time I discuss novel
developments around other kind of bound kaon clusters, which include states of
two mesons and one baryon, with either one or two kaons, and states of a vector
meson and two kaons, which explain naturally the observed properties of the
X(2175) and Y(4260) resonances.
