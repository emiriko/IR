Transiting planet systems offer an unique opportunity to observationally
constrain proposed models of the interiors (radius, composition) and
atmospheres (chemistry, dynamics) of extrasolar planets. The spectacular
successes of ground-based transit surveys (more than 60 transiting systems
known to-date) and the host of multi-wavelength, spectro-photometric follow-up
studies, carried out in particular by HST and Spitzer, have paved the way to
the next generation of transit search projects, which are currently ongoing
(CoRoT, Kepler), or planned. The possibility of detecting and characterizing
transiting Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone of their parent stars
appears tantalizingly close. In this contribution we briefly review the power
of the transit technique for characterization of extrasolar planets, summarize
the state of the art of both ground-based and space-borne transit search
programs, and illustrate how the science of planetary transits fits within the
Blue Dots perspective.
