We review a recent approach to the mean-field limits in neural networks that
takes into account the stochastic nature of input current and the uncertainty
in synaptic coupling. This approach was proved to be a rigorous limit of the
network equations in a general setting, and we express here the results in a
more customary and simpler framework. We propose a heuristic argument to derive
these equations providing a more intuitive understanding of their origin. These
equations are characterized by a strong coupling between the different moments
of the solutions. We analyse the equations, present an algorithm to simulate
the solutions of these mean-field equations, and investigate numerically the
equations. In particular, we build a bridge between these equations and
Sompolinsky and collaborators approach (1988, 1990), and show how the coupling
between the mean and the covariance function deviates from customary
approaches.
