In this paper we consider the supervisory control problem through language
equation solving. The equation solving approach allows to deal with more
general topologies and to find a largest supervisor which can be used as a
reservoir for deriving an optimal controller. We introduce the notions of
solutions under partial controllability and partial observability, and we show
how supervisory control problems with partial controllability and partial
observability can be solved by employing equation solving methods.
