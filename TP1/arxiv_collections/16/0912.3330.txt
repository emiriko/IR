We argue that the time from the onset of infectiousness to infectious
contact, which we call the contact interval, is a better basis for inference in
epidemic data than the generation or serial interval. Since contact intervals
can be right-censored, survival analysis is the natural approach to estimation.
Estimates of the contact interval distribution can be used to estimate R_0 in
both mass-action and network-based models.
