In this work we report electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements in the
semiconducting Ce1-xGdxFe4P12 (x ~ 0.001) filled skutterudite compounds.
Investigation of the temperature (T) dependence of the ESR spectra and
relaxation process suggests, that in the T-interval of 140-160 K, the onset of
a "weak" metal-insulator (M-I) transition takes place due to the increasing
density of thermally activated carriers across the semiconducting gap of ~ 1500
K. In addition, the observed low-T fine and hyperfine structures start to
collapse at ~ 140 K and is completely absent for > 160 K. We claim that the
increasing carrier density is able to trigger the rattling of the Gd3+ ions
which in turn is responsible, via a motional narrowing mechanism, for the
collapse of the ESR spectra.
