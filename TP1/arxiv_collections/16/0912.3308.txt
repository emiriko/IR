In 1996 Chui and Wang proved that the uncertainty constants of scaling and
wavelet functions tend to infinity as smoothness of the wavelets grows for a
broad class of wavelets such as Daubechies wavelets and spline wavelets. We
construct a class of new families of wavelets (quasispline wavelets) whose
uncertainty constants tend to those of the Meyer wavelet function used in
construction.
