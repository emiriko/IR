Through magnetic linear dichroism spectroscopy, the magnetic susceptibility
anisotropy of metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes has been extracted and
found to be 2-4 times greater than values for semiconducting single-walled
carbon nanotubes. This large anisotropy is consistent with our calculations and
can be understood in terms of large orbital paramagnetism of electrons in
metallic nanotubes arising from the Aharonov-Bohm-phase-induced gap opening in
a parallel field. We also compare our values with previous work for
semiconducting nanotubes, which confirm a break from the prediction that the
magnetic susceptibility anisotropy increases linearly with the diameter.
