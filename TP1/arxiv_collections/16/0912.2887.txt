Using a microscopic model for stochastic transport through a single quantum
dot that is modified by the Coulomb interaction of environmental (weakly
coupled) quantum dots, we derive generic properties of the full counting
statistics for multi-stable Markovian transport systems. We study the temporal
crossover from multi-modal to broad uni-modal distributions depending on the
initial mixture, the long-term asymptotics and the divergence of the cumulants
in the limit of a large number of transport branches. Our findings demonstrate
that the counting statistics of a single resonant level may be used to probe
background charge configurations.
