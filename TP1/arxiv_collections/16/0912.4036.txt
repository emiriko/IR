We study the quintessential properties of the Black Hole solutions in a
scalar--tensor theory of gravity with Higgs potential in view of the static and
spherically symmetric line element. In view of our earlier results,
Reissner--Nordstr\"om-like and Schwarzschild Black Hole solutions are derived
with the introduction of a series-expansion method to solve the field equations
without and with Higgs field mass. The physical consequences of the Black Hole
solutions and the solutions obtained in the weak field limit are discussed in
detail by the virtue of the equation-of-state parameter, the scalar-field
excitations and the geodesic motion. The appearance of naked singularities is
also discussed together with the dependence of Black Hole horizons on the field
excitations, which are themselves dependent on pressure terms which effectively
screen the mass terms. A possible connection to flat rotation curves following
the interaction with the scalar field is also presented in the weak field limit
of gravity, together with a discussion of dynamical effects of scalar fields
and pressure terms on mass.
