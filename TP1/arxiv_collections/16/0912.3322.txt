We study spatial symmetry in general ABA-stacked multilayer graphene to
illustrate how electronic spectra at the two valleys are related in a magnetic
field. We show that the lattice of multilayers with an even number of layers,
as well as that of monolayer graphene, satisfy spatial inversion symmetry,
which rigorously guarantees valley degeneracy in the absence of time-reversal
symmetry. A multilayer with an odd number of layers (three or more) lacks
inversion symmetry, but there is another transformation imposing an approximate
valley degeneracy, which arises because the low-energy Hamiltonian consists of
separate monolayerlike and bilayerlike parts. We show that an external
electrostatic potential generally breaks valley degeneracy in a magnetic field,
in a markedly different manner in odd and even multilayers.
