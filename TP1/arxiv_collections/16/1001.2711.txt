We consider the application of the dual parametrization for the case of gluon
GPDs in the nucleon. This provides opportunities for the more flexible modeling
unpolarized gluon GPDs in a nucleon which in particular contain the invaluable
information on the fraction of nucleon spin carried by gluons. We perform the
generalization of Abel transform tomography approach for the case of gluons. We
also discuss the skewness effect in the framework of the dual parametrization.
We strongly suggest to employ the fitting strategies based on the dual
parametrization to extract the information on GPDs from the experimental data.
