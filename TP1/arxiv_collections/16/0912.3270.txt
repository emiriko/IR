I present a brief overview of a variety of computational tools for
supersymmetry calculations, including: spectrum generators, cross section and
branching fraction calculators, low energy constraints, general purpose event
generators, matrix element event generators, SUSY dark matter codes, parameter
extraction codes and Les Houches interface tools.
