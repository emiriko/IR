We present the analysis of high-resolution optical spectroscopic observations
of the zero-age main-sequence O star Herschel 36 spanning six years. This star
is definitely a multiple system, with at least three components detected in its
spectrum. Based on our radial-velocity (RV) study, we propose a picture of a
close massive binary and a more distant companion, most probably in wide orbit
about each other. The orbital solution for the binary, whose components we
identify as O9 V and B0.5 V, is characterized by a period of 1.5415 +/- 0.0006
days. With a spectral type O7.5 V, the third body is the most luminous
component of the system and also presents RV variations with a period close to
498 days. Some possible hypotheses to explain the variability are briefly
addressed and further observations are suggested.
