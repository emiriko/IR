Homogeneous and isotropic closed models are studied in both the Einstein and
the Jordan frame of the second order gravity theory. The normal form of the
dynamical system has periodic solutions for a large set of initial conditions.
This implies that an initially expanding closed isotropic universe may exhibit
oscillatory behavior.
