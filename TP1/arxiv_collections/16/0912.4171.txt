We clarify the difference among potential models so far proposed to explain
mass spectra of heavy-light mesons via transformations of the vacuum. Applying
our idea to QQ-bar quarkonium, we obtain the extra term, 1/r^2 with positive
coefficient, other than non-relativistic potential terms expected for
quarkonium.
