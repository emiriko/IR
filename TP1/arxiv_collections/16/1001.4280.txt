The N-dependence of the non-relativistic bosonic ground state energy is
studied for quantum N-body systems with either Coulomb or Newton interactions.
The Coulomb systems are "bosonic atoms," with their nucleus fixed, and the
Newton systems are "bosonic stars". In either case there exists some third
order polynomial in N such that the ratio of the ground state energy to the
respective polynomial grows monotonically in N. Some applications of these new
monotonicity results are discussed.
