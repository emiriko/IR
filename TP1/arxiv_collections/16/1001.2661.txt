Recent experiments have shown that the striking structure formation in
dewetting films of evaporating colloidal nanoparticle suspensions occurs in an
ultrathin `postcursor' layer that is left behind by a mesoscopic dewetting
front. Various phase change and transport processes occur in the postcursor
layer, that may lead to nanoparticle deposits in the form of labyrinthine,
network or strongly branched `finger' structures. We develop a versatile
dynamical density functional theory to model this system which captures all
these structures and may be employed to investigate the influence of
evaporation/condensation, nanoparticle transport and solute transport in a
differentiated way. We highlight, in particular, the influence of the subtle
interplay of decomposition in the layer and contact line motion on the observed
particle-induced transverse instability of the dewetting front.
