We review some recent progress in our understanding of the lowest-lying
spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 baryon magnetic moments (MMs) in terms of Chiral
Perturbation Theory (ChPT). In particular, we show that at
next-to-leading-order ChPT can describe the MMs of the octet baryons quite
well. We also make predictions for the decuplet MMs at the same chiral order.
Among them, the MMs of the $\Delta^{++}$ and $\Delta^+$ are found to agree well
with data within the experimental uncertainties.
