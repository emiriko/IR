Geometric generalized Mittag-Leffler distributions having the Laplace
transform $\frac{1}{1+\beta\log(1+t^\alpha)},0<\alpha\le 2,\beta>0$ is
introduced and its properties are discussed. Autoregressive processes with
Mittag-Leffler and geometric generalized Mittag-Leffler marginal distributions
are developed. Haubold and Mathai (2000) derived a closed form representation
of the fractional kinetic equation and thermonuclear function in terms of
Mittag-Leffler function. Saxena et al (2002, 2004a,b) extended the result and
derived the solutions of a number of fractional kinetic equations in terms of
generalized Mittag-Leffler functions. These results are useful in explaining
various fundamental laws of physics. Here we develop first-order autoregressive
time series models and the properties are explored. The results have
applications in various areas like astrophysics, space sciences, meteorology,
financial modeling and reliability modeling.
