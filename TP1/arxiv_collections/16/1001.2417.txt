We discuss the usage of ratchet mechanisms to transport a continuous phase in
several micro-fluidic settings. In particular, we study the transport of a
dielectric liquid in a heterogeneous ratchet capacitor that is periodically
switched on and off. The second system consists of drops on a solid substrate
that are transported by different types of harmonic substrate vibrations. We
argue that the latter can be seen as a self-ratcheting process and discuss
analogies between the employed class of thin film equations and Fokker-Planck
equations for transport of discrete objects in a 'particle ratchet'.
