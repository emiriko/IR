We present total and differential cross sections for W b anti-b and
  Z b anti-b production at the CERN Large Hadron Collider including
  Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) QCD corrections and full bottom-quark mass
effects. We discuss the scale uncertainty of the total cross sections due to
the residual renormalization- and factorization-scale dependence of the
truncated perturbative series. We also discuss b-quark mass effects in
kinematic distributions by comparing with a calculation that considers massless
bottom quarks, as implemented in the Monte Carlo program MCFM. The effects of a
non-zero bottom-quark mass (m_b) cannot be neglected in phase-space regions
where the relevant kinematic observable, such as the transverse momentum of the
bottom quarks or the invariant mass of the bottom-quark pair, are of the order
of m_b. Finally, we present the result of a detailed comparison of NLO QCD
predictions for W+b-jet production with one or two jets with Tevatron data.
