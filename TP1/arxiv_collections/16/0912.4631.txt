The positive parity scalar D$_{s0}^*$(2317) and axial-vector D$_{s1}^*$(2460)
charmed strange mesons are generated by coupled-channel dynamics through the
s-wave scattering of Goldstone bosons off the pseudoscalar and vector
D(D$_s$)-meson ground states. The specific masses of these states are obtained
as a consequence of the attraction arising from the Weinberg-Tomozawa
interaction in the chiral Lagrangian. Chiral corrections to order Q$_\chi^2$
are calculated and found to be small. The D$_{s0}^*$(2317) and D$_{s1}^*$(2460)
mesons decay either strongly into the isospin-violating $\pi^0$D$_s$ and
$\pi^0$D$_s^*$ channels or electromagnetically. We show that the $\pi^0$-$\eta$
and (K$^0$D$^+$-K$^+$D$^0$) mixings act constructively to generate strong
widths of the order of 140 keV and emphasize the sensitivity of this value to
the $KD$ component of the states. The one-loop contribution to the radiative
decay amplitudes of scalar and axial-vector states is calculated using the
electromagnetic Lagrangian to chiral order Q$_\chi^2$. We show the importance
of taking into account processes involving light vector mesons explicitly in
the dynamics of electromagnetic decays. The radiative width are sensitive to
both $\eta D_s$ and $KD$ components, hence providing information complementary
to the strong widths on the positive parity $D_s$-meson structure.
