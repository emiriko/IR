In this article we review the foundations and the present status of loop
quantum gravity. It is short and relatively non-technical, the emphasis is on
the ideas, and the flavor of the techniques. In particular, we describe the
kinematical quantization and the implementation of the Hamilton constraint, as
well as the quantum theory of black hole horizons, semiclassical states, and
matter propagation. Spin foam models and loop quantum cosmology are mentioned
only in passing, as these will be covered in separate reviews to be published
alongside this one.
