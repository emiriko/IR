The relation between physical observables measured at LHC and Tevatron and
standard model Higgs pseudo-observables (production cross section and partial
decay widths) is revised by extensively using the notion of the Higgs complex
pole on the second Riemann sheet of the $S $-matrix. The extension of their
definition to higher orders is considered, confronting the problems that arise
when QED(QCD) corrections are included in computing realistic observables.
Numerical results are presented for pseudo-observables related to the standard
model Higgs boson decay and production. The relevance of the result for
exclusion plots of the standard model Higgs boson for high masses (up to $600
$GeV) is discussed. Furthermore, a recipe for the analytical continuation of
Feynman loop integrals from real to complex internal masses and complex
Mandelstam invariants is thoroughly discussed.
