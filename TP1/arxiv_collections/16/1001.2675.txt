Pseudo-Hermitian operators appear in the solution of Maxwell's equations for
stationary non-dispersive media with arbitrary (space-dependent) permittivity
and permeability tensors. We offer an extension of the results in this
direction to certain stationary dispersive media. In particular, we use the WKB
approximation to derive an explicit expression for the planar time-harmonic
solutions of Maxwell's equations in an inhomogeneous dispersive medium and
study the combined affect of inhomogeneity and dispersion.
