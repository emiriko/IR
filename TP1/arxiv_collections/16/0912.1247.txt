Classical novae (CNe) have recently been reported to represent the major
class of supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) in the central area of our neighbouring
galaxy M 31. This paper presents a review of results from recent X-ray
observations of M 31 with XMM-Newton and Chandra. We carried out a dedicated
optical and X-ray monitoring program of CNe and SSSs in the central area of M
31. We discovered the first SSSs in M 31 globular clusters (GCs) and their
connection to the very first discovered CN in a M 31 GC. This result may have
an impact on the CN rate in GCs. Furthermore, in our optical and X-ray
monitoring data we discovered the CN M31N 2007-11a, which shows a very short
SSS phase of 29 - 52 days. Short SSS states (durations < 100 days) of CNe
indicate massive white dwarfs (WDs) that are candidate progenitors of
supernovae type Ia. In the case of M31N 2007-11a, the optical and X-ray light
curves suggest a binary containing a WD with M_WD > 1.0 M_sun. Finally, we
present the discovery of the SSS counterpart of the CN M31N 2006-04a. The X-ray
light curve of M31N 2006-04a shows short-time variability, which might indicate
an orbital period of about 2 hours.
