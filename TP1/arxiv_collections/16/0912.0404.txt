The SIM Lite mission will undertake several planet surveys. One of them, the
Deep Planet Survey, is designed to detect Earth-mass exoplanets in the
habitable zones of nearby main sequence stars. A double blind study has been
conducted to assess the capability of SIM to detect such small planets in a
multi-planet system where several giant planets might be present. One of the
tools which helped in deciding if the detected planets were actual was an orbit
integrator using the publicly available HNBody code so that the orbit solutions
could be analyzed in terms of temporal stability over many orbits. In this
contribution, we describe the implementation of this integrator and analyze the
different blind test solutions. We discuss also the usefulness of this method
given that some planets might be not detected but still affect the overall
stability of the system.
