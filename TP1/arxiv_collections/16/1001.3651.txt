After reviewing the theoretical, phenomenological and experimental
motivations for supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model, we recall that
supersymmetric relics from the Big Bang are expected in models that conserve R
parity. We then discuss possible supersymmetric dark matter candidates,
focusing on the lightest neutralino and the gravitino. In the latter case, the
next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle is expected to be long-lived, and
possible candidates include spartners of the tau lepton, top quark and
neutrino. We then discuss the roles of the renormalization-group equations and
electroweak symmetry breaking in delimiting the supersymmetric parameter space.
We discuss in particular the constrained minimal extension of the Standard
Model (CMSSM), in which the supersymmetry-breaking parameters are assumed to be
universal at the grand unification scale, presenting predictions from a
frequentist analysis of its parameter space. We also discuss astrophysical and
cosmological constraints on gravitino dark matter models, as well as the
parameter space of minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) models in which there are
extra relations between the trilinear and bilinear supersymmetry-breaking
parameters, and between the gravitino and scalar masses. Finally, we discuss
models with non-universal supersymmetry-breaking contributions to Higgs masses,
and models in which the supersymmetry-breaking parameters are universal at some
scale below that of grand unification.
