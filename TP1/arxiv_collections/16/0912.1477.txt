We consider a model for an underpinning of the universe: there are
oscillators at the Planck scale in the background dark energy. Starting from a
coherent array of such oscillators it is possible to get a description from
elementary particles to Black Holes including the usual Hawking-Beckenstein
theory. There is also a description of Gravitation in the above model which
points to a unified description with electromagnetism.
