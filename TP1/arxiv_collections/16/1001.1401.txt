A perceived limitation of evolutionary art and design algorithms is that they
rely on human intervention; the artist selects the most aesthetically pleasing
variants of one generation to produce the next. This paper discusses how
computer generated art and design can become more creatively human-like with
respect to both process and outcome. As an example of a step in this direction,
we present an algorithm that overcomes the above limitation by employing an
automatic fitness function. The goal is to evolve abstract portraits of Darwin,
using our 2nd generation fitness function which rewards genomes that not just
produce a likeness of Darwin but exhibit certain strategies characteristic of
human artists. We note that in human creativity, change is less choosing
amongst randomly generated variants and more capitalizing on the associative
structure of a conceptual network to hone in on a vision. We discuss how to
achieve this fluidity algorithmically.
