Let $F$ denote a field and let $V$ denote a vector space over $F$ with finite
positive dimension. We consider a pair of linear transformations $A:V \to V$
and $A^*:V \to V$ that satisfy the following conditions: (i) each of $A,A^*$ is
diagonalizable; (ii) there exists an ordering $\lbrace V_i\rbrace_{i=0}^d$ of
the eigenspaces of $A$ such that $A^* V_i \subseteq V_{i-1} + V_{i} + V_{i+1}$
for $0 \leq i \leq d$, where $V_{-1}=0$ and $V_{d+1}=0$; (iii) there exists an
ordering $\lbrace V^*_i\rbrace_{i=0}^\delta$ of the eigenspaces of $A^*$ such
that $A V^*_i \subseteq V^*_{i-1} + V^*_{i} + V^*_{i+1}$ for $0 \leq i \leq
\delta$, where $V^*_{-1}=0$ and $V^*_{\delta+1}=0$; (iv) there is no subspace
$W$ of $V$ such that $AW \subseteq W$, $A^* W \subseteq W$, $W \neq 0$, $W \neq
V$. We call such a pair a {\it tridiagonal pair} on $V$. It is known that
$d=\delta$ and for $ 0 \leq i \leq d$ the dimensions of $V_i,V_{d-i},V^*_i,
V^*_{d-i}$ coincide. The pair $A,A^*$ is called {\it sharp} whenever ${\rm dim}
  V_0=1$. It is known that if $F$ is algebraically closed then $A,A^*$ is
sharp. In this paper we classify up to isomorphism the sharp tridiagonal pairs.
As a corollary, we classify up to isomorphism the tridiagonal pairs over an
algebraically closed field. We obtain these classifications by proving the
$\mu$-conjecture.
