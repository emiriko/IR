The properties of RR Lyrae variables make them excellent probes of the
formation and evolution of a stellar population. The mere presence of such
stars necessitates an age greater than ~10 Gyr while their periods and
amplitudes can be used to estimate the metal abundance of the cluster or galaxy
in which they reside. These and other features of RR Lyraes have been used to
study the Local Group late-type spiral galaxy M33. Though these studies are
generally in their infancy, we have established that M33 does indeed harbor RR
Lyraes in its halo and probably also in its disk suggesting that these two
components formed early in the history of M33. The mean metallicity of the halo
RR Lyraes is consistent with that of the halo globular clusters in M33 at
[Fe/H]~-1.3. Little is known about the spatial distribution of the RR Lyraes;
this will require wide-field time-series studies with sufficient photometric
depth to allow both the identification of RR Lyraes and robust period
determination.
