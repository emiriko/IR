The application of the Gardner method for generation of conservation laws to
all the ABS equations is considered. It is shown that all the necessary
information for the application of the Gardner method, namely B\"acklund
transformations and initial conservation laws, follow from the multidimensional
consistency of ABS equations. We also apply the Gardner method to an asymmetric
equation which is not included in the ABS classification. An analog of the
Gardner method for generation of symmetries is developed and applied to
discrete KdV. It can also be applied to all the other ABS equations.
