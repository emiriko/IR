Within the framework of perturbative QCD approach based on $\mathbf{k_T}$
factorization, we investigate the charmless decay mode $B \to K_0^*(1430)\phi$.
Under two different scenarios (S1 and S2) for the description of scalar meson
$K_0^*(1430)$, we explore the branching fractions and related CP asymmetries.
Besides the dominant contributions from the factorizable emission diagrams,
penguin operators in the annihilation diagrams could also provide considerable
contributions. The central values of our predictions are larger than those from
the QCD factorization in both scenarios. Compared with the experimental
measurements of the BaBar collaboration, the result of neutral channel in the
S1 agrees with experimental data, while the result of the charged one is a bit
smaller than the data. In the S2 scenario, although the central value for the
branching fractions of both channels are much larger than the data, the
predictions could agree with the data due to the large uncertainties to the
branching fractions from the hadronic input parameters. The CP asymmetry in the
charged channel is small and not sensitive to CKM angle $\gamma$. With the
accurate data in near future from the various $B$ factories, these predictions
will be under stringent tests.
