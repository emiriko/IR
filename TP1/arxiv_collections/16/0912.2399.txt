The temperature dependence of the pre-edge features in x-ray absorption
spectroscopy is reviewed. Then, the temperature dependence of the pre-edge
structure at the K-edge of titanium in rutile TiO2 is measured at low and room
temperature. The first two peaks grow with temperature. The fact that these two
peaks also correspond to electric quadrupole transitions is explained by a
recently proposed theory.
