- The aim of this paper is to propose a novel Voice On Demand (VoD)
architecture and implementation of an efficient load sharing algorithm to
achieve Quality of Service (QoS). This scheme reduces the transmission cost
from the Centralized Multimedia Sever (CMS) to Proxy Servers (PS) by sharing
the videos among the proxy servers of the Local Proxy Servers Group [LPSG] and
among the neighboring LPSGs, which are interconnected in a ring fashion. This
results in very low request rejection ratio, reduction in transmission time and
cost, reduction of load on the CMS and high QoS for the users. Simulation
results indicate acceptable initial startup latency, reduced transmission cost
and time, load sharing among the proxy servers, among the LPSGs and between the
CMS and the PS.
