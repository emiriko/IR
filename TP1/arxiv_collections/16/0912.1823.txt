We study the formation of a black hole and its subsequent evaporation in a
model employing a minisuperspace approach to loop quantum gravity. In previous
work the static solution was obtained and shown to be singularity-free. Here,
we examine the more realistic dynamical case by generalizing the static case
with help of the Vaidya metric. We track the formation and evolution of trapped
surfaces during collapse and evaporation and examine the buildup of quantum
gravitationally caused stress-energy preventing the formation of a singularity.
