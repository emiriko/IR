Radio galaxies are the only non-blazar AGN detected in the VHE (E > 100 GeV)
band. These objects enable the investigation of the main substructures of the
AGN, in particular the core, the jet and its interaction with the intergalactic
environment. VERITAS observations have included exposures on a number of radio
galaxies. Recently, the discovery by Fermi of GeV emission from the radio
galaxy NGC 1275 triggered VERITAS observations of this source. Results from the
VERITAS observations of radio galaxies and future plans are presented.
