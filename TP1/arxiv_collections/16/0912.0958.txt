Zariski chambers provide a natural decomposition of the big cone of an
algebraic surface into rational locally polyhedral subcones that are
interesting from the point of view of linear series. In the present paper we
present an algorithm that allows to effectively determine Zariski chambers when
the negative curves on the surface are known. We show how the algorithm can be
used to compute the number of chambers on Del Pezzo surfaces.
