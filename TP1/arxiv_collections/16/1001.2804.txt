Magnetic correlations in the paramagnetic phase of CaFe2As2 (T_N=172 K) have
been examined by means of inelastic neutron scattering from 180 K (~ 1.05 T_N)
up to 300 K (~1.8 T_N). Despite the first-order nature of the magnetic
ordering, strong but short-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations are
clearly observed. These correlations, which consist of quasi-elastic scattering
centered at the wavevector Q_{AFM} of the low-temperature AFM structure, are
observed up to the highest measured temperature of 300 K and at high energy
transfer (E> 60 meV). The L dependence of the scattering implies rather weak
interlayer coupling in the tetragonal c-direction corresponding to nearly
two-dimensional fluctuations in the (ab) plane. The spin correlation lengths
within the Fe layer are found to be anisotropic, consistent with underlying
fluctuations of the AFM stripe structure. Similar to the cobalt doped
superconducting BaFe2As2 compounds, these experimental features can be
adequately reproduced by a scattering model that describes short-range
anisotropic spin correlations with overdamped spin dynamics.
