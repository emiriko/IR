Given a class of dark energy models, constraints from one set of cosmic
acceleration observables make predictions for other observables. Here we
present the allowed ranges for the expansion rate H(z), distances D(z), and the
linear growth function G(z) (as well as other, derived growth observables) from
the current combination of cosmological measurements of supernovae, the cosmic
microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the Hubble constant.
With a cosmological constant as the dark energy and assuming near-minimal
neutrino masses, the growth function is already predicted to better than 2%
precision at any redshift, with or without spatial curvature. Direct
measurements of growth that match this precision offer the opportunity to
stringently test and potentially rule out a cosmological constant. While
predictions in the broader class of quintessence models are weaker, it is
remarkable that they are typically within a factor of 2-3 of forecasts for
future space-based supernovae and Planck CMB measurements. In particular,
measurements of growth at any redshift, or the Hubble constant H_0, that exceed
LambdaCDM predictions by substantially more than 2% would rule out not only a
cosmological constant but also the whole quintessence class, with or without
curvature and early dark energy. Barring additional systematic errors hiding in
the data, such a discovery would require more exotic explanations of cosmic
acceleration such as phantom dark energy, dark energy clustering, or
modifications of gravity.
