We show that the effect of principal pivot transform on the nullity values of
the principal submatrices of a given (square) matrix is described by the
symmetric difference operator (for sets). We consider its consequences for
graphs, and in particular generalize the recursive relation of the interlace
polynomial and simplify its proof.
