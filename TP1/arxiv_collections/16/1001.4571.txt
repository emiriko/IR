This paper presents reflections on the validity of a series of mathematical
methods and technical assumptions that are encrusted in macrophysics (related
to gravitational interaction), that seem to have little or no physical
significance. It is interesting to inquire what a change can occur if one
removes some of the traditional assumptions.
