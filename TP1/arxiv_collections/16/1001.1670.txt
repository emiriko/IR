We report here on the recent results of a monitoring campaign we have been
carrying out with Swift/XRT on a sample of four Supergiant Fast X-ray
Transients. The main goal of this large programme (with a net Swift/XRT
exposure of 540 ks, updated to 2009, August, 31) is to address several main
open issues related to this new class of High Mass X-ray Binaries hosting OB
supergiant stars as companions. Here we summarize the most important results
obtained between October 2007 and August 2009.
