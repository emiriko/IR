We develop and modify the Adomian decomposition method (ADecM) to work for a
new type of nonlinear matrix differential equations (MDE's) which arise in
general relativity (GR) and possibly in other applications. The approach
consists in modifying both the ADecM linear operator with highest order
derivative and ADecM polynomials. We specialize in the case of a 4$\times$4
nonlinear MDE along with a scalar one describing stationary cylindrically
symmetric metrics in quadratic 5-dimensional GR, derive some of their
properties using ADecM and construct the \textit{most general unique power
series solutions}. However, because of the constraint imposed on the MDE by the
scalar one, the series solutions terminate in closed forms exhausting all
possible solutions.
