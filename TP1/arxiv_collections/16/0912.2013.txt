This paper presents a general framework for a refined spectral analysis of a
group of isometries acting on a Banach space, which extends the spectral theory
of Arveson. The concept of continuous Arveson spectrum is introduced and the
corresponding spectral subspace is defined. The absolutely continuous and
singular-continuous parts of this spectrum are specified. Conditions are given,
in terms of the transposed action of the group of isometries, which guarantee
that the pure-point and continuous subspaces span the entire Banach space. In
the case of a unitarily implemented group of automorphisms, acting on a
$C^*$-algebra, relations between the continuous spectrum of the automorphisms
and the spectrum of the implementing group of unitaries are found. The group of
spacetime translation automorphisms in quantum field theory is analyzed in
detail. In particular, it is shown that the structure of its continuous
spectrum is relevant to the problem of existence of (infra-)particles in a
given theory.
