The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope
discovered a rapid (about 5 days duration), high-energy (E >100 MeV) gamma-ray
outburst from a source identified with the blazar PKS 1502+106 (OR 103, S3
1502+10, z=1.839) starting on August 05, 2008 and followed by bright and
variable flux over the next few months. Results on the gamma-ray localization
and identification, as well as spectral and temporal behavior during the first
months of the Fermi all-sky survey are reported here in conjunction with a
multi-waveband characterization as a result of one of the first Fermi
multi-frequency campaigns. The campaign included a Swift ToO (followed up by
16-day observations on August 07-22, MJD 54685-54700), VLBA (within the MOJAVE
program), Owens Valley (OVRO) 40m, Effelsberg-100m, Metsahovi-14m, RATAN-600
and Kanata-Hiroshima radio/optical observations. Results from the analysis of
archival observations by INTEGRAL, XMM-Newton and Spitzer space telescopes are
reported for a more complete picture of this new gamma-ray blazar.
