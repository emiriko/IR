The detailed study of the exoplanetary systems HD189733 and HD209458 has
given rise to a wealth of exciting information on the physics of exoplanetary
atmospheres. To further our understanding of the make-up and processes within
these atmospheres we require a larger sample of bright transiting planets. We
have began a project to detect more bright transiting planets in the southern
hemisphere by utilising precision radial-velocity measurements. We have
observed a constrained sample of bright, inactive and metal-rich stars using
the HARPS instrument and here we present the current status of this project,
along with our first discoveries which include a brown dwarf/extreme-Jovian
exoplanet found in the brown dwarf desert region around the star HD191760 and
improved orbits for three other exoplanetary systems HD48265, HD143361 and
HD154672. Finally, we briefly discuss the future of this project and the
current prospects we have for discovering more bright transiting planets.
