We present various relations among Versions A, B and C of the Segal-Bargmann
transform. We get results for the Segal-Bargmann transform associated to a
Coxeter group acting on a finite dimensional Euclidean space. Then analogous
results are shown for the Segal-Bargmann transform of a connected, compact Lie
group for all except one of the identities established in the Coxeter case. A
counterexample is given to show that the remaining identity from the Coxeter
case does not have an analogous identity for the Lie group case. A major result
is that in both contexts the Segal-Bargmann transform for Version C is
determined by that for Version A.
