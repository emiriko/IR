Generalizing supertropical algebras, we present a "layered" structure,
"sorted" by a semiring which permits varying ghost layers, and indicate how it
is more amenable than the "standard" supertropical construction in
factorizations of polynomials, description of varieties, properties of the
resultant, and for mathematical analysis and calculus, in particular with
respect to multiple roots of polynomials. Explicit examples and comparisons are
given for various sorting semirings such as the natural numbers and the
positive rational numbers, and we see how this theory relates to some recent
developments in the tropical literature such as "characteristic 1,"
"analytification," and "hyperfields."
