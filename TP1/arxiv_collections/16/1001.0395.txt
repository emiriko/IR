We compute the finite temperature density response function of
nonrelativistic cold fermions with an isotropic condensate. The pair-breaking
contribution to the response function is evaluated in the limit of small
three-momentum transfers q within an effective theory which exploits series
expansion in powers of small q/p_F, where p_F is the Fermi momentum. The
leading order O(q^2) contribution is universal and depends only on two
fundamental scales, the Fermi energy and the pairing gap. The particle-hole
Landau Fermi-liquid interaction contributes first at the next-to-leading-order
O(q^4). The scattering contribution to the polarization tensor is
nonperturbative (in the above sense) and is evaluated numerically. The spectral
functions of density fluctuations are constructed and the relevance of the q^2
scaling for the pair-breaking neutrino emission from neutron stars is
discussed.
