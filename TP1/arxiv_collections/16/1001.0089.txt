We describe a method to enhance the sensitivity of precision measurements
that takes advantage of a quantum sensor's environment to amplify its response
to weak external perturbations. An individual qubit is used to sense the
dynamics of surrounding ancillary qubits, which are in turn affected by the
external field to be measured. The resulting sensitivity enhancement is
determined by the number of ancillas that are coupled strongly to the sensor
qubit; it does not depend on the exact values of the coupling strengths and is
resilient to many forms of decoherence. The method achieves nearly
Heisenberg-limited precision measurement, using a novel class of entangled
states. We discuss specific applications to improve clock sensitivity using
trapped ions and magnetic sensing based on electronic spins in diamond.
