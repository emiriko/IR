We report new results from CARMA observations of both continuum and HCO+(1-0)
emission at 3.4 mm from W3-SE, a molecular core of intermediate mass, together
with the continuum observations at 1.1 and 0.85/0.45 mm with the SMA and JCMT.
A continuum emission core elongated from SE to NW (~10"), has been observed at
the and further resolved into a double source with the SMA at 1.1 mm, with a
separation of ~4". Together with the measurements from the Spitzer and MSX at
mid-IR, we determined the SED of W3-SE and fit it with a thermal dust emission
model, suggesting the presence of two dust components with different
temperatures. The emission at mm/submm wavelengths is dominated by a major cold
(~41 K) with a mass of ~65 Msun. In addition, there is a weaker hot component
(~400 K) which accounts for emission in the mid-IR, suggesting that a small
fraction of dust has been heated by newly formed stars. We also imaged the
molecular core in the HCO+(1-0) line using CARMA at an angular resolution ~6".
With the CARMA observations, we have verified the presence of a blue-dominated
double peak profile toward this core. The line profile cannot be explained by
infall alone. The broad velocity wings of the line profile suggest that other
kinematics such as outflows within the central 6" of the core likely dominate
the resulting spectrum. The kinematics of the sub-structures of this core
suggest that the molecular gas outside the main component appears to be
dominated by the bipolar outflow originated from the dust core with a dynamical
age of >30000 yr. Our analysis, based on the observations at wavelengths from
mm/submm to mid-IR suggests that the molecular core W3-SE hosts a group of
newly formed young stars and protostars.
