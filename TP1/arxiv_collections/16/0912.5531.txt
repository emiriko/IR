Future ground-based and space-borne interferometric gravitational-wave
detectors may capture between tens and thousands of binary coalescence events
per year. There is a significant and growing body of work on the estimation of
astrophysically relevant parameters, such as masses and spins, from the
gravitational-wave signature of a single event. This paper introduces a robust
Bayesian framework for combining the parameter estimates for multiple events
into a parameter distribution of the underlying event population. The framework
can be readily deployed as a rapid post-processing tool.
