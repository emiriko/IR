Chances of synthesis of transactinide nuclei in cold fusion reactions
(one-neutron-out) reactions using radioactive beams are evaluated. Because
intensities of radioactive beams are in most of the cases significantly lower
than the ones of the stable beams, reactions with the highest radioactive beam
intensities for the particular elements are considered. The results are
compared with the recent ones obtained by Loveland who investigated the same
nuclei.
