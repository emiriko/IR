We first study labeled transition systems with explicit successful
termination. We establish the notions of strong, weak, and branching
bisimulation in terms of boolean matrix theory, introducing thus a novel and
powerful algebraic apparatus. Next we consider Markov reward chains which are
standardly presented in real matrix theory. By interpreting the obtained matrix
conditions for bisimulations in this setting, we automatically obtain the
definitions of strong, weak, and branching bisimulation for Markov reward
chains. The obtained strong and weak bisimulations are shown to coincide with
some existing notions, while the obtained branching bisimulation is new, but
its usefulness is questionable.
