We look for high-amplitude variable young stars in the open clusters and
associations of the Orion Belt. We use public data from the ASAS-3 Photometric
V-band Catalogue of the All Sky Automated Survey, infrared photometry from the
2MASS and IRAS catalogues, proper motions, and the Aladin sky atlas to obtain a
list of the most variable stars in a survey area of side 5 deg centred on the
bright star Alnilam (eps Ori) in the centre of the Orion Belt. We identify 32
highly-variable stars, of which 16 had not been reported to vary before. They
are mostly variable young stars and candidates (16) and background giants (8),
but there are also field cataclysmic variables, contact binaries, and eclipsing
binary candidates. Of the young stars, which typically are active Herbig Ae/Be
and T Tauri stars with Halpha emission and infrared flux excess, we discover
four new variables and confirm the variability status of another two. Some of
them belong to the well known sigma Orionis cluster. Besides, six of the eight
giants are new variables, and three are new periodic variables.
