We present a search for standard model (SM) Higgs boson production using
ppbar collision data at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV, collected with the CDF II detector
and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.8 fb-1. We search for Higgs
bosons produced in all processes with a significant production rate and
decaying to two W bosons. We find no evidence for SM Higgs boson production and
place upper limits at the 95% confidence level on the SM production cross
section (sigma(H)) for values of the Higgs boson mass (m_H) in the range from
110 to 200 GeV. These limits are the most stringent for m_H > 130 GeV and are
1.29 above the predicted value of sigma(H) for mH = 165 GeV.
