Pariser-Parr-Pople (P-P-P) model Hamiltonian has been used extensively over
the years to perform calculations of electronic structure and optical
properties of $\pi$-conjugated systems successfully. In spite of tremendous
successes of \emph{ab initio} theory of electronic structure of large systems,
the P-P-P model continues to be a popular one because of a recent resurgence in
interest in the physics of $\pi$-conjugated polymers, fullerenes and other
carbon based materials. In this paper, we describe a Fortran 90 computer
program developed by us, which uses P-P-P model Hamiltonian to not only solve
Hartree-Fock (HF) equation for closed- and open-shell systems, but also for
performing correlation calculations at the level of single configuration
interactions (SCI) for molecular systems. Moreover, the code is capable of
computing linear optical absorption spectrum at various levels, such as, tight
binding (TB) Hueckel model, HF, SCI, and also of calculating the band structure
using the Hueckel model. The code also allows the user to solve the HF equation
in the presence of finite external electric field, thus, permitting
calculations of quantities such as static polarizabilities and
electro-absorption spectra. We demonstrate the capabilities of our code by
performing calculations of various properties on conjugated systems such as
$trans$-polyacetylene ($t$-PA), poly-\emph{para}-phenylene (PPP),
poly-\emph{para}-phenylene-vinylene (PPV), \textit{oligo}-acenes, and graphene
nanodisks.
