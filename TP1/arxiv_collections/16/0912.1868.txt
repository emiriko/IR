We report on measurements of the cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray emission of
Earth's atmosphere by the Large Area Telescope onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope. The LAT has observed the Earth during its commissioning phase
and with a dedicated Earth-limb following observation in September 2008. These
measurements yielded 6.4 x 10^6 photons with energies >100MeV and ~250hours
total livetime for the highest quality data selection. This allows the study of
the spatial and spectral distributions of these photons with unprecedented
detail. The spectrum of the emission - often referred to as Earth albedo
gamma-ray emission - has a power-law shape up to 500 GeV with spectral index
Gamma = 2.79+-0.06.
