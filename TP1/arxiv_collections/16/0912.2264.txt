Proton-deuteron radiative capture and two- and three-body photodisintegration
of 3He at low energy are described using realistic hadronic dynamics and
including the Coulomb force. The sensitivity of the observables to the
relativistic corrections of one-nucleon electromagnetic current operator is
studied. Significant effects of the relativistic spin-orbit charge are found
for the vector analyzing powers in the proton-deuteron radiative capture and
for the beam-target parallel-antiparallel spin asymmetry in the three-body
photodisintegration of 3He.
