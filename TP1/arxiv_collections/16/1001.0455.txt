We propose a mechanism which allows one to control the transmission of single
electrons through a molecular junction. The principle utilizes the emergence of
transmission sidebands when molecular vibrational modes are coupled to the
electronic state mediating the transmission. We will show that if a
molecule-metal junction is biased just below a molecular resonance one may
induce the transmission of a single electron by externally exciting a
vibrational mode of the molecule. The analysis is quite general but requires
that the molecular orbital does not hybridize strongly with the metallic
states. As an example we perform a density functional theory (DFT) analysis of
a benzene molecule between two Au(111) contacts and show that exciting a
particular vibrational mode can give rise to transmission of a single electron
