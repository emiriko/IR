We generalize the concept of the geometric phase in stochastic kinetics to a
noncyclic evolution. Its application is demonstrated on kinetics of the
Michaelis-Menten reaction. It is shown that the nonperiodic geometric phase is
responsible for the correction to the Michaelis-Menten law when parameters,
such as a substrate concentration, are changing with time. We apply these ideas
to a model of chemical reactions in a bacterial culture of a growing size,
where the geometric correction qualitatively changes the outcome of the
reaction kinetics.
