The feasibility of a next generation neutrino observatory in Europe is being
considered within the LAGUNA design study. To accommodate giant neutrino
detectors and shield them from cosmic rays, a new very large underground
infrastructure is required. Seven potential candidate sites in different parts
of Europe and at several distances from CERN are being studied: Boulby (UK),
Canfranc (Spain), Fr\'ejus (France/Italy), Pyh\"asalmi (Finland),
Polkowice-Sieroszowice (Poland), Slanic (Romania) and Umbria (Italy). The
design study aims at the comprehensive and coordinated technical assessment of
each site, at a coherent cost estimation, and at a prioritization of the sites
within the summer 2010.
