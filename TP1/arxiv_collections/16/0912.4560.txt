In this paper we will determine the NBB bases with respect to standard
ordering of coatoms (resp.atoms) of 123-132-213-avoiding (resp.321-avoiding)
lattices. Using these expression we will calculate the M\"obius numbers of
123-132-213-avoiding lattices and 321-avoiding lattices. These values become
some modification of fibonacci polynomials.
