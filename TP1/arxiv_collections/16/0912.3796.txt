We present the discovery of a bright (J = 13.1 mag) nearby L6 dwarf found in
a search for L-type ultracool subdwarfs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
Data Release 7. SDSS J141624.08+134826.7 exhibits blue near-infrared colors
compared to other optically-typed L6 objects, but its optical and near-infrared
spectra do not show metal-poor features characteristic of known L-type
ultracool subdwarfs. Instead, SDSS J141624.08+134826.7 is probably a nearby
example of the class of L dwarfs with low condensate opacities which exhibit
unusually blue near-infrared colors for a given spectral type. Its deep 1.4 and
1.9 um H2O absorption bands, weak 2.3 um CO feature, strong 0.99 um FeH band,
and shallow optical TiO and CaH bands resemble the spectra of other blue L
dwarfs which are believed to have unusually thin or large-grained cloud
structure. The luminosity of SDSS J141624.08+134826.7 implies that it is either
a high-mass brown dwarf or a low mass star, depending on its age, and its UVW
space motion suggests a thin-disk membership. With a spectrophotometric
distance of 8.4 +/- 1.9 pc, SDSS J141624.08+134826.7 is one of the nearest L
dwarfs to the Sun and is therefore an excellent target for high resolution
imaging, spectroscopic, and astrometric follow-up observations.
