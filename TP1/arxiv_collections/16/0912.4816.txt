Starting from matter lagrangean containing higher order derivative than the
first, we construct the Poincare gauge theory by localising the Poincare
symmetry of the matter theory. The construction is shown to follow the usual
geometric procedure of gravitational coupling, thereby buttressing the
geometric interpretation of the Poincare gauge theory.
