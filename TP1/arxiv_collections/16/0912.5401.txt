We report the observation of a feedback process between the nuclear spins in
a single charged quantum dot and its trion transition, driven by a periodic
sequence of optical pulses. The pulse sequence intersperses off-resonant
ultrafast pulses for coherent electron-spin rotation and resonant narrow-band
optical pumping. The feedback manifests as a hysteretic triangle-like pattern
in the free-induction-decay of the single spin. We present a simple,
quasi-analytic numerical model to describe this observation, indicating that
the feedback process results from the countering effects of optical nuclear
pumping and nuclear spin-diffusion inside the quantum dot. This effect allows
dynamic tuning of the electron Larmor frequency to a value determined by the
pulse timing, potentially allowing more complex coherent control operations.
