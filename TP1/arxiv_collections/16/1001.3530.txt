First-principles calculations through a FLAPW-GGA method for six possible
polymorphs of ruthenium mononitride RuN with various atomic coordination
numbers CNs: cubic zinc blende (ZB) and cooperite PtS-like structures with CNs
= 4; cubic rock-salt (RS), hexagonal WC-like and NiAs-like structures with CNs
= 6 and cubic CsCl-like structure with CN = 8 indicate that the most stable is
ZB structure, which is much more preferable for RuN than the recently reported
RS structure for synthesized RuN samples. The elastic and electronic properties
of ZB-RuN were investigated and discussed in comparison with those for RS-RuN
polymorph.
