We discuss central exclusive production (CEP) of the tensor $\chi_c(2^{+})$
meson in proton-(anti)proton collisions at Tevatron, RHIC and LHC energies. The
amplitude for the process is derived within the $k_t$-factorisation approach.
Differential and total cross sections are calculated for several unintegrated
gluon distributions (UGDFs). We compare exclusive production of all charmonium
states $\chi_c(0^+),\,\chi_c(1^+)$ and $\chi_c(2^+)$. Equally good description
of the recent Tevatron data is achieved both with Martin-Ryskin
phenomenological UGDF and UGDF based on unified BFKL-DGLAP approach. Unlike for
Higgs production, the main contribution to the diffractive amplitude of heavy
quarkonia comes from nonperturbative region of gluon transverse momenta
$Q_{\perp}<1\,\GeV$. At $y \approx$ 0, depending on UGDF we predict the
contribution of $\chi_c(1^+,2^+)$ to the $J/\Psi + \gamma$ channel to be
comparable or larger than that of the $\chi_c(0^+)$ one. This is partially due
to a significant contribution from lower polarization states $\lambda=0$ for
$\chi_c(1^+)$ and $\lambda=0,\,\pm 1$ for $\chi_c(2^+)$ meson. Corresponding
theoretical uncertainties are discussed.
