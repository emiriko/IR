Compton scattering on light nuclei ($A=2,3$) has emerged as an effective
avenue to search for signatures of neutron polarizabilities, both
spin--independent and spin--dependent ones. In this discussion I will focus on
the theoretical aspect of Compton scattering on light nuclei; giving first a
brief overview and therafter concentrating on our Compton scattering
calculations based on Chiral effective theory at energies of the order of pion
mass. These elastic $\gamma$d and $\gamma$He-3 calculations include nucleons,
pions as the basic degrees of freedom. I will also discuss $\gamma$d results
where the $\Delta$-isobar has been included explicitly. Our results on
unpolarized and polarization observables suggest that a combination of
experiments and further theoretical efforts will provide an extraction of the
neutron polarizabilities.
