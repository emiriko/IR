Bidirectional variants of stochastic many particle models for transport by
molecular motors show a strong tendency to form macroscopic clusters on static
lattices. Inspired by the fact that the microscopic tracks for molecular motors
are dynamical, we study the influence of different types of lattice dynamics on
stochastic bidirectional transport. We observe a transition toward efficient
transport (corresponding to the dissolution of large clusters) controlled by
the lattice dynamics.
