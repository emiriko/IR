We report the first detection of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission
above 140 GeV from PKS 1424+240, a BL Lac object with an unknown redshift. The
photon spectrum above 140 GeV measured by VERITAS is well described by a power
law with a photon index of 3.8 +- 0.5_stat +- 0.3_syst and a flux normalization
at 200 GeV of (5.1 +- 0.9_stat +- 0.5_syst) x 10^{-11} TeV^-1 cm^-2 s^-1, where
stat and syst denote the statistical and systematical uncertainty,
respectively. The VHE flux is steady over the observation period between MJD
54881 and 55003 (2009 February 19 to June 21). Flux variability is also not
observed in contemporaneous high energy observations with the Fermi Large Area
Telescope (LAT). Contemporaneous X-ray and optical data were also obtained from
the Swift XRT and MDM observatory, respectively. The broadband spectral energy
distribution (SED) is well described by a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton
(SSC) model favoring a redshift of less than 0.1. Using the photon index
measured with Fermi in combination with recent extragalactic background light
(EBL) absorption models it can be concluded from the VERITAS data that the
redshift of PKS 1424+240 is less than 0.66.
