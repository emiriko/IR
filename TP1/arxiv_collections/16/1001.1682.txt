We present results from simulations of Two Color QCD with two Wilson quark
flavors in the presence of a quark chemical potential mu at two different
lattice spacings. The equation of state, conformal anomaly, superfluid order
parameter and Polyakov line are all discussed. Our results suggest that the
transition from hadronic to quark matter, and that from confined to deconfined
matter occur at distinct values of mu, consistent with the existence of a
quarkyonic phase in this model.
