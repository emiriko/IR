We present a new first-principle theory for the calculation of the
macroscopic second-order susceptibility chi^(2), based on the Time-Dependent
Density-Functional Theory approach. Our method allows to include
straightforwardly the many-body effects. We apply the theory to the computation
of the Second-Harmonic Generation spectroscopy, showing a very good agreement
with experiment for cubic semiconductor GaAs.
