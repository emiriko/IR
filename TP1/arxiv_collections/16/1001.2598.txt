The mechanism of drastic change of Fermi surfaces as well as transport
anomalies near P=Pc=2.35 GPa in CeRhIn5 is explained theoretically. The key
mechanism is pointed out to be the interplay of magnetic order and Ce-valence
fluctuations. We show that the antiferromagnetic state with "small" Fermi
surfaces changes to the paramagnetic state with "large" Fermi surfaces with
huge enhancement of effective mass of electrons with keeping finite c-f
hybridization. This explains the drastic change of the de Haas-van Alphen
signals. Furthermore, it is also consistent with the emergence of T-linear
resistivity simultaneous with the residual resistivity peak at P=Pc in CeRhIn5.
