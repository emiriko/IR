We discuss both theoretically and experimentally elementary two-photon
polarization entanglement localization after break of entanglement caused by
linear coupling of environmental photon with one of the system photons. The
localization of entanglement is based on simple polarization measurement of the
surrounding photon after the coupling. We demonstrate that non-zero
entanglement can be localized back irrespectively to the distinguishability of
coupled photons. Further, it can be increased by local single-copy polarization
filters up to an amount violating Bell inequalities. The present technique
allows to restore entanglement in that cases, when the entanglement
distillation does not produce any entanglement out of the coupling.
