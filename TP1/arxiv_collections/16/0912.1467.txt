We provide an expression quantitatively describing the specific heat of the
Ising model on the simple-cubic lattice in the critical region. This expression
is based on finite-size scaling of numerical results obtained by means of a
Monte Carlo method. It agrees satisfactorily with series expansions and with a
set of experimental results. Our results include a determination of the
universal amplitude ratio of the specific-heat divergences at both sides of the
critical point.
