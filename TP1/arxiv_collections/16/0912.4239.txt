The usual interpretational rule of quantum mechanics which states that
outcomes do not occur when their weights are zero is changed so as to preclude
outcomes with weights less than a small but positive value. With this "positive
preclusion" rule, and in the absence of any notion of objective probability,
Everett quantum mechanics has the explanatory power to account for the
evolution of organisms with subjective expectations of probability that are in
accord with the Born rule. Positive preclusion also allows for the derivation
of a connection between weight and relative frequency in situations involving a
finite number of measurements.
