Multiple impact basins formed on the Moon about 3.8 Gyr ago in what is known
as the lunar cataclysm or late heavy bombardment. Many workers currently
interpret the lunar cataclysm as an impact spike primarily caused by main-belt
asteroids destabilized by delayed planetary migration. We show that
morphologically fresh (class 1) craters on the lunar highlands were mostly
formed during the brief tail of the cataclysm, as they have absolute crater
number density similar to that of the Orientale basin and ejecta blanket. The
connection between class 1 craters and the cataclysm is supported by the
similarity of their size-frequency distribution to that of
stratigraphically-identified Imbrian craters. Majority of lunar craters younger
than the Imbrium basin (including class 1 craters) thus record the
size-frequency distribution of the lunar cataclysm impactors. This distribution
is much steeper than that of main-belt asteroids. We argue that the projectiles
bombarding the Moon at the time of the cataclysm could not have been main-belt
asteroids ejected by purely gravitational means.
