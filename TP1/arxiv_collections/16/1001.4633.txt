this paper is part of the Prelaunch status LFI papers published on JINST:
http://www.iop.org/EJ/journal/-page=extra.proc5/jinst The Low Frequency
Instrument is optically interfaced with the ESA Planck telescope through 11
corrugated feed horns each connected to the Radiometer Chain Assembly (RCA).
This paper describes the design, the manufacturing and the testing of the
flight model feed horns. They have been designed to optimize the LFI optical
interfaces taking into account the tight mechanical requirements imposed by the
Planck focal plane layout. All the eleven units have been successfully tested
and integrated with the Ortho Mode transducers.
