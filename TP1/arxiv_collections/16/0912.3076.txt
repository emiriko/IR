A brief survey is made to highlight the recent interests in positron,
positronium and antimatter physics. Positron is the first antiparticle observed
which was predicted by Dirac. Positronium is itself its antiparticle and
bi-positronium molecule is recently observed in laboratory which was predicted
by Wheeler. The simplest antiatom i.e. antihydrogen is observed in the
laboratory and the process to achieve the stable confinement of antihydrogen
within the trap are in progress to test the standard model.
