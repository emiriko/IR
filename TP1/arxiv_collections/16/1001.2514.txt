We discuss, in a pedagogical way, how to solve for relativistic wave
functions from the radial Dirac equations. After an brief introduction, in
Section II we solve the equations for a linear Lorentz scalar potential,
V_s(r), that provides for confinement of a quark. The case of massless u and d
quarks is treated first, as these are necessarily quite relativistic. We use an
iterative procedure to find the eigenenergies and the upper and lower component
wave functions for the ground state and then, later, some excited states.
Solutions for the massive quarks (s, c, and b) are also presented. In Section
III we solve for the case of a Coulomb potential, which is a time-like
component of a Lorentz vector potential, V_v(r). We re-derive, numerically, the
(analytically well-known) relativistic hydrogen atom eigenenergies and wave
functions, and later extend that to the cases of heavier one-electron atoms and
muonic atoms. Finally, Section IV finds solutions for a combination of the V_s
and V_v potentials. We treat two cases. The first is one in which V_s is the
linear potential used in Sec. II and V_v is Coulombic, as in Sec. III. The
other is when both V_s and V_v are linearly confining, and we establish when
these potentials give a vanishing spin-orbit interaction (as has been shown to
be the case in quark models of the hadronic spectrum).
