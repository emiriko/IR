Many highly developed Monte Carlo tools for the evaluation of cross sections
based on tree matrix elements exist and are used by experimental collaborations
in high energy physics. As the evaluation of one-loop matrix elements has
recently been undergoing enormous progress, the combination of one-loop matrix
elements with existing Monte Carlo tools is on the horizon. This would lead to
phenomenological predictions at the next-to-leading order level. This note
summarises the discussion of the next-to-leading order multi-leg (NLM) working
group on this issue which has been taking place during the workshop on Physics
at TeV colliders at Les Houches, France, in June 2009. The result is a proposal
for a standard interface between Monte Carlo tools and one-loop matrix element
programs.
