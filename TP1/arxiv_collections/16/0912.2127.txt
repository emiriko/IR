In this note we briefly comment a paper by Itin, Obukhov and Hehl criticising
our previous paper. We show that all remarks by our critics are ill conceived
or irrelevant to our approach and moreover we provide some pertinent new
comments to their critical paper, with the aim to clarify even more our view on
the subject.
