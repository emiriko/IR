This article is concerned with the existence of traveling wave solutions,
including standing waves, to some models based on configurational forces,
describing respectively the diffusionless phase transformations of solid
materials, e.g., Steel, and phase transitions due to interface motion by
interface diffusion, e.g., Sintering. These models are recently proposed by
Alber and Zhu. We consider both the order-parameter-conserved case and the
non-conserved one, under suitable assumptions. Also we compare our results with
the corresponding ones for the Allen-Cahn and the Cahn-Hilliard equations
coupled with linear elasticity, which are models for diffusion-dominated phase
transformations in elastic solids.
