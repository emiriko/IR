In this work, we study the 1D stabilized Kuramoto Sivashinsky equation with
additive uncorrelated stochastic noise. The Eckhaus stable band of the
deterministic equation collapses to a narrow region near the center of the
band. This is consistent with the behavior of the phase diffusion constants of
these states. Some connections to the phenomenon of state selection in driven
out of equilibrium systems are made.
