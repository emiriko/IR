We consider continuum one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with potentials
that are given by a sum of a suitable background potential and an Anderson-type
potential whose single-site distribution has a continuous and compactly
supported density. We prove exponential decay of the expectation of the finite
volume correlators, uniform in any compact energy region, and deduce from this
dynamical and spectral localization. The proofs implement a continuum analog of
the method Kunz and Souillard developed in 1980 to study discrete
one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with potentials of the form background
plus random.
