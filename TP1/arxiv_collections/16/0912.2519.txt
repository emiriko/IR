Transport properties of exciton-polaritons in anisotropic quantum
microcavities are considered theoretically. Microscopic symmetry of the
structure is taken into account by allowing for both the
longitudinal-transverse (TE-TM) and anisotropic splitting of polariton states.
The splitting is equivalent to an effective magnetic field acting on polariton
pseudospin, and polarization conversion in microcavities is shown to be caused
by an interplay of exciton-polariton spin precession and elastic scattering. In
addition, we considered the spin-dependent interference of polaritons leading
to weak localization and calculated coherent backscattering intensities in
different polarizations. Our findings are in a very good agreement with the
recent experimental data.
