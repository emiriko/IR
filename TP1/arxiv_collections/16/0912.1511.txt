The electronic properties and nanostructure of InAs nanowires are correlated
by creating multiple field effect transistors (FETs) on nanowires grown to have
low and high defect density segments. 4.2 K carrier mobilities are ~4X larger
in the nominally defect-free segments of the wire. We also find that dark field
optical intensity is correlated with the mobility, suggesting a simple route
for selecting wires with a low defect density. At low temperatures, FETs
fabricated on high defect density segments of InAs nanowires showed transport
properties consistent with single electron charging, even on devices with low
resistance ohmic contacts. The charging energies obtained suggest quantum dot
formation at defects in the wires. These results reinforce the importance of
controlling the defect density in order to produce high quality electrical and
optical devices using InAs nanowires.
