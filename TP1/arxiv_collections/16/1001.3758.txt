Evanescent modes in complete sonic crystals (SC) and SC with point defects
are reported both theoretically and experimentally in this paper. Plane wave
expansion (PWE) and, in general, $\omega(k)$ methods have been used to
calculate band structures showing gaps that have been interpreted as ranges of
frequencies where no real $k$ exists. In this work, we extend PWE to solve the
complex $k(\omega)$ problem applied to SC, introducing the supercell
approximation for studying one vacancy. Explicit matrix formulation of the
equations is given. This $k(\omega)$ method enables the calculation of complex
band structures, as well as enabling an analysis of the propagating modes
related with real values of the function $k(\omega)$, and the evanescent modes
related with imaginary values of $k(\omega)$. This paper shows theoretical
results and experimental evidences of the evanescent behavior of modes inside
the SC band gap. Experimental data and numerical results using the finite
elements method are in very good agreement with the predictions obtained using
the $k(\omega)$ method.
