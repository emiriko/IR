Using the Gamma ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on Fermi we are monitoring accreting
pulsar systems. We use the rates from GBM's 12 NaI detectors in the 8-50 keV
range to detect and monitor pulsations with periods between 0.5 and 1000
seconds. After discussing our analysis approach we present results for
individual sources from the first year of monitoring. Updated figures for these
and other sources are available at
