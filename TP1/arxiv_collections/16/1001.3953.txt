We consider the coherent stimulated Raman process developing in an optically
dense and disordered atomic medium in application to the quantum memory scheme.
Our theoretical model predicts that the hyperfine interaction in the excited
state of alkali atoms can positively affect on the quantum memory efficiency.
Based on the concept of the coherent information transfer we analyze and
compare the memory requirements for storage of single photon and macroscopic
multi-photon light pulses.
