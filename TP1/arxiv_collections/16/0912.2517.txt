We prepare arbitrary patterns of neutral atoms in a one-dimensional (1D)
optical lattice with single-site precision using microwave radiation in a
magnetic field gradient. We give a detailed account of the current limitations
and propose methods to overcome them. Our results have direct relevance for
addressing of planes, strings or single atoms in higher dimensional optical
lattices for quantum information processing or quantum simulations with
standard methods in current experiments. Furthermore, our findings pave the way
for arbitrary single qubit control with single site resolution.
