Based on a new version of the Hipparcos catalogue and an updated
Geneva-Copenhagen survey of F and G dwarfs, we analyze the space velocity field
of about 17000 single stars in the solar neighborhood. The main known clumps,
streams, and branches (Pleiades, Hyades, Sirius, Coma Berenices, Hercules, Wolf
630-alpha Ceti, and Arcturus) have been identified using various approaches.
The evolution of the space velocity field for F and G dwarfs has been traced as
a function of the stellar age. We have managed to confirm the existence of the
recently discovered KFR08 stream. We have found 19 Hipparcos stars, candidates
for membership in the KFR08 stream, and obtained an isochrone age estimate for
the stream, 13 Gyr. The mean stellar ages of the Wolf 630-alpha Ceti and
Hercules streams are shown to be comparable, 4--6 Gyr. No significant
differences in the metallicities of stars belonging to these streams have been
found. This is an argument for the hypothesis that these streams owe their
origin to a common mechanism.
