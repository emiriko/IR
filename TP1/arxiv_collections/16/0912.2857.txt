We discuss a universal algebraic approach to quasi-exactly solvable models
which allows us to interpret them as constrained Hamiltonian systems with a
finite number of physical states. Using this approach we reproduce well-known
two-dimensional Lie-algebraic quasi-exactly solvable system based on Lie
algebra su(3).
