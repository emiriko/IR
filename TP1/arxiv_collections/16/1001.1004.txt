A rigorous quantum theory of atomic collisions in the presence of radio
frequency (rf) magnetic fields is developed and applied to elucidate the
effects of combined dc and rf magnetic fields on elastic scattering in
ultracold collisions of Rb atoms. We show that rf fields can be used to induce
Feshbach resonances, which can be tuned by varying the amplitude and frequency
of the rf field. The rf-induced Feshbach resonances occur also in collisions of
atoms in low-field-seeking states at moderate rf field strengths easily
available in atom chip experiments, which opens up the world of tunable
interactions to magnetically trappable atomic quantum gases.
