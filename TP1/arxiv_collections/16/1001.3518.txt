It is widely believed that ultraluminous infrared (IR) galaxies and active
galactic nuclei (AGN) activity are triggered by galaxy interactions and
merging, with the peak of activity occurring at z~2, where submillimetre
galaxies are thousands of times more numerous than local ULIRGs. In this
evolutionary picture, submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) would host an AGN, which
would eventually grow a black hole (BH) strong enough to blow off all of the
gas and dust leaving an optically luminous QSO. To probe this evolutionary
sequence we have focussed on the 'missing link' sources, which demonstrate both
strong starburst (SB) and AGN signatures, in order to determine if the SB is
the main power source even in SMGs when we have evidence that an AGN is present
from their IRAC colours. The best way to determine if a dominant AGN is present
is to look for their signatures in the mid-infrared with the Spitzer IRS, since
often even deep X-ray observations miss identifying the presence of AGN in
heavily dust-obscured SMGs. We present the results of our audit of the energy
balance between star-formation and AGN within this special sub-population of
SMGs -- where the BH has grown appreciably to begin heating the dust emission.
