A closed expression is obtained for the cross-section for Coulomb excitation
of levels of the giant dipole resonance of given angular momentum and phonon
number. Applications are made to the Goldhaber-Teller and Steinwedel-Jensen
descriptions of the resonance, at non-relativistic and relativistic bombarding
energies.
