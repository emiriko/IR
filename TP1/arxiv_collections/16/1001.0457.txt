The present paper gives an account and quantifies the change in topology
induced by small and type II geometric transitions, by introducing the notion
of the \emph{homological type} of a geometric transition. The obtained results
agree with, and go further than, most results and estimates, given to date by
several authors, both in mathematical and physical literature.
