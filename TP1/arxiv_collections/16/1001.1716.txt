The magnetic properties of the diluted magnetic semiconductor
Ga_{1-x}Mn_{x}As are studied within the dynamical cluster approximation. We use
the k-dot-p Hamiltonian to describe the electronic structure of GaAs with
spin-orbit coupling and strain effects. We show that nonlocal effects are
essential for explaining the experimentally observed transition temperature and
saturation magnetization. We also demonstrate that the cluster anisotropy is
very strong and induces rotational frustration and a cube-edge direction
magnetic anisotropy at low temperature. With this, we explain the
temperature-driven spin reorientation in this system.
