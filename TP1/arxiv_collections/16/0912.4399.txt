Lithium is made up in the envelopes of massive Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB)
stars through the process of Hot Bottom Burning. In Globular Clusters, this
processing is one possible source of the hot-CNO burning whose nuclear products
are then ejected into the intracluster medium and take part in the formation of
a second stellar generation, explaining the peculiar distribution of chemical
elements among the cluster stars. We discuss the lithium yields from AGB stars
in the mass range 3-6.3 Msun, and from super-AGB stars of masses in the range
6.5-9 Msun for metallicity Z=0.001. The qualitative behaviour of these yields
is discussed in terms of the physical structure of the different masses.
Although many uncertainties affect the other yields of these stars (e.g. O, Na
and Mg), even larger uncertainties affect the lithium yield, as it depends
dramatically on the adopted description of mass loss. When we adopt our
standard mass loss formulation, very large yields are obtained especially for
the super-AGB stars, and we discuss their possible role on the lithium
abundance of second generation stars in globular clusters.
