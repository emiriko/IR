We analyze generalized CP symmetries of two-Higgs doublet models, extending
them from the scalar to the fermion sector of the theory. We show that, with a
single exception, those symmetries imply massless fermions. The single model
which accommodates a fermionic mass spectrum compatible with experimental data
possesses a remarkable feature. It displays a new type of spontaneous CP
violation, which occurs not in the scalar sector responsible for the symmetry
breaking mechanism but, rather, in the fermion sector.
