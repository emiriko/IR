In the CMS experiment, the non event data needed to set up the detector, or
being produced by it, and needed to calibrate the physical responses of the
detector itself are stored in ORACLE databases. The large amount of data to be
stored, the number of clients involved and the performance requirements make
the database system an essential service for the experiment to run. This note
describes the CMS condition database architecture, the data-flow and PopCon,
the tool built in order to populate the offline databases. Finally, the first
experience obtained during the 2008 and 2009 cosmic data taking are presented.
