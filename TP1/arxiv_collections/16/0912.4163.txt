We report on observations of the Large Magellanic Cloud with the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. The LMC is clearly detected with the Large Area
Telescope (LAT) and for the first time the emission is spatially well resolved
in gamma-rays. Our observations reveal the massive star forming region 30
Doradus as a bright source of gamma-ray emission in the LMC. The observations
furthermore show that the gamma-ray emission correlates little with the gas
density of the LMC. Implications of this finding will be discussed.
