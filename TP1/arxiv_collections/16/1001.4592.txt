In order to reveal possible non-homogeneities in the spatial distribution of
long (T_90 > 2^s) gamma-ray bursts we have examined 201 of them with known
redshifts z. For different functional forms of metric distance r(z)we use the
distribution function f(l)of separations between objects. Asymptotically, for
small l this function behaves like f(l)~l^{D-1} for fractal sets whose fractal
dimension is D. It is revealed that for all of the considered forms of r(z) the
spatial distribution of gamma-ray burst sources shows signs of fractality with
D=2.2-2.5. A few spatially isolated groups of gamma-ray burst sources have been
found, one of which has equatorial coordinates alpha extending from 23^h 56^m
to 0^h 49^m and delta from +19^o to +23^o its redshifts being within the range
of 0.81 to 0.94.
