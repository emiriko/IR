When a mountaineer is ascending one of the great peaks of the Himalayas she
knows that an entirely new vista awaits her at the top, whose ramifications
will be known only after she gets there. Her immediate goal though, is to
tackle the obstacles on the way up, and reach the summit. In a similar vein,
one of the immediate goals of contemporary theoretical physics is to build a
quantum, unified description of general relativity and the standard model of
particle physics. Once that peak has been reached, a new (yet unknown) vista
will open up. In this essay I propose a novel approach towards this goal. One
must address and resolve a fundamental unsolved problem in the presently known
formulation of quantum theory : the unsatisfactory presence of an external
classical time in the formulation. Solving this problem takes us to the very
edge of theoretical physics as we know it today!
