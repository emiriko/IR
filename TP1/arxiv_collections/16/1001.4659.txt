The Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) is a radiometer array covering the 30-70
GHz spectral range on-board the ESA Planck satellite, launched on May 14th,
2009 to observe the cosmic microwave background (CMB) with unprecedented
precision. In this paper we describe the development and validation of a
software model of the LFI pseudo-correlation receivers which enables to
reproduce and predict all the main system parameters of interest as measured at
each of the 44 LFI detectors. These include system total gain, noise
temperature, band-pass response, non-linear response. The LFI Advanced RF Model
(LARFM) has been constructed by using commercial software tools and data of
each radiometer component as measured at single unit level. The LARFM has been
successfully used to reproduce the LFI behavior observed during the LFI
ground-test campaign. The model is an essential element in the database of LFI
data processing center and will be available for any detailed study of
radiometer behaviour during the survey.
