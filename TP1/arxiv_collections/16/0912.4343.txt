The recent analyses of the light curves provided by CoRoT have revealed
pulsation spectra of unprecedented richness and precision, in particular,
thousands of pulsating modes, and a clear distribution of amplitudes with
frequency. In the community, some scientists have started doubting about the
validity of the classical tools to analyze these very accurate light curves.
  This work provides the asteroseismic community with answers to this question
showing that (1) it is physically possible for a star to excite at a time and
with the observed amplitudes such a large number of modes; and (2) that the
kinetic energy accumulated in all those modes does not destroy the equilibrium
of the star. Consequently, mathematical tools presently applied in the analyses
of light curves can a priori be trusted. This conclusion is even more important
now, when a large amount of space data coming from Kepler are currently being
analyzed.
  The power spectrum of different stellar cases, and the non-adiabatic code
GraCo have been used to estimate the upper limit of the energy per second
required to excite all the observed modes, and their total kinetic energy. A
necessary previous step for this study is to infer the relative radial
pulsational amplitude from the observed photometric amplitude, scaling our
linear pulsational solutions to absolute values. The derived upper limits for
the required pulsational energy were compared with 1) the luminosity of the
star; and 2) the gravitational energy. We obtained that both upper energy
limits are orders of magnitude smaller.
