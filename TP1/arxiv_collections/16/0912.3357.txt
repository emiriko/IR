A sudden change of the Hamiltonian parameter drives a quantum system out of
equilibrium. For a finite-size system, expectations of observables start
fluctuating in time without converging to a precise limit. A new equilibrium
state emerges only in probabilistic sense, when the probability distribution
for the observables expectations over long times concentrate around their mean
value. In this paper we study the full statistic of generic observables after a
small quench. When the quench is performed around a regular (i.e. non-critical)
point of the phase diagram, generic observables are expected to be
characterized by Gaussian distribution functions (``good equilibration'').
Instead, when quenching around a critical point a new universal double-peaked
distribution function emerges for relevant perturbations. Our analytic
predictions are numerically checked for a non-integrable extension of the
quantum Ising model.
