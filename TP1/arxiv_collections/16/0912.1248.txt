We show that a VMD based theoretical input allows for a significantly
improved accuracy for the hadronic vacuum polarization of the photon which
contributes to the theoretical estimate of the muon g-2. We also show that the
only experimental piece of information in the $\tau$ decay which cannot be
accounted for is the accepted value for ${\rm Br}(\tau \ra \pi \pi \nu_\tau)$,
while the spectum lineshape is in agreement with expectations from $e^+ e^-$
annihilations.
