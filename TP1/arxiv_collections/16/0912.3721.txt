In holographic QCD the effects of gluonic condensate can be encoded in a
suitable deformation of the 5D metric. We develop two different methods for the
evaluation of first order perturbative corrections to masses and decay
constants of vector resonances in 5D Hard-Wall models of QCD due to small
deformations of the metric. They are extracted either from a novel compact form
for the first order correction to the vector two-point function, or from
perturbation theory for vector bound-state eigenfunctions: the equivalence of
the two methods is shown. Our procedures are then applied to flat and to AdS 5D
Hard-Wall models; we complement results of existing literature evaluating the
corrections to vector decay constant and to two-pion-one-vector couplings: this
is particularly relevant to satisfy the sum rules. We concentrate our attention
on the effects for the Gasser-Leutwyler coefficients; we show that, as in the
Chiral Quark model, the addition of the gluonic condensate improves the
consistency, the understanding and the agreement with phenomenology of the
holographic model.
