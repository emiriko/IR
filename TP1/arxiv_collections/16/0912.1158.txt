We consider an object at rest in space with a universal Hubble expansion
taking place away from it. We find that a governing differential equation
developed from the Schroedinger equation leads to wave functions which turn out
to exhibit pronounced central localization. The extent of concentration of
probability depends on the mass; objects with small masses tend to behave in a
delocalized manner as ordinary quantum objects do in a static space, while
quantum objects with large masses have wave functions that are largely
concentrated into much smaller regions. This in turn suggests the possibility
that classical behavior is being induced in quantum objects by the presence of
the Hubble expansion. If the size of the localized region of concentrated
probability density is larger than the size of the corresponding extended
object, quantum behavior might be expected; whereas classical behavior might be
expected for cases in which the region of high probability density is smaller
than the size of the object. The resulting quantum-classical boundary due to
Hubble expansion may be expressed in terms of a relationship between the size
and mass of an object, or may be expressed in terms of a threshold moment of
inertia.
