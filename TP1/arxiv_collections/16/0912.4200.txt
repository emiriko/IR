A variety of detectors has been proposed for dark matter direct detection,
but most of them -- by the fact -- are still at R&D stage. In many cases, it is
claimed that the lack of an adequate detectors' radio-purity might be
compensated through heavy uses of MonteCarlo simulations, subtractions and
handlings of the measured counting rates, in order to claim higher sensitivity
(just for a particular scenario). The relevance of a correct evaluation of
systematic effects in the use of MonteCarlo simulations at very low energy
(which has always been safely discouraged in the field so far) and of multiple
subtractions and handling procedures applied to the measured counting rate is
shortly addressed here at some extent. Many other aspects would also deserve
suitably deep investigations.
