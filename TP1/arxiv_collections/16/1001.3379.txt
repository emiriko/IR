We present theoretical thermally-averaged rate constants for vibrational and
rotational (de-)excitation of the H3+ ion by electron impact. The constants are
calculated using the multi-channel quantum-defect approach. The calculation
includes processes that involve a change Delta J<=2 in the rotational angular
momentum J of H3+. The rate constants are calculated for states with J<=5 for
rotational transitions of the H3+ ground vibrational level. The thermal rates
for transitions among the lowest eight vibrational levels are also presented,
averaged over the rotational structure of the vibrational levels. The
conditions for producing non-thermal rotational and vibrational distributions
of H3+ in astrophysical environments are discussed.
