Fit;o) is a M\"ossbauer fitting and analysis program written in Borland
Delphi. It has a complete graphical user interface that allows all actions to
be carried out via mouse clicks or key shortcut operations in a WYSIWYG
fashion. The program does not perform complete transmission integrals, and will
therefore not be suited for a complete analysis of all types of M\"ossbauer
spectra and e.g. low temperature spectra of ferrous silicates. Instead, the
program is intended for application on complex spectra resulting from typical
mineral samples, in which many phases and different crystallite sizes are often
present at the same time. The program provides the opportunity to fit the
spectra with Gaussian, Lorentzian, Split-Lorentzian, Pseudo-Voigt,
Pseudo-Lorentz and Pearson-VII line profiles for individual components of the
spectra. This feature is particularly useful when the sample contains
components, that are affected by effects of either relaxation or interaction
among particles. Fitted spectra may be printed, fits saved, data files exported
for graph creation in other programs, and analysis tables and reports may be
exported as plain text or LaTeX files. With Fit;o) even an inexperienced user
will soon be able to analyze and fit relatively complex M\"ossbauer spectra of
mineralogical samples quickly without programming knowledge.
