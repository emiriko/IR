Random Number Generators play a critical role in a number of important
applications. In practice, statistical testing is employed to gather evidence
that a generator indeed produces numbers that appear to be random. In this
paper, we reports on the studies that were conducted on the compressed data
using 8 compression algorithms or compressors. The test results suggest that
the output of compression algorithms or compressors has bad randomness, the
compression algorithms or compressors are not suitable as random number
generator. We also found that, for the same compression algorithm, there exists
positive correlation relationship between compression ratio and randomness,
increasing the compression ratio increases randomness of compressed data. As
time permits, additional randomness testing efforts will be conducted.
