We construct new families of multi-error-correcting quantum codes for the
amplitude damping channel. Our key observation is that, with proper encoding,
two uses of the amplitude damping channel simulate a quantum erasure channel.
This allows us to use concatenated codes with quantum erasure-correcting codes
as outer codes for correcting multiple amplitude damping errors. Our new codes
are degenerate stabilizer codes and have parameters which are better than the
amplitude damping codes obtained by any previously known construction.
