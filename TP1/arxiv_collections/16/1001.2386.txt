Software is intangible and knowledge about software systems is typically
tacit. The mental model of software developers is thus an important factor in
software engineering. It is our vision that developers should be able to refer
to code as being "up in the north", "over in the west", or "down-under in the
south". We want to provide developers, and everyone else involved in software
development, with a *shared*, spatial and stable mental model of their software
project. We aim to reinforce this by embedding a cartographic visualization in
the IDE (Integrated Development Environment). The visualization is always
visible in the bottom-left, similar to the GPS navigation device for car
drivers. For each development task, related information is displayed on the
map. In this paper we present CODEMAP, an eclipse plug-in, and report on
preliminary results from an ongoing user study with professional developers and
students.
