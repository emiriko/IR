It is now widely accepted that errors in spreadsheets are both common and
potentially dangerous. Further research has taken place to investigate how
frequently these errors occur, what impact they have, how the risk of
spreadsheet errors can be reduced by following spreadsheet design guidelines
and methodologies, and how effective auditing of a spreadsheet is in the
detection of these errors. However, little research exists to establish the
usefulness of software tools in the auditing of spreadsheets. This paper
documents and tests office software tools designed to assist in the audit of
spreadsheets. The test was designed to identify the success of software tools
in detecting different types of errors, to identify how the software tools
assist the auditor and to determine the usefulness of the tools.
