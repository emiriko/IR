We derive an explict bias dependent expression for electron transfer reaction
rate from a solvated redox to a electrode through a bridged molecule of
arbitrary length. The interaction of the solvated redox with the solvent is
modelled as a classical harmonic oscillator bath. The effect of competing
process, namely resonance tunneling between redox and bridge and the solvation
of the redox is investigated. Plots were produced for the case of 5 atom
bridge. Our analysis shows that for certain suitable value of nearest-neighbour
coupling, it is possible to block electron transfer in certain intermediate
voltage regime
