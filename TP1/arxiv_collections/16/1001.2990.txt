We address the gravitation and inertia in the framework of 'general gauge
principle', which accounts for 'gravitation gauge group' generated by hidden
local internal symmetry implemented on the flat space. We connect this group to
nonlinear realization of the Lie group of 'distortion' of local internal
properties of six-dimensional flat space, which is assumed as a toy model
underlying four-dimensional Minkowski space. The agreement between proposed
gravitational theory and available observational verifications is satisfactory.
We construct relativistic field theory of inertia and derive the relativistic
law of inertia. This theory furnishes justification for introduction of the
Principle of Equivalence. We address the rearrangement of vacuum state in
gravity resulting from these ideas.
