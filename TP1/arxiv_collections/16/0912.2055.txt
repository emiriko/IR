We have carried out high-precision photometry on a large number of archival
HST images of the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6752, to search for signs of
multiple stellar populations. We find a broadened main sequence, and
demonstrate that this broadening cannot be attributed either to binaries or to
photometric errors. There is also some indication of a main-sequence split. No
significant spread could be found along the subgiant branch, however.
  Ground-based photometry reveals that in the U vs. (U-B) color-magnitude
diagram the red-giant branch exhibits a clear color spread, which we have been
able to correlate with variations in Na and O abundances. In particular the
Na-rich, O-poor stars identified by Carretta et al. (2007) define a sequence on
the red side of the red-giant branch, while Na-poor, O-rich stars populate a
bluer, more dispersed portion of the red-giant branch.
