High-contrast coronagraphy will be needed to image and characterize faint
extra-solar planetary systems. Coronagraphy is a rapidly evolving field, and
many enhanced alternatives to the classical Lyot coronagraph have been proposed
in the past ten years. Here, we discuss the operation of the vector vortex
coronagraph, which is one of the most efficient possible coronagraphs. We first
present recent laboratory results, and then first light observations at the
Palomar observatory. Our near-infrared H-band (centered at ~ 1.65 microns) and
K-band (centered at ~ 2.2 microns) vector vortex devices demonstrated excellent
contrast results in the lab, down to ~ 1e-6 at an angular separation of 3 lb/d.
On sky, we detected a brown dwarf companion 3000 times fainter than its host
star (HR 7672) in the Ks band (centered at ~2.15 microns), at an angular
separation of ~ 2.5 lb/d. Current and next-generation high-contrast instruments
can directly benefit from the demonstrated capabilities of such a vector
vortex: simplicity, small inner working angle, high optical throughput (>90%),
and maximal off-axis discovery space.
