Turbulent spectra of magnetic fluctuations in the free solar wind are studied
from MHD to electron scales using Cluster observations. We discuss the problem
of the instrumental noise and its influence on the measurements at the electron
scales. We confirm the presence of a curvature of the spectrum $\sim
\exp{\sqrt{k\rho_e}}$ over the broad frequency range $\sim[10,100]$ Hz,
indicating the presence of a dissipation. Analysis of seven spectra under
different plasma conditions show clearly the presence of a quasi-universal
power-law spectrum at MHD and ion scales. However, the transition from the
inertial range $\sim k^{-1.7}$ to the spectrum at ion scales $\sim k^{-2.7}$ is
not universal. Finally, we discuss the role of different kinetic plasma scales
on the spectral shape, considering normalized dimensionless spectra.
