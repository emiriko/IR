We calculate the leading contribution to the spectral density of the Wilson
Dirac operator using chiral perturbation theory where volume and lattice
spacing corrections are given by universal scaling functions. We find
analytical expressions for the spectral density on the scale of the average
level spacing, and introduce a chiral Random Matrix Theory that reproduces
these results. Our work opens up a novel approach to the infinite volume limit
of lattice gauge theory at finite lattice spacing and new ways to extract
coefficients of Wilson chiral perturbation theory.
