In this paper, we present an interesting method to microfabricate a tilted
micro air jet generator. We used the well-know deep reactive ion etching (DRIE)
technique in order to realize in a silicon substrate a double side etching. For
aircraft and cars, micro air jets will take an important place for fluid
control. Micro air jets are characterized by their speed, frequency and tilt.
Usually, this micro air jets are produced by fluidic microsystems. We presented
experimental results about micro tilted air jets. A comparison between finite
element method simulation, theory and experimental results are performed to
define the microsystem geometry leading a specific air jet angle.
