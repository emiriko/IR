One of the most fundamental questions in the field of relativistic heavy ion
physics is how to reach and explore densities which are needed to cross the
chiral and/or the deconfinement phase transition. In this analysis we
investigate the information we can gather by analyzing baryonic and mesonic
resonances on the hot and dense phase in such nuclear reactions. The decay
products of these resonances carry information on the resonances properties at
the space time point of their decay. We especially investigate the percentage
of reconstructable resonances as a function of density for heavy ion collisions
in the energy range between $E_{lab}$ = 30 AGeV and $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 AGeV, the
energy domain between the future FAIR facility and the present RHIC collider.
