The scalar $f_{xc}$ and tensor $\hat{f}_{xc}$ exchange-correlation (xc)
kernels are key ingredients of the time-dependent density functional theory and
the time-dependent current density functional theory, respectively. We derive a
comparatively simple relation between these two kernels under the assumption
that the dynamic xc can be considered "weak". We expect our formula to serve as
a convenient bridge between the scalar $f_{xc}$ which directly enters many
applications and the tensor $\hat{f}_{xc}$ which, due to its locality in space,
is much easier to approximate.
