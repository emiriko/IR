The behavior of the geometric phase gained by a single spin-1/2 nucleus
immersed into a thermal or a squeezed environment is investigated. Both the
time dependence of the phase and its value at infinity are examined against
several physical parameters. It is observed that for some intermediate ranges
of the temperature and the coupling strength, the presence of squeezing
enhances the geometric phase.
