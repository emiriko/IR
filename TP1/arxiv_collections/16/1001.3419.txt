We study quantum Darwinism--the redundant recording of information about the
preferred states of a decohering system by its environment--for an object
illuminated by a black body. In the cases of point-source and isotropic
illumination, we calculate the quantum mutual information between the object
and its photon environment. We demonstrate that this realistic model exhibits
fast and extensive proliferation of information about the object into the
environment and results in redundancies orders of magnitude larger than the
exactly soluble models considered to date.
