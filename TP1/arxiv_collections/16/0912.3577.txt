We present our numerical results of two-dimensional hydrodynamic (HD)
simulations and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the collapse of
rotating massive stars in light of the collapsar model of gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs). Pushed by recent evolution calculations of GRB progenitors, we focus on
lower angular momentum of the central core than the ones taken mostly in
previous studies. By performing special relativistic simulations including both
realistic equation of state and neutrino cooling, we follow a long-term
evolution of the slowly rotating collapsars up to 10 s, accompanied by the
formation of jets and accretion disks. We find such outfows can be launched
both by MHD process and neutrino process. We investigeate the properties of
these jets whether it can become GRBs or remains primary weak outflow.
