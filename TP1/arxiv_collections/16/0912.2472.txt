A recent study indicates that the $\alpha^2\alpha_s^2$ order QED processes of
$\Upsilon \to \jpsi + X$ decay are compatible with those of QCD processes.
However, in the endpoint region, the Non-relativistic QED (NRQED) calculation
breaks down since the collinear degrees of freedom are missing under the
framework of this effective theory.
  In this paper we apply the soft collinear effective theory (SCET) to study
the color-singlet QED process at the kinematic limit. Within this approach we
are able to sum the kinematic logarithms by running operators using the
renormalization group equations of SCET, which will lead to a dramatic change
in the momentum distribution near the endpoint and the spectrum shape
consistent with the experimental results.
