The Darboux transformation is used to obtain multisoliton solutions of the
chiral model in two dimensions. The matrix solutions of the principal chiral
model and its Lax pair are expressed in terms of quasideterminants. The
iteration of the Darboux transformation gives the quasideterminant multisoliton
solutions of the model. It has been shown that the quasideterminant
multisoliton solution of the chiral model is the same as obtained by Zakharov
and Mikhailov using the dressing method based on the matrix Riemann-Hilbert
problem.
