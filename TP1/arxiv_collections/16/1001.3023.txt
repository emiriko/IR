We study the three-dimensional system of magnetic nanoparticle dipoles
randomly oriented along quenched easy axes. Directions of the magnetic momenta
are described by the Ising variables which allow the momenta to flip along
their random orientations. Using the standard mean-field approximation and the
replica technique it is shown that the system undergoes a finite temperature
phase transition into a spin-glass phase.
