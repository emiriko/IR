A language L is prefix-closed if, whenever a word w is in L, then every
prefix of w is also in L. We define suffix-, factor-, and subword-closed
languages in the same way, where by subword we mean subsequence. We study the
quotient complexity (usually called state complexity) of operations on prefix-,
suffix-, factor-, and subword-closed languages. We find tight upper bounds on
the complexity of the prefix-, suffix-, factor-, and subword-closure of
arbitrary languages, and on the complexity of boolean operations,
concatenation, star and reversal in each of the four classes of closed
languages. We show that repeated application of positive closure and complement
to a closed language results in at most four distinct languages, while Kleene
closure and complement gives at most eight languages.
