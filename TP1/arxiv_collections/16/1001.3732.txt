We analyze the dynamics of growth of the number of congressmen supporting the
resolution HR1207 to audit the Federal Reserve. The plot of the total number of
co-sponsors as a function of time is of "Devil's staircase" type. The
distribution of the numbers of new co-sponsors joining during a particular day
(step height) follows a power law. The distribution of the length of intervals
between additions of new co-sponsors (step length) also follows a power law. We
use a modification of Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld sandpile model to simulate the
dynamics of Congress and obtain a good agreement with the data.
