We have studied isospin breaking effects in the X(3872) resonance and found a
natural explanation for the branching fraction of the X decaying to $J/\psi$
with two and three pions being close to unit. Within our framework the X(3872)
is a dynamically generated resonance in coupled channels. We also study the
relationship between the couplings of the resonance to the coupled channels
with its wave function, which further helps us to understand the isospin
structure of the resonance.
