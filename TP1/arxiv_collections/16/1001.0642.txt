M-learning (mobile learning) can take various forms. We are interested in
contextualized M-learning, i.e. the training related to the situation
physically or logically localized. Contextualization and pervasivity are
important aspects of our approach. We propose in particular MOCOCO principles
(Mobility - COntextualisation - COoperation) using IMERA platform (Mobile
Interaction in the Augmented Real Environment). We are studying various mobile
learning contexts related to professional activities, in order to master
appliances (Installation, Use, Breakdown diagnostic and Repairing).
Contextualization, traceability and checking of execution of prescribed
operations are based mainly on the use of RFID labels. Investigation of the
appropriate training methods for this kind of learning situation, applying
mainly a constructivist approach known as "Just-in-time learning", "learning by
doing", "learning and doing", constitutes an important topic of this project.
  From an organizational point of view we are in perfect symbiosis with EPSS -
Electronic Performance Support System [12] and our objective is to integrate
learning in professional activities in three ways: 1/ before work i.e. to learn
about coming actions, 2/ after work i.e. to learn about past actions to
understand what happened and accumulate experience, 3/ during work i.e. to
master the problem just-in-time
