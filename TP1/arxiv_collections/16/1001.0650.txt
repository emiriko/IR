We used the CRIRES spectrograph on the VLT to study the ro-vibrational
12CO/13CO, the Pfund beta and H2 emission between 4.59 and 4.72mu wavelengths
toward the BN object, the disk candidate source n, and a proposed dust density
enhancement IRC3. We detected CO absorption and emission features toward all
three targets. Toward the BN object, the data partly confirm the results
obtained more than 25 years ago by Scoville et al., however, we also identify
several new features. While the blue-shifted absorption is likely due to
outflowing gas, toward the BN object we detect CO in emission extending in
diameter to ~3300AU. Although at the observational spectral resolution limit,
the 13CO line width of that feature increases with energy levels, consistent
with a disk origin. If one attributes the extended CO emission also to a disk
origin, its extent is consistent with other massive disk candidates in the
literature. For source n, we also find the blue-shifted CO absorption likely
from an outflow. However, it also exhibits a narrower range of redshifted CO
absorption and adjacent weak CO emission, consistent with infalling motions. We
do not spatially resolve the emission for source n. For both sources we conduct
a Boltzmann analysis of the 13CO absorption features and find temperatures
between 100 and 160K, and H2 column densities of the order a few times
10^23cm^-2. The observational signatures from IRC3 are very different with only
weak absorption against a much weaker continuum source. However, the CO
emission is extended and shows wedge-like position velocity signatures
consistent with jet-entrainment of molecular gas, potentially associated with
the Orion-KL outflow system. We also present and discuss the Pfund beta and H2
emission in the region.
