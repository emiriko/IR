In this paper, we investigate the entanglement degrees of pseudoscalar meson
states via quantum algebra Y(su(3)). By making use of transition effect of
generators J of Y(su(3)), we construct various transition operators in terms of
J of Y(su(3)), and act them on eta-pion-eta mixing meson state. The
entanglement degrees of both the initial state and final state are calculated
with the help of entropy theory. The diagrams of entanglement degrees are
presented. Our result shows that a state with desired entanglement degree can
be achieved by acting proper chosen transition operator on an initial state.
This sheds new light on the connect among quantum information, particle physics
and Yangian algebra.
