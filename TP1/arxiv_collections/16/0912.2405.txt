Liquid xenon is a suitable material for a dark matter search. For future
large scale experiments, single phase detectors are attractive due to their
simple configuration and scalability. However, in order to reduce backgrounds,
they need to fully rely on liquid xenon's self-shielding property. A prototype
detector was developed at Kamioka Observatory to establish vertex and energy
reconstruction methods and to demonstrate the self-shielding power against
gamma rays from outside of the detector. Sufficient self-shielding power for
future experiments was obtained.
