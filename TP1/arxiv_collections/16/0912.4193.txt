We propose a few selected experimental approaches to show that new-generation
instruments can give a direct access to significant observables on the density
dependence of the symmetry energy in the nuclear equation of state. The form of
such dependence is investigated within the Stochastic Mean Field model, coupled
to a secondary-decay treatment.
