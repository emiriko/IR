We study the correlation between spin-independent and spin-dependent
scattering in the context of MSSM neutralino dark matter for both thermal and
non-thermal histories. We explore the generality of this relationship with
reference to other models. We discuss why either fine-tuning or numerical
coincidences are necessary for the correlation to break down. We derive upper
bounds on spin-dependent scattering mediated by a Z boson.
