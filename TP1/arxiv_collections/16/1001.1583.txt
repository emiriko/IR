We study the dynamics of solitons as solutions to the perturbed KdV (pKdV)
equation $\partial_t u = -\partial_x (\partial_x^2 u + 3u^2-bu)$, where $b(x,t)
= b_0(hx,ht)$, $h\ll 1$ is a slowly varying, but not small, potential. We
option an explicit description of the trajectory of the soliton parameters of
scale and position on the dynamically relevant time scale $\delta h^{-1}\log
h^{-1}$, together with an estimate on the error of size $h^{1/2}$. In addition
to the Lyapunov analysis commonly applied to these problems, we use a local
virial estimate due to Martel-Merle (2005). The results are supported by
numerics. The proof does not rely on the inverse scattering machinery and is
expected to carry through for the $L^2$ subcritical gKdV-$p$ equation, $1<p<5$.
The case of $p=3$, the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation, is
structurally simpler and more precise results can be obtained by the method of
Holmer-Zworski (2007).
