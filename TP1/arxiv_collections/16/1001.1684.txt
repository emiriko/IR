A simulation study is performed to investigate the dynamics of coupled
Langmuir waves (LWs) and ion-acoustic waves (IAWs) in an unmagnetized plasma.
The effects of dispersion due to charge separation and the density nonlinearity
associated with the IAWs, are considered to modify the properties of Langmuir
solitons, as well as to model the dynamics of relatively large amplitude wave
envelopes. It is found that the Langmuir wave electric field, indeed, increases
by the effect of ion-wave nonlinearity (IWN). Use of a low-dimensional model,
based on three Fourier modes shows that a transition to temporal chaos is
possible, when the length scale of the linearly excited modes is larger than
that of the most unstable ones. The chaotic behaviors of the unstable modes are
identified by the analysis of Lyapunov exponent spectra. The space-time
evolution of the coupled LWs and IAWs shows that the IWN can cause the
excitation of many unstable harmonic modes, and can lead to strong IAW
emission. This occurs when the initial wave field is relatively large or the
length scale of IAWs is larger than the soliton characteristic size. Numerical
simulation also reveals that many solitary patterns can be excited and
generated through the modulational instability (MI) of unstable harmonic modes.
As time goes on, these solitons are seen to appear in the spatially partial
coherence (SPC) state due to the free ion-acoustic radiation as well as in the
state of spatiotemporal chaos (STC) due to collision and fusion in the
stochastic motion. The latter results the redistribution of initial wave energy
into a few modes with small length scales, which may lead to the onset of
Langmuir turbulence in laboratory as well as space plasmas.
