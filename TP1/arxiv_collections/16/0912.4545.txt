Unambiguous evidence for the microscopic coexistence of ferromagnetism and
superconductivity in UCoGe ($T_{\rm Curie} \sim 2.5$ K and $T_{\rm SC}$ $\sim$
0.6 K) is reported from $^{59}$Co nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR). The
$^{59}$Co-NQR signal below 1 K indicates ferromagnetism throughout the sample
volume, while nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ in the ferromagnetic
(FM) phase decreases below $T_{\rm SC}$ due to the opening of the
superconducting(SC) gap. The SC state was found to be inhomogeneous, suggestive
of a self-induced vortex state, potentially realizable in a FM superconductor.
In addition, the $^{59}$Co-NQR spectrum around $T_{\rm Curie}$ show that the FM
transition in UCoGe possesses a first-order character, which is consistent with
the theoretical prediction that the low-temperature FM transition in itinerant
magnets is generically of first-order.
