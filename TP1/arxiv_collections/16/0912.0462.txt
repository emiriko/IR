We consider the growth of cosmological perturbations in modified gravity
models where a scalar field mediates a non-universal Yukawa force between
different matter species. The growth of the density contrast is altered for
scales below the Compton wave-length of the scalar field. As the universe
expands, the Compton wave-length varies in time in such a way that scales which
were outside the range of the scalar field force may feel it at a lower
redshift. In this case, both the exponent $\gamma$ measuring the growth of Cold
Dark Matter perturbations and the slip function representing the ratio of the
two Newtonian potentials $\psi$ and $\phi$ may differ from their values in
General Relativity at low redshift.
