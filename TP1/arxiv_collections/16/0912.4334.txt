For a variation of Hodge structure over a punctured disk, Green, Griffiths
and Kerr introduced a N\'eron model which is a Hausdorff space that includes
values of admissible normal functions. On the other hand, Kato, Nakayama and
Usui introduced a N\'eron model as a logarithmic manifold using log mixed Hodge
theory. This work constructs a homeomorphism between these two models.
