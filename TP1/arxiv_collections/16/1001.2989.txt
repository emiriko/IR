We report results of the 2006 April multi-wavelengths campaign of SS 433,
focusing on X-ray data observed with Suzaku at two orbital phases (in- and
out-of- eclipse) and simultaneous optical spectroscopic observations. By
analyzing the Fe25 K_alpha lines originating from the jets, we detect rapid
variability of the Doppler shifts, dz/dt ~ 0.019/0.33 day^-1, which is larger
than those expected from the precession and/or nodding motion. This phenomenon
probably corresponding to "jitter" motions observed for the first time in
X-rays, for which significant variability both in the jet angle and intrinsic
speed is required. From the time lag of optical Doppler curves from those of
X-rays, we estimate the distance of the optical jets from the base to be ~(3-4)
\times 10^14 cm. Based on the radiatively cooling jet model, we determine the
innermost temperature of the jets to be T_0 = 13 +/- 2 keV and 16 +/- 3 keV
(the average of the blue and red jets) for the out-of-eclipse and in-eclipse
phase, respectively, from the line intensity ratio of Fe25 K_alpha and Fe26
K_alpha. While the broad band continuum spectra over the 5--40 keV band in
eclipse is consistent with a multi-temperature bremsstrahlung emission expected
from the jets, and its reflection component from cold matter, the
out-of-eclipse spectrum is harder than the jet emission with the base
temperature determined above, implying the presence of an additional hard
component.
