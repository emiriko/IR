In this paper we extend a method of Arveson and McCullough to prove a
tangential interpolation theorem for subalgebras of $H^\infty$. This tangential
interpolation result implies a Toelitz corona theorem. In particular, it is
shown that the set of matrix positivity conditions is indexed by cyclic
subspaces, which is analogous to the results obtained for the ball and the
polydisk algebra by Trent-Wick and Douglas-Sarkar.
