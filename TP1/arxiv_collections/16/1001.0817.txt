Preparations for the anapole measurement in Fr indicate the possibility of
performing a similar measurement in a chain of Rb. The sensitivity analysis
based on a single nucleon model shows the potential for placing strong limits
on the nucleon weak interaction parameters. There are values of the magnetic
fields at much lower values than found before that are insensitive to first
order changes in the field. The anapole moment effect in Rb corresponds to an
equivalent electric field that is eighty times smaller than Fr, but the
stability of the isotopes and the current performance of the dipole trap in the
apparatus, presented here, are encouraging for pursuing the measurment.
