A remarkable inconsistency between the calibrated differential time-ordered
data (TOD) of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) mission, which is
the input for map-making, and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature
maps published by the WMAP team is revealed, indicating that there must exist a
serious problem in the map making routine of the WMAP team. This inconsistency
is easy to be confirmed without the use of WMAP map-making software. In view of
the importance of this issue for cosmology study, the authors invite readers to
check it by themselves.
