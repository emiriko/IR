In cold dark matter cosmologies, the most massive dark matter halos are
predicted to undergo rapid growth at z<1. While there is the expectation that
massive galaxies will also rapidly grow via merging, recent observational
studies conclude that the stellar masses of the most massive galaxies grow by
just 30 percent at z<1. We have used the observed space density and clustering
of z<1 red galaxies in Bootes to determine how these galaxies populate dark
matter halos. In the most massive dark matter halos, central galaxy stellar
mass is proportional to halo mass to the power of a third and much of the
stellar mass resides within satellite galaxies. As a consequence, the most
massive galaxies grow slowly even though they reside within rapidly growing
dark matter halos.
