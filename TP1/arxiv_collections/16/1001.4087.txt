NGC404 is a nearly face-on nearby low-luminosity lenticular galaxy. Probing
its characteristics provides a wealth of information on the details of possible
evolution processes of dS0 galaxies which may not be possible in other, more
distant objects. In order to study its kinematics and star formation history,
we obtained long slit spectroscopy at the OHP 1m93 telescope along the major
and minor axes of NGC404. The spectra have a resolution R = 3600 covering a
wavelength range from 4600 to 5500 A. The data are fitted against the Pegase.HR
stellar population models to derive simultaneously the internal stellar
kinematics, ages and metallicities. Firstly, the global properties of the
galaxy are analyzed by fitting a single model and to the data and looking at
the kinematic variations and SSP equivalent age and metallicities as a function
of radius. Afterwards, the stellar populations are decomposed into 4 components
that are individually analyzed. NGC404 clearly shows two radial velocity
inversions along its major axis. The kinematically decoupled core rotates in
the same direction as the neutral hydrogen shell that surrounds the galaxy. We
resolved the star formation history in the core of the galaxy ino 4 events: A
very young (< 150 Myr, and [Fe/H] = 0.4) component with constant on-going star
formation, a second young (430 Myr) component with [Fe/H] = 0.1, an
intermediate population (1.7 Gyr) which has [Fe/H] = -0.05 and, finally, an old
(12 Gyr) component with [Fe/H] = -1.26. The two young components fade very
quickly with radius, leaving only the intermediate and old population at a
radius of 25" (370 pc) from the centre. We conclude that NGC404 had a spiral
morphology about 1 Gyr ago and that one or many merger events has triggered a
morphological transition.
