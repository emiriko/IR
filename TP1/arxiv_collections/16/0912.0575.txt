We study critical coupling (CC) in a system of two coupled negative index
medium (NIM) layers leading to near-total suppression of both reflection and
transmission at specified frequencies. The tunability of the CC frequency is
demonstrated by varying the angle of incidence retaining the full causal
response for the NIM materials.
