We study the evolution of magnetized and rigidly rotating neutron stars
within a fully general relativistic implementation of ideal
magnetohydrodynamics with no assumed symmetries in three spatial dimensions.
The stars are modeled as rotating, magnetized polytropic stars and we examine
diverse scenarios to study their dynamics and stability properties. In
particular we concentrate on the stability of the stars and possible critical
behavior. In addition to their intrinsic physical significance, we use these
evolutions as further tests of our implementation which incorporates new
developments to handle magnetized systems.
