Observations of high energy emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) constrain
the extreme physical conditions associated with these energetic cosmic
explosions. The Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space
Telescope, a pair conversion telescope, observes energetic quanta from 30 MeV
to > 300 GeV. Synergy of the LAT with the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
enlarges the energy coverage to ~ 7.5 decades, very useful for studying the GRB
emission itself. Prompt optical observations and their possible correlations
with photon emission at LAT energies help our understanding of the physical
mechanisms behind these events. The prompt response times and large fields of
of the ROTSE-III telescopes make afterglow observations possible for Fermi
bursts with ~ 1 degree localized errors. As an example, GRB 090902B, was
observed starting ~ 4803 s after the burst. This is the earliest ground-based
optical detection ever made for long-duration bursts sensed by the LAT. The
ROTSE detection classifies the optical afterglow of GRB 090902B as one of the
brightest.
