We calculate differential cross sections for exclusive double diffractive
(EDD) production of open charm in proton-proton and proton-antiproton
collisions. Sizeable cross sections are found. The EDD contribution constitutes
about 1 % of the total inclusive cross section for open charm production. A few
differential distributions are shown and discussed. The EDD contribution falls
faster both with transverse momentum of the $c$ quark/antiquark and the $c \bar
c$ invariant mass than in the inclusive case.
