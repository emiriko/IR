We show how the general features of the electronic structure of the Fe-based
high-Tc superconductors are a natural setting for a selective localization of
the conduction electrons to arise. Slave-spin and Dynamical mean-field
calculations support this picture and allow for a comparison of the magnetic
properties with experiments.
