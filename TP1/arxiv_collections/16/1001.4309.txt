We propose a real-time digital holographic microscopy, that enables
simultaneous multiple reconstructed images with arbitrary resolution, depth and
positions, using Shifted-Fresnel diffraction instead of Fresnel diffraction. In
this system, we used four graphics processing units (GPU) for multiple
reconstructions in real-time. We show the demonstration of four reconstruction
images from a hologram with arbitrary depths, positions, and resolutions.
