The saturation momentum seeing in the nuclear infinite momentum frame is
directly related to transverse momentum broadening of partons propagating
through the medium in the nuclear rest frame. Calculation of broadening within
the color dipole approach including the effects of saturation in the nucleus,
gives rise to an equation which describes well data on broadening in Drell-Yan
reaction and heavy quarkonium production.
