The face ring of a simplicial complex modulo m generic linear forms is shown
to have finite local cohomology if and only if the link of every face of
dimension m or more is `nonsingular', i.e., has the homology of a wedge of
spheres of the expected dimension. This is derived from an enumerative result
for local cohomology of face rings modulo generic linear forms, as compared
with local cohomology of the face ring itself. The enumerative result is
generalized in slightly weaker form to squarefree modules. A concept of
`Cohen-Macaulay in codimension c' is defined and characterized for arbitrary
finitely generated modules and coherent sheaves. For the face ring of an
r-dimensional complex Delta, it is equivalent to nonsingularity of Delta in
dimension r-c; for a coherent sheaf on projective space, this condition is
shown to be equivalent to the same condition on any single generic hyperplane
section. The characterization of nonsingularity in dimension m via finite local
cohomology thus generalizes from face rings to arbitrary graded modules.
