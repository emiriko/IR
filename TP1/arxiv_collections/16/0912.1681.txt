The magnetic field of the classical T Tauri star V2129 Oph can be modeled
approximately by superposing slightly tilted dipole and octupole moments, with
polar magnetic field strengths of 0.35kG and 1.2kG respectively (Donati et al.
2007). Here we construct a numerical model of V2129 Oph incorporating this
result and simulate accretion onto the star. Simulations show that the disk is
truncated by the dipole component and matter flows towards the star in two
funnel streams. Closer to the star, the flow is redirected by the octupolar
component, with some of the matter flowing towards the high-latitude poles, and
the rest into the octupolar belts. The shape and position of the spots differ
from those in a pure dipole case, where crescent-shaped spots are observed at
the intermediate latitudes. Simulations show that if the disk is truncated at
the distance of 6.2 R_* which is comparable with the co-rotation radius, 6.8
R_*, then the high-latitude polar spots dominate, but the accretion rate
obtained from the simulations is about an order of magnitude lower than the
observed one. The accretion rate matches the observed one if the disk is
disrupted much closer to the star, at 3.4 R_*. However, the octupolar belt
spots strongly dominate. Better match has been obtained in experiments with a
dipole field twice as strong. The torque on the star from the
disk-magnetosphere interaction is small, and the time-scale of spin evolution,
2 x10^7-10^9 years is longer than the 2x10^6 years age of V2129 Oph. The
external magnetic flux of the star is strongly influenced by the disk: the
field lines connecting the disk and the star inflate and form magnetic towers
above and below the disk. The potential (vacuum) approximation is still valid
inside the Alfv\'en (magnetospheric) surface where the magnetic stress
dominates over the matter stress.
