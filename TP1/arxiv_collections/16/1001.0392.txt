Ten days of commissioning data (Quarter 0) and thirty-three days of science
data (Quarter 1) yield instrumental flux timeseries of ~150,000 stars that were
combed for transit events, termed Threshold Crossing Events (TCE), each having
a total detection statistic above 7.1-sigma. TCE light curves are modeled as
star+planet systems. Those returning a companion radius smaller than 2R_J are
assigned a KOI (Kepler Object of Interest) number. The raw flux, pixel flux,
and flux-weighted centroids of every KOI are scrutinized to assess the
likelihood of being an astrophysical false-positive versus the likelihood of a
being a planetary companion. This vetting using Kepler data is referred to as
data validation. Herein, we describe the data validation metrics and graphics
used to identify viable planet candidates amongst the KOIs. Light curve
modeling tests for a) the difference in depth of the odd- versus even-numbered
transits, b) evidence of ellipsoidal variations, and c) evidence of a secondary
eclipse event at phase=0.5. Flux-weighted centroids are used to test for
signals correlated with transit events with a magnitude and direction
indicative of a background eclipsing binary. Centroid timeseries are
complimented by analysis of images taken in-transit versus out-of-transit, the
difference often revealing the pixel contributing the most to the flux change
during transit. Examples are shown to illustrate each test. Candidates passing
data validation are submitted to ground-based observers for further
false-positive elimination or confirmation/characterization.
