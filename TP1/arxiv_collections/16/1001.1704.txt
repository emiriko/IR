We address the effects of realistic photodetection, with nonunit quantum
efficiency and background noise (dark counts), on the performances of quantum
communication schemes based on photon-number entangled states. We consider
channels based on Gaussian twin-beam states and non-Gaussian two-mode coherent
states and evaluate the channel capacity by optimizing the bit discrimination
threshold. We found that TWB-based channels are more robust against noise than
TMC-based ones and that this result is almost independent on the statistics of
dark counts.
