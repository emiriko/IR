We report the first study of the nucleon where the full Poincare-covariant
structure of the three-quark amplitude is implemented in the Faddeev equation.
We employ an interaction kernel which is consistent with contemporary studies
of meson properties and aspects of chiral symmetry and its dynamical breaking,
thus yielding a comprehensive approach to hadron physics. The resulting
current-mass evolution of the nucleon mass compares well with lattice data and
deviates only by ~5% from the quark-diquark result obtained in previous
studies.
