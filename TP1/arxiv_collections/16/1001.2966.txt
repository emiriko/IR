Dunkel and Trigger [Phys. Rev. A {71}, 052102 (2005)] show that the Leipnik's
joint entropy monotonously increases for the initially maximally classical
Gaussian wave packet for a free particle. After expressing the joint entropy of
the general Gaussian wave packets for quadratic Hamiltonians as $S (t) = ln
(e/2) + ln (2 Delta x (t) Delta p (t)/hbar)$, we show that a class of general
Gaussian wave packets does not warrant the monotonous increase of the joint
entropy. We propose that the random-phase entropy with respect to the squeeze
angle always monotonously increases even for non-maximally classical states.
