We study the relevance of different renormalization schemes in Resonance
Chiral Theory. The SS-PP correlator is explicitly computed at the one-loop
level. Demanding the operator product expansion behaviour at short distances
produces a new set of constraints, as some logarithmic terms are absent at high
energies. Likewise, the loops induce subleading corrections in 1/Nc to the
leading-order constraints, the Weinberg sum rules. We find that the
short-distance conditions from a minimally subtracted scheme generate large
uncertainties which, alternatively, can be largely simplified in other schemes.
