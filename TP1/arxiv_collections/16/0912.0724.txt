The low-energy singlet dynamics of the Quantum Heisenberg Antiferromagnet on
the Kagome lattice is described by a quantitative Quantum Dimer Model. Using
advanced numerical tools, the latter is shown to exhibit Valence Bond Crystal
order with a large 36-site unit cell and hidden degeneracy between even and odd
parities. Evidences are given that this groundstate lies in the vicinity of a
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ dimer liquid region separated by a Quantum Critical Point.
Implications regarding numerical analysis and experiments are discussed.
