We consider equation systems of the form X_1 = f_1(X_1, ..., X_n), ..., X_n =
f_n(X_1, ..., X_n) where f_1, ..., f_n are polynomials with positive real
coefficients. In vector form we denote such an equation system by X = f(X) and
call f a system of positive polynomials, short SPP. Equation systems of this
kind appear naturally in the analysis of stochastic models like stochastic
context-free grammars (with numerous applications to natural language
processing and computational biology), probabilistic programs with procedures,
web-surfing models with back buttons, and branching processes. The least
nonnegative solution mu f of an SPP equation X = f(X) is of central interest
for these models. Etessami and Yannakakis have suggested a particular version
of Newton's method to approximate mu f.
  We extend a result of Etessami and Yannakakis and show that Newton's method
starting at 0 always converges to mu f. We obtain lower bounds on the
convergence speed of the method. For so-called strongly connected SPPs we prove
the existence of a threshold k_f such that for every i >= 0 the (k_f+i)-th
iteration of Newton's method has at least i valid bits of mu f. The proof
yields an explicit bound for k_f depending only on syntactic parameters of f.
We further show that for arbitrary SPP equations Newton's method still
converges linearly: there are k_f>=0 and alpha_f>0 such that for every i>=0 the
(k_f+alpha_f i)-th iteration of Newton's method has at least i valid bits of mu
f. The proof yields an explicit bound for alpha_f; the bound is exponential in
the number of equations, but we also show that it is essentially optimal.
Constructing a bound for k_f is still an open problem. Finally, we also provide
a geometric interpretation of Newton's method for SPPs.
