We discuss a general theoretical framework for the study of bound states made
of two heavy quarks. For states below threshold, the framework has been
developed to the level of providing precision studies for several charmonium
and bottomonium observables. For states above threshold, like some of the newly
discovered charmonium-like resonances at the B factories, a systematic
description exists so far only for specific systems.
