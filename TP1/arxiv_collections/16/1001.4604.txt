The cross sections of the pd -> 3He eta, pd -> 3He pi0 pi0 pi0 and pd -> 3He
pi+ pi- pi0 reactions have been measured at beam kinetic energies T_p= 1360 MeV
and T_p= 1450 MeV using the CELSIUS/WASA detector setup. At both energies, the
differential cross section dsigma/dOmega of the eta meson in the pd -> 3He eta
reaction shows a strong forward-backward asymmetry in the CMS. The ratio
between the pd -> 3He pi+ pi- pi0 and the pd -> 3He pi0 pi0 pi0 cross sections
has been analysed in terms of isospin amplitudes. The reconstructed invariant
mass distributions of the pi-pi, 3He-pi and 3He-2pi systems provide hints on
the role of nucleon resonances in the 3pi production process.
