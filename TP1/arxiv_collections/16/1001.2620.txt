We consider continuous-time average consensus dynamics in which the agents'
states are communicated through uniform quantizers. Solutions to the resulting
system are defined in the Krasowskii sense and are proven to converge to
conditions of "practical consensus". To cope with undesired chattering
phenomena we introduce a hysteretic quantizer, and we study the convergence
properties of the resulting dynamics by a hybrid system approach.
