We describe here a new concept of one group chasing another, called "group
chase and escape", by presenting a simple model. We will show that even a
simple model can demonstrate rather rich and complex behavior. In particular,
there are cases in which an optimal number of chasers exists for a given number
of escapees (or targets) to minimize the cost of catching all targets. We have
also found an indication of self-organized spatial structures formed by both
groups.
