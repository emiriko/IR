Franson-like setups are inadequate for multiparty Bell experiments with
energy-time entanglement because postselected events can depend on the local
settings, and local models can exploit this feature to reproduce the quantum
predictions, even in the case of ideal devices. We extend a previously
introduced interferometric scheme [A. Cabello, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 102,
040401 (2009)] to solve this problem in the n-qubit and n-qunit cases. In
addition, the proposed setups allow us to prepare and test n-qubit
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and $(\sum_{i=1}^n |i ... i>)/\sqrt{n}$ energy-time
entangled states.
