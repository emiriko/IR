We introduce a fractal version of the pinwheel substitution tiling. There are
thirteen basic prototiles, all of which have fractal boundaries. These tiles,
along with their reflections and rotations, create a tiling space which is
mutually locally derivable from the pinwheel tiling space. Interesting
rotational properties, symmetries, and relative tile frequency are discussed
for the tiling space associated with the fractal pinwheel tiling.
