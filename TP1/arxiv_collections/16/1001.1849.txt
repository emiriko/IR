The microcanonical dynamics of an ensemble of random magnetic dipoles in a
needle has been investigated. Analyzing magnetic reversal times, a transition
between a chaotic paramagnetic phase and an integrable ferromagnetic phase has
been numerically found. In particular, a simple criterium for transition has
been formulated. Close to the transition point the statistics of average
magnetic reversal times and fluctuations have been studied and critical
exponents numerically given.
