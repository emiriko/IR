In this paper, we study an adaptive finite element method for a class of a
nonlinear eigenvalue problems that may be of nonconvex energy functional and
consider its applications to quantum chemistry. We prove the convergence of
adaptive finite element approximations and present several numerical examples
of micro-structure of matter calculations that support our theory.
