The Multiconjugate Adaptive optics Demonstrator (MAD) for ESO-Very Large
Telescopes (VLT) will demonstrate on sky the MultiConjugate Adaptive Optics
(MCAO) technique. In this paper the laboratory tests relative to the first
preliminary acceptance in Europe of the Layer Oriented (LO) Wavefront Sensor
(WFS) for MAD will be described: the capabilities of the LO approach have been
checked and the ability of the WFS to measure phase screens positioned at
different altitudes has been experimented. The LO WFS was opto-mechanically
integrated and aligned in INAF - Astrophysical Observatory of Arcetri before
the delivering to ESO (Garching) to be installed on the final optical bench.
The LO WFS looks for up to 8 reference stars on a 2arcmin Field of View and up
to 8 pyramids can be positioned where the focal spot images of the reference
stars form, splitting the light in four beams. Then two objectives conjugated
at different altitudes simultaneously produce a quadruple pupil image of each
reference star.
