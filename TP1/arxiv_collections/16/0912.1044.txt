It is developed the phase-space formulation for the Type IIA superstring on
the AdS_4 x CP^3 background in the kappa-symmetry light-cone gauge for which
the light-like directions are taken from the D=3 Minkowski boundary of AdS_4.
After fixing bosonic light-cone gauge the superstring Hamiltonian is expressed
as a function of the transverse physical variables and in the quadratic
approximation corresponds to the light-cone gauge-fixed IIA superstring in flat
space.
