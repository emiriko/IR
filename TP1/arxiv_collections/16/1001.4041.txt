In order to construct a quantum theory of gravity, we may have to abandon
certain assumptions we were making. In particular, the concept of spacetime as
a continuum substratum is questioned. Causal Sets is an attempt to construct a
quantum theory of gravity starting with a fundamentally discrete spacetime. In
this contribution we review the whole approach, focusing on some recent
developments in the kinematics and dynamics of the approach.
