This monograph (1977) is a continuation of the monograph "The construction of
the Sun and planets of the solar system from the viewpoint of mechanics of the
inertless mass" (refer to: http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0701258, part 1,
http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0701259, part 2). This manuscript concerning the
studies of the energy structure of the Sun and planets was discovered in the
archive of the author in 2009. Being a draft version, it contains some remarks
of the author on other subjects and has a free style. The editor has omitted
all the retreats of the author. Thus, the work is a final study and is intended
for the reader who is familiar with previous studies of the author that are
placed in this Archive.
