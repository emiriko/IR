This paper reviews application of Artificial Neural Networks in Aircraft
Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO). MRO solutions are designed to
facilitate the authoring and delivery of maintenance and repair information to
the line maintenance technicians who need to improve aircraft repair turn
around time, optimize the efficiency and consistency of fleet maintenance and
ensure regulatory compliance. The technical complexity of aircraft systems,
especially in avionics, has increased to the point at which it poses a
significant troubleshotting and repair challenge for MRO personnel. As per the
existing scenario, the MRO systems in place are inefficient. In this paper, we
propose the centralization and integration of the MRO database to increase its
efficiency. Moreover the implementation of Artificial Neural Networks in this
system can rid the system of many of its deficiencies. In order to make the
system more efficient we propose to integrate all the modules so as to reduce
the efficacy of repair.
