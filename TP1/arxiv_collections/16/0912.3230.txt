We present solution of self-consistent equations for the N3LO nuclear energy
density functional. We derive general expressions for the mean fields expressed
as differential operators depending on densities and for the densities
expressed in terms of derivatives of wave functions. These expressions are then
specified to the case of spherical symmetry. We also present the computer
program HOSPHE (v1.00), which solves the self-consistent equations by using the
expansion of single-particle wave functions on the spherical harmonic
oscillator basis.
