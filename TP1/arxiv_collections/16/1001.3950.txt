Recent anomalies in cosmic rays data, namely from the PAMELA collaboration,
can be interpreted in terms of TeV scale decaying/annihilating Dark Matter. We
analyze the impact of radiative corrections coming from the electroweak sector
of the Standard Model on the spectrum of the final products at the interaction
point. As an example, we consider virtual one loop corrections and real gauge
bosons emission in the case of a very heavy vector boson annihilating into
fermions. We show that the effect of electroweak corrections is relevant, but
not as big as sometimes claimed in the literature. At such high scales, one
loop electroweak effects are so big that eventually higher orders/resummations
have to be considered: we advocate for the inclusion of these effects in parton
shower Montecarlos aiming at the description of TeV scale physics.
