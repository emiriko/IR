We study the ratio of luminous-to-faint red sequence galaxies in both
optically and X-ray selected galaxy clusters in the poorly studied redshift
range 0.05< z<0.19. The X-ray selected sample consists of 112 clusters based on
the ROSAT All-Sky Survey, while the optical sample consists of 266 clusters
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our results are consistent with the presence
of a trend in luminous-to-faint ratio with redshift, confirming that downsizing
is continuous from high to low redshift.
  After correcting for the variations with redshift using a partial Spearman
analysis, we find no significant relationship between luminous-to-faint ratio
and X-ray luminosity of the host cluster sample, in contrast to recent
suggestions. Finally, we investigate the stacked colour-magnitude relations of
these samples finding no significant differences between the slopes for
optically and X-ray selected clusters. The colour-magnitude slopes are
consistent with the values obtained in similar studies, but not with
predictions of theoretical models.
