The design of highly wavelength tunable semiconductor laser structures is
presented. The system is based on a one dimensional photonic crystal cavity
consisting of two patterned, doubly-clamped nanobeams, otherwise known as a
"zipper" cavity. Zipper cavities are highly dispersive with respect to the gap
between nanobeams in which extremely strong radiation pressure forces exist.
Schemes for controlling the zipper cavity wavelength both optically and
electrically are presented. Tuning ranges as high as 75nm are achieved for a
nominal design wavelength of 1.3micron. Sensitivity of the mechanically
compliant laser structure to thermal noise is considered, and it is found that
dynamic back-action of radiation pressure in the form of an optical or
electrical spring can be used to stabilize the laser frequency. Fabrication of
zipper cavity laser structures in GaAs material with embedded self-assembled
InAs quantum dots is presented, along with measurements of photoluminescence
spectroscopy of the zipper cavity modes.
