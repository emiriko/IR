Image filtering algorithms are applied on images to remove the different
types of noise that are either present in the image during capturing or
injected in to the image during transmission. Underwater images when captured
usually have Gaussian noise, speckle noise and salt and pepper noise. In this
work, five different image filtering algorithms are compared for the three
different noise types. The performances of the filters are compared using the
Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Square Error (MSE). The modified
spatial median filter gives desirable results in terms of the above two
parameters for the three different noise. Forty underwater images are taken for
study.
