We have investigated the energy correlation of the two electrons from
nonsequential double ionization of helium atom in 800 nm laser fields at
intensities below the recollision threshold by quantum calculations. The
circular arcs structure of the correlated electron momentum spectra reveals a
resonant double ionization process in which the two electrons transit from
doubly excited states into continuum states by simultaneously absorbing and
sharing excess energy in integer units of the photon energy. Coulomb repulsion
between the two electrons in continuum states is responsible for the dominant
back-to-back electron emission and two intensity-independent cutoffs in the
two-electron energy spectra.
