We formulate (N=1, d=11) supergravity in components in light-cone gauge
(LC_2) to order $\kappa$. In this formulation, we use judicious gauge choices
and the associated constraint relations to express the metric, three-form and
gravitino entirely in terms of the physical degrees of freedom in the theory.
