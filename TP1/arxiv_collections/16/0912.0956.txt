Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) allows parties to know the result of
cooperative computation while preserving privacy of individual data. Secure sum
computation is an important application of SMC. In our proposed protocols
parties are allowed to compute the sum while keeping their individual data
secret with increased computation complexity for hacking individual data. In
this paper the data of individual party is broken into a fixed number of
segments. For increasing the complexity we have used the randomization
technique with segmentation
