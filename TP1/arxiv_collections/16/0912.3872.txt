I study hard collisions between unpolarized protons and antiprotons where a
lepton-antilepton pair is detected in coincidence with a final
proton-antiproton pair, and no more particles are produced, in the regime 10
GeV^2 << s << 1000 GeV^2, M > 4 GeV, q_T < 3 GeV/c. The present work is
centered on azimuthal asymmetries. Because of momentum conservation, a
Boer-Mulders term in the momentum distribution of a quark implies a balancing
effect in the momentum distribution of some spectators. This produces azimuthal
asymmetries of the final hadrons. To analyze this, I have organized a
parton-level MonteCarlo generator where a standard cos(2phi)-asymmetry of the
dilepton distribution is produced, thanks to a soft rescattering process
between an active quark coming from a hadron and a spectator anti-diquark
coming from the other hadron. This produces cos(2phi)-asymmetries of the final
hadron pair. Hadron and lepton asymmetries have the same size.
