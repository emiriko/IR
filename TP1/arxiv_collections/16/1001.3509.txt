In this paper, we continue our study of calculating the cross section by the
spinor method, i.e., performing the phase space integration using the spinor
method. We have focused on the case where the physical momenta are massive and
in pure 4D. We established the framework of such a new method and presented
several examples, including two real progresses: $Z^0\to l^+ l^- H$ and
$\bar{qq} \to \bar{ff} H^0$.
