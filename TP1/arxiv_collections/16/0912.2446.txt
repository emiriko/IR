Processes involving flavor changing neutral currents (FCNC) provide excellent
signatures with which to search for evidence of new physics. They have very
small branching fractions in the Standard Model since they are highly
suppressed by Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism. They occur only
through higher order diagrams, and new particles contributions can provide a
significant enhancements, which would be an uniquevocal signs of physics beyond
the Standard Model. In this paper we present the most recent measurements on
FCNC processes performed by CDF and D0 Collaborations, while last section is
devote to the charm physics at CDF.
