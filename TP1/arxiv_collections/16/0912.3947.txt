We show that an ensemble of identical d-level atoms can be efficiently
described by d-1 collective oscillator degrees of freedom in the vicinity of a
product state with all atoms in the same, but otherwise arbitrary
single-particle state. We apply our description to two different kinds of spin
squeezing: (i) when each spin-F atom is individually squeezed without creating
interatomic entanglement and (ii) when a particular collective atomic
oscillator mode is squeezed via quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement and
feedback. When combined in sequence, the order of the two methods is relevant
in the final degree of squeezing. We also discuss the role of the two kinds of
squeezing when multi-sublevel atoms are used as quantum memories for light.
