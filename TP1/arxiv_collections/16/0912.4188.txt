Computer science is a relatively young discipline combining science,
engineering, and mathematics. The main flavors of computer science research
involve the theoretical development of conceptual models for the different
aspects of computing and the more applicative building of software artifacts
and assessment of their properties. In the computer science publication
culture, conferences are an important vehicle to quickly move ideas, and
journals often publish deeper versions of papers already presented at
conferences. These peculiarities of the discipline make computer science an
original research field within the sciences, and, therefore, the assessment of
classical bibliometric laws is particularly important for this field. In this
paper, we study the skewness of the distribution of citations to papers
published in computer science publication venues (journals and conferences). We
find that the skewness in the distribution of mean citedness of different
venues combines with the asymmetry in citedness of articles in each venue,
resulting in a highly asymmetric citation distribution with a power law tail.
Furthermore, the skewness of conference publications is more pronounced than
the asymmetry of journal papers. Finally, the impact of journal papers, as
measured with bibliometric indicators, largely dominates that of proceeding
papers.
