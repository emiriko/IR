We re-visit the phase diagram of the frustrated spin-1/2 ladder with two
competing inter-chain antiferromagnetic exchanges, rung coupling J_\perp and
diagonal coupling J_\times. We suggest, based on the accurate renormalization
group analysis of the low-energy Hamiltonian of the ladder, that marginal
inter-chain current-current interaction plays central role in destabilizing
previously predicted intermediate columnar dimer phase in the vicinity of
classical degeneracy line J_\perp = 2J_\times. Following this insight we then
suggest that changing these competing inter-chain exchanges from the previously
considered antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic ones eliminates the issue of
the marginal interactions altogether and dramatically expands the region of
stability of the columnar dimer phase. This analytical prediction is
convincingly confirmed by the numerical density matrix renormalization group
and exact diagonalization calculations as well as by the perturbative
calculation in the strong rung-coupling limit. The phase diagram for
ferromagnetic J_\perp and J_\times is determined.
