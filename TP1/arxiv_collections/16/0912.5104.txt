We have used a sample of photon+3 jets events collected by the D0 experiment
with an integrated luminosity of about 1 fb^-1 to determine the fraction of
events with double parton scattering (f_DP) in a single ppbar collision at
sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV. The DP fraction and effective cross section (sigma_eff), a
process-independent scale parameter related to the parton density inside the
nucleon, are measured in three intervals of the second (ordered in pT) jet
transverse momentum pT_jet2 within the range 15 < pT_jet2 < 30 GeV. In this
range, f_DP varies between 0.23 < f_DP < 0.47, while sigma_eff has the average
value sigma_eff_ave = 16.4 +- 0.3(stat) +- 2.3(syst) mb.
