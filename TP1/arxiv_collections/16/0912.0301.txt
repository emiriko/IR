We present a functional formalism to derive a generating functional for
correlation functions of a multiplicative stochastic process represented by a
Langevin equation. We deduce a path integral over a set of fermionic and
bosonic variables without performing any time discretization. The usual
prescriptions to define the Wiener integral appear in our formalism in the
definition of Green functions in the Grassman sector of the theory. We also
study non-perturbative constraints imposed by BRS symmetry and supersymmetry on
correlation functions. We show that the specific prescription to define the
stochastic process is wholly contained in tadpole diagrams. Therefore, in a
supersymmetric theory the stochastic process is uniquely defined since tadpole
contributions cancels at all order of perturbation theory.
