Bayesian inference is now a leading technique for reconstructing phylogenetic
trees from aligned sequence data. In this short note, we formally show that the
maximum posterior tree topology provides a statistically consistent estimate of
a fully-resolved evolutionary tree under a wide variety of conditions. This
includes the inference of gene trees from aligned sequence data across the
entire parameter range of branch lengths, and under general conditions on
priors in models where the usual `identifiability' conditions hold. We extend
this to the inference of species trees from sequence data, where the gene trees
constitute `nuisance parameters', as in the program *BEAST. This note also
addresses earlier concerns raised in the literature questioning the extent to
which statistical consistency for Bayesian methods might hold in general.
