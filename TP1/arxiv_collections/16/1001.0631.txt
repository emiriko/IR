Recently, it has been noticed that the amplification of the amplitude of
curvature perturbation cycle by cycle can lead to a cyclic multiverse scenario,
in which the number of universes increases cycle by cycle. However, this
amplification will also inevitably induce either the ultimate end of
corresponding cycle, or the resulting spectrum of perturbations inside
corresponding universe is not scale invariant, which baffles the existence of
observable universes. In this paper, we propose a design of a cyclic
multiverse, in which the observable universe can emerges naturally. The
significance of a long period of dark energy before the turnaround of each
cycle for this implementing is shown.
