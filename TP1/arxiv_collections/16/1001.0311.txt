We use the factorization method to find the exact eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions for a particle in a box with the delta function potential
$V(x)=\lambda\delta(x-x_{0})$. We show that the presence of the potential
results in the discontinuity of the corresponding ladder operators. The
presence of the delta function potential allows us to obtain the full spectrum
in the first step of the factorization procedure even in the weak coupling
limit $\lambda\to 0$.
