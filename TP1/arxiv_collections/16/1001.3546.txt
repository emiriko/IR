Representations of two bridge knot groups in the isometry group of some
complete Riemannian 3-manifolds as $E^{3}$ (Euclidean 3-space), $H^{3}$
(hyperbolic 3-space) and $ E^{2,1}$ (Minkowski 3-space), using quaternion
algebra theory, are studied. We study the different representations of a
2-generator group in which the generators are send to conjugate elements, by
analyzing the points of an algebraic variety, that we call the \emph{variety of
affine c-representations of}$G$. Each point in this variety correspond to a
representation in the unit group of a quaternion algebra and their affine
deformations.
