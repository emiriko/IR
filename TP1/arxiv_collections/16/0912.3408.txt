We study clustering algorithms based on neighborhood graphs on a random
sample of data points. The question we ask is how such a graph should be
constructed in order to obtain optimal clustering results. Which type of
neighborhood graph should one choose, mutual k-nearest neighbor or symmetric
k-nearest neighbor? What is the optimal parameter k? In our setting, clusters
are defined as connected components of the t-level set of the underlying
probability distribution. Clusters are said to be identified in the
neighborhood graph if connected components in the graph correspond to the true
underlying clusters. Using techniques from random geometric graph theory, we
prove bounds on the probability that clusters are identified successfully, both
in a noise-free and in a noisy setting. Those bounds lead to several
conclusions. First, k has to be chosen surprisingly high (rather of the order n
than of the order log n) to maximize the probability of cluster identification.
Secondly, the major difference between the mutual and the symmetric k-nearest
neighbor graph occurs when one attempts to detect the most significant cluster
only.
