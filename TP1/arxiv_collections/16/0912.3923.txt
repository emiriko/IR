In this paper a novel spatial domain LSB based watermarking scheme for color
Images is proposed. The proposed scheme is of type blind and invisible
watermarking. Our scheme introduces the concept of storing variable number of
bits in each pixel based on the actual color value of pixel. Equal or higher
the color value of channels with respect to intensity of pixel stores higher
number of watermark bits. The Red, Green and Blue channel of the color image
has been used for watermark embedding. The watermark is embedded into selected
channels of pixel. The proposed method supports high watermark embedding
capacity, which is equivalent to the size of cover image. The security of
watermark is preserved by permuting the watermark bits using secret key. The
proposed scheme is found robust to various image processing operations such as
image compression, blurring, salt and pepper noise, filtering and cropping.
