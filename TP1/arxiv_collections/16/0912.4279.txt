Advances in laser and Z-pinch technology, coupled with the development of
plasma diagnostics and the availability of high-performance computers, have
recently stimulated the growth of high-energy density laboratory astrophysics.
In particular a number of experiments have been designed to study radiative
shocks and jets with the aim of shedding new light on physical processes linked
to the ejection and accretion of mass by newly born stars.
  Although general scaling laws are a powerful tools to link laboratory
experiments with astrophysical plasmas, the phenomena modelled are often too
complicated for simple scaling to remain relevant. Nevertheless, the
experiments can still give important insights into the physics of astrophysical
systems and can be used to provide the basic experimental validation of
numerical simulations in regimes of interest to astrophysics.
  We will illustrate the possible links between laboratory experiments,
numerical simulations and astrophysics in the context of stellar jets. First we
will discuss the propagation of stellar jets in a cross-moving interstellar
medium and the scaling to Z-pinch produced jets. Our second example focuses on
slab-jets produced at the PALS (Prague Asterix Laser System) laser installation
and their practical applications to astrophysics. Finally, we illustrate the
limitations of scaling for radiative shocks, which are found at the head of the
most rapid stellar jets.
