The observed radio-optical-X-ray spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 22
hot spots and 45 knots in the jets of 35 active galactic nuclei are complied
from literature and modeled with single-zone lepton models. It is found that
the observed luminosities at 5 GHz (L_5GHz) and at 1 keV (L_1keV) are tightly
correlated, and the two kinds of sources can be roughly separated with a
division of L_1keV=L_5GHz. Our SED fits show that the mechanisms of the X-rays
are diverse. Considering the sources at rest, the synchrotron-self-Compton
(SSC) scattering would dominate the IC process. This model can interpret the
X-rays of some hot spots with a magnetic field strength (B_ssc^delta=1) being
consistent with the equipartition magnetic field (B_eq^delta=1) in one order of
magnitude, but an unreasonably low B_ssc^delta=1 is required to model the
X-rays for all knots. The ratio R_B=B_eq^delta=1/B_ssc^delta=1 is greater than
1 and it is tightly anti-correlated with ratio R_L= L_1keV/L_5GHz for both the
knots and the hot spots. We propose that the deviation may be due to the
neglect of the relativistic bulk motion for these sources. Considering this
effect, we show that the IC/CMB model well explains the X-ray emission for most
sources. Both B_eq' and delta are tentatively correlated with R_L. Corrected by
the beaming effect, the L'_5GHz-L'_1keV relations for the two kinds of sources
are even tighter than the observed ones. These facts suggest that, under the
equipartition condition, the observational differences of the X-rays from the
knots and hot spots may be mainly due the differences on the Doppler boosting
effect and the co-moving magnetic field of the two kinds of sources. Our IC
scattering models predict a prominent GeV-TeV component in the SEDs for some
sources, which are detectable with H.E.S.S. and Fermi/LAT.
