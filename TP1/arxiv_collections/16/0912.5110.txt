We classify non-nilpotent complex structures on 6-nilmanifolds and their
associated invariant balanced metrics. As an application we find a large family
of solutions of the heterotic supersymmetry equations with non-zero flux,
non-flat instanton and constant dilaton satisfying the anomaly cancellation
condition with respect to the Chern connection.
