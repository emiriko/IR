Surface waves on a thin metal filament are described in terms of quantum
electrodynamics. The interaction of surface waves with a quantum oscillator is
discussed in the dipole approximation. The increase in the spontaneous emission
rate of the excited quantum oscillator, the so called Purcell factor, is
evaluated to be as high as ten to the five times.
