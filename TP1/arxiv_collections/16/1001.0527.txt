Squeezed correlations of hadron-antihadron pairs are predicted to appear if
their masses are modified in the hot and dense medium formed in high energy
heavy ion collisions. If discovered experimentally, they would be an
unequivocal evidence of in-medium mass shift found by means of hadronic probes.
We discuss a method proposed to search for this novel type of correlation,
illustrating it by means of D_s-mesons with in-medium shifted masses. These
particles are expected to be more easily detected and identified in future
upgrades at RHIC.
