We report the first experimental observation of multi-stable states in a
single-longitudinal mode semiconductor ring laser. We show how the operation of
the device can be steered to either monostable, bistable or multi-stable
dynamical regimes in a controlled way. We observe that the dynamical regimes
are organized in well reproducible sequences that match the bifurcation
diagrams of a two-dimensional model. By analyzing the phase space in this
model, we predict how the stochastic transitions between multi-stable states
take place and confirm it experimentally.
