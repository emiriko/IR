Here we show that self-propulsion in quantum vacuum may be achieved by
rotating or aggregating magneto-electric nano-particles. The back-action
follows from changes in momentum of electro-magnetic zero-point fluctuations,
generated in magneto-electric materials. This effect may provide new tools for
investigation of the quantum nature of our world. It might also serve in the
future as a "quantum wheel" to correct satellite orientation in space.
