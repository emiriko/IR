We investigate the effects of quenched bond randomness on the critical
properties of the two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising model embedded in a
triangular lattice. The system is studied in both the pure and disordered
versions by the same efficient two-stage Wang-Landau method. In the first part
of our study we present the finite-size scaling behavior of the pure model, for
which we calculate the critical amplitude of the specific heat's logarithmic
expansion. For the disordered system, the numerical data and the relevant
detailed finite-size scaling analysis along the lines of the two well-known
scenarios - logarithmic corrections versus weak universality - strongly support
the field-theoretically predicted scenario of logarithmic corrections. A
particular interest is paid to the sample-to-sample fluctuations of the random
model and their scaling behavior that are used as a successful alternative
approach to criticality.
