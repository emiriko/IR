The problem of quantum state discrimination between two wave functions of a
particle in a square well potential is considered. The optimal minimum-error
probability for the state discrimination is known to be given by the Helstrom
bound. A new strategy is introduced here whereby the square well is compressed
isoenergetically, modifying the wave-functions. The new contracted chamber is
then probed using the conventional optimal strategy, and the error probability
is calculated. It is shown that in some cases the Helstrom bound can be
violated, i.e. the state discrimination can be realized with a smaller error
probability.
