We study the production of a single resonance at the LHC and its decay into a
pair of Z bosons. We demonstrate how full reconstruction of the final states
allows us to determine the spin and parity of the resonance and restricts its
coupling to vector gauge bosons. Full angular analysis is illustrated with the
simulation of the production and decay chain including all spin correlations
and the most general couplings of spin-zero, -one, and -two resonances to
Standard Model matter and gauge fields. We note implications for analysis of a
resonance decaying to other final states.
