We present new and archival Chandra snapshot (10 ks each) observations of 15
optically identified (from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, SDSS) Type 2 quasars
at z=0.40-0.73. When combined with existing X-ray data, this work provides
complete X-ray coverage for all 25 radio-quiet Type 2 quasars with
logL_[OIII]>9.28 L_sun from Zakamska et al. (2003). Two targets out of 15 were
not detected by Chandra and most of the remaining sources are X-ray weak, with
nine having less than 10 counts in the 0.5-8keV band. Low-to-moderate quality
spectral analysis was limited to three sources, whose properties are consistent
with the presence of column densities in the range NH~10^22-10^23 cm^-2 in the
source rest frame. If the [OIII] luminosity is a reliable proxy for the
intrinsic X-ray luminosity, the current X-ray data indicate that Compton-thick
quasars may hide among ~65 per cent of the SDSS Type 2 quasar population (L_{X,
meas}/L_{X, [OIII]}<0.01); however, since the Type 2 quasar sample is selected
on [OIII] luminosity, the estimated Compton-thick quasar fraction may be
overestimated. Using archival Spitzer observations, we find that ~50 per cent
of SDSS Type 2 quasars appear to be obscured by Compton-thick material based on
both the L_{X, meas}/L_{X, mid-IR} (where mid-IR corresponds to rest-frame 12.3
micron) and L_{X, meas}/L_{X, [OIII]} ratios. We use this information to
provide an estimate of the Compton-thick quasar number density at z=0.3-0.8,
which we find is in broad agreement with the expectations from X-ray background
models.
