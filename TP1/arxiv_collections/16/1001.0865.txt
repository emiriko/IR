We report the observation of vortex nucleation in a rotating optical lattice.
A 87Rb Bose-Einstein condensate was loaded into a static two-dimensional
lattice and the rotation frequency of the lattice was then increased from zero.
We studied how vortex nucleation depended on optical lattice depth and rotation
frequency. For deep lattices above the chemical potential of the condensate we
observed a linear dependence of the number of vortices created with the
rotation frequency,even below the thermodynamic critical frequency required for
vortex nucleation. At these lattice depths the system formed an array of
Josephson-coupled condensates. The effective magnetic field produced by
rotation introduced characteristic relative phases between neighbouring
condensates, such that vortices were observed upon ramping down the lattice
depth and recombining the condensates.
