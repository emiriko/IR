We reformulate the theory of strong electrostatic coupling in order to
describe an asymmetric electrolyte solution of monovalent salt ions and
polyvalent counterions using field-theoretical techniques and Monte-Carlo
simulations. The theory is based on an asymmetric treatment of the different
components of the electrolyte solution. The weak coupling Debye-Huckel approach
is used in order to describe the monovalent salt ions while a strong coupling
approach is used to tackle the polyvalent counterions. This combined
weak-strong coupling approach effectively leads to dressed interactions between
polyvalent counterions and thus directly affects the correlation attraction
mediated by polyvalent counterions between like-charged objects. The general
theory is specifically applied to a system composed of two uniformly charged
plane-parallel surfaces in the presence of salt and polyvalent counterions. In
the strong coupling limit for polyvalent counterions the comparison with
Monte-Carlo simulations shows good agreement for large enough values of the
electrostatic coupling parameter. We delineate two limiting laws that in fact
encompass all the Monte-Carlo data.
