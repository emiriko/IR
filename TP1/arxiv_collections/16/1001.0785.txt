Starting from first principles and general assumptions Newton's law of
gravitation is shown to arise naturally and unavoidably in a theory in which
space is emergent through a holographic scenario. Gravity is explained as an
entropic force caused by changes in the information associated with the
positions of material bodies. A relativistic generalization of the presented
arguments directly leads to the Einstein equations. When space is emergent even
Newton's law of inertia needs to be explained. The equivalence principle leads
us to conclude that it is actually this law of inertia whose origin is
entropic.
