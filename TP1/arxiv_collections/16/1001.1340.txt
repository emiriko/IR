In the presence of large extra dimensions, the fundamental scale could be as
low as a few TeV. This yields leptogenesis and seesaw at a TeV scale.
Phenomenologically two TeV-scale Majorana fermions with a small mass split can
realize a resonant leptogenesis whereas a TeV-scale Higgs triplet with a small
trilinear coupling to the standard model Higgs doublet can give a verifiable
seesaw. We propose an interesting scenario where the small parameters for the
resonant leptogenesis and the type-II seesaw can be simultaneously generated by
the propagation of lepton number violation from distant branes to our world.
