We report on the radio-emission characteristics of 222 interplanetary (IP)
shocks. A surprisingly large fraction of the IP shocks (~34%) is radio quiet
(i.e., the shocks lacked type II radio bursts). The CMEs associated with the RQ
shocks are generally slow (average speed ~535 km/s) and only ~40% of the CMEs
were halos. The corresponding numbers for CMEs associated with radio loud (RL)
shocks are 1237 km/s and 72%, respectively. The RQ shocks are also accompanied
by lower peak soft X-ray flux. CMEs associated with RQ (RL) shocks are
generally accelerating (decelerating). The kinematics of CMEs associated with
the km type II bursts is similar to those of RQ shocks, except that the former
are slightly more energetic. Comparison of the shock The RQ shocks seem to be
mostly subcritical and quasi-perpendicular. The radio-quietness is predominant
in the rise phase and decreases through the maximum and declining phases of
solar cycle 23. The solar sources of the shock-driving CMEs follow the sunspot
butterfly diagram, consistent with the higher-energy requirement for driving
shocks.
