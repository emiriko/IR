We observe that gold atoms deposited by physical vapor deposition onto few
layer graphenes condense upon annealing to form nanoparticles with an average
diameter that is determined by the graphene film thickness. The data are well
described by a theoretical model in which the electrostatic interactions
arising from charge transfer between the graphene and the gold particle limit
the size of the growing nanoparticles. The model predicts a nanoparticle size
distribution characterized by a mean diameter D that follows a scaling law D
proportional to m^(1/3), where m is the number of carbon layers in the few
layer graphene film.
