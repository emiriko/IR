We report on investigations of the applicability of non-relativistic
constituent quark models to the low-energy nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction.
The major innovations of a resulting NN potential are the use of the $^3$P$_0$
decay model and quark model wave functions to derive nucleon-nucleon-meson
form-factors, and the use of a colored spin-spin contact hyperfine interaction
to model the repulsive core rather than the phenomenological treatment common
in other NN potentials. We present the results of the model for experimental
free NN scattering phase shifts, S-wave scattering lengths and effective ranges
and deuteron properties. Plans for future study are discussed.
