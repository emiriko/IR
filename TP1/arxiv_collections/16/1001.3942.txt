It has been more than a century since first Lorentz and later Einstein
explored relativistic events and still important consequences of that remains
unclear to everybody. The present study extensively focus on Lorentz (Length)
contraction phenomenon and takes a different approaches to explain how the
shrinking of the body appears if exists. We utilized two postulates of Special
Relativity that emphasizes constancy of speed of light and same physical laws
in any inertial frame. Finally, we propose Lorentz contraction exists in
different form through the shape of the accelerated body. The deformation of
its shape depends on the part where it is measured.
