In their comment, Poole et al. (2009) aim to show it is highly improbable
that the observations described in Chepfer and Noel (2009), and described as
"NAT-like" therein, are produced by Nitric Acid Trihydrate (NAT) particles. In
this reply, we attempt to show why there is, in our opinion, too little
evidence to reject this interpretation right away.
