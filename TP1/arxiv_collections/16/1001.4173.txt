The gravitational phase shift of neutrino oscillation can be discussed in the
framework of f(R)-gravity. We show that the shift of quantum mechanical phase
can depend on the given f(R)-theory that we choose. This fact is general and
could constitute a fundamental test to discriminate among the various
alternative relativistic theories of gravity. Estimations of ratio between the
gravitational phase shift and the standard phase are carried out for the
electronic Solar neutrinos.
