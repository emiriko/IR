We propose a simple and systematic way of accounting for the back reaction on
the background field due to the pair creation in the four--dimensional scalar
QED. This method is straightforwardly generalizable to the gravity backgrounds.
In the case of QED with the instantly switched on constant electric field
background we obtain a remarkably simple formula for its decay rate.
