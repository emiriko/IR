We summarize a recent work on the subject title. The Dirac equation in a
curved spacetime depends on a field of coefficients (essentially the Dirac
matrices), for which a continuum of different choices are possible. We study
the conditions under which a change of the coefficient fields leads to an
equivalent Hamiltonian operator H, or to an equivalent energy operator E. In
this paper, we focus on the standard version of the gravitational Dirac
equation, but the non-uniqueness applies also to our alternative versions. We
find that the changes which lead to an equivalent operator H, or respectively
to an equivalent operator E, are determined by initial data, or respectively
have to make some point-dependent antihermitian matrix vanish. Thus, the vast
majority of the possible coefficient changes lead neither to an equivalent
operator H, nor to an equivalent operator E, whence a lack of uniqueness. We
show that even the Dirac energy spectrum is not unique.
