Orbital variability has been found in the X-ray hardness of the black hole
candidate Cygnus X-1 during the soft/high X-ray state using light curves
provided by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer's All Sky Monitor. We are able to
set broad limits on how the mass-loss rate and X-ray luminosity vary between
the hard and soft states. The folded light curve shows diminished flux in the
soft X-ray band at phase 0 (defined as the time of of the superior conjunction
of the X-ray source). Models of the orbital variability provide slightly
superior fits when the absorbing gas is concentrated in neutral clumps and
better explain the strong variability in hardness. In combination with the
previously established hard/low state dips, our observations give a lower limit
to the mass loss rate in the soft state (Mdot<2x10^{-6} Msun/yr) than the limit
in the hard state (Mdot<4x10^{-6} Msun/yr). Without a change in the wind
structure between X-ray states, the greater mass-loss rate during the low/hard
state would be inconsistent with the increased flaring seen during the
high-soft state.
