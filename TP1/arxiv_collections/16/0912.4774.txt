By carrying out a rational transformation on the base curve $\mathbb{CP}^1$
of the Seiberg-Witten curve for $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric pure
$\mathrm{SU}(2)$-gauge theory, we obtain a family of Jacobian elliptic K3
surfaces of Picard rank 17. The isogeny relating the Seiberg-Witten curve for
pure $\mathrm{SU}(2)$-gauge theory to the one for $\mathrm{SU}(2)$-gauge theory
with $N_f=2$ massless hypermultiplets extends to define a Nikulin involution on
each K3 surface in the family. We show that the desingularization of the
quotient of the K3 surface by the involution is isomorphic to a Kummer surface
of the Jacobian variety of a curve of genus two. We then derive a relation
between the Yukawa coupling associated with the elliptic K3 surface and the
Yukawa coupling of pure $\mathrm{SU}(2)$-gauge theory.
