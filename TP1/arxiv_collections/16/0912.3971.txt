This article is present the effected oxide capacitor in CMOS structure of
integrated circuit level 5 micrometer technology. It has designed and basic
structure of MOS diode. It establish with aluminum metallization layer by
sputtering method, oxide insulator layer mode from silicon dioxide, n+ and p+
semiconductor layer, it has high capacitance concentrate. From the MOS diode
structure silicon dioxide thickness 0.5 micrometer, it will get capacitance
between aluminum metal layer and p+ semiconductor at 28.62 pF, the capacitance
between aluminum metal layer and n+ semiconductor at 29.55 pF. In this article
establish second metal layer for measurement density values of first aluminum
metal layer with second aluminum metal layer, it has density values at 16 pF.
