We report low-temperature transport measurements of three-terminal T-shaped
device patterned from GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. We demonstrate the mode
branching and bend resistance effects predicted by numerical modeling for
linear conductance data. We show also that the backscattering at the junction
area depends on the wave function parity. We find evidence that in a non-linear
transport regime the voltage of floating electrode always increases as a
function of push-pull polarization. Such anomalous effect occurs for the
symmetric device, provided the applied voltage is less than the Fermi energy in
equilibrium.
