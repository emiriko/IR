Nonlinear statistics (i.e. statistics of permanents) on the eigenvalues of
invariant random matrix models are considered for the three Dyson's symmetry
classes $\beta=1,2,4$. General formulas in terms of hyperdeterminants are found
for $\beta=2$. For specific cases and all $\beta$s, more computationally
efficient results are obtained, based on symmetric functions expansions. As an
application, we consider the case of quantum transport in chaotic cavities
extending results from [D.V. Savin, H.-J. Sommers and W. Wieczorek, {\it Phys.
Rev. B} {\bf 77}, 125332 (2008)].
