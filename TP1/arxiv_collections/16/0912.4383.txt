We show that our procedure of constructing excited-state energy functionals
by splitting k-space, employed so far to obtain exchange energies of
excited-states, is quite general. We do so by applying the same method to
construct modified Thomas-Fermi kinetic energy functional and its gradient
expansion up to the second order for the excited-states. We show that the
resulting kinetic energy functional has the same accuracy for the
excited-states as the ground-state functionals do for the ground-states.
