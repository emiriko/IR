The special case of the hypergeometric function $_{2}F_{1}$ represents the
binomial series $(1+x)^{\alpha}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(\:\alpha n\:)x^{n}$ that
always converges when $|x|<1$. Convergence of the series at the endpoints,
$x=\pm 1$, depends on the values of $\alpha$ and needs to be checked in every
concrete case. In this note, using new approach, we reprove the convergence of
the hypergeometric series $_{2}F_{1}(\alpha,\beta;\beta;x)$ for $|x|<1$ and
obtain new result on its convergence at point $x=-1$ for every integer
$\alpha\neq 0$. The proof is within a new theoretical setting based on the new
method for reorganizing the integers and on the regular method for summation of
divergent series.
