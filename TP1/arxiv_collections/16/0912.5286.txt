Axially symmetric solutions for f (R)-gravity can be derived starting from
exact spherically sym- metric solutions achieved by Noether symmetries. The
method takes advantage of a complex coordi- nate transformation previously
developed by Newman and Janis in General Relativity. An example is worked out
to show the general validity of the approach. The physical properties of the
solution are also considered.
