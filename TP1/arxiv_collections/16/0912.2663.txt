Predictions for the charm-production reaction antiproton-proton ->
antiLambda_c-Lambda_c for energies near the threshold are presented. The
calculations are performed in a meson-exchange framework in close analogy to
our earlier study on antiproton-proton -> antiLambda-Lambda by connecting the
two processes via SU(4) symmetry. The obtained antiLambda_c-Lambda_c production
cross sections are in the order of 1 to 7 \mub, i.e. a factor of around 10
smaller than the corresponding cross sections for antiLambda-Lambda. However,
they are 100 to 1000 times larger than predictions of other model calculations
in the literature.
