Recently there has been renewed interest in second sound in superfluid Bose
and Fermi gases. By using two-fluid hydrodynamic theory, we review the density
response $\chi_{nn}(\bq,\omega)$ of these systems as a tool to identify second
sound in experiments based on density probes. Our work generalizes the
well-known studies of the dynamic structure factor $S(\bq,\omega)$ in
superfluid $^4$He in the critical region. We show that, in the unitary limit of
uniform superfluid Fermi gases, the relative weight of second vs. first sound
in the compressibility sum rule is given by the Landau--Placzek ratio
$\lp\equiv (\bar{c}_p-\bar{c}_v)/\bar{c}_v$ for all temperatures below $T_c$.
In contrast to superfluid $^4$He, $\lp$ is much larger in strongly interacting
Fermi gases, being already of order unity for $T \sim 0.8 T_c$, thereby
providing promising opportunities to excite second sound with density probes.
The relative weights of first and second sound are quite different in
$S(\bq,\omega)$ (measured in pulse propagation studies) as compared to
$\mathrm{Im}\chi_{nn}(\bq,\omega)$ (measured in two-photon Bragg scattering).
We show that first and second sound in $S(\bq,\omega)$ in a strongly
interacting Bose-condensed gas are similar to those in a Fermi gas at
unitarity. However, in a weakly interacting Bose gas, first and second sound
are mainly uncoupled oscillations of the thermal cloud and condensate,
respectively, and second sound has most of the spectral weight in
$S(\bq,\omega)$. We also discuss the behaviour of the superfluid and normal
fluid velocity fields involved in first and second sound.
