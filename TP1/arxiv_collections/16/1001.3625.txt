The Chalker Coddington quantum network percolation model is numerically
pertinent to the understanding of the delocalization transition of the quantum
Hall effect. We study the model restricted to a cylinder of perimeter 2M. We
prove firstly that the Lyapunov exponents are simple and in particular that the
localization length is finite; secondly that this implies spectral
localization. Thirdly we prove a Thouless formula and compute the mean Lyapunov
exponent which is independent of M.
