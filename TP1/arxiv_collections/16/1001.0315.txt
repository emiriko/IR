We present the results of computing the $p^6$ order low energy constants in
the anomalous part of chiral Lagrangian both for two and three flavor
pseudoscalar mesons. This is a generalization of our previous work on
calculating the $p^6$ order coefficients for the normal part chiral Lagrangian
in terms of the quark self energy $\Sigma(p^2)$. We show that most of our
results are consistent with those we can find in the literature.
