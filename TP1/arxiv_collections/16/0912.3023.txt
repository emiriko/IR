We present results from two observations of the wind-accreting X-ray pulsar
4U 1907+09 using the Suzaku observatory. The broadband time-averaged spectrum
allows us to examine the continuum emission of the source and the cyclotron
resonance scattering feature at ~19 keV. Additionally, using the narrow CCD
response of Suzaku near 6 keV allows us to study in detail the Fe K bandpass
and to quantify the Fe K beta line for this source for the first time. The
source is absorbed by fully-covering material along the line of sight with a
column density of NH ~2e22 /cm^2, consistent with a wind accreting geometry,
and a high Fe abundance (~3-4 x solar). Time and phase-resolved analyses allow
us to study variations in the source spectrum. In particular, dips found in the
2006 observation which are consistent with earlier observations occur in the
hard X-ray bandpass, implying a variation of the whole continuum rather than
occultation by intervening material, while a dip near the end of the 2007
observation occurs mainly in the lower energies implying an increase in NH
along the line of sight, perhaps indicating clumpiness in the stellar wind.
