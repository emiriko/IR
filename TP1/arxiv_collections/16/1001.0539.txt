The observation that PT-symmetric Hamiltonians can have real-valued energy
levels even if they are non-Hermitian has triggered intense activities, with
experiments, in particular, focusing on optical systems, where Hermiticity can
be broken by absorption and amplification. For classical waves, absorption and
amplification are related by time-reversal symmetry. This work shows that
microreversibility-breaking quantum noise turns PT-symmetric systems into
self-sustained sources of radiation, which distinguishes them from ordinary,
Hermitian quantum systems.
