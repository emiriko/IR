We study universality in the kinetics of spinodal phase separation in
unstable thin liquid films, via simulations of the thin film equation. It is
shown that in addition to morphology and free energy,the number density of
local maxima in the film profile can also be used to identify the early,
intermediate and late stages of spinodal phase separation. A universal curve
between the number density of local maxima and rescaled time describes the
kinetics of early stage in d = 2, 3. The Lifshitz-Slyozov exponent of -1/3
describes the kinetics of the late stage in d = 2 even in the absence of
coexisting equilibrium phases.
