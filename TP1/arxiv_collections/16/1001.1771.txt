Using Bose-Einstein-statistics-forbidden two-photon excitation in atomic
barium, we have limited the rate of statistics-violating transitions, as a
fraction $\nu$ of an equivalent statistics-allowed transition rate, to
$\nu<4.0\times10^{-11}$ at the 90% confidence level. This is an improvement of
more than three orders of magnitude over the best previous result.
Additionally, hyperfine-interaction enabling of the forbidden transition has
been observed, to our knowledge, for the first time.
