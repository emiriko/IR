We have developed a theory of the one-phonon intraband resonance Raman
scattering (IRRS) in anisotropic quantum dots subjected to an arbitrarily
directed magnetic field. The differential Raman cross section is obtained. The
resonance structure of the Raman cross section is studied. It is shown that the
quantum dot subjected in a magnetic field can be used as the detector of phonon
modes. The interesting multiplet structure of the resonance peaks is studied.
