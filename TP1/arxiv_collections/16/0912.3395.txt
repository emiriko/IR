We discuss applications of time-delayed feedback control to delay-coupled
neural systems and lasers, in the framework of the FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron model
and the Lang-Kobayashi laser model, respectively. In the context of neural
systems, we will point out some complex scenarios of synchronized in-phase or
antiphase oscillations, bursting patterns, or amplitude death, induced by
delayed coupling in combination with delayed self-feedback in simple network
motifs. For optical systems, we will show that multiple time-delayed feedback,
realized by a Fabry-Perot resonator coupled to the laser, provides a valuable
tool for the suppression of unwanted intensity pulsations, and leads to stable
continuous-wave operation.
