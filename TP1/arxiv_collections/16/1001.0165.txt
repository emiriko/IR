Progenitor scenarios for short gamma-ray bursts (short GRBs) include
coalescenses of two neutron stars or a neutron star and black hole, which would
necessarily be accompanied by the emission of strong gravitational waves. We
present a search for these known gravitational-wave signatures in temporal and
directional coincidence with 22 GRBs that had sufficient gravitational-wave
data available in multiple instruments during LIGO's fifth science run, S5, and
Virgo's first science run, VSR1. We find no statistically significant
gravitational-wave candidates within a [-5, +1) s window around the trigger
time of any GRB. Using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test, we find no evidence
for an excess of weak gravitational-wave signals in our sample of GRBs. We
exclude neutron star-black hole progenitors to a median 90% CL exclusion
distance of 6.7 Mpc.
