We study zero-temperature stability of topological phases of matter under
weak time-independent perturbations. Our results apply to quantum spin
Hamiltonians that can be written as a sum of geometrically local commuting
projectors on a D-dimensional lattice with certain topological order
conditions. Given such a Hamiltonian H_0 we prove that there exists a constant
threshold \epsilon>0 such that for any perturbation V representable as a sum of
short-range bounded-norm interactions the perturbed Hamiltonian H=H_0+\epsilon
V has well-defined spectral bands originating from O(1) smallest eigenvalues of
H_0. These bands are separated from the rest of the spectrum and from each
other by a constant gap. The band originating from the smallest eigenvalue of
H_0 has exponentially small width (as a function of the lattice size).
  Our proof exploits a discrete version of Hamiltonian flow equations, the
theory of relatively bounded operators, and the Lieb-Robinson bound.
