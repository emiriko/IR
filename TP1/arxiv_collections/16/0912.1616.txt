The present thesis aims to be an analysis of various aspects of neutrino
phenomenology in two different scenarios. On the one hand, we address the study
of non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) in accelerator and reactor
terrestrial experiments. On the other hand, we discuss the propagation of
supernova (SN) neutrinos, taking into account the recent developments showing
the importance that neutrino background may have in their evolution. This
effect, neglected for a long time, may be of capital importance when trying to
understand the neutrino signal from a future galactic SN. Our SN neutrino
analysis is presented both in absence and presence of NSI.
