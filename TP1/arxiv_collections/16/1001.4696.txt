The Radiometer Electronics Box Assembly (REBA) is the control and data
processing on board computer of the Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) of the
Planck mission (ESA). The REBA was designed and built incorporating state of
the art processors, communication interfaces and real time operating system
software in order to meet the scientific performance of the LFI. We present a
technical summary of the REBA, including a physical, functional, electrical,
mechanical and thermal description. Aspects of the design and development, the
assembly, the integration and the verification of the equipment are provided. A
brief description of the LFI on board software is given including the Low-Level
Software and the main functionalities and architecture of the Application
Software. The compressor module, which has been developed as an independent
product, later integrated in the application, is also described in this paper.
Two identical engineering models EM and AVM, the engineering qualification
model EQM, the flight model FM and flight spare have been manufactured and
tested. Low-level and Application software have been developed. Verification
activities demonstrated that the REBA hardware and software fulfil all the
specifications and perform as required for flight operation.
