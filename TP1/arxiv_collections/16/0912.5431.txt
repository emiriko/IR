From observations with the 6-m BTA telescope at SAO RAS, we have determined
spectroscopic redshifts of seven optical objects whose coordinates coincide
with those of radio sources from the list of IVS (International VLBI Service
for Geodesy and Astrometry). When compared to radio data, the obtained spectra
and redshifts provide evidence for reliable identification of four observed
objects; the other three require further study. The distances to the sources
derived from our measurements will make it possible to refine the current
estimates for parameters of cosmological models based on proper motions of
these objects, which are determined from geodetic VLBI observations.
