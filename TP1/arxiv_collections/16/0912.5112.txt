One of the major efforts in the quantum biological program is to subject
biological systems to standard tests or measures of quantumness. These tests
and measures should elucidate if non-trivial quantum effects may be present in
biological systems. Two such measures of quantum correlations are the quantum
discord and the relative entropy of entanglement. Here, we show that the
relative entropy of entanglement admits a simple analytic form when dynamics
and accessible degrees of freedom are restricted to a zero- and
single-excitation subspace. We also simulate and calculate the amount of
quantum discord that is present in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson protein complex
during the transfer of an excitation from a chlorosome antenna to a reaction
center. We find that the single-excitation quantum discord and relative entropy
of entanglement are equal for all of our numerical simulations, but a proof of
their general equality for this setting evades us for now. Also, some of our
simulations demonstrate that the relative entropy of entanglement without the
single-excitation restriction is much lower than the quantum discord. The first
picosecond of dynamics is the relevant timescale for the transfer of the
excitation, according to some sources in the literature. Our simulation results
indicate that quantum correlations contribute a significant fraction of the
total correlation during this first picosecond in many cases, at both cryogenic
and physiological temperature.
