We investigate the possibility of introducing the temperature to the one
dimensional Sznajd model and propose a natural extension of the original model
by including other types of interactions. We characterise different kinds of
equilibria into which the extended system can evolve. We determine the
consequences of fulfilling the detailed balance condition and we prove that in
some cases it is equivalent to microscopic reversibility. We propose a simple
definition of the temperature-like quantity that measures the size of
fluctuations in the system at equilibrium. The complete list of
zero-temperature degenerated cases is provided.
