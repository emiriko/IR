Full Stokes spectropolarimetric data (in the 10830 A region) of an active
region filament were obtained in July 2005 using the Tenerife Infrared
Polarimeter instrument. The polarization profiles in the filament show
Zeeman-like signatures. Milne-Eddington inversions were performed to infer the
chromospheric magnetic field, inclination, azimuth, velocity and Doppler width
from the He I 10830 A multiplet. Field strengths of the order of 600-800 G were
found in the filament. Strong transverse fields at chromospheric levels were
detected near the polarity inversion line. To our knowledge, these are the
highest field strengths reliably measured in these structures. Our findings
suggest the possible presence of a flux rope.
