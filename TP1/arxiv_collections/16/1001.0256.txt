The Kepler Mission seeks to detect Earth-size planets transiting solar-like
stars in its ~115 deg^2 field of view over the course of its 3.5 year primary
mission by monitoring the brightness of each of ~156,000 Long Cadence stellar
targets with a time resolution of 29.4 minutes. We discuss the photometric
precision achieved on timescales relevant to transit detection for data
obtained in the 33.5-day long Quarter 1 (Q1) observations that ended 2009 June
15. The lower envelope of the photometric precision obtained at various
timescales is consistent with expected random noise sources, indicating that
Kepler has the capability to fulfill its mission. The Kepler light curves
exhibit high precision over a large dynamic range, which will surely permit
their use for a large variety of investigations in addition to finding and
characterizing planets. We discuss the temporal characteristics of both the raw
flux time series and the systematic error-corrected flux time series produced
by the Kepler Science Pipeline, and give examples illustrating Kepler's large
dynamic range and the variety of light curves obtained from the Q1
observations.
