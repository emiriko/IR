Solving multihomogeneous systems, as a wide range of structured algebraic
systems occurring frequently in practical problems, is of first importance.
Experimentally, solving these systems with Gr\"obner bases algorithms seems to
be easier than solving homogeneous systems of the same degree. Nevertheless,
the reasons of this behaviour are not clear. In this paper, we focus on
bilinear systems (i.e. bihomogeneous systems where all equations have bidegree
(1,1)). Our goal is to provide a theoretical explanation of the aforementionned
experimental behaviour and to propose new techniques to speed up the Gr\"obner
basis computations by using the multihomogeneous structure of those systems.
The contributions are theoretical and practical. First, we adapt the classical
F5 criterion to avoid reductions to zero which occur when the input is a set of
bilinear polynomials. We also prove an explicit form of the Hilbert series of
bihomogeneous ideals generated by generic bilinear polynomials and give a new
upper bound on the degree of regularity of generic affine bilinear systems.
This leads to new complexity bounds for solving bilinear systems. We propose
also a variant of the F5 Algorithm dedicated to multihomogeneous systems which
exploits a structural property of the Macaulay matrix which occurs on such
inputs. Experimental results show that this variant requires less time and
memory than the classical homogeneous F5 Algorithm.
