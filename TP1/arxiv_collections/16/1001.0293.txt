In the two-Higgs-Doublet model the alignment of the Yukawa flavour matrices
of the two scalar doublets guarantees the absence of tree-level
flavour-changing neutral couplings. The resulting fermion-scalar interactions
are parameterized in terms of three complex parameters, leading to a generic
Yukawa structure which contains as particular cases all known specific
implementations of the model based on Z2 symmetries. These three complex
parameters are potential new sources of CP violation.
