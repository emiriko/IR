Dance videos are interesting and semantics-intensive. At the same time, they
are the complex type of videos compared to all other types such as sports, news
and movie videos. In fact, dance video is the one which is less explored by the
researchers across the globe. Dance videos exhibit rich semantics such as macro
features and micro features and can be classified into several types. Hence,
the conceptual modeling of the expressive semantics of the dance videos is very
crucial and complex. This paper presents a generic Dance Video Semantics Model
(DVSM) in order to represent the semantics of the dance videos at different
granularity levels, identified by the components of the accompanying song. This
model incorporates both syntactic and semantic features of the videos and
introduces a new entity type called, Agent, to specify the micro features of
the dance videos. The instantiations of the model are expressed as graphs. The
model is implemented as a tool using J2SE and JMF to annotate the macro and
micro features of the dance videos. Finally examples and evaluation results are
provided to depict the effectiveness of the proposed dance video model.
