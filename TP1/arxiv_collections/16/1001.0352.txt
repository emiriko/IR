The Kepler Mission was launched on March 6, 2009 to perform a photometric
survey of more than 100,000 dwarf stars to search for terrestrial-size planets
with the transit technique. Follow-up observations of planetary candidates
identified by detection of transit-like events are needed both for
identification of astrophysical phenomena that mimic planetary transits and for
characterization of the true planets and planetary systems found by Kepler. We
have developed techniques and protocols for detection of false planetary
transits and are currently conducting observations on 177 Kepler targets that
have been selected for follow-up. A preliminary estimate indicates that between
24% and 62% of planetary candidates selected for follow-up will turn out to be
true planets.
