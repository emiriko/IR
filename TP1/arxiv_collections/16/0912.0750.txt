On distributed memory electronic computers, the implementation and
association of fast parallel matrix multiplication algorithms has yielded
astounding results and insights. In this discourse, we use the tools of
molecular biology to demonstrate the theoretical encoding of Strassen's fast
matrix multiplication algorithm with DNA based on an $n$-moduli set in the
residue number system, thereby demonstrating the viability of computational
mathematics with DNA. As a result, a general scalable implementation of this
model in the DNA computing paradigm is presented and can be generalized to the
application of \emph{all} fast matrix multiplication algorithms on a DNA
computer. We also discuss the practical capabilities and issues of this
scalable implementation. Fast methods of matrix computations with DNA are
important because they also allow for the efficient implementation of other
algorithms (i.e. inversion, computing determinants, and graph theory) with DNA.
