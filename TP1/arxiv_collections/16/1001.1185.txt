Digital architectures for Chebyshev interpolation are explored and a
variation which is word-serial in nature is proposed. These architectures are
contrasted with equispaced system structures. Further, Chebyshev interpolation
scheme is compared to the conventional equispaced interpolation vis-a-vis
reconstruction error and relative number of samples. It is also shown that the
use of a hybrid (or dual) Analog to Digital converter unit can reduce system
power consumption by as much as 1/3rd of the original.
