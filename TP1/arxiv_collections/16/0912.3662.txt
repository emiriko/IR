We report two different types of backflow from jets by performing 2D special
relativistic hydrodynamical simulations. One is anti-parallel and
quasi-straight to the main jet (quasi-straight backflow), and the other is bent
path of the backflow (bent backflow). We find that the former appears when the
head advance speed is comparable to or higher than the local sound speed at the
hotspot while the latter appears when the head advance speed is slower than the
sound speed bat the hotspot. Bent backflow collides with the unshocked jet and
laterally squeezes the jet. At the same time, a pair of new oblique shocks are
formed at the tip of the jet and new bent fast backflows are generated via
these oblique shocks. The hysteresis of backflow collisions is thus imprinted
in the jet as a node and anti-node structure. This process also promotes
broadening of the jet cross sectional area and it also causes a decrease in the
head advance velocity. This hydrodynamic process may be tested by observations
of compact young jets.
