We report on an explicit on-shell framework to renormalize the
fermion-flavour mixing matrices in the Standard Model and its extensions, at
one-loop level. It is based on a novel procedure to separate the external-leg
mixing corrections into gauge-independent self-mass and gauge-dependent
wave-function renormalization contributions.
