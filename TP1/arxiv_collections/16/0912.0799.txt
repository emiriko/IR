We calculate the temperature-dependent charge carrier transport of bilayer
graphene (BLG) impacted by Coulomb impurity scattering within the random phase
approximation. We find the polarizability is equal to the density of states at
zero momentum transfer and is enhanced by a factor $\log{4}$ at large momentum
transfer for arbitrary temperature. The sharp cusp of static polarizability at
$q=2k_F$, due to the strong backward scattering, would be smooth by the
increasing temperatures. We also obtain the asymptotic behaviors of
conductivity of BLG at low and high temperature, and find it turns from a two
dimensional electron gas (2DEG) like linear temperature metallic behavior to a
single layer graphene (SLG) like quadratic temperature insulating behavior as
the temperature increases.
