We consider boundary integral equations (BIEs) met in the scattering by
dielectric cylinders and compare numerical algorithms based on elementary and
Muller's BIEs near the "numerical resonances". A procedure of partial removal
of well-known defect of elementary BIEs related to the loss of their unique
solvability is discussed.
