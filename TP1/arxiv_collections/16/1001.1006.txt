We investigate chains of 'd' dimensional quantum spins (qudits) on a line
with generic nearest neighbor interactions without translational invariance. We
find the conditions under which these systems are not frustrated, i.e. when the
ground states are also the common ground states of all the local terms in the
Hamiltonians. The states of a quantum spin chain are naturally represented in
the Matrix Product States (MPS) framework. Using imaginary time evolution in
the MPS ansatz, we numerically investigate the range of parameters in which we
expect the ground states to be highly entangled and find them hard to
approximate using our MPS method.
