We study a lattice Higgs-Yukawa model emulating the same Higgs-fermion
coupling structure as in the Higgs sector of the electroweak Standard Model, in
particular, obeying a Ginsparg-Wilson version of the underlying SU(2) x U(1)
symmetry, being a global symmetry here due to the neglection of gauge fields in
this model. In this paper we present our results on the cutoff-dependent upper
Higgs boson mass bound at several selected values of the cutoff parameter.
