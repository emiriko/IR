We consider a linearly thermoelastic composite medium,which consists of a
homogeneous matrix containing a statistically inhomogeneous random set of
inclusions, when the concentration of the inclusions is a function of the
coordinates (so-called Functionally Graded Materials). The composite medium is
subjected to essentially inhomogeneous loading by the fields of the stresses,
temperature and body forces (e.g. for a centrifugal load). The general integral
equations connecting the stress and strain fields in the point being considered
and the surrounding points are obtained for the random fields of inclusions.
The method is based on a centering procedure of subtraction from both sides of
a known initial integral equation their statistical averages obtained without
any auxiliary assumptions such as, e.g., effective field hypothesis implicitly
exploited in the known centering methods. In so doing the size of a region
including the inclusions acting on a separate one is finite, i.e. the locality
principle takes place.
