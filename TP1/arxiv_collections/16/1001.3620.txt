We present high statistics results for the structure of the nucleon from a
mixed-action calculation using 2+1 flavors of asqtad sea and domain wall
valence fermions. We perform extrapolations of our data based on different
chiral effective field theory schemes and compare our results with available
information from phenomenology. We discuss vector and axial form factors of the
nucleon, moments of generalized parton distributions, including moments of
forward parton distributions, and implications for the decomposition of the
nucleon spin.
