Some features of the Bianchi type-I universes in the presence of a fluid that
wields an anisotropic equation of state (EoS) parameter are discussed in the
context of general relativity. The models that exhibit de Sitter volumetric
expansion due to the constant effective energy density (the sum of the energy
density of the fluid and the anisotropy energy density) are of particular
interest. We also introduce two locally rotationally symmetric models, which
exhibit de Sitter volumetric expansion in the presence of a hypothetical fluid
that has been obtained by minimally altering the conventional vacuum energy. In
the first model, the directional EoS parameter on the x axis is assumed to be
-1, while the ones on the other axes and the energy density of the fluid are
allowed to be functions of time. In the second model, the energy density of the
fluid is assumed to be constant, while the directional EoS parameters are
allowed to be functions of time.
