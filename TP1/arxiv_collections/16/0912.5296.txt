We present a direct approach to the construction of Lagrangians for a large
class of one-dimensional dynamical systems with a simple dependence (monomial
or polynomial) on the velocity. We rederive and generalize some recent results
and find Lagrangian formulations which seem to be new. Some of the considered
systems (e.g., motions with the friction proportional to the velocity and to
the square of the velocity) admit infinite families of different Lagrangian
formulations.
