The questions I have been asked during the 5th International School on Field
Theory and Gravitation, have compelled me to give an account of the premises
that I consider important for a beginner's approach to Loop Quantum Gravity.
After a description of some general arguments and an introduction to the
canonical theory of gravity, I review the background independent approach to
quantum gravity, giving only a brief survey of Loop Quantum Gravity.
