One of the essential security services needed to safeguard online
transactions is fair exchange. In fair exchange protocols two parties can
exchange their signatures in a fair manner, so that either each party gain the
other's signature or no one obtain anything useful. This paper examines
security solutions for achieving fair exchange. It proposes new security
protocols based on the "Certified Encrypted Message Being Signature" (CEMBS) by
using RSA signature scheme. This protocol relies on the help of an "off-line
Semi-Trusted Third Party" (STTP) to achieve fairness. They provide with
confidential protection from the STTP for the exchanged items by limiting the
role and power of the STTP. Three different protocols have been proposed. In
the first protocol, the two main parties exchange their signatures on a common
message. In the second protocol, the signatures are exchanged on two different
messages. While in the third one, the exchange is between confidential data and
signature.
