Rate and diversity impose a fundamental trade-off in communications. This
trade-off was investigated for flat-fading channels in [15] as well as for
Inter-symbol Interference (ISI) channels in [1]. A different point of view was
explored in [12] where high-rate codes were designed so that they have a
high-diversity code embedded within them. These diversity embedded codes were
investigated for flat fading channels both from an information theoretic
viewpoint [5] and from a coding theory viewpoint in [2]. In this paper we
explore the use of diversity embedded codes for inter-symbol interference
channels. In particular the main result of this paper is that the diversity
multiplexing trade-off for fading MISO/SIMO/SISO ISI channels is indeed
successively refinable. This implies that for fading ISI channels with a single
degree of freedom one can embed a high diversity code within a high rate code
without any performance loss (asymptotically). This is related to a
deterministic structural observation about the asymptotic behavior of frequency
response of channel with respect to fading strength of time domain taps as well
as a coding scheme to take advantage of this observation.
