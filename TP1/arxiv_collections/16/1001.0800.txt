We report the discovery of diffuse hard (1-5 keV) X-ray emission around
Jupiter in a deep 160 ks Suzaku XIS data. The emission is distributed over
~16x8 Jovian radius and spatially associated with the radiation belts and the
Io Plasma Torus. It shows a flat power-law spectrum with a photon index of
1.4+/-0.2 with the 1-5 keV X-ray luminosity of (3.3+/-0.5)x10^15 erg/s. We
discussed its origin and concluded that it seems to be truly diffuse, although
a possibility of multiple background point sources can not be completely
rejected with a limited angular resolution. If it is diffuse, the flat
continuum indicates that X-rays arise by the non-thermal electrons in the
radiation belts and/or the Io Plasma Torus. The synchrotron and bremsstrahlung
models can be rejected from the necessary electron energy and X-ray spectral
shape, respectively. The inverse-Compton scattering off solar photons by
ultra-relativistic (several tens MeV) electrons can explain the energy and the
spectrum but the necessary electron density is >~10 times larger than the value
estimated from the empirical model of Jovian charge particles.
