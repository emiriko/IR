What can we know about the universe? I outline a few of the fundamental
limitations that are posed to our understanding of the cosmos, such as the
existence of horizons, the fact that we occupy a specific place in space and
time, the possible presence of dark components, the absence of a reliable
physical framework to interpret the behaviour of the very early universe.
