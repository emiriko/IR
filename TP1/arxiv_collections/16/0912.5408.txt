A periodic homogenization result of nonconvex integral functionals in the
vectorial case with convex bounded constraints on gradients is proved. The
class of integrands considered have singular behavior near the boundary of the
convex set of the constraints. We apply the result to the case of periodic
homogenization in hyperelasticity for bounded gradients of deformations.
