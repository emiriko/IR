We present a first-principles study of bare and hydrogen passivated armchair
nanoribbons of the puckered single layer honeycomb structures of silicon and
germanium. Our study includes optimization of atomic structure, stability
analysis based on the calculation of phonon dispersions, electronic structure
and the variation of band gap with the width of the ribbon. The band gaps of
silicon and germanium nanoribbons exhibit family behavior similar to those of
graphene nanoribbons. The edges of bare nanoribbons are sharply reconstructed,
which can be eliminated by the hydrogen termination of dangling bonds at the
edges. Periodic modulation of the nanoribbon width results in a superlattice
structure which can act as a multiple quantum wells. Specific electronic states
are confined in these wells. Confinement trends are qualitatively explained by
including the effects of the interface. In order to investigate wide and long
superlattice structures we also performed empirical tight binding calculations
with parameters determined from \textit{ab initio} calculations.
