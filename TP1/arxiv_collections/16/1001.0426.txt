Based on the semi-classical theory, we investigate the thermodynamic
properties of a dipolar Fermi gas. Through a self-consistent procedure, we
numerically obtain the phase space distribution function at finite temperature.
We show that the deformations in both momentum and real space becomes smaller
and smaller as one increases the temperature. For homogeneous case, we also
calculate pressure, entropy, and heat capacity. In particular, at low
temperature limit and in weak interaction regime, we obtain an analytic
expression for the entropy, which agrees qualitatively with our numerical
result. The stability of a trapped gas at finite temperature is also explored.
