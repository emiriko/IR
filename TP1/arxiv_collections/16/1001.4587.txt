In this paper, some relations between the topological parameter $d$ and
concurrences of the projective entangled states have been presented. It is
shown that for the case with $d=n$, all the projective entangled states of two
$n$-dimensional quantum systems are the maximally entangled states (i.e.
$C=1$). And for another case with $d\neq n$, $C$ both approach $0$ when
$d\rightarrow +\infty$ for $n=2$ and $3$. Then we study the thermal
entanglement and the entanglement sudden death (ESD) for a kind of Yang-Baxter
Hamiltonian. It is found that the parameter $d$ not only influences the
critical temperature $T_{c}$, but also can influence the maximum entanglement
value at which the system can arrive at. And we also find that the parameter
$d$ has a great influence on the ESD.
