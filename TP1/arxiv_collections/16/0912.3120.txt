We address the question: Given an arbitrary initial state and a general
physical interaction what is the minimum time for reaching a target entangled
state? We show that the minimum time is inversely proportional to the quantum
mechanical uncertainty in the non-local Hamiltonian. We find that the presence
of initial entanglement helps to minimize the waiting time. Furthermore, we
find that in a bi-local rotating frame the entangling capability is actually a
geometric quantity. We give an universal bound for the time average of
entanglement rate for general quantum systems. The time average of entanglement
rate does not depend on the particular Hamiltonian, rather on the fluctuation
in the Hamiltonian. There can be infinite number of nonlocal Hamiltonians which
may give same average entanglement rate. We also prove a composition law for
minimum time when the system evolves under a composite Hamiltonian.
