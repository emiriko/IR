We point out that the minimal seesaw model can provide a natural framework to
accommodate tiny neutrino masses, while its experimental testability and
notable predictiveness are still maintained. This possibility is based on the
observation that two heavy right-handed Majorana neutrinos in the minimal
seesaw model may naturally emerge as a pseudo-Dirac fermion. In a specific
scenario, we show that the tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing can be produced, and
only the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy is allowed. The low-energy phenomena,
including non-unitarity effects in neutrino oscillations, neutrinoless
double-beta decays and rare lepton-flavor-violating decays of charged leptons
l_alpha to l_beta + gamma, have been explored. The collider signatures of the
heavy singlet neutrino are also briefly discussed.
