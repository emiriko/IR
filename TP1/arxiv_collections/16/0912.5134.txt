We examine the behavior of a Non Gaussian state like NOON state under phase
insensitive amplification. We derive analytical result for the density matrix
of the NOON state for arbitrary gain of the amplifier. We consider cases of
both symmetric and antisymmetric amplification of the two modes of the NOON
state. We quantitatively evaluate the loss of entanglement by the amplifier in
terms of the logarithmic negativity parameter. We find that NOON states are
more robust than their Gaussian counterparts.
