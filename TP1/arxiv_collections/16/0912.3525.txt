We use the formalism of constrained Gaussian random field to compute a
precise large scale simulation of the 60 Mpc/h volume of our Local Universe. We
derive the constraints from the reconstructed peculiar velocities of the 2MASS
Redshift Survey. We obtain a correlation of 0.97 between the log-density field
of the dark matter distribution of the simulation and the log-density of
observed galaxies of the Local Universe. We achieve a good comparison of the
simulated velocity field to the observed velocity field obtained from the
galaxy distances of the NBG-3k. At the end, we compare the two-point
correlation function of both the 2MRS galaxies and of the dark matter particles
of the simulation. We conclude that this method is a very promising technique
of exploring the dynamics and the particularities the Universe in our
neighbourhood.
