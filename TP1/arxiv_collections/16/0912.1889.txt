The observational evidence for AGN relativistic Iron lines is very much
debated. To address this topic, the FERO project makes use of the largest
sample of X-ray spectra of radio quiet Type 1 AGN available in the XMM-Newton
archive. We perform a systematic fit of the individual sources using a full
relativistic code. Results on the first part of the project are presented here.
