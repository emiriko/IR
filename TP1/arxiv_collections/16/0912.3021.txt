We construct exact solutions to noncommutative gravity following the
formulation of Chamseddine and show that they are in general accompanied by
Abelian gauge fields which are first order in the noncommutative scale. This
provides a mechanism for generating cosmological electromagnetic fields in an
expanding space-time background, and also leads to multipole-like fields
surrounding black holes. Exact solutions to noncommutative Einstein-Maxwell
theory can give rise to first order corrections to the metric tensor, as well
as to the electromagnetic fields. This leads to first order shifts in the
horizons of charged black holes.
