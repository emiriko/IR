The production of Z bosons via Vector Boson Fusion at the LHC collider at 10
TeV centre-of-mass energy has been studied. The aim is to investigate the
possibility to isolate a known Standard Model process to be used as reference
for the measurement of the detector performance for the search of the Higgs
Boson produced via Vector Boson Fusion. The signal to background ratio has been
estimated considering only the dominant sources of background.
