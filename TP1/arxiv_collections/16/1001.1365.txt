One of the main goals of the ATLAS detector at the LHC of CERN, a
proton-proton collider with a nominal centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV, is to
search for New Physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). A widely favoured BSM
candidate is Supersymmetry (SUSY), which postulates a superpartner for each
Standard Model particle. The first part of this thesis describes a strategy for
an early discovery of SUSY using the trilepton signature, with a focus on
gravity-mediated SUSY breaking, mSUGRA. The discovery potential for SUSY for
the case where strongly interacting supersymmetric particles are very massive
is critically investigated. A possible choice of triggers for L = 10-31cm-2s-1
is suggested by optimising the event yield at intermediate and final selection
stages. A novel method to measure the rate of leptons from heavy flavour decays
passing isolation requirements by isolating tt events in data is outlined.
  The task of the ATLAS silicon tracker is to track particles produced in
proton-proton collisions in its centre, measuring their momenta and production
vertices. The precise knowledge of the silicon tracker module positions and
their orientation in space (alignment) down to some microns and fractions of a
miliradian in the critical coordinates is of vital importance for large parts
of the ambitious ATLAS physics program. In the second part of the thesis, the
alignment of the ATLAS silicon tracker using the Robust Alignment algorithm and
particle tracks is described. The algorithm is applied to align end-cap A of
the pixel detector using cosmic ray particle tracks recorded during its
on-surface commissioning in 2006. Finally, about 2M cosmic ray tracks collected
by ATLAS in situ in autumn 2008 are utilised to provide a coherent alignment of
the entire silicon tracker with the Robust Alignment algorithm.
