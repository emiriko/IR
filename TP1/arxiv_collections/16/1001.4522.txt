Henry Eyring was, and still is, a towering figure in science. Some aspects of
his life and science, beginning in Mexico and continuing in Arizona,
California, Wisconsin, Germany, Princeton, and finally Utah, are reviewed here.
Eyring moved gradually from quantum theory toward statistical mechanics and the
theory of liquids, motivated in part by his desire to understand reactions in
condensed matter. Significant structure theory, while not as successful as
Eyring thought, is better than his critics realize. Eyring won many awards.
However, most chemists are surprised, if not shocked, that he was never awarded
a Nobel Prize. He joined Lise Meitner, Rosalind Franklin, John Slater, and
others, in an even more select group, those who should have received a Nobel
Prize but did not.
