In this paper, we introduce $\Phi$-Auslander-Yoneda algebras in a
triangulated category with $\Phi$ a parameter set in $\mathbb N$, and provide a
method to construct new derived equivalences between these
$\Phi$-Auslander-Yoneda algebras (not necessarily Artin algebras), or their
quotient algebras, from a given almost $\nu$-stable derived equivalence. As
consequences of our method, we have: (1) Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are
representation-finite, self-injective Artin algebras with $_AX$ and $_BY$
additive generators for $A$ and $B$, respectively. If $A$ and $B$ are
derived-equivalent, then the $\Phi$-Auslander-Yoneda algebras of $X$ and $Y$
are derived-equivalent for every admissible set $\Phi$. In particular, the
Auslander algebras of $A$ and $B$ are both derived-equivalent and stably
equivalent. (2) For a self-injective Artin algeba $A$ and an $A$-module $X$,
the $\Phi$-Auslander-Yoneda algebras of $A\oplus X$ and $A\oplus \Omega_A(X)$
are derived-equivalent for every admissible set $\Phi$, where $\Omega$ is the
Heller loop operator. Motivated by these derived equivalences between
$\Phi$-Auslander-Yoneda algebras, we consider constructions of derived
equivalences for quotient algebras, and show, among others, that a derived
equivalence between two basic self-injective algebras may transfer to a derived
equivalence between their quotient algebras obtained by factorizing out socles.
