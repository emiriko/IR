We construct the gauge invariant potentials of Hermitian Gravity and derive
the linearized equations of motion they obey. A comparison reveals a striking
similarity to the Bardeen potentials of general relativity. We then consider
the response to a point particle source, and discuss in what sense the
solutions of Hermitian Gravity reduce to the Newtonian potentials. In a rather
intriguing way, the Hermitian Gravity solutions exhibit a generalized
reciprocity symmetry originally proposed by Born in the 1930s. Finally, we
consider the trajectories of massive and massless particles under the influence
of a potential. The theory correctly reproduces the Newtonian limit in three
dimensions and the nonrelativistic acceleration equation. However, it differs
from the light deflection calculated in linearized generalrelativity by 25%.
While the specific complexification of general relativity by extension to
Hermitian spaces performed here does not agree with experiment, it does possess
useful properties for quantization and is well-behaved around singularities.
Another form of complex general relativity may very well agree with
experimental data.
