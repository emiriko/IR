We consider the numerical approximation of a system of partial differential
equations involving a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation coupled with a
hyperbolic conservation law. This system arises in models for the interaction
of short and long waves. Using the compensated compactness method, we prove
convergence of approximate solutions generated by semi-discrete finite volume
type methods towards the unique entropy solution of the Cauchy problem. Some
numerical examples are presented.
