Quiescent cosmology and the Weyl curvature hypothesis possess a mathematical
framework, namely the definition of an Isotropic Singularity, but only for the
initial state of the universe. A complementary framework is necessary to also
encode appropriate cosmological futures. In order to devise a new framework we
analyse the relation between regular conformal structures and (an)isotropy, the
behaviour and role of a monotonic conformal factor which is a function of
cosmic time, as well as four example cosmologies for further guidance. Finally,
we present our new definitions of an Anisotropic Future Endless Universe and an
Anisotropic Future Singularity which offer a promising realisation for the new
framework. Their irregular, degenerate conformal structures differ
significantly from those of the Isotropic Singularity. The combination of the
three definitions together could then provide the first complete formalisation
of the quiescent cosmology concept. For completeness we also present the new
definitions of an Isotropic Future Singularity and a Future Isotropic Universe.
The relation to other approaches, in particular to the somewhat dual dynamical
systems approach, and other asymptotic scenarios is briefly discussed.
