We describe a new pipeline used to analyze the data from the fifth science
run (S5) of the LIGO detectors to search for continuous gravitational waves
from isolated spinning neutron stars. The method employed is based on the Hough
transform, which is a semi-coherent, computationally efficient, and robust
pattern recognition technique. The Hough transform is used to find signals in
the time-frequency plane of the data whose frequency evolution fits the pattern
produced by the Doppler shift imposed on the signal by the Earth's motion and
the pulsar's spin-down during the observation period. The main differences with
respect to previous Hough all-sky searches are described. These differences
include the use of a two-step hierarchical Hough search, analysis of
coincidences among the candidates produced in the first and second year of S5,
and veto strategies based on a $\chi^2$ test.
