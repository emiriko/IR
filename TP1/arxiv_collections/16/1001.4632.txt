The imprints left by quantum mechanics in classical (Hamiltonian) mechanics
are much more numerous than is usually believed. We show Using no physical
hypotheses) that the Schroedinger equation for a nonrelativistic system of
spinless particles is a classical equation which is equivalent to Hamilton's
equations.
