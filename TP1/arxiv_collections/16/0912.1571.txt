We present an analysis of archival X-ray observations of the Type IIL
supernova SN 1979C. We find that its X-ray luminosity is remarkably constant at
(6.5+/-0.1) x 10^38 erg/s over a period of 12 years between 1995 and 2007. The
high and steady luminosity is considered as possible evidence for a
stellar-mass (~ 5-10Msun) black hole accreting material from either a supernova
fallback disk or from a binary companion, or possibly from emission from a
central pulsar wind nebula. We find that the bright and steady X-ray light
curve is not consistent with either a model for a supernova powered by magnetic
braking of a rapidly rotating magnetar, or a model where the blast wave is
expanding into a dense circumstellar wind.
