We consider a long-range Ising antiferromagnet put in a transverse field
(LRTIAF) with disorder. We have obtained the phase diagrams for both the
classical and quantum case. For the pure case applying quantum Monte Carlo
method, we study the variation of order parameter (spin correlation in the
Trotter direction), susceptibility and average energy of the system for various
values of the transverse field at different temperatures. The antiferromagnetic
order is seen to get immediately broken as soon as the thermal or quantum
fluctuations are added. We discuss generally the phase diagram for the same
LRTIAF model with perturbative Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) type disorder. We
find that while the antiferromagnetic order is immediately broken as one adds
an infinitesimal transverse field or thermal fluctuation to the pure LRTIAF
system, an infinitesimal SK spin glass disorder is enough to induce a stable
glass order in the LRTIAF. This glass order eventually gets destroyed as the
thermal or quantum fluctuations are increased beyond their threshold values and
the transition to para phase occurs. Analytical studies for the phase
transitions are discussed in detail in each case. These transitions have been
confirmed by applying classical and quantum Monte Carlo methods. We show here
that the disordered LRTIAF has a surrogate incubation property of the SK spin
glass phase.
