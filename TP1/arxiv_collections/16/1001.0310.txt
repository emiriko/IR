Relative and absolute emission line shifts have been previously found for
symbiotic binaries, but their cause was not clear. This work aims to better
understand the emission line shifts. Positions of strong emission lines were
measured on archival UV spectra of Z And, AG Dra, RW Hya, SY Mus and AX Per and
relative shifts between the lines of different ions compared. Profiles of lines
of RW Hya and Z And were also examined. The reality of the relative shift
between resonance and intercombination lines of several times ionised atoms was
clearly shown except for AG Dra. This redshift shows a well defined variation
with orbital phase for Z And and RW Hya. In addition the intercombination lines
from more ionised atoms and especially OIV are redshifted with respect to those
from less ionised atoms. Other effects are seen in the profiles. The
resonance-intercombination line shift variation can be explained in quiescence
by P Cygni shorter wavelength component absorption, due to the wind of the cool
component, which is specially strong in inferior conjunction of this cool
giant. The velocity stratification permits absorption of line emission. The
relative intercombination line shifts may be connected with varying occultation
of line emission near an accretion disk, which is optically thick in the
continuum.
