The Kepler Mission Science Operations Center (SOC) performs several critical
functions including managing the ~156,000 target stars, associated target
tables, science data compression tables and parameters, as well as processing
the raw photometric data downlinked from the spacecraft each month. The raw
data are first calibrated at the pixel level to correct for bias, smear induced
by a shutterless readout, and other detector and electronic effects. A
background sky flux is estimated from ~4500 pixels on each of the 84 CCD
readout channels, and simple aperture photometry is performed on an optimal
aperture for each star. Ancillary engineering data and diagnostic information
extracted from the science data are used to remove systematic errors in the
flux time series that are correlated with these data prior to searching for
signatures of transiting planets with a wavelet-based, adaptive matched filter.
Stars with signatures exceeding 7.1 sigma are subjected to a suite of
statistical tests including an examination of each star's centroid motion to
reject false positives caused by background eclipsing binaries. Physical
parameters for each planetary candidate are fitted to the transit signature,
and signatures of additional transiting planets are sought in the residual
light curve. The pipeline is operational, finding planetary signatures and
providing robust eliminations of false positives.
