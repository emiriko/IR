Using experiments, theory and simulations, we show that the arrested state
observed in a colloidal clay at intermediate concentrations is stabilized by
the screened Coulomb repulsion (Wigner glass). Dilution experiments allow us to
distinguish this high-concentration disconnected state, which melts upon
addition of water, from a low-concentration gel state, which does not melt.
Theoretical modelling and simulations reproduce the measured Small Angle X-Ray
Scattering static structure factors and confirm the long-range electrostatic
nature of the arrested structure. These findings are attributed to the
different timescales controlling the competing attractive and repulsive
interactions.
