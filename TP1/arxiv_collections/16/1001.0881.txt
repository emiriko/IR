Recent experimental and computational studies of vibrated thin layers of
identical spheres have shown transitions to ordered phases similar to those
seen in equilibrium systems. Motivated by these results, we carry out
simulations of hard inelastic spheres forced by homogenous white noise. We find
a transition to an ordered state of the same symmetry as that seen in the
experiments, but the clear phase separation observed in the vibrated system is
absent. Simulations of purely elastic spheres also show no evidence for phase
separation. We show that the energy injection in the vibrated system is
dramatically different in the different phases, and suggest that this creates
an effective surface tension not present in the equilibrium or randomly forced
systems. We do find, however, that inelasticity suppresses the onset of the
ordered phase with random forcing, as is observed in the vibrating system, and
that the amount of the suppression is proportional to the degree of
inelasticity. The suppression depends on the details of the energy injection
mechanism, but is completely eliminated when inelastic collisions are replaced
by uniform system-wide energy dissipation.
