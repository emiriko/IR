We study the transport properties of a graphene ferromagnet-insulator
superconductor (FIS) junction within the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism by
solving spin-polarized Dirac-Bogoliubov-de-Gennes equation. We find that the
retro and specular Andreev reflections in the graphene FIS junction are
drastically modified in the presence of exchange interaction and that the
spin-polarization ($P_T$) of tunneling current can be tuned from the positive
to negative value by bias voltage ($V$). In the thin-barrier limit, the
conductance $G$ of a graphene FIS junction oscillates as a function of barrier
strength $\chi$. Both the amplitude and phase of the conductance oscillation
varies with the exchange energy $E_{ex}$. For $E_{ex}<E_F$ (Fermi energy), the
amplitude of oscillation decreases with $E_{ex}$. For $E_{ex}^{c}>E_{ex}>E_F$,
the amplitude of oscillation increases with $E_{ex}$, where
$E_{ex}^{c}=2E_{F}+U_{0}$ ($U_{0}$ is the applied electrostatic potential on
the superconducting segment of the junction). For $E_{ex} > E_{ex}^{c}$, the
amplitude of oscillation decreases with $E_{ex}$ again. Interestingly, a
universal phase difference of $\pi/2$ in $\chi$ exists between the $G-\chi$
curves for $E_{ex}>E_F$ and $E_{ex}<E_F$. Finally, we find that the transitions
between retro and specular Andreev reflections occur at $eV=|E_{F}-E_{ex}|$ and
$eV=E_{ex}+E_{F}$, and hence the singular behavior of the conductance near
these bias voltages results from the difference in transport properties between
specular and retro Andreev reflections.
