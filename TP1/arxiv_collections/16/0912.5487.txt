Noncollinear frustrated magnets are proposed as a new class of spintronic
materials with high magnetoresistance which can be controlled with relatively
small applied voltages. It is demonstrated that their magnetic configuration
strongly depends on position of the Fermi energy and applied voltage. The
voltage induced control of noncollinear frustrated materials (VCFM) can be seen
as a way to intrinsic control of colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and is the
bulk material counterpart of spin transfer torque concept used to control giant
magnetoresistance in layered spin-valve structures.
