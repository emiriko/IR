We study questions related to critical points of the
  Green's function of a bounded multiply connected domain in the complex plane.
The motion of critical points, their limiting positions as the pole approaches
the boundary and the differential geometry of the level lines of the Green's
function are main themes in the paper. A unifying role is played by various
affine and projective connections and corresponding M\"obius invariant
differential operators. In the doubly connected case the three Eisenstein
series $E_2$, $E_4$, $E_6$ are used. A specific result is that a doubly
connected domain is the disjoint union of the set of critical points of the
Green's function, the set of zeros of the Bergman kernel and the separating
boundary limit positions for these. At the end we consider the projective
properties of the prepotential associated to a second order differential
operator depending canonically on the domain.
