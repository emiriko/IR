We analyze photometry of the Soft X-ray Transient A0620-00 spanning nearly 30
years, including previously published and previously unpublished data. Previous
attempts to determine the inclination of A0620 using subsets of these data have
yielded a wide range of measured values of i. Differences in the measured value
of i have been due to changes in the shape of the light curve and uncertainty
regarding the contamination from the disk. We give a new technique for
estimating the disk fraction and find that disk light is significant in all
light curves, even in the infrared. We also find that all changes in the shape
and normalization of the light curve originate in a variable disk component.
After accounting for this disk component, we find that all the data, including
light curves of significantly different shapes, point to a consistent value of
i. Combining results from many separate data sets, we find i=51 plus or minus
0.9 degrees, implying M=6.6 plus or minus 0.25 solar masses. Using our
dynamical model and zero-disk stellar VIH magnitudes, we find d=1.06 plus or
minus 0.12 kpc. Understanding the disk origin of non-ellipsoidal variability
may assist with making reliable determinations of i in other systems, and the
fluctuations in disk light may provide a new observational tool for
understanding the three-dimensional structure of the accretion disk.
