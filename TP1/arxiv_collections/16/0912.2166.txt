The multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) can be used, in
its scale invariant version, to describe the ground state of a lattice system
at a quantum critical point. From the scale invariant MERA one can determine
the local scaling operators of the model. Here we show that, in the presence of
a global symmetry $\mathcal{G}$, it is also possible to determine a class of
non-local scaling operators. Each operator consist, for a given group element
$g\in\mathcal{G}$, of a semi-infinite string $\tGamma_g$ with a local operator
$\phi$ attached to its open end. In the case of the quantum Ising model,
$\mathcal{G}= \mathbb{Z}_2$, they correspond to the disorder operator $\mu$,
the fermionic operators $\psi$ and $\bar{\psi}$, and all their descendants.
Together with the local scaling operators identity $\mathbb{I}$, spin $\sigma$
and energy $\epsilon$, the fermionic and disorder scaling operators $\psi$,
$\bar{\psi}$ and $\mu$ are the complete list of primary fields of the Ising
CFT. Thefore the scale invariant MERA allows us to characterize all the
conformal towers of this CFT.
