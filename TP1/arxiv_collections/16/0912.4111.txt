Transition radiation from relativistic electrons is investigated in an
ultrasonic superlattice excited in a finite thickness plate. In the
quasi-classical approximation formulae are derived for the vector potential of
the electromagnetic field and for the spectral-angular distribution of the
radiation intensity. The acoustic waves generate new resonance peaks in the
spectral and angular distribution of the radiation intensity. The heights of
the peaks can be tuned by choosing the parameters of the acoustic wave.
