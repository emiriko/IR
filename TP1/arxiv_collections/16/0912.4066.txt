Coherent electronic transport in single-molecule junctions is investigated in
the Coulomb blockade regime. Both the transmission phase and probability are
calculated for junctions with various contact symmetries. A dramatic
suppression of the Coulomb blockade peaks is predicted for junctions where
multiple atomic orbitals of the molecule couple to a single electrode although
the charging steps are unaffected.
