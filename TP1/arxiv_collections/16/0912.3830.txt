In the last couple of years the Magic air Cherenkov telescope has made
significant contributions to very high energy $\gamma$-ray astronomy. These
include the detection of the galactic binary system LSI +61 303 and the
observation of pulsed emission from the Crab pulsar. Extragalactic objects like
the famous FSRQ 3C 279 and the LBL S5 0716+714 have both been detected during
optical high states, and the radio galaxy M87 could be observed during an
unexpected strong $\gamma$-ray outburst. Given its low energy trigger threshold
(~50 GeV) and fast repositioning time of less than 30s the Magic air Cherenkov
telescope is particularly well suited for the observation of fast transient
objects like AGN or GRBs. So far no GRB could be detected with Magic, however.
In this paper we present selected highlights from recent MAGIC observations of
extragalactic objects.
