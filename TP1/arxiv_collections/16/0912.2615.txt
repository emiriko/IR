A La0.75Ca0.25MnO3-film grown by metalorganic aerosol deposition technique
was investigated by scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy. A small
spot was found on the surface which exhibits the expected magnetic field
dependence of the tunnelling conductivity giving the opportunity for a local
spectroscopic study of the intrinsic colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) behavior.
The tunnelling conductivity is strongly enhanced in an external magnetic field
of 4 T and the CMR behavior can be interpreted in terms of a redistribution of
occupied electronic states torwards the Fermi energy.
