The light flavour baryons are studied within the quark model using the hyper
central description of the three-body system. The confinement potential is
assumed as hypercentral coulomb plus power potential ($hCPP_\nu$) with power
index $\nu$. The masses and magnetic moments of light flavour baryons are
computed for different power index, $\nu$ starting from 0.5 to 1.5. The
predicted masses and magnetic moments are found to attain a saturated value
with respect to variation in $\nu$ beyond the power index $\nu>$ 1.0. Further
we computed transition magnetic moments and radiative decay width of light
flavour baryons. The results are in good agreement with known experimental as
well as other theoretical models.
