Thermoelectrics are important in physics, engineering, and material science
due to their useful applications and inherent theoretical difficulty,
especially in strongly correlated materials. Here we reexamine the framework
for calculating the thermopower, inspired by ideas of Lord Kelvin from 1854. We
find an approximate but concise expression, which we term as the Kelvin formula
for the the Seebeck coefficient. According to this formula, the Seebeck
coefficient is given as the particle number $N$ derivative of the entropy
$\Sigma$, at constant volume $V$ and temperature $T$,
$S_{\text{Kelvin}}=\frac{1}{q_e}\{\frac{\partial {\Sigma}}{\partial N}
\}_{V,T}$. This formula is shown to be competitive compared to other
approximations in various contexts including strongly correlated systems. We
finally connect to a recent thermopower calculation for non-Abelian fractional
quantum Hall states, where we point out that the Kelvin formula is exact.
