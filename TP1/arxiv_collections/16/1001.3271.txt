We outline a general strategy to deal with perturbations in brane world
models. We illustrate the method by studying simple 6D brane world
compactifications. We introduce the background geometries induced by the
branes, and summarize the main physical features observed in the fluctuation
spectra. We compare these results with 5D brane world models and the
traditional Kaluza-Klein picture.
