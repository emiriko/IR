We study the influence of an electric current on a continuous non-collinear
antiferromagnetic texture. Despite the lack of a net magnetic moment we find
that the exchange interaction between conduction electrons and local
magnetization generally results in current-induced torques that are similar in
phenomenology to spin transfer torques in ferromagnets. We present the
generalization of the non-linear sigma model equation of motion for the
N\'{e}\`{e}l vector that includes these current-induced torques, and briefly
discuss the resulting current-induced antiferromagnetic domain wall motion and
spin-wave Doppler shift. We give an interpretation of our results using a
unifying picture of current-induced torques in ferromagnets and
antiferromagnets in which they are viewed as due to the current-induced spin
polarization resulting from an effective spin-orbit coupling.
