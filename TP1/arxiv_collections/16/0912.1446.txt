We investigate the twist three distribution function $e(x)$ in light-front
Hamiltonian perturbation theory. In light-front gauge, by eliminating the
constrained field, we find a mass term, an intrinsic transverse momentum
dependent term and a 'genuine twist three' quark-gluon interaction term in the
operator. The equation of motion relation, moment relation and the sum rules
are satisfied for a quark at one loop. We compare the results with other model
calculations.
