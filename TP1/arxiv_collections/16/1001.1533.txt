All-optical signal processing is envisioned as an approach to dramatically
decrease power consumption and speed up performance of next-generation optical
telecommunications networks. Nonlinear optical effects, such as four-wave
mixing (FWM) and parametric gain, have long been explored to realize
all-optical functions in glass fibers. An alternative approach is to employ
nanoscale engineering of silicon waveguides to enhance the optical
nonlinearities by up to five orders of magnitude, enabling integrated
chip-scale all-optical signal processing. Previously, strong two-photon
absorption (TPA) of the telecom-band pump has been a fundamental and
unavoidable obstacle, limiting parametric gain to values on the order of a few
dB. Here we demonstrate a silicon nanophotonic optical parametric amplifier
exhibiting gain as large as 25.4 dB, by operating the pump in the mid-IR near
one-half the band-gap energy (E~0.55eV, lambda~2200nm), at which parasitic
TPA-related absorption vanishes. This gain is high enough to compensate all
insertion losses, resulting in 13 dB net off-chip amplification. Furthermore,
dispersion engineering dramatically increases the gain bandwidth to more than
220 nm, all realized using an ultra-compact 4 mm silicon chip. Beyond its
significant relevance to all-optical signal processing, the broadband
parametric gain also facilitates the simultaneous generation of multiple
on-chip mid-IR sources through cascaded FWM, covering a 500 nm spectral range.
Together, these results provide a foundation for the construction of
silicon-based room-temperature mid-IR light sources including tunable
chip-scale parametric oscillators, optical frequency combs, and supercontinuum
generators.
