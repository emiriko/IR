We explore the consequences of denying the "emptiness of paths not taken,"
EPNT, a premise of Bernstein, Greenberger, Horne, and Zeilinger in their paper
titled, Bell theorem without inequalities. Carrying out the negation of EPNT
leads to the concept of a "shadow stream." Streams are essentially particle
implementations of the path amplitudes in Feynman's formulation of quantum
mechanics, resulting in a simple and consistent extension of the standard
postulates for quantum mechanics. Following up on the negation of EPNT using
shadow streams, we analyze the experimental outcomes in a standard two-particle
interferometer. The result is a simple counterexample to Bell's theorem in
position/momentum space.
