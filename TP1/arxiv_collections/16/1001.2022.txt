We present the application of novel diagnostics to the spectroscopic
observation of a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) on disk by the Extreme Ultraviolet
Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on the Hinode spacecraft. We apply a recently
developed line profile asymmetry analysis to the spectroscopic observation of
NOAA AR 10930 on 14-15 December 2006 to three raster observations before and
during the eruption of a 1000km/s CME. We see the impact that the observer's
line-of-sight and magnetic field geometry have on the diagnostics used.
Further, and more importantly, we identify the on-disk signature of a
high-speed outflow behind the CME in the dimming region arising as a result of
the eruption. Supported by recent coronal observations of the STEREO
spacecraft, we speculate about the momentum flux resulting from this outflow as
a secondary momentum source to the CME. The results presented highlight the
importance of spectroscopic measurements in relation to CME kinematics, and the
need for full-disk synoptic spectroscopic observations of the coronal and
chromospheric plasmas to capture the signature of such explosive energy release
as a way of providing better constraints of CME propagation times to L1, or any
other point of interest in the heliosphere.
