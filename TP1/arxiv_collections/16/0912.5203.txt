Collisions of antiprotons with bare uranium nuclei are studied for scattering
angles nearby 180$^{\circ}$ in the framework of relativistic theory. The
Coulomb glory phenomenon is investigated at energies of the antiprotons in the
range 100 eV to 2.5 keV. The vacuum polarization effect and the anomalous
magnetic moment of the antiproton are taken into account. The estimations of
possible influence of such effects as radiative recombination and antiproton
annihilation are given.
