Charge excitations in a two dimensional electron gas, under a quantizing
magnetic field and in the fractional quantum Hall effect regime, flow in one
dimensional-like strips along the edges of the sample. These excitations
(quasiparticles) may be independent or condense into an interacting chiral
Luttinger liquid. Adding a backscattering potential, which reflects a forward
propagating quasiparticle to a backward propagating one, partitions the stream
of quasiparticles and induces quantum shot noise. The noise is proportional to
quasiparticles charge and may be affected by their mutual interactions. The
dependence of the determined charge on the temperature, excitation energy, and
partitioning will be describes for a few fractional states, revealing in some
cases a universal behavior.
