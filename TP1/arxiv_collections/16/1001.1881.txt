We prove the periodicities of the restricted T and Y-systems associated with
the quantum affine algebra of type C_r, F_4, and G_2 at any level. We also
prove the dilogarithm identities for these Y-systems at any level. Our proof is
based on the tropical Y-systems and the categorification of the cluster algebra
associated with any skew-symmetric matrix by Plamondon.
