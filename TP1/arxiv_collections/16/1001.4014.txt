Theoretical and observational support suggests that the spectral evolution of
neutron-star LMXBs, including transient hard X-ray tails, may be explained by
the interplay between thermal and bulk motion Comptonization. In this
framework, we developed a new model for the X-ray spectral fitting XSPEC
package which takes into account the effects of both thermal and dynamical
(i.e. bulk) Comptonization, CompTB. Using data from the INTEGRAL satellite, we
tested our model on broad band spectra of a sample of persistently low magnetic
field bright neutron star Low Mass X-ray Binaries, covering different spectral
states. The case of the bright source GX 5-1 is presented here. Particular
attention is given to the transient powerlaw-like hard X-ray (above 30 keV)
tail that we interpret in the framework of the bulk motion Comptonization
process, qualitatively describing the physical conditions of the environment in
the innermost part of the system.
