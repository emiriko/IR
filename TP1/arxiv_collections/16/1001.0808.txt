We discuss the metal-insulator transition of the spinless fermion model on
the Kagom\'{e} lattice at 1/3-filling. The system is analyzed using exact
diagonalization, the density-matrix renormalization group methods and the
random phase approximation. In the strong-coupling region, the charge-ordered
ground state is consistent with the predictions of the effective model with a
plaquette order. We find that the qualitative properties of the metal-insulator
transition are totally different depending on the sign of the hopping
integrals, reflecting the difference of band structure at the Fermi level.
