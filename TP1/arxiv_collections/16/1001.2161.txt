This is a chapter (planned to appear in Wiley's upcoming Encyclopedia of
Operations Research and Management Science) describing parts of the theory of
convex polyhedra that are particularly important for optimization. The topics
include polyhedral and finitely generated cones, the Weyl-Minkowski Theorem,
faces of polyhedra, projections of polyhedra, integral polyhedra, total dual
integrality, and total unimodularity.
