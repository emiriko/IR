The merger dynamics of a black hole-neutron star (BHNS) binary is influenced
by the neutron star equation of state (EoS) through the latter's effect on the
neutron star's radius and on the character of the mass transfer onto the black
hole. We study these effects by simulating a number of BHNS binaries in full
general relativity using a mixed pseudospectral/finite difference code. We
consider several models of the neutron star matter EoS, including Gamma=2 and
Gamma=2.75 polytropes and the nuclear-theory based Shen EoS. For models using
the Shen EoS, we consider two limits for the evolution of the composition:
source-free advection and instantaneous beta-equilibrium. To focus on EoS
effects, we fix the mass ratio to 3:1 and the initial aligned black hole spin
to a/m=0.5 for all models. We confirm earlier studies which found that more
compact stars create a stronger gravitational wave signal but a smaller
postmerger accretion disk. We also vary the EoS while holding the compaction
fixed. All mergers are qualitatively similar, but we find signatures of the EoS
in the waveform and in the tail and disk structures.
