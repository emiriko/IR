We investigate both theoretically and experimentally the stochastic switching
between two counter-propagating lasing modes of a semiconductor ring laser.
Experimentally, the residence time distribution cannot be described by a simple
one parameter Arrhenius exponential law and reveals the presence of two
different mode-hop scenarios with distinct time scales. In order to elucidate
the origin of these two time scales, we propose a topological approach based on
a two-dimensional dynamical system.
