A general phenomenological theory describing dynamics of Josephson vortices
coupled to wide class of linear waves in layered high-T$_c$ superconductors is
developed. The theory is based on hydrodynamic long wave approximation and
describes interaction of vortices with electromagnetic, electronic and phonon
degrees of freedom on an equal footing. In the limiting cases the proposed
theory degenerates to simple models considered earlier. In the framework of the
suggested model we undertook the numerical simulation of resistive state in
layered superconductors placed in external magnetic field and demonstrate
excitation of linear waves of various origin by a moving vortex lattice,
manifesting in existence of resonances on current-voltage characteristics.
