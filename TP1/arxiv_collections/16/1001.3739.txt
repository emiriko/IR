It has been shown recently that information is lost in the Hawking radiation
of the linear dilaton black holes in various theories when applying the
tunneling formulism without considering quantum gravity effects. In this
Letter, we recalculate the emission probability by taking into account of the
log-area correction to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and the statistical
correlation between quanta emitted. The crucial role of the black hole remnant
on the entropy conservation is highlighted. We model the remnant as a higher
dimensional linear dilaton vacuum in order to show that such a remnant model
cannot radiate and its temperature would be zero. In addition to this, the
entropy conservation in the higher dimensional linear dilaton black holes is
also discussed. In summary, we show in detail that the information can also
leak out from the linear dilaton black holes together with preserving unitarity
in quantum mechanics.
