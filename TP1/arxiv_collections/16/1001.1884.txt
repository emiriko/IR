Results are presented on neutral kaon, hyperon and antihyperon production in
Pb-Pb and p-Be interactions at 40 GeV/c per nucleon. The enhancement pattern
follows the same hierarchy as seen in the higher energy data - the enhancement
increases with the strangeness content of the hyperons and with the centrality
of collision. The centrality dependence of the Pb-Pb yields and enhancements is
steeper at 40 than at 158 A GeV/c. The energy dependence of strangeness
enhancements at mid-rapidity is discussed.
