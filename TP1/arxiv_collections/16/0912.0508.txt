The crawling motion of Dictyostelium discoideum on substrata involves a
number of coordinated events including cell contractions and cell protrusions.
The mechanical forces exerted on the substratum during these contractions have
recently been quantified using traction force experiments. Based on the results
from these experiments, we present a biomechanical model of Dictyostelium
discoideum motility with an emphasis on the adhesive properties of the
cell-substratum contact. Our model assumes that the cell contracts at a
constant rate and is bound to the substratum by adhesive bridges which are
modeled as elastic springs. These bridges are established at a spatially
uniform rate while detachment occurs at a spatially varying, load-dependent
rate. Using Monte-Carlo simulations and assuming a rigid substratum, we find
that the cell speed depends only weakly on the adhesive properties of the
cell-substratum, in agreement with experimental data. Varying the parameters
that control the adhesive and contractile properties of the cell we are able to
make testable predictions. We also extend our model to include a flexible
substrate and show that our model is able to produce substratum deformations
and force patterns that are quantitatively and qualitatively in agreement with
experimental data.
