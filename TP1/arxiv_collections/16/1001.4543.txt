Observations of red (G-K)-giant stars with the CoRoT satellite provide
unprecedented information on the stochastically excited oscillations in these
stars. The long time series of nearly uninterrupted high-cadence and
high-precision photometry revealed the presence of non-radial modes with long
lifetimes, which opens the possibility to perform asteroseismology on these
stars. Also, the large number of red giants, for which solar-like oscillations
are now observed, allows for a more statistical investigation of the
characteristics of solar-like oscillations in red giants.
