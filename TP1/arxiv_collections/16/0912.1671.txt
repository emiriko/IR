The Darboux transformation on matrix solutions to the generalized coupled
dispersionless integrable system based on some non-abelian Lie group, is
studied and the solutions are shown to be expressed in terms of
quasideterminants. As an explicit example, the Darboux transformation on scalar
solutions to the system based on the Lie group SU(2) is discussed in detail and
the solutions are shown to be expressed as ratios of determinants.
