We prove the reality of the perturbed eigenvalues of some PT symmetric
Hamiltonians of physical interest by means of stability methods. In particular
we study 2-dimensional generalized harmonic oscillators with polynomial
perturbation and the one-dimensional $x^2(ix)^{\epsilon}$ for $-1<\epsilon<0$.
