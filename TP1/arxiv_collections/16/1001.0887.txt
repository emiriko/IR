Feature selection techniques have been used as the workhorse in biomarker
discovery applications for a long time. Surprisingly, the stability of feature
selection with respect to sampling variations has long been under-considered.
It is only until recently that this issue has received more and more attention.
In this article, we review existing stable feature selection methods for
biomarker discovery using a generic hierarchal framework. We have two
objectives: (1) providing an overview on this new yet fast growing topic for a
convenient reference; (2) categorizing existing methods under an expandable
framework for future research and development.
