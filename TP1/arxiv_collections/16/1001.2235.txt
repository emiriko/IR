We study the structure and formation of the $\phi$ mesic nuclei to
investigate the in-medium modification of the $\phi$-meson spectral function at
finite density. We consider (${\bar p},\phi$), ($\gamma,p$) and ($\pi^-,n$)
reactions to produce a $\phi$-meson inside the nucleus and evaluate the effects
of its medium modifications to the reaction cross sections. We also estimate
the consequences of the uncertainties of the ${\bar K}$ selfenergy in medium to
the $\phi$-nucleus interaction. We find that it may be possible to see a peak
structure in the reaction spectra for the strong attractive potential cases. On
the other hand, for strong absorptive interaction cases with relatively weak
attractions, it is very difficult to observe clear peaks and we may need to
know the spectrum shape in a wide energy region to deduce the properties of
$\phi$.
