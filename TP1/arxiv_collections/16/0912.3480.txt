We investigate the oscillation spectrum of rotating Newtonian neutron stars
endowed with purely toroidal magnetic fields, using a time evolution code to
evolve linear perturbations in the Cowling approximation. The background star
is generated by numerically solving the MHD equilibrium equations and may be
nonspherical by virtue of both rotation and magnetic effects; hence our
perturbations and background are fully consistent. Whilst the background field
is purely toroidal, the perturbed field is mixed poloidal-toroidal. From
Fourier analysis of the perturbations we are able to identify a number of
magnetically-restored Alfv\'en (or $a$-) modes. We show that in a rotating star
pure inertial and $a$-modes are replaced by hybrid magneto-inertial modes,
which reduce to $a$-modes in the nonrotating limit and inertial modes in the
nonmagnetic limit. We show that the $r$-mode instability is suppressed by
magnetic fields in sufficiently slowly rotating stars. In addition, we
determine magnetic frequency shifts in the $f$-mode. We discuss the
astrophysical relevance of our results, in particular for magnetar
oscillations.
