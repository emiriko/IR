We present mean-field calculations for the in-plane optical conductivity, the
superfluid density, and the electronic Raman susceptibility in quasi
two-dimensional systems possessing a ground state with two competing order
parameters: d-wave density wave (dDW) and d-wave superconductor (dSC). In the
coexisting dDW+dSC phase we calculate the frequency dependence of these
correlation functions in the presence of impurity scattering in the unitary
limit, relevant to zinc-doped cuprate superconductors.
