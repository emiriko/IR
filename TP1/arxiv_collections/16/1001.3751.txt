The increase in dissipated power per unit area of electronic components sets
higher demands on the performance of the heat sink. Also if we continue at our
current rate of miniaturisation, laptops and other electronic devices can get
heated up tremendously. Hence we require a better heat dissipating system to
overcome the excess heat generating problem of using nanoelectronics, which is
expected to power the next generation of computers. To handle the excessive and
often unpredictable heating up of high performance electronic components like
microprocessors, we need to predict the temperature profile of the heat sink
used. This also helps us to select the best heat sink for the operating power
range of any microprocessor. Understanding the temperature profile of a heat
sink and a microprocessor helps us to handle its temperature efficiently for a
range of loads. In this work, a method to estimate the normal response of a
heat sink to various loads of a microprocessor is explained.
