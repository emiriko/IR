In this paper we study the possible relation between the electronic and
magnetic structure of the TiO2/LaAlO3 interface and the unexpected magnetism
found in undoped TiO2 films grown on LaAlO$_3$. We concentrate on the role
played by structural relaxation and interfacial oxygen vacancies.
  LaAlO3 has a layered structure along the (001) direction with alternating LaO
and AlO2 planes, with nominal charges of +1 and -1, respectively. As a
consequence of that, an oxygen deficient TiO2 film with anatase structure will
grow preferently on the AlO2 surface layer. We have therefore performed
ab-initio calculations for superlattices with TiO2/AlO2 interfaces with
interfacial oxygen vacancies. Our main results are that vacancies lead to a
change in the valence state of neighbour Ti atoms but not necessarily to a
magnetic solution and that the appearance of magnetism depends also on
structural details, such as second neighbor positions. These results are
obtained using both the LSDA and LSDA+U approximations.
