In order to do relativistic gravimetry one needs to define a system of null
coordinates for a given constellation of satellites. We present here three
methods in order to find the null coordinates of an event in a Schwarzschild
geometry. We implement these three methods for the weak gravitational field of
the Earth, compare their precision and time of computation.
