We use density functional theory (DFT) with a recently developed van der
Waals density functional (vdW-DF) to study the adsorption of graphene on Al,
Cu, Ag, Au, Pt, Pd, Co and Ni(111) surfaces. In constrast to the local density
approximation (LDA) which predicts relatively strong binding for Ni,Co and Pd,
the vdW-DF predicts weak binding for all metals and metal-graphene distances in
the range 3.40-3.72 \AA. At these distances the graphene bandstructure as
calculated with DFT and the many-body G$_0$W$_0$ method is basically unaffected
by the substrate, in particular there is no opening of a band gap at the
$K$-point.
