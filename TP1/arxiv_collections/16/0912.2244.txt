The capture of a moving atom by a non-dissipative trap, such as an optical
dipole trap, requires the removal of the excessive kinetic energy of the atom.
In this article we develop a mechanism to harvest ultra cold atoms from a
guided atom beam into an optical dipole trap by removing their directed kinetic
energy. We propose a continuous loading scheme where this is accomplished via
deceleration by a magnetic potential barrier followed by optical pumping to the
energetically lowest Zeeman sublevel. We theoretically investigate the
application of this scheme to the transfer of ultra cold chromium atoms from a
magnetically guided atom beam into a deep optical dipole trap. We discuss the
realization of a suitable magnetic field configuration. Based on numerical
simulations of the loading process we analyze the feasibility and efficiency of
our loading scheme.
