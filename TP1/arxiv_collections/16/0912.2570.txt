Our main result establishes functorial desingularization of noetherian
quasi-excellent schemes over $\bfQ$ with ordered boundaries. A functorial
embedded desingularization of quasi-excellent schemes of characteristic zero is
deduced. Furthermore, a standard simple argument extends these results to other
categories, including in particular, (equivariant) embedded desingularization
of the following objects of characteristic zero: qe algebraic stacks, qe
schemes, qe formal schemes, complex and non-archimedean analytic spaces. We
also obtain a semistable reduction theorem for formal schemes.
