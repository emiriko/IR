We analyze the leptonic sector in the left-right symmetric model dressed with
a $(Z_{2})^{3}$ discrete symmetry which realizes, after weak spontaneous
breaking, a small broken $\mu\lra\tau$ symmetry that is suggested to explain
observable neutrino oscillation data. $\mu\lra\tau$ symmetry is broken at tree
level in the effective neutrino mass matrix due to the mass difference
$\widetilde{m}_{\tau}\neq \widetilde{m}_{\mu}$ in the diagonal Dirac mass
terms, whereas all lepton mixings arise from a Majorana mass matrix. In the
limit of a small breaking we determined $\theta_{13}$, and the deviation from
the maximal value of $\theta_{ATM}$, in terms of the light neutrino hierarchy
scale, $m_{3}$, and a single free parameter $h_{s}$ of the model.
