We provide a complete solution of the problems of the probability
distribution and the escape rate in Poisson-noise driven systems. It includes
both the exponents and the prefactors. The analysis refers to an overdamped
particle in a potential well. The results apply for an arbitrary average rate
of noise pulses, from slow pulse rates, where the noise acts on the system as
strongly non-Gaussian, to high pulse rates, where the noise acts as effectively
Gaussian.
