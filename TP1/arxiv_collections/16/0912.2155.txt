The classes of exact multi line soliton, periodic solutions and solutions
with functional parameters, with constant asymptotic values at infinity
u|_{xi^2+eta^2->infty}->-epsilon, for the hyperbolic and elliptic versions of
the Nizhnik-Veselov-Novikov (NVN) equation via dibar-dressing method of
Zakharov and Manakov were constructed. At fixed time these solutions are
exactly solvable potentials correspondingly for one-dimensional perturbed
telegraph and two-dimensional stationary Schroedinger equations. Physical
meaning of stationary states of quantum particle in exact one line and two line
soliton potential valleys was discussed. In the limit epsilon->0 exact special
solutions u^{1}, u^{2} (line solitons and periodic solutions) were found which
sum u^{1}+u^{2}(linear superposition) is also exact solution of NVN equation.
