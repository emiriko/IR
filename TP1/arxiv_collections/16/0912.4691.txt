We present results of a signature-based search for new physics using a dijet
plus missing transverse energy data sample collected in 2 fb-1 of p-pbar
collisions at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV with the CDF II detector at the Fermilab
Tevatron. We observe no significant event excess with respect to the standard
model prediction and extract a 95% C.L. upper limit on the cross section times
acceptance for a potential contribution from a non-standard model process.
Based on this limit the mass of a first or second generation scalar leptoquark
is constrained to be above 187 GeV/c^2.
