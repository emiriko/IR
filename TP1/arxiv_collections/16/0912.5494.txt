This work expands further our earlier poster presentation and integration of
the OpenGL Slides Framework (OGLSF) - to make presentations with real-time
animated graphics where each slide is a scene with tidgets - and physical based
animation of elastic two-, three-layer softbody objects. The whole project is
very interactive, and serves dual purpose - delivering the teaching material in
a classroom setting with real running animated examples as well as releasing
the source code to the students to show how the actual working things are made.
