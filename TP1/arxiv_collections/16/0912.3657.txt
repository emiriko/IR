The fermionic T-duality transformation developed by Berkovits and Maldacena
is applied to D-brane and the pp-wave solutions of type IIB supergravity. The
pp-wave is found to be self-dual under the combination of dualities. We explore
the consequences of applying the transformation and discuss various properties
of the new transformed solutions.
