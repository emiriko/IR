We demonstrate for the first time natural phase matching for optical
frequency doubling in a high-Q whispering gallery mode resonator made of
Lithium Niobate. A conversion efficiency of 9% is achieved at 30 micro Watt
in-coupled continuous wave pump power. The observed saturation pump power of
3.2 mW is almost two orders of magnitude lower than the state-of-the-art. This
suggests an application of our frequency doubler as a source of non-classical
light requiring only a low-power pump, which easily can be quantum noise
limited. Our theoretical analysis of the three-wave mixing in a whispering
gallery mode resonator provides the relative conversion efficiencies for
frequency doubling in various modes.
