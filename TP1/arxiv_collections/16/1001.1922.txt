The aim of this paper is to propose a realistic and operational model to
quantify the systematic risk of mortality included in an engagement of
retirement. The model presented is built on the basis of model of Lee-Carter.
The stochastic prospective tables thus built make it possible to project the
evolution of the random mortality rates in the future and to quantify the
systematic risk of mortality.
