Assuming diffusive carrier transport and employing an effective medium
theory, we calculate the temperature dependence of bilayer graphene
conductivity due to Fermi-surface broadening as a function of carrier density.
We find that the temperature dependence of the conductivity depends strongly on
the amount of disorder. In the regime relevant to most experiments, the
conductivity is a function of T/T*, where T* is the characteristic temperature
set by disorder. We demonstrate that experimental data taken from various
groups collapse onto a theoretically predicted scaling function.
