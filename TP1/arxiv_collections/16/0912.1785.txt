In the metamaterial with hyperbolic dispersion (an array of silver nanowires
in alumina membrane) we have observed six-fold reduction of the emission
life-time of dye deposited onto the metamaterials surface. This serves as the
evidence of the earlier predicted high density of photonic states in hyperbolic
metamaterials.
