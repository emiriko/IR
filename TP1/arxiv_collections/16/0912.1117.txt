We consider diffusion of a cold Fermi gas in the presence of a random optical
speckle potential. The evolution of the initial atomic cloud in space and time
is discussed. Analytical and numerical results are presented in various
regimes. Diffusion of a Bose-Einstein condensate is also briefly discussed and
similarity with the Fermi gas case is pointed out.
