The dark matter content of galaxies is usually determined from galaxies in
dynamical equilibrium, mainly from rotationally supported galactic components.
Such determinations restrict measurements to special regions in galaxies, e.g.
the galactic plane(s), whereas other regions are not probed at all. Interacting
galaxies offer an alternative, because extended tidal tails often probe outer
or off-plane regions of galaxies. However, these systems are neither in
dynamical equilibrium nor simple, because they are composed of two or more
galaxies, by this increasing the associated parameter space.We present our
genetic algorithm based modeling tool which allows to investigate the extended
parameter space of interacting galaxies. From these studies, we derive the
dynamical history of (well observed) galaxies. Among other parameters we
constrain the dark matter content of the involved galaxies. We demonstrate the
applicability of this strategy with examples ranging from stellar streams
around theMilkyWay to extended tidal tails, from proto-typical binary galaxies
(like M51 or the Antennae system) to small group of galaxies.
