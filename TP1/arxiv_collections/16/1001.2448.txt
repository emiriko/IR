The resonance fluorescence from regular atomic systems is shown to represent
a continuous source of non-Gaussian entangled radiation propagating in two
different directions. For a single atom entanglement occurs under the same
conditions as squeezing. For more atoms, the entanglement can be more robust
against dephasing than squeezing, hence providing a useful continuous source
for various applications of entangled radiation.
