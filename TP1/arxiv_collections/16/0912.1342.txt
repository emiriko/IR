Initial state radiation, multiple interactions, and event pileup can
contaminate jets and degrade event reconstruction. Here we introduce a
procedure, jet trimming, designed to mitigate these sources of contamination in
jets initiated by light partons. This procedure is complimentary to existing
methods developed for boosted heavy particles. We find that jet trimming can
achieve significant improvements in event reconstruction, especially at high
energy/luminosity hadron colliders like the LHC.
