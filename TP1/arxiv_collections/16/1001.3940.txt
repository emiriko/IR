A solid slender beam of length $L$, made from a material of Young's modulus
$Y$ and subject to a gentle compressive force $F$, requires a volume of
material proportional to $L^{3}f^{1/2}$ [where $f\equiv F/(YL^{2})\ll 1$] in
order to be stable against Euler buckling. By constructing a hierarchical space
frame, we are able to systematically change the scaling of required material
with $f$ so that it is proportional to $L^{3}f^{(G+1)/(G+2)}$, through changing
the number of hierarchical levels $G$ present in the structure. Based on simple
choices for the geometry of the space frames, we provide expressions specifying
in detail the optimal structures (in this class) for different values of the
loading parameter $f$. These structures may then be used to create effective
materials which are elastically isotropic and have the combination of low
density and high crush strength. Such a material could be used to make
light-weight components of arbitrary shape.
