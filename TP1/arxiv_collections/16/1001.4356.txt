We consider bulk correlation numbers on disk in one-matrix model. Using the
recently found so-called resonance transformation from the KdV to the Liouville
frame, we obtain an explicit expression for the bulk one-point function. The
result is consistent with the form of FZZ one-point function in the boundary
Liouville Field Theory.
