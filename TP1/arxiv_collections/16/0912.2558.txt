During the last few decades scientists have been able to test the bases of
the physics paradigms, where the quantum mechanics has to match the
cosmological scales. Between the extremes of this scenario, biological
phenomena and their complexity take place, challenging the laws we observe in
the atomic and sub-atomic world. In order to explore the details of this world,
new huge experimental facilities are under construction. These projects involve
people coming from several countries and give physicists the opportunity to
work together with chemists, biologists and other scientists. The Roman Young
Researchers Meeting is a conference, organised by Ph. D. students and young
postdocs connected to the Roman area. It is aimed primarily at graduate
students and post-docs, working in physics. The 1st conference has been held on
the 21st of July 2009 at the University of Roma Tor Vergata. It was organised
in three sessions, devoted to Astrophysics and Cosmology, Soft and Condensed
Matter Physics and Theoretical and Particle Physics. In this proceeding we
collect the contributions which have been presented and discussed during the
meeting, according to the specific topics treated.
