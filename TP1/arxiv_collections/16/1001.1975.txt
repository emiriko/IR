In recent times, a necessity has been raised in order to distribute computing
applications often across grids. These applications are dependent on the
services like data transfer or data portal services as well as submission of
jobs. Security is of utmost importance in grid computing applications as grid
resources are heterogeneous, dynamic, and multidomain. Authentication remains
as the significant security challenge in grid environment. In traditional
authentication protocol a single server stores the sensitive user credentials,
like username and password. When such a server is compromised, a large number
of user passwords, will be exposed. Our proposed approach uses a dual
authentication protocol in order to improve the authentication service in grid
environment. The protocol utilizes the fundamental concepts of trigon and based
on the parameters of the trigon the user authentication will be performed. In
the proposed protocol, the password is interpreted and alienated into more than
one unit and these units are stored in two different servers, namely,
Authentication Server and Backend Server. Only when the combined authentication
scheme from both the servers authenticates the user, the privilege of accessing
the requested resources is obtained by the user. The main advantage of
utilizing the dual authentication protocol in grid computing is that an
adversary user cannot attain the access privilege by compromising a single
consolidated server because of the fact that the split password is stored in
different servers.
