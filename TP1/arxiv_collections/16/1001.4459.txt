The Privacy Coach is an application running on a mobile phone that supports
customers in making privacy decisions when confronted with RFID tags. The
approach we take to increase customer privacy is a radical departure from the
mainstream research efforts that focus on implementing privacy enhancing
technologies on the RFID tags themselves. Instead the Privacy Coach functions
as a mediator between customer privacy preferences and corporate privacy
policies, trying to find a match between the two, and informing the user of the
outcome. In this paper we report on the architecture of the Privacy Coach, and
show how it enables users to make informed privacy decisions in a user-friendly
manner. We also spend considerable time to discuss lessons learnt and to
describe future plans to further improve on the Privacy Coach concept.
