We investigate the correlation between the point disclination energies and
the surface curvature modulation of nematic liquid crystal membranes with a
Gaussian bump geometry. Due to the correlation, disclinations feel an
attractive force that confines them to an annulus region, resulting in a halo
distribution around the top of the bump. The halo formation is a direct
consequence of the nonzero Gaussian curvature of the bump that affects
preferable configurations of liquid crystal molecules around the disclination
core.
