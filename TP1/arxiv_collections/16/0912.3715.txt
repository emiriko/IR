We extend the multi-purpose Monte-Carlo event generator Sherpa to include
processes in deeply inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering. Hadronic final states
in this kinematical setting are characterised by the presence of multiple
kinematical scales, which were up to now accounted for only by specific
resummations in individual kinematical regions. Using an extension of the
recently introduced method for merging truncated parton showers with
higher-order tree-level matrix elements, it is possible to obtain predictions
which are reliable in all kinematical limits. Different hadronic final states,
defined by jets or individual hadrons, in deep-inelastic scattering are
analysed and the corresponding results are compared to HERA data. The various
sources of theoretical uncertainties of the approach are discussed and
quantified. The extension to deeply inelastic processes provides the
opportunity to validate the merging of matrix elements and parton showers in
multi-scale kinematics inaccessible in other collider environments. It also
allows to use HERA data on hadronic final states in the tuning of hadronisation
models.
