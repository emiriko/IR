Driven by the support and interest of the international space plasma
community to examine simultaneous physical plasma scales and their
interactions, the Cross-Scale Mission concept was submitted and accepted as an
ESA Cosmic Vision M-class candidate mission. This report presents an overview
of the assessment study phase of the 7 ESA spacecraft Cross-Scale mission.
Where appropriate, discussion of the benefit of international collaboration
with the SCOPE mission, as well as other interested parties, is included.
