We show that an Optical Parametric Oscillator which is simultaneously
resonant for several modes, either spatial or temporal, generates both below
and above threshold a multimode non-classical state of light consisting of
squeezed vacuum states in all the non-oscillating modes. We confirm this
prediction by an experiment dealing with the degenerate TEM$_{01}$ and
TEM$_{10}$ modes. We show the conservation of non-classical properties when the
threshold is crossed. The experiment is made possible by the implementation of
a new method to lock the relative phase of the pump and the injected beam.
