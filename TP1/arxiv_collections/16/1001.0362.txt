An interaction of a photon with $^3H$ is invstigated based on a three
dimensional Faddeev approach. In this approach the three-nucleon Faddeev
equations with two-nucleon interactions are formulated with consideration of
the magnitude of the vector Jacobi momenta and the angle between them with the
inclusion of the spin-isospin quantum numbers, without employing a partial wave
decomposition. In this formulation the two body t-matrices and triton wave
function are calculated in the three dimensional approach using AV18 potential.
In the first step we use the standard single nucleon current in this article.
