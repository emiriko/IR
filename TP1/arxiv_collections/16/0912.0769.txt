We show that when graphene monolayers are disordered, the conductance
exhibits a metallic-to-insulating transition, which opens the door to new
electronic devices. The transition can be observed by driving the density or
Fermi energy through the mobility edge. At the Dirac point the system is
localized, whereas at higher densities there is a region of metallic behavior
before the system becomes insulating again at higher densities. The region of
metallic behavior depends on the disorder strength and eventually vanishes at
high disorder. This result is quite unexpected since in square lattices,
scaling theory predicts that this metallic region does not exist in two
dimensions, in contrast to graphene, where the lattice is a honeycomb.
