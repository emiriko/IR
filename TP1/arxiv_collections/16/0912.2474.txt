I propose a new and direct connection between classical mechanics and quantum
mechanics where I derive the quantum mechanical propagator from a variational
principle. This variational principle is Hamilton's modified principle
generalized to allow many paths due to the non-local existence of particles in
phase space. This principle allows a physical system to evolve non-locally in
phase space while still allowing a representation that uses many classical
paths. Whereas a point in phase space represents a classical system's state, I
represent the state of a non-local system by a mixed trajectory. This
formulation naturally leads to the transactional interpretation for resolving
the paradoxes of the measurement problem. This principle also suggests a more
flexible framework for formulating theories based on invariant actions and
provides a single conceptual framework for discussing many areas of science.
