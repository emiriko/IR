Randomness extraction involves the processing of purely classical information
and is therefore usually studied in the framework of classical probability
theory. However, such a classical treatment is generally too restrictive for
applications, where side information about the values taken by classical random
variables may be represented by the state of a quantum system. This is
particularly relevant in the context of cryptography, where an adversary may
make use of quantum devices. Here, we show that the well known construction
paradigm for extractors proposed by Trevisan is sound in the presence of
quantum side information.
  We exploit the modularity of this paradigm to give several concrete extractor
constructions, which, e.g, extract all the conditional (smooth) min-entropy of
the source using a seed of length poly-logarithmic in the input, or only
require the seed to be weakly random.
