The localized spin triplet ground state of a nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in
diamond can be used in atomic-scale detection of local magnetic fields. Here we
present a technique using these defects in diamond to image fields around
magnetic structures. We extract the local magnetic field vector by probing
resonant transitions of the four fixed tetrahedral NV orientations. In
combination with confocal microscopy techniques, we construct a 2-dimensional
image of the local magnetic field vectors. Measurements are done in external
fields less than 50 G and under ambient conditions.
