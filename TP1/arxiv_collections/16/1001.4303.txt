The paper studies scaling limits of random skew plane partitions confined to
a box when the inner shapes converge uniformly to a piecewise linear function V
of arbitrary slopes in [-1,1]. It is shown that the correlation kernels in the
bulk are given by the incomplete Beta kernel, as expected. As a consequence it
is established that the local correlation functions in the scaling limit do not
depend on the particular sequence of discrete inner shapes that converge to V.
A detailed analysis of the correlation kernels at the top of the limit shape
and of the frozen boundary is given. It is shown that depending on the slope of
the linear section of the back wall, the system exhibits behavior observed in
either [OR2] or [BMRT].
