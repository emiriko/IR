Differential privacy is a robust privacy standard that has been successfully
applied to a range of data analysis tasks. Despite much recent work, optimal
strategies for answering a collection of correlated queries are not known.
  We study the problem of devising a set of strategy queries, to be submitted
and answered privately, that will support the answers to a given workload of
queries. We propose a general framework in which query strategies are formed
from linear combinations of counting queries, and we describe an optimal method
for deriving new query answers from the answers to the strategy queries. Using
this framework we characterize the error of strategies geometrically, and we
propose solutions to the problem of finding optimal strategies.
