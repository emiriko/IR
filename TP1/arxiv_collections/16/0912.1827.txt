We demonstrate the fabrication of high-performance Ge-SixGe1-x core-shell
nanowire field-effect transistors with highly doped source and drain, and
systematically investigate their scaling properties. Highly doped source and
drain regions are realized by low energy boron implantation, which enables
efficient carrier injection with a contact resistance much lower than the
nanowire resistance. We extract key device parameters, such as intrinsic
channel resistance, carrier mobility, effective channel length, and external
contact resistance, as well as benchmark the device switching speed and ON/OFF
current ratio.
