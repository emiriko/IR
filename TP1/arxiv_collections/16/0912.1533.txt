We describe a versatile planar Penning trap structure, which allows to
dynamically modify the trapping conguration almost arbitrarily. The trap
consists of 37 hexagonal electrodes, each with a circumcirle-diameter of 300 m,
fabricated in a gold-on-sapphire lithographic technique. Every hexagon can be
addressed individually, thus shaping the electric potential. The fabrication of
such a device with clean room methods is demonstrated. We illustrate the
variability of the device by a detailed numerical simulation of a lateral and a
vertical transport and we simulate trapping in racetrack and articial crystal
congurations. The trap may be used for ions or electrons, as a versatile
container for quantum optics and quantum information experiments.
