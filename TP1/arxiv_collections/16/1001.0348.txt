Harmonic numbers $H_k=\sum_{0<j\le k}1/j (k=0,1,2,...)$ arise naturally in
many fields of mathematics. In this paper we initiate the study of congruences
involving both harmonic numbers and Lucas sequences. One of our three theorems
is as follows: Let u_0=0, u_1=1, and u_{n+1}=u_n-4u_{n-1} for n=1,2,3,....
Then, for any prime p>5 we have $$\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}u_{k+\delta}H_k/2^k=0 (mod
p),$$ where $\delta=0$ if p=1,2,4,8 (mod 15), and $\delta=1$ otherwise.
