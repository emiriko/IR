In the present paper a new concept is introduced that: `mass is a complex
quantity'. The concept of complex-mass suggests that the total mass M of a
moving body is complex sum of: (i) the real-part (grain or rest) mass $m_{g}$
establishing its particle behaviour and (ii) the imaginary-part mass $m_{p}$
governing its wave properties. Mathematically, the complex mass $M = m_{g} +
im_{p}$; the magnitude $\mid M \mid = (m_{g}^{2} + m_{p}^{2})^{{1/2}}. The
theory proposed here explains successfully several effects such as `Compton
effect' and `refraction of light' which could not be explained otherwise by a
single theory of wave or particle. Also explained are `Doppler effect for
light', `photo-electric effect', `Uncertainty principle', `Relativity' and
`supersymmetry'
