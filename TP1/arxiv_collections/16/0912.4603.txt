This article investigates entanglement of the motional states of massive
coupled oscillators. The specific realization of an idealized diatomic molecule
in one-dimension is considered, but the techniques developed apply to any
massive particles with two degrees of freedom and a quadratic Hamiltonian. We
present two methods, one analytic and one approximate, to calculate the
interatomic entanglement for Gaussian and non-Gaussian pure states as measured
by the purity of the reduced density matrix. The cases of free and trapped
molecules and hetero- and homonuclear molecules are treated. In general, when
the trap frequency and the molecular frequency are very different, and when the
atomic masses are equal, the atoms are highly-entangled for molecular coherent
states and number states. Surprisingly, while the interatomic entanglement can
be quite large even for molecular coherent states, the covariance of atomic
position and momentum observables can be entirely explained by a classical
model with appropriately chosen statistical uncertainty.
