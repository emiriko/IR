We apply epicyclic resonances to the magnetic connection (MC) of a black hole
(BH) with a relativistic accretion disc, interpreting the high frequency
quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) with 3:2 pairs observed in three BH X-ray
binaries. It turns out that the 3:2 HFQPO pairs are associated with the steep
power-law states, and the severe damping can be overcome by transferring energy
and angular momentum from a spinning BH to the inner disc in the MC process.
