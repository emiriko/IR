The magnetostructural transitions and magnetoelectric effects reported in
TbMn2O5 are described theoretically and shown to correspond to two essentially
different mechanisms for the induced ferroelectricity. The incommensurate and
commensurate phases observed between 38 and 24 K exhibit a hybrid pseudoproper
ferroelectric nature resulting from an effective bilinear coupling of the
polarization with the antiferromagnetic order parameter. This explains the high
sensitivity of the dielectric properties of the material under applied magnetic
field. Below 24 K the incommensurate phase shows a standard improper
ferroelectric character induced by the coupling of two distinct magnetic order
parameters. The complex dielectric behavior observed in the material reflects
the crossover from one to the other transition regime. The temperature
dependences of the pertinent physical quantities are worked out, and previous
theoretical models are discussed.
