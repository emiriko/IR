Complete expressions of time-domain gravitational waveforms for spinning
binary inspirals via the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation would require
determination of the phase, amplitude, inclination angle, precession phase and
spin vectors as well as the knowledge of the order coefficients for the PN
expansion terms. These quantities are determined by solving simultaneously the
spin-precession equations, the evolution equation for the Newtonian angular
momentum, and the equation for the orbital frequency. For the spinning binaries
with equal masses, determination of these quantities can be done fully
analytically, by taking advantage of the equal mass symmetry, therefore by
simplifying those equations to solve. We provide the analytical results through
1.5 PN order which includes spin-orbit interactions.
