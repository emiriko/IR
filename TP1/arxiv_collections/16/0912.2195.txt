A method is given for quantitatively rating the social acceptance of
different options which are the matter of a preferential vote. In contrast to a
previous article, here the individual votes are allowed to be incomplete, that
is, they need not express a comparison between every pair of options. This
includes the case where each voter gives an ordered list restricted to a subset
of most preferred options. In this connection, the proposed method (except for
one of the given variants) carefully distinguishes a lack of information about
a given pair of options from a proper tie between them. As in the special case
of complete individual votes, the proposed generalization is proved to have
certain desirable properties, which include: the continuity of the rates with
respect to the data, a decomposition property that characterizes certain
situations opposite to a tie, the Condorcet-Smith principle, and clone
consistency
