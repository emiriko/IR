We present the first experimental investigation of nonlinear optical
properties of graphene flakes. We find that at near infrared frequencies a
graphene monolayer exhibits a remarkably high third-order optical nonlinearity
which is practically independent of the wavelengths of incident light. The
nonlinear optical response can be utilized for imaging purposes, with image
contrasts of graphene which are orders of magnitude higher than those obtained
using linear microscopy.
