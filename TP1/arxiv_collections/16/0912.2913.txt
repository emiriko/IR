A Lattice Boltzmann formulation for relativistic fluids is presented and
numerically verified through quantitative comparison with recent hydrodynamic
simulations of relativistic shock-wave propagation in viscous quark-gluon
plasmas. This formulation opens up the possibility of exporting the main
advantages of Lattice Boltzmann methods to the relativistic context, which
seems particularly useful for the simulation of relativistic fluids in
complicated geometries.
