We analyzed data accumulated during 2005 and 2006 by the Taiwan-American
Occultation Survey (TAOS) in order to detect short-period variable stars
(periods of <~ 1 hour) such as delta Scuti. TAOS is designed for the detection
of stellar occultation by small-size Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) and is
operating four 50cm telescopes at an effective cadence of 5Hz. The four
telescopes simultaneously monitor the same patch of the sky in order to reduce
false positives. To detect short-period variables, we used the Fast Fourier
Transform algorithm (FFT) inasmuch as the data points in TAOS light-curves are
evenly spaced. Using FFT, we found 41 short-period variables with amplitudes
smaller than a few hundredths of a magnitude and periods of about an hour,
which suggest that they are low-amplitude delta Scuti stars (LADS). The
light-curves of TAOS delta Scuti stars are accessible online at the Time Series
Center website (http://timemachine.iic.harvard.edu)
