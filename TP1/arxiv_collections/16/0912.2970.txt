Quantum memories, capable of controllably storing and releasing a photon, are
a crucial component for quantum computers and quantum communications. So far,
quantum memories have operated with bandwidths that limit data rates to MHz.
Here we report the coherent storage and retrieval of sub-nanosecond low
intensity light pulses with spectral bandwidths exceeding 1 GHz in cesium
vapor. The novel memory interaction takes place via a far off-resonant
two-photon transition in which the memory bandwidth is dynamically generated by
a strong control field. This allows for an increase in data rates by a factor
of almost 1000 compared to existing quantum memories. The memory works with a
total efficiency of 15% and its coherence is demonstrated by directly
interfering the stored and retrieved pulses. Coherence times in hot atomic
vapors are on the order of microsecond - the expected storage time limit for
this memory.
