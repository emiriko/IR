The behavior of a nanodevice based upon double-walled carbon nanotube
oscillators driven by periodically applied thermal gradients (7 and 17 K/nm) is
investigated by numerical calculations and classical molecular dynamics
simulations. Our results indicate that thermophoresis can be effective to
initiate the oscillator and that suitable heat pulses may provide an
appropriate way to tune its behavior. Sustained regular oscillatory as well as
chaotic motions were observed for the systems investigated in this work.
