Current cosmological models indicate that the Milky Way's stellar halo was
assembled from many smaller systems. Based on the apparent absence of the most
metal-poor stars in present-day dwarf galaxies, recent studies claimed that the
true Galactic building blocks must have been vastly different from the
surviving dwarfs. The discovery of an extremely iron-poor star (S1020549) in
the Sculptor dwarf galaxy based on a medium-resolution spectrum cast some doubt
on this conclusion. However, verification of the iron-deficiency and
measurements of additional elements, such as the alpha-element Mg, are
mandatory for demonstrating that the same type of stars produced the metals
found in dwarf galaxies and the Galactic halo. Only then can dwarf galaxy stars
be conclusively linked to early stellar halo assembly. Here we report
high-resolution spectroscopic abundances for 11 elements in S1020549,
confirming the iron abundance of less than 1/4000th that of the Sun, and
showing that the overall abundance pattern mirrors that seen in low-metallicity
halo stars, including the alpha-elements. Such chemical similarity indicates
that the systems destroyed to form the halo billions of years ago were not
fundamentally different from the progenitors of present-day dwarfs, and
suggests that the early chemical enrichment of all galaxies may be nearly
identical.
