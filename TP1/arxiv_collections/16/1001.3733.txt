By using a No-Scale Supergravity model, which was proved well to explain WMAP
observations appropriately, a mechanism of preheating just after the end of
inflation is investigated. By using the canonically normalized and diagonalized
scalars, the decay rates of these fields are calculated inflaton $S$ into gauge
sector fields. The reheating temperature is estimated by both the stability
condition of Boltzmann equation and the instant preheating mechanism. The both
of reheating temperatures are almost the same order of magnitude $\sim
O(10^{10})$ GeV. Because two mechanisms are completely independent processes,
the former is caused through the inflaton decays into gauge fields and
gauginons and the latter is caused by the scattering process of two inflatons
into two right handed sneutrinos, which will decay into Higgs fields and other
minimal SUSY standard model (MSSM) particles, we conclude that both mechanisms
play essential roles in the preheating process after inflation.
