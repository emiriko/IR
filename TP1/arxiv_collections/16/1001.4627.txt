We present results for a combined resummation of soft and Coloumb gluon
corrections in squark-antisquark production at the LHC, including the
non-trivial interference of the two effects and the contribution of
squark-antisquark bound states below threshold. The total correction to the
next-to-leading order approximation is found to be sizeable, and amounts to
5-14 % in the squark mass region 200 GeV-2 TeV. The scale dependence of the
total cross section is also reduced.
