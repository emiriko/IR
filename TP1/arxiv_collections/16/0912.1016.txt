The technique of database refactoring is all about applying disciplined and
controlled techniques to change an existing database schema. The problem is to
successfully create a Database Refactoring Framework for databases. This paper
concentrates on the feasibility of adapting this concept to work as a generic
template. To retain the constraints regardless of the modifications to the
metadata, the paper proposes a MetaData Manipulation Tool to facilitate change.
The tool adopts a Template Design Pattern to make it database independent. The
paper presents a drawback of using java for constraint extraction and proposes
an alternative.
