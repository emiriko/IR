Graphene based sheets have stimulated great interest due to their superior
mechanical, electrical and thermal properties. A general visualization method
that allows quick observation of these single atomic layers would be highly
desirable as it can greatly facilitate sample evaluation and manipulation, and
provide immediate feedback to improve synthesis and processing strategies. Here
we report that graphene based sheets can be made highly visible under a
fluorescence microscope by quenching the emission from a dye coating, which can
be conveniently removed afterwards by rinsing without disrupting the sheets.
Current imaging techniques for graphene based sheets rely on the use of special
substrates. In contrast, the fluorescence quenching mechanism is no longer
limited by the types of substrates. Graphene, reduced graphene oxide, or even
graphene oxide sheets deposited on arbitrary substrates can now be readily
visualized by eye with good contrast for layer counting. Direct observation of
suspended sheets in solution was also demonstrated. The fluorescence quenching
microscopy offers unprecedented imaging flexibility and could become a general
tool for characterizing graphene based materials.
