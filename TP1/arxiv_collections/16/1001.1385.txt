This paper deals with the quantum optimal discrimination among mixed quantum
states enjoying geometrical uniform symmetry with respect to a reference
density operator $\rho_0$. It is well-known that the minimal error probability
is given by the positive operator-valued measure (POVM) obtained as a solution
of a convex optimization problem, namely a set of operators satisfying
geometrical symmetry, with respect to a reference operator $\Pi_0$, and
maximizing $\textrm{Tr}(\rho_0 \Pi_0)$. In this paper, by resolving the dual
problem, we show that the same result is obtained by minimizing the trace of a
semidefinite positive operator $X$ commuting with the symmetry operator and
such that $X >= \rho_0$. The new formulation gives a deeper insight into the
optimization problem and allows to obtain closed-form analytical solutions, as
shown by a simple but not trivial explanatory example. Besides the theoretical
interest, the result leads to semidefinite programming solutions of reduced
complexity, allowing to extend the numerical performance evaluation to quantum
communication systems modeled in Hilbert spaces of large dimension.
