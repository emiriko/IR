When a single resonator is coupled to a continuous spectrum one obtains a
resonance of finite half-width. Such a resonance is known in many fields of
physics. The Friedel resonance is an example where a d-impurity is dissolved in
a simple metal. If two resonators are coupled to the continuous spectrum the
resonances interfere. For identical coupling and frequencies one obtains two
effective resonances. The effective coupling of one of them to the continuum
can be tuned to zero yielding a delta-like resonance.
