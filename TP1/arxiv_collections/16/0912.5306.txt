We consider a processor sharing queue where the number of jobs served at any
time is limited to $K$, with the excess jobs waiting in a buffer. We use random
counting measures on the positive axis to model this system. The limit of this
measure-valued process is obtained under diffusion scaling and heavy traffic
conditions. As a consequence, the limit of the system size process is proved to
be a piece-wise reflected Brownian motion.
