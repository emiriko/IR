We present an extension of a previously suggested test of all modified
theories of gravity that would reproduce MOND at low accelerations. In a class
of models, called "dark matter emulators", gravitational waves and other
particles couple to different metrics. This leads to a detectable time lag
between their detection at Earth from the same source. We calculate this time
lag numerically for any event that occurs in our galaxy up to 400 kpc, and
present a graph of this possible time lag. This suggests that, gravitational
wave observers might have to consider the possibility of extending their
analysis to non-coincident gravitational and electromagnetic signals, and the
graph that we present might be a useful guideline for this effort.
