The generation of an early kination dominated era within a tracking
quintessential model is investigated, the relic density of the Weakly
Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) is calculated and we show that it can be
enhanced with respect to its value in the standard cosmology. By adjusting the
parameters of the quintessential scenario, the cold dark matter abundance in
the universe can become compatible with large values for the annihilation cross
section times the velocity of the WIMPs. Using these values and assuming that
the WIMPs annihilate predominantly to $\mu^+\mu^-$, we calculate the induced
fluxes of $e^\pm$ cosmic rays and fit the current PAMELA and Fermi-LAT data. We
achieve rather good fits in conjunction with a marginal fulfillment of the
restriction arisen from the cosmic microwave background radiation.
