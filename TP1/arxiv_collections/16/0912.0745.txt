The objective of this paper is to understand the critical parameters that
need to be addressed while designing a guitar tuner. The focus of the design
lies in developing a suitable algorithm to accurately detect the fundamental
frequency of a plucked guitar string from its frequency spectrum. A
userfriendly graphical interface is developed using Matlab to allow any user to
easily tune his guitar using the developed program.
