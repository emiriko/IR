We consider the spin correlation functions for rare-earth compounds in their
paramagnetic state with the aim to understand the temperature dependence of the
quasi-elastic and crystal-field linewidths and the spin-lattice relaxation
rates measured by the muon-spin-relaxation technique. Both the conduction
electron and phonon relaxation mechanisms are treated. First the single-ion
dynamics is described using an iterative method introduced by P. M. Richards.
Then the case of a regular lattice of rare-earth ions is studied using the
random-phase approximation (RPA). Applications to simple crystal-field level
schemes are given with particular emphasis on the phonon relaxation mechanism.
This allows us to investigate the domain of validity of our results. In order
to account for data recorded on insulators, a phenomelogical modification is
suggested.
