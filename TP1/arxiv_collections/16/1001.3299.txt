We present a detailed analysis of the dynamics of photon transport in
waveguiding systems in the presence of a two-level system. In these systems,
quantum interference effects generate a strong effective optical nonlinearity
on the few-photon level. We clarify the relevant physical mechanisms through an
appropriate quantum many-body approach. Based on this, we demonstrate that a
single-particle photon-atom bound state with an energy outside the band can be
excited via multi-particle scattering processes. We further show that these
trapping effects are robust and, therefore, will be useful for the control of
photon entanglement in solid-state based quantum optical systems.
