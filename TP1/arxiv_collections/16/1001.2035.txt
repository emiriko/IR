We analyzed the decays of $B^{+}\to {\bar {D}^0}+D^{+}_{sJ}(2S)$ and
$B^{+}\to\bar D^{0}+D^{+}_{sJ}(1D)$ by naive factorization method and model
dependent calculation based on the Bethe-Salpeter method, the branching ratios
are $Br({\bar {D}^0}D^{+}_{sJ}(2S))=(0.72\pm0.12)%$ and $Br({\bar
{D}^0}D^{+}_{sJ}(1D))=(0.027\pm0.007)%$. The branching ratio of decay $B^{+}\to
{\bar {D}^0}D^{+}_{sJ}(2S)\to {\bar {D}^0}D^0 K^+$ consist with the data of
Belle Collaboration, so we conclude that the new state $D^{+}_{sJ}(2700)$ is
the first excited state $D^{+}_{sJ}(2S)$.
