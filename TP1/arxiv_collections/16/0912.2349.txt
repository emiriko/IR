Finiteness spaces constitute a categorical model of Linear Logic (LL) whose
objects can be seen as linearly topologised spaces, (a class of topological
vector spaces introduced by Lefschetz in 1942) and morphisms as continuous
linear maps. First, we recall definitions of finiteness spaces and describe
their basic properties deduced from the general theory of linearly topologised
spaces. Then we give an interpretation of LL based on linear algebra. Second,
thanks to separation properties, we can introduce an algebraic notion of
totality candidate in the framework of linearly topologised spaces: a totality
candidate is a closed affine subspace which does not contain 0. We show that
finiteness spaces with totality candidates constitute a model of classical LL.
Finally, we give a barycentric simply typed lambda-calculus, with booleans
${\mathcal{B}}$ and a conditional operator, which can be interpreted in this
model. We prove completeness at type ${\mathcal{B}}^n\to{\mathcal{B}}$ for
every n by an algebraic method.
