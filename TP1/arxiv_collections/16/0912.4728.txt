The very high energy (VHE; E > 100 GeV) gamma-ray blazar Markarian 501 has a
history of extreme spectral variability and is an excellent laboratory for
studying the physical processes within the jets of active galactic nuclei. A
short term multi-wavelength study of Markarian 501 was coordinated in March
2009 using the Suzaku X-ray satellite as well as the VERITAS and MAGIC
experiments to cover the critical X-ray and VHE gamma-ray bands. The results of
the quiescent-state observations with VERITAS and Suzaku are combined with
public data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and compared to historical
observations of the source during an extreme outburst, to examine the spectral
variability, particularly how the spectral energy distribution varies with
flux.
