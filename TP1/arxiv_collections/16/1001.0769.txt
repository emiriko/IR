We use present cosmological data from the cosmic microwave background,
large-scale structure and deuterium at high redshifts to constrain
supersymmetric F- and D-term hybrid inflation scenarios including possible
contributions to the CMB anisotropies from cosmic strings. Using two different
realizations of the cosmic string spectrum, we find that the minimal version of
the D-term model is ruled out at high significance. F-term models are also in
tension with the data. We also discuss possible non-minimal variants of the
models.
