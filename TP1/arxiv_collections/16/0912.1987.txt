We consider a MIMO fading broadcast channel where the fading channel
coefficients are constant over time-frequency blocks that span a coherent time
$\times$ a coherence bandwidth. In closed-loop systems, channel state
information at transmitter (CSIT) is acquired by the downlink training sent by
the base station and an explicit feedback from each user terminal. In open-loop
systems, CSIT is obtained by exploiting uplink training and channel
reciprocity. We use a tight closed-form lower bound on the ergodic achievable
rate in the presence of CSIT errors in order to optimize the overall system
throughput, by taking explicitly into account the overhead due to channel
estimation and channel state feedback. Based on three time-frequency block
models inspired by actual systems, we provide some useful guidelines for the
overall system optimization. In particular, digital (quantized) feedback is
found to offer a substantial advantage over analog (unquantized) feedback.
