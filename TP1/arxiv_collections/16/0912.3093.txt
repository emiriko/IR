With the development of high throughput sequencing technology, it becomes
possible to directly analyze mutation distribution in a genome-wide fashion,
dissociating mutation rate measurements from the traditional underlying
assumptions. Here, we sequenced several genomes of Escherichia coli from
colonies obtained after chemical mutagenesis and observed a strikingly
nonrandom distribution of the induced mutations. These include long stretches
of exclusively G to A or C to T transitions along the genome and orders of
magnitude intra- and inter-genomic differences in mutation density. Whereas
most of these observations can be explained by the known features of enzymatic
processes, the others could reflect stochasticity in the molecular processes at
the single-cell level. Our results demonstrate how analysis of the molecular
records left in the genomes of the descendants of an individual mutagenized
cell allows for genome-scale observations of fixation and segregation of
mutations, as well as recombination events, in the single genome of their
progenitor.
