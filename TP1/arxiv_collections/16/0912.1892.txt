The energy of the ions accelerated by an intense electromagnetic wave in the
radiation pressure dominated regime can be greatly enhanced due to a transverse
expansion of a thin target. The expansion decreases the number of accelerated
ions in the irradiated region increasing the energy and the longitudinal
velocity of remaining ions. In the relativistic limit, the ions become
phase-locked with respect to the electromagnetic wave resulting in the
unlimited ion energy gain. This effect and the use of optimal laser pulse shape
provide a new approach for great enhancing the energy of laser accelerated
ions.
