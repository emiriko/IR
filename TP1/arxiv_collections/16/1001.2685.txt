In designed experiments and surveys, known laws or design feat ures provide
checks on the most relevant aspects of a model and identify the target
parameters. In contrast, in most observational studies in the health and social
sciences, the primary study data do not identify and may not even bound target
parameters. Discrepancies between target and analogous identified parameters
(biases) are then of paramount concern, which forces a major shift in modeling
strategies. Conventional approaches are based on conditional testing of
equality constraints, which correspond to implausible point-mass priors. When
these constraints are not identified by available data, however, no such
testing is possible. In response, implausible constraints can be relaxed into
penalty functions derived from plausible prior distributions. The resulting
models can be fit within familiar full or partial likelihood frameworks. The
absence of identification renders all analyses part of a sensitivity analysis.
In this view, results from single models are merely examples of what might be
plausibly inferred. Nonetheless, just one plausible inference may suffice to
demonstrate inherent limitations of the data. Points are illustrated with
misclassified data from a study of sudden infant death syndrome. Extensions to
confounding, selection bias and more complex data structures are outlined.
