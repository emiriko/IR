The study of optical phenomena on the subwavelength scale is becoming
increasingly important in photonics, particularly in the fields of
nanoemitters, photonic crystals and plasmonics. Subwavelength field patterns
are evanescent and must thus be investigated with near-field techniques. The
light powers emitted by nanoscale sources are extremely low, undermining the
traditional approach of scattering a near field to a large (thus noisy)
far-field detector. Nanoscale detectors, providing direct sensing in the
near-field with small noise due to a small active area, are needed in
high-sensitivity, high-resolution near-field imaging and in quantum
nanophotonic circuits. Here we report the first nanoscale ~50x50nm2) detector
displaying single-photon sensitivity and a nanosecond response. These
nanodetectors can also be operated in multi-photon mode, where the detection
threshold can be set at N=1, 2, 3 or 4 photons, thus allowing the mapping of
photon number statistics on the nanoscale.
