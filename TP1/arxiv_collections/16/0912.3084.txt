We investigate localization of noninteracting particles with spins higher
than 1/2 in a two-dimensional random potential in presence of spin-orbit
coupling. We consider an integer spin ($s=1$) and a half-integer spin ($s=3/2$)
belonging to orthogonal and symplectic symmetry classes, respectively. We show
that particles with integer spin are localized and those with half-integer spin
exhibit Anderson transition. The transition belongs to universality class of
conventional symplectic model for spin-1/2 particles.
