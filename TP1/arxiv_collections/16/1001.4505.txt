In composite models with colored preons leptogluons (l_(8)) has a same status
with leptoquarks, excited leptons and quarks etc. We analyze resonant
production of color octet electron (e_(8)) at QCD Explorer stage of the Large
Hadron electron Collider (LHeC). It is shown that the e_(8) discovery at the
LHeC will simultaneously determine the compositeness scale.
