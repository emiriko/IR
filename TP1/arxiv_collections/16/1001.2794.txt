The Antarctic region in which severe ozone depletion has taken place is known
as the ozone hole. This region has two basic indicators: the area, where the
ozone abundance is low (size), and the quantity of ozone mass deficit (depth).
The energetic particles that penetrate deeply into the atmosphere and galactic
cosmic rays (GCR) modify the ozone abundance in the stratosphere. With this
research project, we are looking for evidence of a connection between
variations in the cosmic ray flux and variations in the size of the ozone hole.
In addition, we are looking for signs of the kind of processes that physically
connect GCR fluxes with variations in the stratospheric ozone hole size (OHS)
in the Antarctic region. With this goal in mind, we also analyze here the
atmospheric temperature (AT) anomalies, which have often been linked with such
variations. Using Morlet's wavelet spectral analysis to compute the coherence
between two time series, we found that during the analyzed period (1982-2005),
there existed a common signal of around 3 and 5 years between the OHS and GCR
time series, during September and November, respectively. In both cases, the
relationship showed a time-dependent anti-correlation between the two series.
On the other hand, for October the analysis showed a time-dependent correlation
that occurs around 1.7 years. These results seem to indicate that there exist
at least two kinds of modulation processes of GCR fluxes on the OHS that work
simultaneously but that change their relative relevance along the timeline.
