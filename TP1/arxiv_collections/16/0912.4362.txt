We investigate arrays of three traps with two fermionic or bosonic atoms. The
tunneling interaction between neighboring sites is used to prepare multi-site
dark states for the empty site, i.e., the hole, allowing for the coherent
manipulation of its external degrees of freedom. By means of an ab initio
integration of the Schr\"odinger equation, we investigate the adiabatic
transport of a hole between the two extreme traps of a triple-well potential.
Furthermore, a quantum-trajectory approach based on the de Broglie-Bohm
formulation of quantum mechanics is used to get physical insight into the
transport process. Finally, we discuss the use of the hole for the construction
of a coherent single hole diode and a coherent single hole transistor.
