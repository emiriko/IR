By using four-terminal configurations, we investigated the dependence of
longitudinal and diagonal resistances of a graphene p-n interface on the
quantum-Hall edge-state equilibration position. The resistance of a p-n device
in our four-terminal scheme is asymmetric with respect to the zero point where
the filling factor ($\nu$) of the entire graphene vanishes. This resistance
asymmetry is caused by the chiral-direction-dependent change of the
equilibration position and leads to a deeper insight into the equilibration
process of the quantum-Hall edge states in a bipolar graphene system.
