The electrical resistivity of the quasi-1D organic superconductor (TMTSF)2PF6
was recently measured at low temperature from the critical pressure needed to
suppress the spin-density-wave state up to a pressure where superconductivity
has almost disappeared. This data revealed a direct correlation between the
onset of superconductivity at Tc and the strength of a non-Fermi-liquid linear
term in the normal-state resistivity, going as r(T) = r0 + AT + BT2 at low
temperature, so that A goes to 0 as Tc goes to 0. Here we show that the
contribution of low-frequency antiferromagnetic fluctuations to the
spin-lattice relaxation rate is also correlated with this non-Fermi-liquid term
AT in the resistivity. These correlations suggest that anomalous scattering and
pairing have a common origin, both rooted in the low-frequency
antiferromagnetic fluctuations measured by NMR. A similar situation may also
prevail in the recently-discovered iron-pnictide superconductors.
