We study the propagation and localization of classical waves in
one-dimensional disordered structures composed of alternating layers of left-
and right-handed materials (mixed stacks) and compare them to the structures
composed of different layers of the same material (homogeneous stacks). For
weakly scattering layers, we have developed an effective analytical approach
and have calculated the transmission length within a wide region of the input
parameters. When both refractive index and layer thickness of a mixed stack are
random, the transmission length in the long-wave range of the localized regime
exhibits a quadratic power wavelength dependence with the coefficients
different for mixed and homogeneous stacks. Moreover, the transmission length
of a mixed stack differs from reciprocal of the Lyapunov exponent of the
corresponding infinite stack. In both the ballistic regime of a mixed stack and
in the near long-wave region of a homogeneous stack, the transmission length of
a realization is a strongly fluctuating quantity. In the far long-wave part of
the ballistic region, the homogeneous stack becomes effectively uniform and the
transmission length fluctuations are weaker. The crossover region from the
localization to the ballistic regime is relatively narrow for both mixed and
homogeneous stacks. In mixed stacks with only refractive-index disorder,
Anderson localization at long wavelengths is substantially suppressed, with the
localization length growing with the wavelength much faster than for
homogeneous stacks. The crossover region becomes essentially wider and
transmission resonances appear only in much longer stacks. All theoretical
predictions are in an excellent agreement with the results of numerical
simulations.
