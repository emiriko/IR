CUORE is a 1 ton scale cryogenic experiment aiming at the measurement of the
Majorana mass of the electron neutrino. The detector is an array of 988 TeO2
bolometers used for a calorimetric detection of the two electrons emitted in
the BB0n of 130Te. The sensitivity of the experiment to the lowest Majorana
mass is determined by the rate of background events that can mimic a BB0n. In
this paper we investigate the contribution of external sources i.e.
environmental gammas, neutrons and cosmic ray muons to the CUORE background and
show that the shielding setup designed for CUORE guarantees a reduction of this
external background down to a level <1.0E-02 c/keV/kg/y at the Q-value, as
required by the physical goal of the experiment.
