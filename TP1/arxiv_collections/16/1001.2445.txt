We report results of experiments performed with the KEDR detector at the
VEPP-4M e+e- collider. They include precise measurement of the D0 and D+- meson
masses, determination of the psi(3770) resonance parameters, and a search for
narrow resonances in e+e- annihilation at center-of-mass energies between 1.85
and 3.1 GeV.
