This paper reports an experimental demonstration of partial displacement
noise free laser interferometry in the gravitational wave detection band. The
used detuned Fabry-Perot cavity allows the isolation of the mimicked
gravitational wave signal from the displacement noise on the cavities input
mirror. By properly combining the reflected and transmitted signals from the
cavity a reduction of the displacement noise was achieved. Our results
represent the first experimental demonstration of this recently proposed
displacement noise free laser interferometry scheme. Overall we show that the
rejection ratio of the displacement noise to the gravitational wave signal was
improved in the frequency range of 10 Hz to 10 kHz with a typical factor of 60.
