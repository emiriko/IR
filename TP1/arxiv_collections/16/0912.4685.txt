First, we argue that the smooth metal-air interface should be regarded as a
distinct dielectric medium, the skin of the metal. The existence of this metal
skin leads to theoretical explanation of experimental data on the excitation of
electromagnetic surface shape resonances in lamellar metallic gratings by light
in the visible to near-infrared range. Surface polaritons have been observed in
reflection modes on metallized gratings where the electric field is highly
localized inside the grooves (around 300-1000 times larger than intensity of
incoming optical light). Here we present quantized Maxwell's equations for
electromagnetic field in an isotropic homogeneous medium, allowing us to solve
the absorption anomaly property of these metal films. The results imply the
existence of light boson particles with spin one and effective mass $m=
2.5\cdot 10^{-5} m_e$. We also show the presence of two new type surface
polaritons into nanoholes in metal films.
