A way to identify the would-be zero-modes of staggered lattice fermions away
from the continuum limit is presented. Our approach also identifies the
chiralities of these modes, and their index is seen to be determined by gauge
field topology in accordance with the Index Theorem. The key idea is to
consider the spectral flow of a certain hermitian version of the staggered
Dirac operator. The staggered fermion index thus obtained can be used as a new
way to assign the topological charge of lattice gauge fields. In a numerical
study in U(1) backgrounds in 2 dimensions it is found to perform as well as the
Wilson index while being computationally more efficient. It can also be
expressed as the index of an overlap Dirac operator with a new staggered
fermion kernel.
