Compact object mergers, or their collisions in dense stellar environments,
involve different time scales. Each of these has its own tempo and dictates a
characteristic set of consequences which may, or may not, be observable in what
we see as a gamma-ray burst (GRB). I detail here these stages, the state of our
knowledge about them, and how they may be important for our understanding of
this class of progenitors.
