With the growing importance of personal identification and authentication in
todays highly advanced world where most business and personal tasks are being
replaced by electronic means, the need for a technology that is able to
uniquely identify an individual and has high fraud resistance see the rise of
biometric technologies. Making biometric based solution mobile is a promising
trend. A new RST invariant square based palm print ROI extraction method was
successfully implemented and integrated into the current application suite. A
new set of palm print image database captured using embedded cameras in mobile
phone was created to test its robustness. Comparing to those extraction methods
that are based on boundary tracking of the overall hand shape that has
limitation of being unable to process palm print images that has one or more
fingers closed, the system can now effectively handle the segmentation of palm
print images with varying finger positioning. The high flexibility makes palm
print matching mobile possible.
