This paper generalizes some known solitary solutions of a time-dependent
Hamiltonian in two ways: The time-dependent field can be an elliptic function,
and the time evolution is obtained for a complete set of basis vectors. The
latter makes it feasible to consider arbitrary initial conditions. The former
makes it possible to observe a beating caused by the non-linearity of the
driving field.
