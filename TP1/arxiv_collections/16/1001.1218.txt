Antianemic medicament Ascofer and ferrous gluconate, its basic iron bearing
ingredient, were studied with the use of Mossbauer spectroscopy. Room
temperature spectra gave a clear evidence that two phases of iron were present
viz. ferrous (Fe2+) as a major one with a contribution of 85+-5%, and ferric
(Fe3+) whose contribution was found to be 15+-5%. However, the actual values of
the contributions of the two kind of the iron ions in Ascofer depend on
sample's age: the abundance of Fe2+ ions increases with time by 10% after 51
months, while that of Fe3+ decreases by the same amount. This means that an
internal reduction of Fe3+ ions takes place. Ferrous ions were shown to occupy
at least two different sites. In Ascofer, the relative abundance of the two
sites does not depend on the age of sample, while in the gluconate the
population of site 1 increases and that of site 2 decreases with the age of the
sample.
