Coulomb effects in the intra-beam scattering are taken into account in a way
providing correct description of the spin-dependent contribution to the beam
loss rate. It allows one to calculate this rate for polarized $e^{\pm}$ beams
at arbitrarily small values of the ratio $\delta \varepsilon/\varepsilon$,
characterizing relative change of the electron energy in the laboratory system
during scattering event.
