We theoretically investigate the transport properties of cold bosonic atoms
in a quasi one-dimensional triple-well potential that consists of two large
outer wells, which act as microscopic source and drain reservoirs, and a small
inner well, which represents a quantum-dot-like scattering region. Bias and
gate "voltages" introduce a time-dependent tilt of the triple-well
configuration, and are used to shift the energetic level of the inner well with
respect to the outer ones. By means of exact diagonalization considering a
total number of six atoms in the triple-well potential, we find diamond-like
structures for the occurrence of single-atom transport in the parameter space
spanned by the bias and gate voltages. We discuss the analogy with Coulomb
blockade in electronic quantum dots, and point out how one can infer the
interaction energy in the central well from the distance between the diamonds.
