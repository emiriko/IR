In the Matrix approach to graph transformation we represent simple digraphs
and rules with Boolean matrices and vectors, and the rewriting is expressed
using Boolean operations only. In previous works, we developed analysis
techniques enabling the study of the applicability of rule sequences, their
independence, stated reachability and the minimal digraph able to fire a
sequence. In [20], graph constraints and application conditions (so-called
restrictions) have been studied in detail. In the present contribution we
tackle the problem of translating post-conditions into pre-conditions and vice
versa. Moreover, we shall see that application conditions can be moved along
productions inside a sequence (restriction delocalization). As a
practical-theoretical application we show how application conditions allow us
to perform multidigraph rewriting (as opposed to simple digraph rewriting)
