We derive robust model-independent bounds on DM annihilations and decays from
the first year of FERMI gamma-ray observations of the whole sky. These bounds
only have a mild dependence on the DM density profile and allow the following
DM interpretations of the PAMELA and FERMI electron/positron excesses: primary
channels mu+ mu-, mu+ mu-mu+mu- or e+ e- e+ e-. An isothermal-like density
profile is needed for annihilating DM. In all such cases, FERMI gamma spectra
must contain a significant DM component, that may be probed in the future.
