We simulate the rise through the upper convection zone and emergence through
the solar surface of initially uniform, untwisted, horizontal magnetic flux
with the same entropy as the non-magnetic plasma that is advected into a domain
48 Mm wide from from 20 Mm deep. The magnetic field is advected upward by the
diverging upflows and pulled down in the downdrafts, which produces a hierarchy
of loop like structures of increasingly smaller scale as the surface is
approached. There are significant differences between the behavior of fields of
10 kG and 20 or 40 kG strength at 20 Mm depth. The 10 kG fields have little
effect on the convective flows and show little magnetic buoyancy effects,
reaching the surface in the typical fluid rise time from 20 Mm depth of 32
hours. 20 and 40 kG fields significantly modify the convective flows, leading
to long thin cells of ascending fluid aligned with the magnetic field and their
magnetic buoyancy makes them rise to the surface faster than the fluid rise
time. The 20 kG field produces a large scale magnetic loop that as it emerges
through the surface leads to the formation of a bipolar pore-like structure.
