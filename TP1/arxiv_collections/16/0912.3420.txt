The textbook knowledge of solid state physics is that the electronic specific
heat shows a linear temperature dependence with the leading corrections being a
cubic term due to phonons and a cubic-logarithmic term due to the interaction
of electrons with bosons. We have shown that this longstanding conception needs
to be supplemented since the generic behavior of the low-temperature electronic
specific heat includes a kink if the electrons are sufficiently strongly
correlated
