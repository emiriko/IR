We demonstrate an efficient numerical method to calculate three-tangle of
general mixed states. We construct a "energy function" (target function) for
the three-tangle of the mixed state under certain constrains. The "energy
function" (target function) is then optimized via a replica exchange Monte
Carlo method. We have extensively tested the method for the examples with known
analytical results, showing remarkable agreement. The method can be applied to
other optimization problems in quantum information theory.
