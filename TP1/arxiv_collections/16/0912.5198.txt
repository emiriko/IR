We study light-quark observables by means of dynamical lattice QCD
simulations using two flavours of twisted mass fermions at maximal twist. We
employ chiral perturbation theory to describe our data for the pion mass and
decay constant. In this way, we extract precise determinations for the
low-energy constants of the effective theory as well as for the light-quark
mass and the chiral condensate.
