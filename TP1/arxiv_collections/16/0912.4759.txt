We study the high energy limit of a six-point R-current correlator in N=4
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory for finite N_c. We make use of the framework
of perturbative resummation of large logarithms of the energy. More
specifically, we apply the (extended) generalized leading logarithmic
approximation. We find that the same conformally invariant two-to-four gluon
vertex occurs as in non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. As a new feature we
find a direct coupling of the four-gluon t-channel state to the R-current
impact factor.
