We present the quantum model of Bertrand duopoly and study the entanglement
behavior on the profit functions of the firms. Using the concept of optimal
response of each firm to the price of the opponent, we found only one Nash
equilibirum point for maximally entangled initial state. The very presence of
quantum entanglement in the initial state gives payoffs higher to the firms
than the classical payoffs at the Nash equilibrium. As a result the dilemma
like situation in the classical game is resolved.
