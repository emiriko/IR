Analysis of the measured value of the integrated \bar{d}-\bar{u} asymmetry
(Ifas = 0.147+-0.027) in the nucleon show it to arise from nucleon fluctuations
into baryon plus pion. Requiring angular momentum conservation in these
fluctuations shows the associated orbital angular momentum is equal to the
value of the flavor asymmetry.
