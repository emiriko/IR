Quantum trajectories are used to investigate the EPR-Bohr debate in a modern
sense by examining entanglement and nonlocality. We synthesize a single
"entanglement molecule" from the two scattered particles of the EPR experiment.
We explicitly investigate the behavior of the entanglement molecule rather than
the behaviors of the two scattered particles to gain insight into the EPR-Bohr
debate. We develop the entanglement molecule's wave function in polar form and
its reduced action, both of which manifest entanglement. We next apply Jacobi's
theorem to the reduced action to generate the equation of quantum motion for
the entanglement molecule to produce its quantum trajectory. The resultant
quantum trajectory manifests entanglement and has retrograde segments
interspersed between segments of forward motion. This alternating of forward
and retrograde segments generates nonlocality and, within the entanglement
molecule, action at a distance. Dissection of the equation of quantum motion
for the entanglement molecule, while rendering the classical behavior of the
two scattered particles, also reveals an emergent "entanglon" that maintains
the entanglement between the scattered particles. The characteristics of the
entanglon and its relationship to nonlocality are examined.
