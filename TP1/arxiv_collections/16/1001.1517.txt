We discuss multiscale representations of discrete manifold-valued data. As it
turns out that we cannot expect general manifold-analogues of biorthogonal
wavelets to possess perfect reconstruction, we focus our attention on those
constructions which are based on upscaling operators which are either
interpolating or midpoint-interpolating. For definable multiscale
decompositions we obtain a stability result.
