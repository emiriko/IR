Statistical systems, in which spontaneous symmetry breaking can be
accompanied by spontaneous local symmetry restoration, are considered. A
general approach to describing such systems is formulated, based on the notion
of weighted Hilbert spaces and configuration averaging. The approach is
illustrated by the example of a ferroelectric with mesoscopic fluctuations of
paraelectric phase. The influence of the local symmetry restoration on the
system characteristics, such as sound velocity and Debye-Waller factor, is
discussed.
