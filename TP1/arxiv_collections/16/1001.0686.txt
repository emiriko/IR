We explore from a theoretical perspective angular distributions of electrons
emitted from a Na$_8$ cluster after excitation by a short laser pulse. The tool
of the study is time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) at the level
of the local-density approximation (LDA) augmented by a self-interaction
correction (SIC) to put emission properties in order. We consider free Na$_8$
and Na$_8$ deposited on the surfaces MgO(001) or Ar(001). For the case of free
Na$_8$, we distinguish between a hypothetical situation of known cluster
orientation and a more realistic ensemble of orientations. We also consider the
angular distributions for emission from separate single-electron levels.
