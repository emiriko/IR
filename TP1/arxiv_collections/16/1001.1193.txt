The time-periodic scalar delay differential equation $\dot x(t)=\gamma
f(t,x(t-1))$ is considered, which leads to a resonant bifurcation of the
equilibrium at critical values of the parameter. Using Floquet theory, spectral
projection and center manifold reduction, we give conditions for the stability
properties of the bifurcating invariant curves and four-periodic orbits. The
coefficients of the third order normal form are derived explicitly. We show
that the 1:4 resonance has no effect on equations of the form $\dot
z(t)=-\gamma r(t)g(x(t-1))$.
