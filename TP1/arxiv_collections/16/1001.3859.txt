We study a class of multiplicative algorithms introduced by Silvey et al.
(1978) for computing D-optimal designs. Strict monotonicity is established for
a variant considered by Titterington (1978). A formula for the rate of
convergence is also derived. This is used to explain why modifications
considered by Titterington (1978) and Dette et al. (2008) usually converge
faster.
