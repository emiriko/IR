We report results from a blind analysis of the final data taken with the
Cryogenic Dark Matter Search experiment (CDMS II) at the Soudan Underground
Laboratory, Minnesota, USA. A total raw exposure of 612 kg-days was analyzed
for this work. We observed two events in the signal region; based on our
background estimate, the probability of observing two or more background events
is 23%. These data set an upper limit on the Weakly Interacting Massive
Particle (WIMP)-nucleon elastic-scattering spin-independent cross-section of
7.0x10^{-44} cm^2 for a WIMP of mass 70 GeV/c^2 at the 90% confidence level.
Combining this result with all previous CDMS II data gives an upper limit on
the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross-section of 3.8x10^{-44} cm^2 for a WIMP
of mass 70 GeV/c^2. We also exclude new parameter space in recently proposed
inelastic dark matter models.
