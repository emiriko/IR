We report on magneto-oscillations in differential resistivity of a
two-dimensional electron system subject to intense microwave radiation. The
period of these oscillations is determined not only by microwave frequency but
also by its intensity. A theoretical model based on quantum kinetics at high
microwave power captures all important characteristics of this phenomenon which
is strongly nonlinear in microwave intensity. Our results demonstrate a crucial
role of the multi-photon processes near the cyclotron resonance and its
harmonics in the presence of strong dc electric field and offer a unique way to
reliably determine the intensity of microwaves acting on electrons.
