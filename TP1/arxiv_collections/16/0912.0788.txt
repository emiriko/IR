We demonstrate digital tuning of the slow-light regime in silicon
photonic-crystal waveguides by performing atomic layer deposition of hafnium
oxide. The high group-index regime was deterministically controlled (red-shift
of 140 +/- 10 pm per atomic layer) without affecting the group-velocity
dispersion and third-order dispersion. Additionally, differential tuning of 110
+/- 30 pm per monolayer of the slow-light TE-like and TM-like modes was
observed. This passive post-fabrication process has potential applications
including the tuning of chip-scale optical interconnects, as well as Raman and
parametric amplification.
