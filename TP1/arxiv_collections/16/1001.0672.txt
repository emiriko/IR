The chirality-dependent magnetoelectric properties of Neel-type domain walls
in iron garnet films is observed. The electrically driven magnetic domain wall
motion changes the direction to the opposite with the reversal of electric
polarity of the probe and with the chirality switching of the domain wall from
clockwise to counterclockwise. This proves that the origin of the electric
field induced micromagnetic structure transformation is inhomogeneous
magnetoelectric interaction.
