We comment on the recent paper by Srivastava and Dwivedi (J. Astrophs. Astr.
{\bf 28}, 1, 2007). In the said paper the derived dispersion relation $\nu \eta
\cos^4 \theta k^4 + [v_A^2 - i \omega (\nu + \eta)] \cos^2 \theta k^2 -
\omega^2 = 0$ seems to be in error. Consequently, the conclusion drawn in their
paper are not reliable.
