In the leading twist approximation of the Wilson operator product expansion
with "frozen" and analytic strong coupling constants we show that
Bessel-inspired behavior of the structure function F2 at small x, obtained for
a flat initial condition in the DGLAP evolution equations, leads to good
agreement with the deep inelastic scattering experimental data from HERA.
