The paper focuses on a class of light-tailed multivariate probability
distributions. These are obtained via a transformation of the margins from a
heavy-tailed original distribution. This class was introduced in Balkema et al.
(J. Multivariate Anal. 101 (2010) 1738-1754). As shown there, for the
light-tailed meta distribution the sample clouds, properly scaled, converge
onto a deterministic set. The shape of the limit set gives a good description
of the relation between extreme observations in different directions. This
paper investigates how sensitive the limit shape is to changes in the
underlying heavy-tailed distribution. Copulas fit in well with multivariate
extremes. By Galambos's theorem, existence of directional derivatives in the
upper endpoint of the copula is necessary and sufficient for convergence of the
multivariate extremes provided the marginal maxima converge. The copula of the
max-stable limit distribution does not depend on the margins. So margins seem
to play a subsidiary role in multivariate extremes. The theory and examples
presented in this paper cast a different light on the significance of margins.
For light-tailed meta distributions, the asymptotic behaviour is very sensitive
to perturbations of the underlying heavy-tailed original distribution, it may
change drastically even when the asymptotic behaviour of the heavy-tailed
density is not affected.
