We investigate baryon and charge transport in relativistic heavy-ion
collisions, compare with Au + Au RHIC data at sqrt(s_NN)=0.2 TeV, and make
predictions for net-proton rapidity distributions in central Pb + Pb collisions
at CERN LHC energies of sqrt(s_NN)=2.8, 3.9, and 5.5 TeV. We use the gluon
saturation model and put special emphasis on the midrapidity valley |y|< 2.
Net-kaon distributions are calculated and compared to BRAHMS Au + Au data at
RHIC energies of sqrt(s_NN)= 0.2 TeV, and predicted for Pb + Pb at 5.5 TeV.
