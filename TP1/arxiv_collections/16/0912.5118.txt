We study a possibility of anisotropic scale invariant cosmology. It is shown
that within the conventional Einstein gravity, the violation of the null energy
condition is necessary. We construct an example based on a ghost condensation
model that violates the null energy condition. The cosmological solution
necessarily contains at least one contracting spatial direction as in the
Kasner solution. Our cosmology is conjectured to be dual to, if any, a
non-unitary anisotropic scale invariant Euclidean field theory. We investigate
simple correlation functions of the dual theory by using the holographic
computation. After compactification of the contracting direction, our setup may
yield a dual field theory description of the winding tachyon condensation that
might solve the singularity of big bang/crunch of the universe.
