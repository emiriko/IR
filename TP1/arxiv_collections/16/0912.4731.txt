We present a novel method to discover the Higgs boson in new physics event
samples at the LHC. Our technique applies to broad classes of models where the
Higgs has a significant branching fraction to b-bbar. We exploit the recently
developed techniques for discovering a boosted Higgs using jet substructure.
Our requirements of new physics are quite general: there must be features in
the new physics event sample that allow a clean separation from standard model
background, and there should be Higgs bosons produced in association with the
new physics. We demonstrate that this method superbly finds and identifies the
lightest Higgs boson in the minimal supersymmetric standard model. We focus on
two case studies with a gravitino LSP, however, generalizations to other LSPs
and to other models of new physics are also briefly discussed. In some
circumstances, discovery of the lightest Higgs is possible well before
conventional search strategies uncover convincing evidence.
