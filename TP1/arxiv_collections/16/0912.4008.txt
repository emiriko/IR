For the frustrated two-dimensional $S=1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model
close to quantum phase transition we consider the singlet ground states
retaining both translational and SU(2) symmetry. Besides usually discussed
checkerboard, spin-liquid and stripe states an unconventional state with two
coexisting long-range orders appears to be possible at sufficiently large
damping of spin excitations. The problem is treated in the frames of
self-consistent spherically symmetric approach.
