The effects of the $\Lambda$(1405) ($\Lambda^\ast$) on the structure of the
multi-antikaonic nucleus (MKN), in which several $K^-$ mesons are embedded to
form deeply bound states, are considered based on chiral symmetry combined with
a relativistic mean-field theory. It is shown that additional attraction
resulting from the $\Lambda^\ast$ pole has a sizable contribution to not only
the density profiles for the nucleons and $K^-$ mesons but also the ground
state energy of the $K^-$ mesons and binding energy of the MKN as the number of
the embedded $K^-$ mesons increases.
