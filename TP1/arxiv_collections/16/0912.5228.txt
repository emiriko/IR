We classify primitive non-symplectic automorphisms of order 6 on K3 surfaces.
We show how their study can be reduced to the study of non-symplectic
automorphisms of order 3 and to a local analysis of the fixed loci. In
particular, we determine the possible fixed loci and show that when the Picard
lattice is fixed, K3 surfaces come in mirror pairs.
