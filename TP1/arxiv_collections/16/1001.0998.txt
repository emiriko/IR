The inclusion of the unstable features of a spin-1 particle, without breaking
the electromagnetic gauge invariance, can be properly accomplished by including
higher order contributions as done in the so-called fermion loop scheme (for
the W gauge boson), and the boson loop scheme (for vector mesons). This induces
a non trivial modification to the electromagnetic vertex of the particle, which
must be considered in addition to any other contribution computed as stable
particles. Considering the modified electromagnetic vertex, we obtain general
expressions for the corresponding corrections to the multipoles as a function
of the mass of the particles in the loop. For the W gauge boson no substantial
deviations from the stable case is observed. For the rho and K* mesons the mass
of the particles in the loop makes a significant effect, and can be comparable
with corrections of different nature .
