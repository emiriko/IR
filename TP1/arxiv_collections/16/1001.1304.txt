A characterization of the optical turbulence vertical distribution (Cn2
profiles) and all the main integrated astroclimatic parameters derived from the
Cn2 and the wind speed profiles above the site of the Large Binocular Telescope
(Mt. Graham, Arizona, US) is presented. The statistic includes measurements
related to 43 nights done with a Generalized Scidar (GS) used in standard
configuration with a vertical resolution Delta(H)~1 km on the whole 20 km and
with the new technique (HVR-GS) in the first kilometer. The latter achieves a
resolution Delta(H)~20-30 m in this region of the atmosphere. Measurements done
in different periods of the year permit us to provide a seasonal variation
analysis of the Cn2. A discretized distribution of Cn2 useful for the Ground
Layer Adaptive Optics (GLAO) simulations is provided and a specific analysis
for the LBT Laser Guide Star system ARGOS (running in GLAO configuration) case
is done including the calculation of the 'gray zones' for J, H and K bands. Mt.
Graham confirms to be an excellent site with median values of the seeing
without dome contribution epsilon = 0.72", the isoplanatic angle theta0 = 2.5"
and the wavefront coherence time tau0= 4.8 msec. We find that the optical
turbulence vertical distribution decreases in a much sharper way than what has
been believed so far in proximity of the ground above astronomical sites. We
find that 50% of the whole turbulence develops in the first 80+/-15 m from the
ground. We finally prove that the error in the normalization of the
scintillation that has been recently put in evidence in the principle of the GS
technique, affects these measurements with an absolutely negligible quantity
(0.04").
