We present the Geodesic Deviation Equation (GDE) for the
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker(FRW) universe and we compare it with the equation
for Bianchi type I model. We justify consider this cosmological model due to
the recent importance the Bianchi Models have as alternative models in
cosmology. The main property of these models, solutions of Einstein Field
Equations (EFE) is that they are homogeneous as the FRW model but they are not
isotropic. We can see this because they have a non-null Weyl tensor in the GDE.
