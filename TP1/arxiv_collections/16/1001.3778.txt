It is argued that whereas the Shatskiy single rings produced by the
gravitational inner field of a spherically symmetric wormhole could not be used
to identify the presence of such tunnelings in the universe or the existence of
a parallel universe, the image which the inner gravitational field of a
ringhole with toroidal symmetry would allow us to detect from a single luminous
source is that of two concentric bright rings, and this is a signature that
cannot be attributed to any other single astronomical object in whichever
universe it may be placed. At the beginning of 2008 the NASA/ESA Hubble Space
Telescope revealed a never-before-seen phenomenon in space: a pair of glowing
rings, one nestled inside the other like a bull's-eye pattern. It is also
argued that such a discovery may well be attributed to the first astronomical
ringhole found in the universe. After all, a ringhole is a perfectly valid
solution to the Einstein equations and the stuff which makes it possible is
becoming more and more familiar in cosmology.
