Here we present well-posedness results for first order stochastic
differential inclusions, more precisely for sweeping process with a stochastic
perturbation. These results are provided in combining both deterministic
sweeping process theory and methods concerning the reflection of a Brownian
motion. In addition, we prove convergence results for a Euler scheme,
discretizing theses stochastic differential inclusions.
