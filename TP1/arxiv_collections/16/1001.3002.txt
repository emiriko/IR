Results related to the possible chemical equilibration of hadrons in heavy
ion collisions are reviewed. Overall the evidence is very strong with a few
clear and well-documented deviations, especially concerning multi-strange
hadrons. Two effects are considered in some detail. Firstly, the neglect of
(possibly an infinite number) of heavy resonances is investigated with the help
of the Hagedorn model. Secondly, possible deviations from the standard
statistical distributions are investigated by considering in detail results
obtained using the Tsallis distribution.
