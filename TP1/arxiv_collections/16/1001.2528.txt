The recent experimental evidence in favor of stripe ordering in
ferropnictides [Chuang {\it et. al.}, Science {\bf 327},181 (2010)] points to
the new field of study for strongly correlated systems. Here we argue that due
to the smallness of the chemical potential in ferropnictides the effects of
stripe modulation are likely to be much more pronounced than in the cuprates
leading to stronger degree of one-dimensionality. This may allow to treat the
striped pnictides as an array of coupled one-dimensional spin liquids making
them a good testing ground for various ideas concerning strongly correlated
states originally proposed for the cuprates.
