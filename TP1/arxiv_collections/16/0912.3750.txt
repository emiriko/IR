Kondo insulators are particularly simple type of heavy electron material,
where a filled band of heavy quasiparticles gives rise to a narrow band
insulator. Starting with the Anderson lattice Hamiltonian, we develop a
topological classification of emergent band structures for Kondo insulators and
show that these materials may host three-dimensional topological insulating
phases. We propose a general and practical prescription of calculating the Z_2
strong and weak topological insulator indices for various lattice structures.
Experimental implications of the topological Kondo insulating behavior are
discussed.
