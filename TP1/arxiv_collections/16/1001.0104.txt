For the first time the process-independent parameter of double parton
scattering, $\sigma_{\rm eff}^{\rm exp}$, has been measured newly in the D0
experiment at the three different resolution scales.If we interpret the
measurement as a decrease of the effective cross section with a growth of the
resolution scale it can indicate the QCD evolution of double parton
distributions.
