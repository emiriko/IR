We study the performance of gamma = 100 Beta-Beam setups based on the decays
of 8B and 8Li as a function of the achievable production fluxes and compare
them with the standard setups based on 18Ne and 6He decays. For the standard
setup we also investigate the physics potential for reduced 18Ne fluxes, since
it seems experimentally challenging to achieve the baseline numbers. We find
that, contrary to the standard setup, setups based in 8B and 8Li can be
sensitive to the mass hierarchy down to values of sin^2 2theta_{13} > 10^-2 by
themselves, due to the stronger matter effects granted by the higher energy of
the neutrinos. On the other hand, the longer baseline required for neutrinos to
oscillate at these higher energies reduces the statistics at the detector and
fluxes around three times larger are required to reach the sensitivity to
theta_{13} and CP violation for the smallest values of sin^2 2theta_{13} that
the standard setup provides. We also studied the required suppression factor of
the atmospheric background. In all the setups studied, we found that a
suppression factor of 10^-4 is equivalent to removing completely the
atmospheric background. Suppression factors of order 10^-3 do not imply a
significant loss in sensitivity while suppressions of 10^-2 still allow good CP
discovery potential if sin^2 2theta_{13} > 10^-2 and the flux is not too low.
