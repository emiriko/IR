A description of exclusive charged pion electroproduction $(e,e'\pi^{\pm})$
off nucleons at high energies is proposed. The model combines a Regge pole
approach with residual effect of nucleon resonances. The exchanges of
$\pi$(140), vector $\rho(770)$ and axial-vector $a_1(1260)$ and $b_1(1235)$
Regge trajectories are considered. The contribution of nucleon resonances is
described using a dual connection between the exclusive hadronic form factors
and inclusive deep inelastic structure functions. The model describes the
measured longitudinal, transverse and interference cross sections at JLAB and
DESY. The scaling behavior of the cross sections is in agreement with JLAB and
deeply virtual HERMES data. The results for a polarized beam-spin azimuthal
asymmetry in $(\vec{e},e'\pi^{\pm})$ are presented. Model predictions for JLAB
at 12 GeV are given.
