We study holographic superconductors in the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole with
a global monopole through a charged complex scalar field. We calculate the
condensates of the charged operators in the dual conformal field theories
(CFTs) and discuss the effects of the global monopole on the condensation
formation. Moreover, we compute the electric conductive using the probe
approximation and find that the properties of the conductive are quite similar
to those in the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole. These results can help us know
more about holographic superconductors in the asymptotic AdS black holes.
