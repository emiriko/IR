In an earlier article [arXiv:0902.0590 [hep-th], Phys. Rev D80 (2009)
025011], I discussed the potential benefits of allowing Lorentz symmetry
breaking in quantum field theories. In particular I discussed the perturbative
power-counting finiteness of the normal-ordered :P(phi)^{z>=d}_{d+1}: scalar
quantum field theories, and sketched the implications for Horava's model of
quantum gravity. In the current rather brief addendum, I will tidy up some
dangling issues and fill out some of the technical details of the argument
indicating the power-counting renormalizability of a z>=d variant of Horava
gravity in (d+1) dimensions.
