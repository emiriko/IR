We show how to convert an arbitrary stabilizer code into a bipartite quantum
code. A bipartite quantum code is one that involves two senders and one
receiver. The two senders exploit both nonlocal and local quantum resources to
encode quantum information with local encoding circuits. They transmit their
encoded quantum data to a single receiver who then decodes the transmitted
quantum information. The nonlocal resources in a bipartite code are ebits and
nonlocal information qubits and the local resources are ancillas and local
information qubits. The technique of bipartite quantum error correction is
useful in both the quantum communication scenario described above and in
fault-tolerant quantum computation. It has application in fault-tolerant
quantum computation because we can prepare nonlocal resources offline and
exploit local encoding circuits. In particular, we derive an encoding circuit
for a bipartite version of the Steane code that is local and additionally
requires only nearest-neighbor interactions. We have simulated this encoding in
the CNOT extended rectangle with a publicly available fault-tolerant simulation
software. The result is that there is an improvement in the "pseudothreshold"
with respect to the baseline Steane code, under the assumption that quantum
memory errors occur less frequently than quantum gate errors.
