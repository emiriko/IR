Inflation based on scalar fields which are non-minimally coupled to gravity
has been proposed as a way to unify inflation with weak-scale physics, with the
inflaton being identified with the Higgs boson or other weak-scale scalar
article. These models require a large non-minimal coupling xi ~ 10^{4} to have
agreement with the observed density perturbations. However, it has been
suggested that such models are unnatural, due to an apparent breakdown of the
calculation of Higgs-Higgs scattering via graviton exchange in the Jordan
frame. Here we argue that Higgs inflation models are in fact natural and that
the breakdown does not imply new physics due to strong-coupling effects or
unitarity breakdown, but simply a failure of perturbation theory in the Jordan
frame as a calculational method. This can be understood by noting that the
model is completely consistent when analysed in the Einstein frame and that
scattering rates in the two frames are equal by the Equivalence Theorem for
non-linear field redefinitions.
