By means of a Madelung decomposition, exact periodic traveling solutions are
constructed for a modified nonlinear Schrodinger equation derived by Stenflo
and Gradov, describing electrostatic surface waves in semi-infinite plasma. The
condition for the existence of bi-stable equilibria is discussed. A
conservation law as well as the modulational instability admitted by the model
are analyzed.
