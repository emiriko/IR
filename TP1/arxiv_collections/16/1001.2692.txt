We report Gold/Silica biochips for low cost biosensor devices. Firstly, the
study of biochemical interactions on silica by means of Surface Plasmon
Resonance (SPR) is presented. Secondly, Gold/Silica biochips are employed to
reduce the strong quenching that occurs when a fluorophore is close to the gold
surface. Furthermore, the control of the Silica-like thickness allows
optimizing the distance between the metallic surface and the fluorophore in
order to enhance the fluorescent signal. These results represent the first
steps towards highly sensitive, specific and low cost biosensors based, for
example, on Surface Plasmon Coupled Emission (SPCE) techniques.
