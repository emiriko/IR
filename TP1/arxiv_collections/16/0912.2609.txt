Stochastic differential equations are often simulated with the Monte Carlo
Euler method. Convergence of this method is well understood in the case of
globally Lipschitz continuous coefficients of the stochastic differential
equation. The important case of superlinearly growing coefficients, however,
has remained an open question. The main difficulty is that numerically weak
convergence fails to hold in many cases of superlinearly growing coefficients.
In this paper we overcome this difficulty and establish convergence of the
Monte Carlo Euler method for a large class of one-dimensional stochastic
differential equations whose drift functions have at most polynomial growth.
