We consider a semi-classical treatment, in the regime of weak gauge coupling,
of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in a space-time of the form T^3xR with
SU(n)/Z_n gauge group and a non-trivial gauge bundle. More specifically, we
consider the theories obtained as power series expansions around a certain
class of normalizable vacua of the classical theory, corresponding to isolated
points in the moduli space of flat connections, and the perturbative
corrections to the free energy eigenstates and eigenvalues in the weakly
interacting theory. The perturbation theory construction of the interacting
Hilbert space is complicated by the divergence of the norm of the interacting
states. Consequently, the free and interacting Hilbert furnish unitarily
inequivalent representation of the algebra of creation and annihilation
operators of the quantum theory. We discuss a consistent redefinition of the
Hilbert space norm to obtain the interacting Hilbert space and the properties
of the interacting representation. In particular, we consider the lowest
non-vanishing corrections to the free energy spectrum and discuss the crucial
importance of supersymmetry for these corrections to be finite.
