We demonstrate an exchange bias in (Ga,Mn)As induced by antiferromagnetic
coupling to a thin overlayer of Fe. Bias fields of up to 240 Oe are observed.
Using element-specific x-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements, we
distinguish a strongly exchange coupled (Ga,Mn)As interface layer in addition
to the biassed bulk of the (Ga,Mn)As film. The interface layer remains
polarized at room temperature.
