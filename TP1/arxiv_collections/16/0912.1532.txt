We show that the changes in the electronic density of states (DOS) in
graphene induced by impurity scattering with short-range potentials are
completely different from those caused by the long-range Coulomb potential. The
spectral weight of the state that eventually disappears into the valence band
(as the strength of scattering increases) does not transform into a resonance
state. Therefore no unusual screening effects related to a redistribution of
the density of states in the valence band are observed. The states induced by
the short-range impurities in graphene, therefore, have distinctively different
properties compared with the long-range potential case. These properties, in
fact, closely resemble the case of a short-range single impurity in other
bipartite lattices, such as the square, body centered cubic, and simple cubic
lattices.
