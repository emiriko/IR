We use 10 orbits of Advanced Camera for Surveys observations to reach the end
of the white dwarf cooling sequence in the solar-metallicity open cluster NGC
2158. Our photometry and completeness tests show that the end falls at
magnitude m_F606W = 27.5 +/- 0.15, which implies an age between ~1.8 and ~2.0
Gyr, consistent with the age of 1.9 +/- 0.2 Gyr obtained from fits to the
main-sequence turn-off. The faintest white dwarfs show a clear turn toward
bluer colors, as predicted by theoretical isochrones.
