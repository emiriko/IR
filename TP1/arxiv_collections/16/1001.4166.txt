We extend our recently advanced model on collisional energy loss of heavy
quarks in a quark gluon plasma (QGP) by including radiative energy loss. We
discuss the approach and present first preliminary results. We show that
present data on nuclear modification factor of non photonic single electrons
hardly permit to distinguish between those 2 energy loss mechanisms.
