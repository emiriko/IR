We present an investigation of the atomic and electronic structure of
graphene monolayer islands on the 6H-SiC(000-1)(3x3) (SiC(3x3)) surface
reconstruction using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy
(STS). The orientation of the graphene lattice changes from one island to the
other. In the STM images, this rotational disorder gives rise to various
superlattices with periods in the nm range. We show that those superlattices
are moir\'e patterns (MPs) and we correlate their apparent height with the
stacking at the graphene/SiC(3x3) interface. The contrast of the MP in STM
images corresponds to a small topographic modulation of the graphene layer.
  From STS measurements we find that the substrate surface presents a 1,5 eV
wide bandgap encompassing the Fermi level. This substrate surface bandgap
subsists below the graphene plane. The tunneling spectra are spatially
homogeneous on the islands within the substrate surface gap, which shows that
the MPs do not impact the low energy electronic structure of graphene. We
conclude that the SiC(3 x 3) reconstruction efficiently passivates the
substrate surface and that the properties of the graphene layer which grows on
top of it should be similar to those of the ideal material.
