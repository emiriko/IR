Let $Y$ be an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion governed by an ergodic finite
state Markov process $X$: $dY_t=-\lambda(X_t)Y_tdt+\sigma(X_t)dB_t$, $Y_0$
given. Under ergodicity condition, we get quantitative estimates for the long
time behavior of $Y$. We also establish a trichotomy for the tail of the
stationary distribution of $Y$: it can be heavy (only some moments are finite),
exponential-like (only some exponential moments are finite) or Gaussian-like
(its Laplace transform is bounded below and above by Gaussian ones). The
critical moments are characterized by the parameters of the model.
