We theoretically investigate the phenomenon of voltage-controlled intracavity
electromagnetically induced transparency with asymmetric double quantum dot
system. The impact of voltage on frequency pulling and cavity linewidth
narrowing are discussed. The linewidth and position of the cavity transmission
can be engineered by the bias voltage. The scheme may be useful in integrated
electro-optical device in quantum information process.
