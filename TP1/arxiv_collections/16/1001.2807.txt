Selected recent quantum chromodynamics (QCD) measurements are reviewed for
Fermilab Run II Tevatron proton-antiproton collisions studied by the Collider
Detector at Fermilab (CDF) and DZero Collaborations at a centre-of-mass energy
of sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV. Tantamount to Rutherford scattering studies at the TeV
scale, inclusive jet and dijet production cross-section measurements are used
to seek and constrain new particle physics phenomena, test perturbative QCD
calculations, inform parton distribution function (PDF) determinations, and
extract a precise value of the strong coupling constant, alpha_s(m_Z) =
0.1161^{+0.0041}_{-0.0048}. Inclusive photon production cross-section
measurements reveal an inability of next-to-leading-order (NLO) perturbative
QCD (pQCD) calculations to describe low-energy photons arising directly in the
hard scatter. Events with gamma + 3-jet configurations are used to measure the
increasingly important double parton scattering (DPS) phenomenon, with an
obtained effective interaction cross section of sigma_{eff} = 16.4 +- 2.3 mb.
Observations of central exclusive particle production demonstrate the viability
of observing the Standard Model Higgs boson using similar techniques at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Three areas of inquiry into lower energy QCD,
crucial to understanding high-energy collider phenomena, are discussed: the
examination of intra-jet track kinematics to infer that jet formation is
dominated by pQCD, and not hadronization, effects; detailed studies of the
underlying event and its universality; and inclusive minimum-bias
charged-particle momentum and multiplicity measurements, which are shown to
challenge the Monte Carlo generators.
