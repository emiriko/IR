In a few months the KLOE-2 detector is expected to start data taking at the
upgraded DA$\rm{\Phi}$NE $\phi$-factory of INFN Laboratori Nazionali di
Frascati. It aims to collect 25 fb$^{-1}$ at the $\phi(1020)$ peak, and about 5
fb$^{-1}$ in the energy region between 1 and 2.5 GeV. We review the status and
physics program of the project
