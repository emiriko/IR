In this paper, we present systematic studies on the B-, R- and $K_s$-band
luminosity-metallicity (L-Z) relations for a set of metal poor, blue compact
dwarf galaxies. Metallicity is derived by using both the empirical N2 and the
direct $T_e$ methods. Our work reconciles contradictory results obtained by
different authors and shows that the L-Z relationship does also hold for blue
compact dwarf galaxies. The empirical N2-based slope of the L-Z relation, for
each photometric band, is consistent with the $T_e$-based one. We confirm that
the slope of the L-Z relation is shallower in the near-infrared than that in
the optical. Our investigations on the correlations between the $L_B$-Z
relation residuals and different galactic parameters show that the star
formation activities could be a cause of the large scatter in the optical L-Z
relationships, whereas the internal-absorption might be another possible
contributing factor.
