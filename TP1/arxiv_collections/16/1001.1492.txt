Based on a Riemann theta function and the super-Hirota bilinear form, we
propose a key formula for explicitly constructing quasi-periodic wave solutions
of the supersymmetric Ito's equation in superspace
$\mathbb{C}_{\Lambda}^{2,1}$. Once a nonlinear equation is written in bilinear
forms, then the quasi-periodic wave solutions can be directly obtained from our
formula. The relations between the periodic wave solutions and the well-known
soliton solutions are rigorously established. It is shown that the
quasi-periodic wave solutions tends to the soliton solutions under small
amplitude limits.
