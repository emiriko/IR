Massive spectroscopic surveys like the SDSS have revolutionized the way we
study AGN and their relations to the galaxies they live in. A first step in any
such study is to define samples of different types of AGN on the basis of
emission line ratios. This deceivingly simple step involves decisions on which
classification scheme to use and data quality censorship. Galaxies with weak
emission lines are often left aside or dealt with separately because one cannot
fully classify them onto the standard Star-Forming, Seyfert of LINER
categories. This contribution summarizes alternative classification schemes
which include this very numerous population. We then study how star-formation
histories and physical properties of the hosts vary from class to class, and
present compelling evidence that the emission lines in the majority of
LINER-like systems in the SDSS are not powered by black-hole accretion. The
data are fully consistent with them being galaxies whose old stars provide all
the ionizing power needed to explain their line ratios and luminosities. Such
retired galaxies deserve a place in the emission line taxonomy.
