Electrical current fluctuations in a single-channel quantum point contact can
produce photons (at frequency omega close to the applied voltage V x e/hbar)
which inherit the sub-Poissonian statistics of the electrons. We extend the
existing zero-temperature theory of the photostatistics to nonzero temperature
T. The Fano factor F (the ratio of the variance and the average photocount) is
<1 for T<T_c (antibunched photons) and >1 for T>T_c (bunched photons). The
crossover temperature T_c ~ Deltaomega x hbar/k_B is set by the band width
Deltaomega of the detector, even if hbar x Deltaomega << eV. This implies that
narrow-band detection of photon antibunching is hindered by thermal
fluctuations even in the low-temperature regime where thermal electron noise is
negligible relative to shot noise.
