A scheme that publishes aggregate information about sensitive data must
resolve the trade-off between utility to information consumers and privacy of
the database participants. Differential privacy is a well-established
definition of privacy--this is a universal guarantee against all attackers,
whatever their side-information or intent. In this paper, we present a
universal treatment of utility based on the standard minimax rule from decision
theory (in contrast to the utility model in, which is Bayesian). In our model,
information consumers are minimax (risk-averse) agents, each possessing some
side-information about the query, and each endowed with a loss-function which
models their tolerance to inaccuracies. Further, information consumers are
rational in the sense that they actively combine information from the mechanism
with their side-information in a way that minimizes their loss. Under this
assumption of rational behavior, we show that for every fixed count query, a
certain geometric mechanism is universally optimal for all minimax information
consumers. Additionally, our solution makes it possible to release query
results at multiple levels of privacy in a collusion-resistant manner.
