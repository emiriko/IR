In a frequency-modulation spectroscopy experiment, using the radiation from a
single frequency diode laser, the spectra of molecular iodine hyperfine
structure near 640 nm were recorded on the transition
$B^3\Pi_{0_u^{+}}-X^1\Sigma^+_{g}$. The frequency reference given by the value
of the modulation frequency (12.5 MHz in given experiment) allows determination
of the frequency differences between hyperfine components with accuracy better
than 0.1 MHz using the fitting procedure in experiment with only one laser.
