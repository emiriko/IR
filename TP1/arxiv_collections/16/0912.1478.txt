The fluxes of electrons, positrons, gammas, Cherenkov photons and muons in
individual extensive air showers induced by the primary protons and helium,
oxygen and iron nuclei at the level of observation have been estimated with
help of the code CORSICA 6.616. The comparison show that the values of the
function Xi**2 per one degree of freedom changes from 1.1 for iron nuclei to
0.9 for primary protons. As this difference is small all readings of detectors
of the Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation have been used. At last, readings of
underground detectors of muons with energies above 1 GeV have been exploited to
make definite conclusion about chemical composition.
