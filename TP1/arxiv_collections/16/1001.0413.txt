We present an analysis of the early Kepler observations of the previously
discovered transiting planet HAT-P-7b. The light curve shows the transit of the
star, the occultation of the planet, and the orbit phase-dependent light from
the planet. In addition, phase-dependent light from the star is present, known
as "ellipsoidal variations". The very nearby planet (only 4 stellar radii away)
gravitationally distorts the star and results in a flux modulation twice per
orbit. The ellipsoidal variations can confuse interpretation of the planetary
phase curve if not self-consistently included in the modeling. We fit the light
curve using the Roche potential approximation and derive improved planet and
orbit parameters.
