The last two decades have seen tremendous advances in our ability to generate
and manipulate quantum coherence in mesoscopic superconducting circuits. These
advances have opened up the study of quantum optics of microwave photons in
superconducting circuits as well as providing important hardware for the
manipulation of quantum information. Focusing primarily on charge-based qubits,
we provide a brief overview of these developments and discuss the present state
of the art. We also survey the remarkable progress that has been made in
realizing circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) in which superconducting
artificial atoms are strongly coupled to individual microwave photons.
