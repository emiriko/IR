Recent measurements of the $\eta_b(1S)$, the ground state of the $b\bar{b}$
system, show the splitting between it and the $\Up(1S)$ to be 69.5$\pm$3.2 MeV,
considerably larger than lattice QCD and potential model predictions, including
recent calculations published by us. The models are unable to incorporate such
a large hyperfine splitting within the context of a consistent description of
the energy spectrum and decays. We demonstrate that in our model, which
incorporates a relativistic kinetic energy term, a linear confining term
including its scalar-exchange relativistic corrections, and the complete
one-loop QCD short distance potential, such a consistent description, including
the measured hyperfine splitting, can be obtained by not softening the delta
function terms in the hyperfine potential. We calculate the hyperfine splitting
to be 67.5 MeV.
