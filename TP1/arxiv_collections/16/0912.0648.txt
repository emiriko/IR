In this work we suggest definite solution of the famous two capacitors
paradox. Moreover we suggest definite solution of analogous paradox in general
case for arbitrary number (single, two or many) capacitors. It is shown that
seeming loss of the energy of the electrical field is (without any dissipative
processes, e.g. Joule heating or/and electromagnetic waves emissions)
equivalent to work done by electric field by transition of the electric charge
from initial in the final position (from the first at the other capacitors)
defined in usual, well-known way.
