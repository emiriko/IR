Real-time databases deal with time-constrained data and time-constrained
transactions. The design of this kind of databases requires the introduction of
new concepts to support both data structures and the dynamic behaviour of the
database. In this paper, we give an overview about different aspects of
real-time databases and we clarify requirements of their modelling. Then, we
present a framework for real-time database design and describe its fundamental
operations. A case study demonstrates the validity of the structural model and
illustrates SQL queries and Java code generated from the classes of the model
