We correct the values of the dominant nucleon to Delta axial transition form
factors CA_5 and CA_6 published in C. Alexandrou et.al., Phys. Rev. D 76,094511
(2007). The analysis error affects only the values obtained when using the
hybrid action in the low Q^2 regime bringing them into agreement with those
obtained with Wilson fermions.
