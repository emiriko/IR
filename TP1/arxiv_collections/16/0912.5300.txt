We review some recent results obtained in studying superspace formulations of
2D N=(4,4) matter-coupled supergravity. For a superspace geometry described by
the minimal supergravity multiplet, we first describe how to reduce to
components the chiral integral by using ``ectoplasm'' superform techniques as
in arXiv:0907.5264 and then we review the bi-projective superspace formalism
introduced in arXiv:0911.2546. After that, we elaborate on the curved
bi-projective formalism providing a new result: the solution of the covariant
type-I twisted multiplet constraints in terms of a weight-(-1,-1) bi-projective
superfield.
