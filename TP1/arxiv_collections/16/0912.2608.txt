Wave propagation control by spatial modulation of velocity has a long history
in optics and acoustics. We address velocity-modulation control of electron
wave propagation in graphene and other two-dimensional Dirac-electron systems,
pointing out a key distinction of the Dirac-wave case. We also propose a
strategy for pattern transfer from a remote metallic layer that is based on
many-body velocity renormalization.
