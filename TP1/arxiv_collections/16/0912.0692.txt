We present a detailed study of 75As NMR Knight shift and spin-lattice
relaxation rate in the normal state of stoichiometric polycrystalline LiFeAs.
Our analysis of the Korringa relation suggests that LiFeAs exhibits strong
antiferromagnetic fluctuations, if transferred hyperfine coupling is a dominant
interaction between 75As nuclei and Fe electronic spins, whereas for an on-site
hyperfine coupling scenario, these are weaker, but still present to account for
our experimental observations. Density-functional calculations of electric
field gradient correctly reproduce the experimental values for both 75As and
7Li sites.
