We study the determination of neutrino mass hierarchy, through neutrino
experiments within the next ten years. The T2K neutrino oscillation experiment
will start in 2009. In the experiment the high intensity \nu_{\mu} beam from
JHF is directed to Super-Kamiokande (SK) detector 295 km away. The NO\nu A (off
axies neutrino oscillation) experiment is being planned, with the \nu_{\mu}
beam from Fermi-Lab directed to a site 610km away, which is 0,7,14 milliradian
off-axies. Both the above experiments will measure \nu_{\mu}\to\nu_{e}
oscillation probability. The double-CHOOZ experiment under construction detects
\bar{\nu_{e}}s emitted by nuclear reactors both through a near detector (150m)
and a far detector (1.05 Km) and measure \bar{\nu_{e}}\to\bar{\nu_{e}} survival
probability. In this paper, we outline a procedure to determine the sign of
\Delta_{31} from the simulated data of the above experiments.
