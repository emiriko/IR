These notes accompany an introductory lecture course on the twistor approach
to supersymmetric gauge theories aimed at early-stage PhD students. It was held
by the author at the University of Cambridge during the Michaelmas term in
2009. The lectures assume a working knowledge of differential geometry and
quantum field theory. No prior knowledge of twistor theory is required.
