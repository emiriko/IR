We report the first systematic survey of molecular lines (including HCO+
(1-0) and 12CO, 13CO, C18O (1-0) lines at 3 mm band) towards a new sample of 88
massive young stellar object (MYSO) candidates associated with ongoing outflows
(known as extended green objects or EGOs) identified from the Spitzer GLIMPSE
survey in the northern hemisphere with the PMO-13.7 m radio telescope. By
analyzing the asymmetries of the optically thick line HCO+ for 69 of 72 EGOs
with HCO+ detection, we found 29 sources with blue asymmetric profiles and 19
sources with red asymmetric profiles. This results in a blue excess of 0.14,
seen as a signature of collapsing cores in the observed EGO sample. The
relatively small blue excess measured in our full sample due to that the
observed EGOs are mostly dominated by outflows and at an earlier evolutionary
phase associated with IRDCs and 6.7 GHz methanol masers. The physical
properties of clouds surrounding EGOs derived from CO lines are similar to
those of massive clumps wherein the massive star forming cores associated with
EGOs possibly embedded. The infall velocities and mass infall rates derived for
20 infall candidates are also consistent with the typical values found in
MYSOs. Thus our observations further support the speculation of Cyganowski et
al. (2008) that EGOs trace a population with ongoing outflow activity and
active rapid accretion stage of massive protostellar evolution from a
statistical view, although there maybe have limitations due to single-pointing
survey with a large beam.
