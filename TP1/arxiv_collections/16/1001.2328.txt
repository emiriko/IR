The principles of the parallel numerical code SELFAS-3 are presented. The
code modifies previous version of the code to enable parallel computations of
electrodynamic aggregation in a many-body system of basic blocks which are
taken as strongly magnetized thin rods (i.e., one-dimensional static magnetic
dipoles), with electric conductivity and static electric charge, screened with
its own static plasma sheath. The aggregation modelling includes the electric
current dynamics in a complicated evolving network to describe the processes of
external and internal electric short-circuiting. The code enables the
continuous modelling of a transition between the following states: randomly
situated ensemble of solitary basic blocks; electric current-carrying
filamentary system; restructured filamentary network with a trend towards a
fractal skeletal structuring. The latter trend is illustrated with generation
of a bigger magnetic dipole in (i) homogeneous random ensemble between the
biased electrodes in the presence of a plasma electric current filament and
(ii) random ensemble around a straight linear nanodust filament with
inhomogeneous distribution of the trapped magnetic flux along the filament.
