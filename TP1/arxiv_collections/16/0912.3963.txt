Multiplicative inverse is a crucial operation in public key cryptography, and
been widely used in cryptography. Public key cryptography has given rise to
such a need, in which we need to generate a related public and private pair of
numbers, each of which is the inverse of the other. The basic method to find
multiplicative inverses is Extended-Euclidean method. In this paper we will
propose a new algorithm for computing the inverse, based on continues subtract
fraction from integer and divide by fraction to obtain integer that will be
used to compute the inverse d. The authors claim that the proposed method more
efficient and faster than the existed methods.
