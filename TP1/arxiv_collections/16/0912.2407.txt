A covariance graph is an undirected graph associated with a multivariate
probability distribution of a given random vector where each vertex represents
each of the different components of the random vector and where the absence of
an edge between any pair of variables implies marginal independence between
these two variables. Covariance graph models have recently received much
attention in the literature and constitute a sub-family of graphical models.
Though they are conceptually simple to understand, they are considerably more
difficult to analyze. Under some suitable assumption on the probability
distribution, covariance graph models can also be used to represent more
complex conditional independence relationships between subsets of variables.
When the covariance graph captures or reflects all the conditional independence
statements present in the probability distribution the latter is said to be
faithful to its covariance graph - though no such prior guarantee exists.
Despite the increasingly widespread use of these two types of graphical models,
to date no deep probabilistic analysis of this class of models, in terms of the
faithfulness assumption, is available. Such an analysis is crucial in
understanding the ability of the graph, a discrete object, to fully capture the
salient features of the probability distribution it aims to describe. In this
paper we demonstrate that multivariate Gaussian distributions that have trees
as covariance graphs are necessarily faithful. The method of proof is original
as it uses an entirely new approach and in the process yields a technique that
is novel to the field of graphical models.
