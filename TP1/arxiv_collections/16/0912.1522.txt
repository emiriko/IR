We show how to distribute with percentage success probabilities almost
perfectly entangled qubit memory pairs over repeater channel segments of the
order of the optical attenuation distance. In addition to some weak, dispersive
light-matter interactions, only Gaussian state transmissions and measurements
are needed for this scheme, which even beats the coherent-state-benchmark for
entanglement distribution based on error-free non-Gaussian measurements. This
is achieved through two innovations: first, optical squeezed states are
utilized instead of coherent states. Secondly, the amplitudes of the bright
signal pulses are reamplified at each repeater station. This latter variation
is a strategy reminiscent of classical repeaters and would be impossible in
single-photon-based schemes.
