This paper presents the following results on sets that are complete for NP.
  1. If there is a problem in NP that requires exponential time at almost all
lengths, then every many-one NP-complete set is complete under
length-increasing reductions that are computed by polynomial-size circuits. 2.
If there is a problem in coNP that cannot be solved by polynomial-size
nondeterministic circuits, then every many-one complete set is complete under
length-increasing reductions that are computed by polynomial-size circuits. 3.
If there exist a one-way permutation that is secure against subexponential-size
circuits and there is a hard tally language in NP intersect coNP, then there is
a Turing complete language for NP that is not many-one complete. Our first two
results use worst-case hardness hypotheses whereas earlier work that showed
similar results relied on average-case or almost-everywhere hardness
assumptions. The use of average-case and worst-case hypotheses in the last
result is unique as previous results obtaining the same consequence relied on
almost-everywhere hardness results.
