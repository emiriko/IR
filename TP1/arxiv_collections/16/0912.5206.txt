We present the consequences of a large radiative correction term coming from
Supersymmetry (SUSY) upon the electron neutrino fluxes streaming off a core-
collapse supernova using a 3-flavor neutrino-neutrino interaction code. We
explore the interplay between the neutrino-neutrino interaction and the effects
of the resonance associated with the mu-tau neutrino index of refraction. We
find that sizeable effects may be visible in the flux on Earth and,
consequently, on the number of events upon the energy signal of electron
neutrinos in a liquid argon detector. Such effect could lead to a probe for
Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics and, ideally, to constraints in the SUSY
parameter space.
