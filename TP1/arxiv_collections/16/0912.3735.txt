In this paper we consider U(1)-gauged Polony'i model with two spurions
coupled to a twisted closed string modulus. This offers a consistent setup for
metastable SUSY breakdown which allows for moduli stabilization and naturally
leads to gauge or hybrid gauge/gravitational mediation mechanism. Due to the
presence of the second spurion one can arrange for a solution of the \mu and
B_\mu problems in a version of modified Giudice-Masiero mechanism, which works
both in the limit of pure gauge mediation and in the mixed regime of hybrid
mediation.
