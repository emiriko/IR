This work aims at investigating the molecular and infrared components in the
massive young stellar object (MYSO) candidate IRAS 18544+0112. The purpose is
to determine the nature and the origin of this infrared source. To analyze the
molecular gas towards IRAS 18544+0112, we have carried out observations in a
90" x 90" region around l = 34.69, b = -0.65, using the Atacama Submillimeter
Telescope Experiment (ASTE) in the 12CO J=3-2, 13CO J=3-2, HCO+ J=4-3 and CS
J=7-6 lines with an angular resolution of 22". The infrared emission in the
area has been analyzed using 2MASS and Spitzer public data. From the molecular
analysis, we find self-absorbed 12CO J=3-2 profiles, which are typical in star
forming regions, but we do not find any evidence of outflow activity. Moreover,
we do not detect either HCO+ J=4-3 or CS J=7-6 in the region, which are species
normally enhanced in molecular outflows and high density envelopes. The 12CO
J=3-2 emission profile suggests the presence of expanding gas in the region.
The Spitzer images reveal that the infrared source has a conspicuous extended
emission bright at 8 um with an evident shell-like morphology of ~ 1.5 arcmin
in size (~ 1.4 pc at the proposed distance of 3 kpc) that encircles the 24 um
emission. The non-detection of ionized gas related to IRAS 18544+0112, together
with the fact that it is still embedded in a molecular clump suggest that IRAS
18544+0112, has not reached the UCHII region stage yet. Based on near infrared
photometry we search for YSO candidates in the region and propos that 2MASS
18565878+0116233 is the infrared point source associated with IRAS 18544+0112.
Finally, we suggest that the expansion of a larger nearby HII region,
G034.8-0.7, might be related to the formation of IRAS 18544+0112.
