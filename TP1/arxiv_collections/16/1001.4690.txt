We report on measurements of the quantum capacitance in graphene as a
function of charge carrier density. A resonant LC-circuit giving high
sensitivity to small capacitance changes is employed. The density of states,
which is directly proportional to the quantum capacitance, is found to be
significantly larger than zero at and around the charge neutrality point. This
finding is interpreted to be a result of potential fluctuations with amplitudes
of the order of 100 meV in good agreement with scanning single-electron
transistor measurements on bulk graphene and transport studies on nanoribbons.
