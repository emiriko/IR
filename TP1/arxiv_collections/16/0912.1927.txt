We analyse the complexity of the computation of the class group structure,
regulator, and a system of fundamental units of a certain class of number
fields. Our approach differs from Buchmann's, who proved a complexity bound of
L(1/2,O(1)) when the discriminant tends to infinity with fixed degree. We
achieve a subexponential complexity in O(L(1/3,O(1))) when both the
discriminant and the degree of the extension tend to infinity by using
techniques due to Enge and Gaudry in the context of algebraic curves over
finite fields.
