Three types of numerical data are provided for compact simple Lie groups $G$
of classical types and of any rank. This data is indispensable for Fourier-like
expansions of multidimensional digital data into finite series of $E-$functions
on the fundamental domain $F^{e}$. Firstly, we determine the number $|F^{e}_M|$
of points in $F^{e}$ from the lattice $P^{\vee}_M$, which is the refinement of
the dual weight lattice $P^{\vee}$ of $G$ by a positive integer $M$. Secondly,
we find the lowest set $\Lambda^{e}_M$ of the weights, specifying the maximal
set of $E-$functions that are pairwise orthogonal on the point set $F^{e}_M$.
Finally, we describe an efficient algorithm for finding the number of conjugate
points to every point of $F^{e}_M$. Discrete $E-$transform, together with its
continuous interpolation, is presented in full generality.
