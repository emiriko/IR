We explore in the supergravity context the possibility that a Higgs scalar
may drive inflation via a non-minimal coupling to gravity characterised by a
large dimensionless coupling constant. We find that this scenario is not
compatible with the MSSM, but that adding a singlet field (NMSSM, or a variant
thereof) can very naturally give rise to slow-roll inflation. The inflaton is
necessarily contained in the doublet Higgs sector and occurs in the D-flat
direction of the two Higgs doublets.
