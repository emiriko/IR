A study of multifragmentation of gold nuclei is reported at incident energies
of 400, 600 and 1000 MeV/nucleon using microscopic theory. The present
calculations are done within the framework of quantum molecular dynamics (QMD)
model. The clusterization is performed with advanced sophisticated algorithm
namely \emph{simulated annealing clusterization algorithm} (SACA) along with
conventional spatial correlation method. A quantitative comparison of mean
multiplicity of intermediate mass fragments with experimental findings of
ALADiN group gives excellent agreement showing the ability of SACA method to
reproduce the fragment yields. It also emphasizes the importance of clustering
criterion in describing the fragmentation process within semi-classical model.
