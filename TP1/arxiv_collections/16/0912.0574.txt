The Stone-von Neumann-Mackey Theorem for Heisenberg groups associated to
locally compact abelian groups is proved using the Peter-Weyl theorem and the
theory of Fourier transforms for finite dimensional real vector spaces. A
theorem of Pontryagin and van Kampen on the structure of locally compact
abelian groups (which is evident in any particular case) is assumed.
