The Berry-Keating operator $H_{\mathrm{BK}}:=
-\ui\hbar(x\frac{\ud\phantom{x}}{\ud x}+{1/2})$ [M. V. Berry and J. P. Keating,
SIAM Rev. 41 (1999) 236] governing the Schr\"odinger dynamics is discussed in
the Hilbert space $L^2(\rz_>,\ud x)$ and on compact quantum graphs. It is
proved that the spectrum of $H_{\mathrm{BK}}$ defined on $L^2(\rz_>,\ud x)$ is
purely continuous and thus this quantization of $H_{\mathrm{BK}}$ cannot yield
the hypothetical Hilbert-Polya operator possessing as eigenvalues the
nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. A complete classification of all
self-adjoint extensions of $H_{\mathrm{BK}}$ acting on compact quantum graphs
is given together with the corresponding secular equation in form of a
determinant whose zeros determine the discrete spectrum of $H_{\mathrm{BK}}$.
In addition, an exact trace formula and the Weyl asymptotics of the eigenvalue
counting function are derived. Furthermore, we introduce the "squared"
Berry-Keating operator $H_{\mathrm{BK}}^2:= -x^2\frac{\ud^2\phantom{x}}{\ud
x^2}-2x\frac{\ud\phantom{x}}{\ud x}-{1/4}$ which is a special case of the
Black-Scholes operator used in financial theory of option pricing. Again, all
self-adjoint extensions, the corresponding secular equation, the trace formula
and the Weyl asymptotics are derived for $H_{\mathrm{BK}}^2$ on compact quantum
graphs. While the spectra of both $H_{\mathrm{BK}}$ and $H_{\mathrm{BK}}^2$ on
any compact quantum graph are discrete, their Weyl asymptotics demonstrate that
neither $H_{\mathrm{BK}}$ nor $H_{\mathrm{BK}}^2$ can yield as eigenvalues the
nontrivial Riemann zeros. Some simple examples are worked out in detail.
