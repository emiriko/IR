In the standard model the two-body charmless hadronic $B_c$ meson decays can
occur via annihilation diagrams only. In this work, we studied the $B_c \to PP,
PV/VP,VV$ decays by employing the perturbative QCD (pQCD) factorization
approach. From our calculations, we find that (a) the pQCD predictions for the
branching ratios of the considered $B_c$ decays are in the range of $10^{-6}$
to $10^{-8}$; (b) for $B_c \to PV/VP, VV$ decays, the branching ratios of
$\Delta S= 0$ decays are much larger than those of $\Delta S =1$ ones because
the different Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa(CKM) factors are involved; (c)
analogous to $B \to K \eta^{(\prime)}$ decays, we find $Br(B_c \to K^+
\eta^\prime) \sim 10 \times Br(B_c \to K^+ \eta)$, which can be understood by
the destructive and constructive interference between the $\eta_q$ and $\eta_s$
contribution to the $B_c \to K^+ \eta$ and $B_c \to K^+ \eta^\prime$ decay; (d)
the longitudinal polarization fractions of $B_c \to VV$ decays are in the range
of $86%-95%$ and play the dominant role; and (e) there is no CP-violating
asymmetries for the considered $B_c$ decays because only one type tree
operators involved.
