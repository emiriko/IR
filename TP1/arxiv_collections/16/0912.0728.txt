Quantum oscillations in hole doped high temperature superconductors are
difficult to understand within the prevailing views. An emerging idea is that
of a putative normal ground state, which appears to be a Fermi liquid with a
reconstructed Fermi surface. The oscillations are due to formation of Landau
levels. Recently the same oscillations were found in the electron doped
cuprate, $\mathrm{Nd_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4}}$, in the optimal to overdoped regime.
Although these electron doped non-stoichiometric materials are naturally more
disordered, they strikingly complement the hole doped cuprates. Here we provide
an explanation of these observations from the perspective of density waves
using a powerful transfer matrix method to compute the conductance as a
function of the magnetic field.
