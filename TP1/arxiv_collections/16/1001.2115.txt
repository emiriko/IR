We consider the interaction between electrons and molecular vibrations in the
context of electronic transport in nanoscale devices. We present a method based
on non-equilibrium Green's functions to calculate both equilibrium and
non-equilibrium electronic properties of a single-molecule junction in the
presence of electron-vibron interactions. We apply our method to a model system
consisting of a single electronic level coupled to a single vibration mode in
the molecule, which is in contact with two electron reservoirs. Higher-order
diagrams beyond the usual self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA) are
included in the calculations. In this paper we consider the effects of the
double-exchange diagram and the diagram in which the vibron propagator is
renormalized by one electron-hole bubble. We study in detail the effects of the
first- and second-order diagrams on the spectral functions for a large set of
parameters and for different transport regimes (resonant and off-resonant
cases), both at equilibrium and in the presence of a finite applied bias. We
also study the linear response (linear conductance) of the nanojunction for all
the different regimes. We find that it is indeed necessary to go beyond the
SCBA in order to obtain correct results for a wide range of parameters.
