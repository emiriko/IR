We study the dihadron azimuthal correlation produced nearly back-to-back in
unpolarized hadron collisions, arising from the product of two Collins
fragmentation functions. Using the latest Collins fragmentation functions
extracted from the global analysis of available experimental data, we make
predictions for the azimuthal correlation of two-pion production in $pp$
collisions at RHIC energies. We find that the correlation is sizable in the
mid-rapidity region for moderate jet transverse momentum.
