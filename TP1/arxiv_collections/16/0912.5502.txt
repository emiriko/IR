We propose to use novel and classical audio and text signal-processing and
otherwise techniques for "inexpensive" fast writer identification tasks of
scanned hand-written documents "visually". The "inexpensive" refers to the
efficiency of the identification process in terms of CPU cycles while
preserving decent accuracy for preliminary identification. This is a
comparative study of multiple algorithm combinations in a pattern recognition
pipeline implemented in Java around an open-source Modular Audio Recognition
Framework (MARF) that can do a lot more beyond audio. We present our
preliminary experimental findings in such an identification task. We simulate
"visual" identification by "looking" at the hand-written document as a whole
rather than trying to extract fine-grained features out of it prior
classification.
