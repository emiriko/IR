We study the optical conductivity in the low-energy regime of gapped mono-
and bilayer graphene. A scaling relation is found, in which the four parameters
frequency, gap, Fermi energy and temperature appear only as combination of
three independent parameters. The ratio of the optical conductivity of bilayer
and mononlayer graphene is exactly 2.
