We consider multi-terminal mesoscopic transport through a well-conducting
chaotic quantum cavity using random matrix theory. Four-probe resistance
vanishes on the average and is not affected by weak localization. Its
fluctuations are given by a single expression valid for arbitrary temperature,
ac frequency, non-ideal coupling of the contacts, and in the presence of
floating probes; surprisingly, they are governed by the dwell time only. In
contrast, the two-probe transport additionally depends on the RC-time, which is
interpreted as a property of the measurement scheme. We also predict a
universal mesoscopic distribution of the phase of transmitted voltage in an ac
experiment.
