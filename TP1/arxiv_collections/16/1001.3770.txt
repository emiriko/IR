We calculate the photonic frequency-dependent absorption cross section and
intensity of the Hawking radiation for a stationary non-rotating black hole
using the electrodynamic membrane paradigm and Kirchhoff's law. A remarkable
conclusion is that the use of geometrical optics limit for absorption
cross-section and Kirchhoff's law for the photonic luminosity of black hole
provides a very good estimation for its total emission power
