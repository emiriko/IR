The study of the surface properties of Centaurs and Trans-Neptunian Objects
(TNOs) provides essential information about the early conditions and evolution
of the outer Solar System. Due to the faintness of most of these distant and
icy bodies, photometry currently constitutes the best technique to survey a
statistically significant number of them. Our aim is to investigate color
properties of a large sample of minor bodies of the outer Solar System, and set
their taxonomic classification. We carried out visible and near-infrared
photometry of Centaurs and TNOs, making use, respectively, of the FORS2 and
ISAAC instruments at the Very Large Telescope (European Southern Observatory).
Using G-mode analysis, we derived taxonomic classifications according to the
Barucci et al. (2005a) system. We report photometric observations of 31
objects, 10 of them have their colors reported for the first time ever. 28
Centaurs and TNOs have been assigned to a taxon. We combined the entire sample
of 38 objects taxonomically classified in the framework of our programme (28
objects from this work; 10 objects from DeMeo et al. 2009a) with previously
classified TNOs and Centaurs, looking for correlations between taxonomy and
dynamics. We compared our photometric results to literature data, finding hints
of heterogeneity for the surfaces of 4 objects.
