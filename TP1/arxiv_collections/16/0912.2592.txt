We study the signatures of different coronal heating regimes on the
differential emission measure (DEM) of multi-stranded coronal loops by means of
hydrodynamic simulations. We consider heating either uniformly distributed
along the loops or localized close to the chromospheric footpoints, in both
steady and impulsive conditions. Our simulations show that condensation at the
top of the loop forms when the localized heating is impulsive with a pulse
cadence time shorter than the plasma cooling time, and the pulse energy is
below a certain threshold. A condensation does not produce observable
signatures in the global DEM structure. Conversely, the DEM coronal peak is
found sensitive to the pulse cadence time. Our simulations can also give an
explanation of the warm overdense and hot underdense loops observed by TRACE,
SOHO and Yohkoh. However, they are unable to reproduce both the transition
region and the coronal DEM structure with a unique set of parameters, which
outlines the need for a more realistic description of the transition region.
