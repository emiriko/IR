We develop a new approach for studying flux anomalies in quadruply-imaged
fold lens systems. We show that in the absence of substructure, microlensing,
or differential absorption, the expected flux ratios of a fold pair can be
tightly constrained using only geometric arguments. We apply this technique to
11 known quadruple lens systems in the radio and infrared, and compare our
estimates to the Monte Carlo based results of Keeton, Gaudi, and Petters. We
show that a robust estimate for a flux ratio from a smoothly varying potential
can be found, and at long wavelengths those lenses deviating from from this
ratio almost certainly contain significant substructure.
