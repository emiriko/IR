We describe a molecular dynamics framework for the direct calculation of the
short-ranged structural forces underlying grain-boundary premelting and
grain-coalescence in solidification. The method is applied in a comparative
study of (i) a Sigma 9 <115> 120 degress twist and (ii) a Sigma 9 <110> {411}
symmetric tilt boundary in a classical embedded-atom model of elemental Ni.
Although both boundaries feature highly disordered structures near the melting
point, the nature of the temperature dependence of the width of the disordered
regions in these boundaries is qualitatively different. The former boundary
displays behavior consistent with a logarithmically diverging premelted layer
thickness as the melting temperature is approached from below, while the latter
displays behavior featuring a finite grain-boundary width at the melting point.
It is demonstrated that both types of behavior can be quantitatively described
within a sharp-interface thermodynamic formalism involving a width-dependent
interfacial free energy, referred to as the disjoining potential. The
disjoining potential for boundary (i) is calculated to display a monotonic
exponential dependence on width, while that of boundary (ii) features a weak
attractive minimum. The results of this work are discussed in relation to
recent simulation and theoretical studies of the thermodynamic forces
underlying grain-boundary premelting.
