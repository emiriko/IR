Experimental investigation as well as theoretical calculations, of the
Fe-partial phonon density-of-states (DOS) for nominally Fe_52.5Cr_47.5 alloy
having (a) alpha- and (b) sigma-phase structure were carried out. The former at
sector 3-ID of the Advanced Photon Source, using the method of nuclear resonant
inelastic X-ray scattering, and the latter with the direct method [K. Parlinski
et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {78, 4063 (1997)]. The characteristic features of
phonon DOS, which differentiate one phase from the other, were revealed and
successfully reproduced by the theory. Various data pertinent to the dynamics
such as Lamb-Mossbauer factor, f, kinetic energy per atom, E_k, and the mean
force constant, D, were directly derived from the experiment and the
theoretical calculations, while vibrational specific heat at constant volume,
C_V, and vibrational entropy, S were calculated using the Fe-partial DOS. Using
the values of f and C_V, we determined values for Debye temperatures, T_D. An
excellent agreement for some quantities derived from experiment and
first-principles theory, like C_V and quite good one for others like D and S
was obtained.
