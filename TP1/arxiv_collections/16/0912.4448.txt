We study stabilization of hypermoduli with emphasis on the effects of
generalized fluxes. We find a class of no-scale vacua described by ISD
conditions even in the presence of geometric flux. The associated flux
attractor equations can be integrated by a generating function with the
property that the hypermoduli are determined by a simple extremization
principle. We work out several orbifold examples where all vector moduli and
many hypermoduli are stabilized, with VEVs given explicitly in terms of fluxes.
