The deflection of a ray of light passing close to a gravitational mass, is
generally calculated from the null geodesic which the light ray (photon)
follows. However, there is an alternate approach, where the effect of
gravitation on the ray of light is estimated by considering the ray to be
passing through a material medium. Calculations have been done in this paper,
following the later approach, to estimate the amount of deflection due to a
static non-rotating mass. The refractive index of such a material medium has
been calculated in a more rigorous manner in the present work and the final
value of amount of deflection calculated here is claimed to be more accurate
than all other values resulting from previous calculations.
