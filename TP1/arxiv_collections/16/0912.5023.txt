We study the interplay between disorder and superconductivity in a rope of
metallic carbon nanotubes. Based on the time dependent Ginzburg Landau theory,
we derive the superconducting transition temperature T$_c$ taking into account
the critical superconducting fluctuations which are expected to be
substantially strong in such low dimensional systems. Our results indicate
that, contrary to what is expected, T$_c$ increases by increasing the amount of
disorder. We argue that this behavior is due to the dynamics of the tubes which
reduces the drastic effect of the local disorder on superconductivity by
enhancing the intertube Josephson tunneling. We also found that T$_c$ is
enhanced as the effective dimensionality of the rope increases by increasing
the number N of the tubes forming the rope. However, T$_c$ tends to saturate
for large values of N, expressing the establishment of a bulk three dimensional
(3D) superconducting order.
