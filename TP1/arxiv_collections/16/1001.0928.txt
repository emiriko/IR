Characteristic results of magnetism in small particles and thin films are
presented. As a consequence of the reduced atomic coordination in small
clusters and thin films the electronic states and density of states modify.
Thus magnetic moments and magnetization are affected. In tunnel junctions
interplay of magnetism, spin currents and superconductivity are of particular
interest. Results are given for single transition metal clusters, cluster
ensembles, thin films and tunnel systems. Interesting behavior of tunnel
currents and currents induced by Aharonov-Bohm effect into mesoscopic rings
etc. are discussed.
