Using microscopic theory, we investigate the properties of a spin current
driven by magnetization dynamics. In the limit of smooth magnetization texture,
the dominant spin current induced by the spin pumping effect is shown to be the
diffusive spin current, i.e., the one arising from only a diffusion associated
with spin accumulation. That is to say, there is no effective field that
locally drives the spin current. We also investigate the conversion mechanism
of the pumped spin current into a charge current by spin-orbit interactions,
specifically the inverse spin Hall effect. We show that the spin-charge
conversion does not always occur and that it depends strongly on the type of
spin-orbit interaction. In a Rashba spin-orbit system, the local part of the
charge current is proportional to the spin relaxation torque, and the local
spin current, which does not arise from the spin accumulation, does not play
any role in the conversion. In contrast, the diffusive spin current contributes
to the diffusive charge current. Alternatively, for spin-orbit interactions
arising from random impurities, the local charge current is proportional to the
local spin current that constitutes only a small fraction of the total spin
current. Clearly, the dominant spin current (diffusive spin current) is not
converted into a charge current. Therefore, the nature of the spin current is
fundamentally different depending on its origin and thus the spin transport and
the spin-charge conversion behavior need to be discussed together along with
spin current generation.
