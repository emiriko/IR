We discuss techniques to generate long-range interactions in a gas of
groundstate alkali atoms, by weakly admixing excited Rydberg states with laser
light. This provides a tool to engineer strongly correlated phases with reduced
decoherence from inelastic collisions and spontaneous emission. As an
illustration, we discuss the quantum phases of dressed atoms with dipole-dipole
interactions confined in a harmonic potential, as relevant to experiments. We
show that residual spontaneous emission from the Rydberg state acts as a
heating mechanism, leading to a quantum-classical crossover.
