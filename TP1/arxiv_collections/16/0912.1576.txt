A complex rare-earth rich aluminoborosilicate glass has been proved to be a
good candidate for the immobilization of new high level radioactive wastes. A
simplified seven-oxides composition of this glass was selected for this study.
In this system, sodium and calcium cations were supposed in other works to
simulate respectively all the other alkali (R+=Li+, Rb+, Cs+) and
alkaline-earth (R'2+=Sr2+, Ba2+) cations present in the complex glass
composition. Moreover, neodymium or lanthanum are used here to simulate all the
rare-earths and actinides occurring in waste solutions. In order to study the
impact of the nature of R+ and R'2+ cations on both glass structure and melt
crystallization tendency during cooling, two glass series were prepared by
replacing either Na+ or Ca2+ cations in the simplified glass by respectively
(Li+, K+, Rb+, Cs+) or (Mg2+, Sr2+, Ba2+) cations. From these substitutions, it
was established that alkali ions are preferentially involved in the charge
compensation of (AlO4)- entities in the glass network comparatively to
alkaline-earth ions. The glass compositions containing calcium give way to the
crystallization of an apatite silicate phase bearing calcium and rare-earth
ions. The melt crystallization tendency during cooling strongly varies with the
nature of the alkaline-earth.
