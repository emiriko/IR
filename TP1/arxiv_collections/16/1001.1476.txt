This paper presents the first high-resolution and high-sensitivity study of
the radio properties of optically selected type~2 quasars. We used the Very
Large Array at 8.4 GHz to observe 59 sources drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey sample of Zakamska et al. (2003). The detection rate of our survey is
59% (35/59), comparable to the detection rate in FIRST at 1.4 GHz. Ongoing star
formation, although present, contributes negligible radio emission at the
current sensitivity limit. Comparing the radio powers with the [O III]
$\lambda$5007 luminosities, we find that roughly 15%$\pm$5% of the sample can
be considered radio-loud. Intriguingly, the vast majority of the detected
sources in our sample fall in a region intermediate between those traditionally
occupied by radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars. Moreover, most of these
"radio-intermediate" sources tend to have flat or inverted radio spectra, which
we speculate may be caused by free-free absorption by ionized gas in the
narrow-line region. The incidence of flat-spectrum sources in type 2 quasars
appears to be much higher than in type 1 quasars, in apparent violation of the
simple orientation-based unified model for active galaxies.
