We investigate the masses of light mesons from a coupled system of
Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations. The dominant non-Abelian and
sub-leading Abelian contributions to the dressed quark-gluon vertex are
explicitly taken into account. We also include unquenching effects in the form
of hadronic resonance contributions via the back-reaction of pions. We
construct the corresponding Bethe--Salpeter kernel that satisfies the
axial-vector Ward-Takahashi identity. Our numerical treatment fully includes
all momentum dependencies with all equations solved completely in the complex
plane. This approach goes well beyond the rainbow-ladder approximation and
permits us to investigate the relative impact of different corrections beyond
rainbow-ladder on the properties of mesons. We find that sub-leading Abelian
corrections are further suppressed dynamically, and that our results supersede
early qualitative predictions with significantly simpler truncation schemes.
