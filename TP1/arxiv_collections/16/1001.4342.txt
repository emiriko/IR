Several exoplanets have been detected towards the Galactic bulge with the
microlensing technique. We show that exoplanets in M31 may also be detected
with the pixel-lensing method, if telescopes making high cadence observations
of an ongoing microlensing event are used. Using a Monte Carlo approach we find
that the mean mass for detectable planetary systems is about $2 M_{\rm {J}}$.
However, even small mass exoplanets ($M_{\rm P} < 20 M_{\oplus}$) can cause
significant deviations, which are observable with large telescopes. We
reanalysed the POINT-AGAPE microlensing event PA-99-N2. First, we test the
robustness of the binary lens conclusion for this light curve. Second, we show
that for such long duration and bright microlensing events, the efficiency for
finding planetary-like deviations is strongly enhanced with respect to that
evaluated for all planetary detectable events.
