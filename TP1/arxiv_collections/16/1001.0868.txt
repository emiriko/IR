he CDF experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron p-pbar collider pioneered the
exploration of charmless b-hadron decays in hadron collisions. This provided a
unique, rich and highly successful program of measurements that is currently
reaching its full maturity. I report here results on two-body decays and the
new analysis of B0s-->phiphi decays in a event sample corresponding to 2.9
fb-1.
