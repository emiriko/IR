There is a remarkable synergy between requirements for Dark Energy probes by
cosmic shear measurements and planet hunting by microlensing. Employing weak
and strong gravitational lensing to trace and detect the distribution of matter
on cosmic and Galactic scales, but as well as to the very small scales of
exoplanets is a unique meeting point from cosmology to exoplanets. It will use
gravity as the tool to explore the full range of masses not accessible by any
other means. EUCLID is a 1.2m telescope with optical and IR wide field imagers
and slitless spectroscopy, proposed to ESA Cosmic Vision to probe for Dark
Energy, Baryonic acoustic oscillation, galaxy evolution, and an exoplanet hunt
via microlensing. A 3 months microlensing program will already efficiently
probe for planets down to the mass of Mars at the snow line, for free floating
terrestrial or gaseous planets and habitable super Earth. A 12+ months survey
would give a census on habitable Earth planets around solar like stars. This is
the perfect complement to the statistics that will be provided by the KEPLER
satellite, and these missions combined will provide a full census of extrasolar
planets from hot, warm, habitable, frozen to free floating.
