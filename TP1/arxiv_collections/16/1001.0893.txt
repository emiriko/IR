We calculate the finite size scaling of the sample-to-sample fluctuations of
the free energy $\Delta F$ of the $m$ component vector spin glass in the
large-$m$ limit. This is accomplished using a variant of the interpolating
Hamiltonian technique which is used to establish a connection between the free
energy fluctuations and bond chaos. The calculation of bond chaos then shows
that the scaling of the free energy fluctuaions with system size $N$ is $\Delta
F \sim N^\mu$ with ${1/5}\leq\mu <{3/10}$, and very likely $\mu={1}{5}$
exactly.
