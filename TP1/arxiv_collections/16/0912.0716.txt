The semiclassical equations of motion for a Bloch electron include an
anomalous velocity term analogous to a $k$-space "Lorentz force", with the
Berry connection playing the role of a vector potential. By examining the
adiabatic evolution of Bloch states in a monotonically-increasing vector
potential, I show that the anomalous velocity can be explained as the
difference in the Berry's phase acquired by adjacent Bloch states within a
wavepacket.
