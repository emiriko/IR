We obtain some theoretic and experimental results concerning various
properties (the number of fixed points, image distribution, cycle lengths) of
the dynamical system naturally associated with Fermat quotients acting on the
set $\{0, ..., p-1\}$. We also consider pseudorandom properties of Fermat
quotients such as joint distribution and linear complexity.
