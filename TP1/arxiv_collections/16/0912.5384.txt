We present the asymptotic formula for the Wigner 9j-symbol, valid when all
quantum numbers are large, in the classically allowed region. As in the
Ponzano-Regge formula for the 6j-symbol, the action is expressed in terms of
lengths of edges and dihedral angles of a geometrical figure, but the angles
require care in definition. Rules are presented for converting spin networks
into the associated geometrical figures. The amplitude is expressed as the
determinant of a 2x2 matrix of Poisson brackets. The 9j-symbol possesses
caustics associated with the fold and elliptic and hyperbolic umbilic
catastrophes. The asymptotic formula obeys the exact symmetries of the
9j-symbol.
