The random K-satisfiability (K-SAT) problem is an important problem for
studying typical-case complexity of NP-complete combinatorial satisfaction; it
is also a representative model of finite-connectivity spin-glasses. In this
paper we review our recent efforts on the solution space fine structures of the
random K-SAT problem. A heterogeneity transition is predicted to occur in the
solution space as the constraint density alpha reaches a critical value
alpha_cm. This transition marks the emergency of exponentially many solution
communities in the solution space. After the heterogeneity transition the
solution space is still ergodic until alpha reaches a larger threshold value
alpha_d, at which the solution communities disconnect from each other to become
different solution clusters (ergodicity-breaking). The existence of solution
communities in the solution space is confirmed by numerical simulations of
solution space random walking, and the effect of solution space heterogeneity
on a stochastic local search algorithm SEQSAT, which performs a random walk of
single-spin flips, is investigated. The relevance of this work to glassy
dynamics studies is briefly mentioned.
