It is known that a single product shock measure in some of one-dimensional
driven-diffusive systems with nearest-neighbor interactions might evolve in
time quite similar to a random walker moving on a one-dimensional lattice with
reflecting boundaries. The non-equilibrium steady-state of the system in this
case can be written in terms of a linear superposition of such uncorrelated
shocks. Equivalently, one can write the steady-state of this system using a
matrix-product approach with two-dimensional matrices. In this paper we
introduce an equilibrium two-dimensional one-transit walk model and find its
partition function using a transfer matrix method. We will show that there is a
direct connection between the partition functions of these two systems. We will
explicitly show that in the steady-state the transfer matrix of the one-transit
walk model is related to the matrix representation of the algebra of the
driven-diffusive model through a similarity transformation. The physical
quantities are also related through the same transformation.
