In a recent paper by the authors, a new approach--called the "embedding
method"--was introduced, which allows to make use of exchangeable pairs for
normal and multivariate normal approximation with Stein's method in cases where
the corresponding couplings do not satisfy a certain linearity condition. The
key idea is to embed the problem into a higher dimensional space in such a way
that the linearity condition is then satisfied. Here we apply the embedding to
U-statistics as well as to subgraph counts in random graphs.
