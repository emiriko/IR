In this note we present eleven unit distance embeddings of the Heawood graph,
i.e. the point-line incidence graph of the finite projective plane of order
two, by way of pictures and 15 digit approximations of the coordinates of the
vertices. These together with the defining algebraic equations suffice to
calculate arbitrarily exact approximations for the exact embeddings, and so to
show that the Heawood graph indeed is a unit-distance graph. Thus we refute a
"suspicion" of V. Chvatal from 1972.
