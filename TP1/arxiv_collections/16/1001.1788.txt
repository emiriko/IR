We study the flavor structure of 4D effective theories, which are derived
from extra dimensional theories with magnetic fluxes and non-Abelian Wilson
lines. We study zero-mode wavefunctions and compute Yukawa couplings as well as
four-point couplings. In our models, we also discuss non-Abelian discrete
flavor symmetries such as $D_4$, $\Delta(27)$ and $\Delta(54)$.
