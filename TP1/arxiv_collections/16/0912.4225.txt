We present the results of a multiwavelength campaign searching for young
objects in the intragroup medium of seven compact groups of galaxies: HCG 2, 7,
22, 23, 92, 100 and NGC 92. We used Fabry-Perot velocity fields and rotation
curves together with GALEX NUV and FUV images, optical R-band and HI maps to
evaluate the stage of interaction of each group. We conclude that groups (i)
HCG 7 and HCG 23 are in an early stage of interaction, (ii) HCG 2 and HCG 22
are mildly interacting, and (iii) HCG 92, HCG 100 and NGC 92 are in a late
stage of evolution. Evolved groups have a population of young objects in their
intragroup medium while no such population is found within the less evolved
groups. We also report the discovery of a tidal dwarf galaxy candidate in the
tail of NGC 92. These three groups, besides containing galaxies which have
peculiar velocity fields, also show extended HI tails. Our results indicate
that the advanced stage of evolution of a group together with the presence of
intragroup HI clouds may lead to star formation in the intragroup medium.
