We introduce a non-disordered lattice spin model, based on the principle of
minimizing spin-spin correlations up to a (tunable) distance R. The model can
be defined in any spatial dimension D, but already for D=1 and small values of
R (e.g. R=5) the model shows the properties of a glassy system: deep and well
separated energy minima, very slow relaxation dynamics, aging and non-trivial
fluctuation-dissipation ratio.
