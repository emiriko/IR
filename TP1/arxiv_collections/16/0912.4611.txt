The microtubule network, an important part of the cytoskeleton, is constantly
remodeled by alternating phases of growth and shrinkage of individual
filaments. Plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs) interact with the microtubule and
in many cases alter its dynamics. While it is established that the prototypal
CLIP-170 enhances microtubule stability by increasing rescues, the plus-end
tracking mechanism is still under debate. We present a model for microtubule
dynamics in which a rescue factor is dynamically added to the filament while
growing. As a consequence, the filament shows aging behavior which should be
experimentally accessible and thus allow one to exclude some hypothesized
models of the inclusion of rescue factors at the microtubule plus end.
Additionally, we show the strong influence of the cell geometry on the
quantitative results.
