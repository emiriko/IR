We describe recent evaluations of three-loop vertex corrections which have
been performed in the context of different physical applications: the massless
quark and gluon form factor, the vector current matching coefficient between
QCD and NRQCD, and the virtual corrections of the gluon-Higgs coupling with
finite top quark mass.
