Fusion research on magnetic confinement is confronted with a severe problem
concerning the electron densities ne to be used in fusion devices. Indeed, high
densities are mandatory for obtaining large efficiencies, whereas it is
empirically found that catastrophic disruptive events occur for densities
exceeding a maximal one n^M_e. On the other hand, despite the large theoretical
work there is no widely accepted, first principles model for the density limit
(see [1], abstract). Here, we propose a simple microscopic model of a
magnetized plasma suited for a tokamak, for which the existence of a density
limit is proven. This property turns out to be a general collective feature of
electrodynamics of point charges, which is lost in the continuum approximation.
The law we find is n^M_e = 1.74 1/(me c^2) B^2/ \mu_0, (1), where \mu_0 is the
vacuum permeability, c the speed of light, me the electron mass, and B the
magnetic field. As shown in Fig. 1, the theoretical limit (big circles) is in
rather good agreement with the empirical data, actually a surprisingly good one
for a model based on first principles, with no adjustable parameter.
