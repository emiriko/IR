Losev and Manin introduced fine moduli spaces $\bar{L}_n$ of stable
$n$-pointed chains of projective lines. The moduli space $\bar{L}_{n+1}$ is
isomorphic to the toric variety $X(A_n)$ associated with the root system $A_n$,
which is part of a general construction to associate with a root system $R$ of
rank $n$ an $n$-dimensional smooth projective toric variety $X(R)$. In this
paper we investigate generalisations of the Losev-Manin moduli spaces for the
other families of classical root systems.
