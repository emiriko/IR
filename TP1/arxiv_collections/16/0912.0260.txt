An 8.8 solar mass electron-capture supernova (SN) was simulated in spherical
symmetry consistently from collapse through explosion to nearly complete
deleptonization of the forming neutron star. The evolution time of about 9 s is
short because of nucleon-nucleon correlations in the neutrino opacities. After
a brief phase of accretion-enhanced luminosities (~200 ms), luminosity
equipartition among all species becomes almost perfect and the spectra of
electron antineutrinos and muon/tau antineutrinos very similar. We discuss
consequences for the neutrino-driven wind as a nucleosynthesis site and for
flavor oscillations of SN neutrinos.
