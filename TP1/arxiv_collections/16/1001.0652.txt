In nuclear fusion and fission, fluctuation and dissipation arise due to the
coupling of collective degrees of freedom with internal excitations. Close to
the barrier, both quantum, statistical and non-Markovian effects are expected
to be important. In this work, a new approach based on quantum Monte-Carlo
addressing this problem is presented. The exact dynamics of a system coupled to
an environment is replaced by a set of stochastic evolutions of the system
density. The quantum Monte-Carlo method is applied to systems with quadratic
potentials. In all range of temperature and coupling, the stochastic method
matches the exact evolution showing that non-Markovian effects can be simulated
accurately. A comparison with other theories like Nakajima-Zwanzig or
Time-ConvolutionLess ones shows that only the latter can be competitive if the
expansion in terms of coupling constant is made at least to fourth order. A
systematic study of the inverted parabola case is made at different
temperatures and coupling constants. The asymptotic passing probability is
estimated in different approaches including the Markovian limit. Large
differences with the exact result are seen in the latter case or when only
second order in the coupling strength is considered as it is generally assumed
in nuclear transport models. On opposite, if fourth order in the coupling or
quantum Monte-Carlo method is used, a perfect agreement is obtained.
