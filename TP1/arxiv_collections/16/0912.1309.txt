Precise measurements of slepton mass-splittings might represent a powerful
tool to probe supersymmetric (SUSY) lepton flavour violation (LFV) at the LHC.
We point out that mass-splittings of the first two generations of sleptons are
especially sensitive to LFV effects involving $\tau-\mu$ transitions. If these
mass-splittings are LFV induced, high-energy LFV processes like the neutralino
decay ${\nt}_2\to\nt_1\tau^{\pm}\mu^{\mp}$ as well as low-energy LFV processes
like $\tau\to\mu\gamma$ are unavoidable. We show that precise slepton
mass-splitting measurements and LFV processes both at the high- and low-energy
scales are highly complementary in the attempt to (partially) reconstruct the
flavour sector of the SUSY model at work. The present study represents another
proof of the synergy and interplay existing between the LHC, i.e. the {\em
high-energy frontier}, and high-precision low-energy experiments, i.e. the {\em
high-intensity frontier}.
