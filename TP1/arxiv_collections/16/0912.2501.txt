The structure of the A1035 cluster of galaxies (10h32m +40d13', cz ~ 22000
km/s), which exhibits a bimodal distribution of galaxy radial velocities
(\Delta V\approx 3000 km/s), is analyzed using three methods of determining the
relative distances to clusters from early-type galaxies: the Kormendy relation
corrected for the dependence of residuals on galaxy magnitude, the photometric
plane, and the fundamental plane. We use the data obtained with the 1-m
telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of
Sciences and SDSS (DR5) data to show that A1035 consists of two gravitationally
unbound independent clusters. These clusters with the velocity dispersions of
566 km/s and 610 km/s and masses within R_200 equal to 2.7 10^14 and 3.5 10^14
M_sun, respectively, obey the Hubble law.
