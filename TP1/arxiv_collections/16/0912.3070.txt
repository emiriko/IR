We explore, within the warped extra dimensional framework, the possibility of
finding anti-matter signals in cosmic rays (CRs) from dark matter (DM)
annihilation. Exchange of order 100 GeV radion, an integral part of our setup,
generically results in Sommerfeld enhancement of the annihilation rate for TeV
DM mass. No dark sector is required to obtain boosted annihilation cross
sections. A mild hierarchy between the radion and DM masses can be natural due
to the pseudo-Goldstone boson nature of the radion. Implications of Sommerfeld
enhancement in warped grand unified theory (GUT) models, where proton stability
implies a DM candidate, are studied. We show, via partially unified Pati-Salam
group, how to incorporate a custodial symmetry for Z->b\bar b into the GUT
framework such that a few TeV Kaluza-Klein (KK) mass scale is allowed by
precision tests. The model with smallest fully unified SO(10) representation
allows us to decouple the DM from the electroweak sector. Thus, a correct DM
relic density is obtained and direct detection bounds are satisfied. Looking at
robust CR observables, a possible future signal in the \bar p / p flux ratio is
found. We show how to embed a similar custodial symmetry for the right handed
tau, allowing it to be strongly coupled to KK particles. Such a scenario might
lead to observed signal in CR positrons; however, the DM candidate in this case
can not constitute all of the DM in the universe. Independently of the above,
the strong coupling between KK particles and tau's can lead to striking LHC
signals.
