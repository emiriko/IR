Security and safety are two intertwined terms. It is a common belief that
when a place or system is secure, it is safe. This paper shows a means of
integrating three devices for physical intrusion detection. This paper thus
suggests a means of increasing the level of security in an enclosed area with
the use three of the four security layers necessary for optimum security. This
paper intends to show that a system with more than one security device in place
tends to prevent unauthorized access. This paper would be illustrating the
implementation of this in an enclosed area whose security level must be kept on
the high at all times.
