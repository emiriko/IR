In this work we present expansions of intersection local times of fractional
Brownian motions in $\R^d$, for any dimension $d\geq 1$, with arbitrary Hurst
coefficients in $(0,1)^d$. The expansions are in terms of Wick powers of white
noises (corresponding to multiple Wiener integrals), being well-defined in the
sense of generalized white noise functionals. As an application of our
approach, a sufficient condition on $d$ for the existence of intersection local
times in $L^2$ is derived, extending the results of D. Nualart and S.
Ortiz-Latorre in "Intersection Local Time for Two Independent Fractional
Brownian Motions" (J. Theoret. Probab.,20(4)(2007), 759-767) to different and
more general Hurst coefficients.
