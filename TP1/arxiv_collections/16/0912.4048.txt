The standard notion of the Laplacian of a graph is generalized to the setting
of a graph with the extra structure of a ``transmission`` system. A
transmission system is a mathematical representation of a means of transmitting
(multi-parameter) data along directed edges from vertex to vertex. The
associated transmission graph Laplacian is shown to have many of the former
properties of the classical case, including: an upper Cheeger type bound on the
second eigenvalue minus the first of a geometric isoperimetric character,
relations of this difference of eigenvalues to diameters for k-regular graphs,
eigenvalues for Cayley graphs with transmission systems. An especially natural
transmission system arises in the context of a graph endowed with an
association. Other relations to transmission systems arising naturally in
quantum mechanics, where the transmission matrices are scattering matrices, are
made. As a natural merging of graph theory and matrix theory, there are
numerous potential applications, for example to random graphs and random
matrices.
