We construct a simple N=(0,2) deformation of the two-dimensional Wess-Zumino
model. In addition to superpotential, it includes a "twisted" superpotential.
Supersymmetry may or may not be spontaneously broken at the classical level. In
the latter case an extra right-handed fermion field \zeta_R involved in the
N=(0,2) deformation plays the role of Goldstino.
