Time-resolved low resolution Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet spectra
together with ground-based optical photometry and spectra are used to constrain
the temperatures and pulsation properties of six cataclysmic variables
containing pulsating white dwarfs. Combining our temperature determinations for
the five pulsating white dwarfs that are several years past outburst with past
results on six other systems shows that the instability strip for accreting
pulsating white dwarfs ranges from 10,500-15,000K, a wider range than evident
for ZZ Ceti pulsators. Analysis of the UV/optical pulsation properties reveals
some puzzling aspects. While half the systems show high pulsation amplitudes in
the UV compared to their optical counterparts, others show UV/optical amplitude
ratios that are less than one or no pulsations at either wavelength region.
