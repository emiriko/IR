We report the first experimental realization of ultracold atoms confined in a
time-averaged, adiabatic potential (TAAP). This novel trapping technique
involves using a slowly oscillating ($\sim$ kHz) bias field to time-average the
instantaneous potential given by dressing a bare magnetic potential with a high
frequency ($\sim$ MHz) magnetic field. The resultant potentials provide a
convenient route to a variety of trapping geometries with tunable parameters.
We demonstrate the TAAP trap in a standard time-averaged orbiting potential
trap with additional Helmholtz coils for the introduction of the radio
frequency dressing field. We have evaporatively cooled 5 $\times 10^4$ atoms of
$^{87}$Rb to quantum degeneracy and observed condensate lifetimes of over
\unit[3]{s}.-
