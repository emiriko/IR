We present several aspects of the screening of charged macromolecules in an
electrolyte. After a review of the basic mean field approach, based on the
linear Debye-Huckel theory, we consider the case of highly charged
macromolecules, where the linear approximation breaks down and the system is
described by full nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Some analytical results
for this nonlinear equation give some interesting insight on physical phenomena
like the charge renormalization and the Manning counterion condensation.
