Suzaku observed the region including HESS J1809-193, one of the TeV
unidentified (unID) sources, and confirmed existence of the extended hard X-ray
emission previously reported by ASCA, as well as hard X-ray emission from the
pulsar PSR J1809-1917 in the region. One-dimensional profile of the diffuse
emission is represented with a Gaussian model with the best-fit sigma of 7+-1
arcmin. The diffuse emission extends for at least 21 pc (at the 3sigma level,
assuming the distance of 3.5 kpc), and has a hard spectrum with the photon
index of Gamma ~1.7. The hard spectrum suggests the pulsar wind nebula (PWN)
origin, which is also strengthened by the hard X-ray emission from PSR
J1809-1917 itself. Thanks to the low background of Suzaku XIS, we were able to
investigate spatial variation of the energy spectrum, but no systematic
spectral change in the extended emission is found. These results imply that the
X-ray emitting pulsar wind electrons can travel up to 21 pc from the pulsar
without noticeable energy loss via synchrotron emission.
