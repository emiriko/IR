The data collected by XMM-Newton as it slews between pointings currently
cover almost half the entire sky, and many familiar features and new sources
are visible. The soft-band sensitivity limit of the Slew is close to that of
the RASS, and a large-area Slew-RASS comparison now provides the best
opportunity for discovering extremely rare high-variability objects.
