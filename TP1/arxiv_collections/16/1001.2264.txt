This paper is present sinusoidal frequency doublers circuit with low voltage
1.5 volt CMOS inverter. Main structure of circuit has three parts that is CMOS
inverter circuit, differential amplifier circuit, and square root circuit. This
circuit has designed to receive input voltage and give output voltage use few
MOS transistor, easy to understand, non complex of circuit, high precision, low
error and low power. The Simulation of circuit has MOS transistor functional in
active and saturation period. PSpice programmed has used to confirmation of
testing and simulation.
