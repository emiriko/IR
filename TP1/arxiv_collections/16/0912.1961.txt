Here we propose a generic mechanism - networked buffering - for generating
robust traits in complex systems that requires two basic conditions to be
satisfied: 1) agents are versatile enough to perform more than one single
functional role within a system and 2) agents are degenerate, i.e. there exists
partial overlap in the functional capabilities of agents. Given these
prerequisites, degenerate systems can readily produce a distributed systemic
response to local perturbations. Reciprocally, excess resources related to a
single function can indirectly support multiple unrelated functions within a
degenerate system. In models of genome:proteome mappings for which distributed
decision-making and modularity of genetic functions are assumed, we verify that
such distributed compensatory effects cause enhanced robustness of system
traits. The conditions needed to achieve the networked buffering behavior are
not demanding or rare, leading us to conjecture that degeneracy may
fundamentally underpin distributed robustness within several biological
systems. We further argue that degenerate forms of distributed robustness may
readily arise in other disciplines. For instance, it may allow for new insights
into systems engineering and planning activities that occur under high
uncertainty. We also speculate that the proposed hypothesis helps to explain
recent developments in understanding the origins of resilience within complex
ecosystems.
