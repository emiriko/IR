After giving a short introduction on smooth lattice polytopes, I will present
a proof for the finiteness of smooth lattice polytopes with few lattice points.
The argument is then turned into an algorithm for the classification of smooth
lattice polytopes in fixed dimension with an upper bound on the number of
lattice points. Additionally I have implemented this algorithm for dimension
two and three and used it, together with a classification of smooth minimal
fans by Tadao Oda, to create lists of all smooth 2-polytopes and 3-polytopes
with at most 12 lattice points.
