Understanding the astrophysical processes acting within galaxy groups and
their effects on the evolution of the galaxy population is one of the crucial
topic of modern cosmology, as almost 60% of galaxies in the Local Universe are
found in groups. We imaged in the far (FUV 1539 A) and near ultraviolet (NUV
2316 A) with GALEX three nearby groups, namely LGG93, LGG127 and LGG225. We
obtained the UV galaxy surface photometry and, for LGG225, the only group
covered by the SDSS, the photometry in u, g, r, i, z bands. We discuss galaxy
morphologies looking for interaction signatures and we analyze the SED of
galaxies to infer their luminosity-weighted ages. The UV and optical photometry
was also used to perform a kinematical and dynamical analysis of each group and
to evaluate the stellar mass. A few member galaxies in LGG225 show a distorted
UV morphology due to ongoing interactions. (FUV-NUV) colors suggest that
spirals in LGG93 and LGG225 host stellar populations in their outskirts younger
than that of M31 and M33 in the LG or with less extinction. The irregular
interacting galaxy NGC3447A has a significantly younger stellar population (few
Myr old) than the average of the other irregular galaxies in LGG225 suggesting
that the encounter triggered star formation. The early-type members of LGG225,
NGC3457 and NGC3522, have masses of the order of a few 10^9 Mo, comparable to
the Local Group ellipticals. For the most massive spiral in LGG225, we estimate
a stellar mass of ~4x10$^{10}$ Mo, comparable to M33 in the LG. Ages of stellar
populations range from a few to ~7 Gyr for the galaxies in LGG225. The
kinematical and dynamical analysis indicates that LGG127 and LGG225 are in a
pre-virial collapse phase, i.e. still undergoing dynamical relaxation, while
LGG93 is likely virialized. (Abridged)
