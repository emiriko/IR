V1130 Tau is a bright (m_V = 6.56), nearby (71 +/- 2 pc) detached system with
a circular orbit (P = 0.80d). The components are deformed with filling factors
above 0.9. Their masses and radii have been established to 0.6-0.7%. We derive
a [Fe/H] abundance of -0.25 +/- 0.10. The measured rotational velocities, 92.4
+/- 1.1 (primary) and 104.7 +/- 2.7 (secondary) km/s, are in fair agreement
with synchronization. The larger 1.39 Msun secondary component has evolved to
the middle of the main-sequence band and is slightly cooler than the 1.31 Msun
primary. Yonsai-Yale, BaSTI, and Granada evolutionary models for the observed
metal abundance and a 'normal' He content of Y = 0.25-0.26, marginally
reproduce the components at ages between 1.8 and 2.1 Gyr. All such models are,
however, systematically about 200 K hotter than observed and predict ages for
the more massive component, which are systematically higher than for the less
massive component. These trends can not be removed by adjusting the amount of
core overshoot or envelope convection level, or by including rotation in the
model calculations. They may be due to proximity effects in V1130 Tau, but on
the other hand, we find excellent agreement for 2.5-2.8 Gyr Granada models with
a slightly lower Y of 0.23-0.24. V1130 Tau is a valuable addition to the very
few well-studied 1-2 Msun binaries with component(s) in the upper half of the
main-sequence band, or beyond. The stars are not evolved enough to provide new
information on the dependence of core overshoot on mass (and abundance), but
might - together with a larger sample of well-detached systems - be useful for
further tuning of the helium enrichment law.
