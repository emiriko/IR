The cooling dynamics of glass-embedded noble metal nanoparticles with
diameters ranging from 4 to 26 nm were studied using ultrafast pump-probe
spectroscopy. Measurements were performed probing away from the surface plasmon
resonance of the nanoparticles to avoid spurious effects due to glass heating
around the particle. In these conditions, the time-domain data reflect the
cooling kinetics of the nanoparticle. Cooling dynamics are shown to be
controlled by both thermal resistance at the nanoparticule?glass interface, and
heat diffusion in the glass matrix. Moreover, the interface conductances are
deduced from the experiments and found to be correlated to the acoustic
impedance mismatch at the metal/glass interface.
