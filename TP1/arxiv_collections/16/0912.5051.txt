The AKARI All-Sky Survey provided the first bright point source catalog
detected at 90um. Starting from this catalog, we selected galaxies by matching
AKARI sources with those in the IRAS PSCz. Next, we have measured total GALEX
FUV and NUV flux densities. Then, we have matched this sample with SDSS and
2MASS galaxies. By this procedure, we obtained the final sample which consists
of 607 galaxies. If we sort the sample with respect to 90um, their average SED
shows a coherent trend: the more luminous at 90um, the redder the global SED
becomes. The M_r--NUV-r color-magnitude relation of our sample does not show
bimodality, and the distribution is centered on the green valley between the
blue cloud and red sequence seen in optical surveys. We have established
formulae to convert FIR luminosity from AKARI bands to the total infrared (IR)
luminosity L_TIR. With these formulae, we calculated the star formation
directly visible with FUV and hidden by dust. The luminosity related to star
formation activity (L_SF) is dominated by L_TIR even if we take into account
the far-infrared (FIR) emission from dust heated by old stars. At high star
formation rate (SFR) (> 20 Msun yr^-1), the fraction of directly visible SFR,
SFR_FUV, decreases. We also estimated the FUV attenuation A_FUV from
FUV-to-total IR (TIR) luminosity ratio. We also examined the L_TIR/L_FUV-UV
slope (FUV- NUV) relation. The majority of the sample has L_TIR/L_FUV ratios 5
to 10 times lower than expected from the local starburst relation, while some
LIRGs and all the ULIRGs of this sample have higher L_TIR/L_FUV ratios. We
found that the attenuation indicator L_TIR/L_FUV is correlated to the stellar
mass of galaxies, M*, but there is no correlation with specific SFR (SSFR),
SFR/M*, and dust attenuation L_TIR/L_FUV. (abridged)
