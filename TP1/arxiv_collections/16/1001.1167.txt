We show that certain statements related to the Fourier-Walsh expansion of
functions with respect to a biased measure on the discrete cube can be deduced
from the respective results for the uniform measure by a simple reduction. In
particular, we present simple generalizations to the biased measure $\mu_p$ of
the Bonami-Beckner hypercontractive inequality, and of Talagrand's lower bound
on the size of the boundary of subsets of the discrete cube. Our
generalizations are tight up to constant factors.
