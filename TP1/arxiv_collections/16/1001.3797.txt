The Jordan algebra structure of the bounded real quantum observables was
recognized already in the early days of quantum mechanics. While there are
plausible reasons for most parts of this structure, the existence of the
distributive nonassociative multiplication operation is hard to justify from a
physical or statistical point of view. Considering the non-Boolean extension of
classical probabilities, presented in a recent paper, it is shown in this paper
that such a multiplication operation can be derived from certain properties of
the conditional probabilities and the observables, i.e., from postulates with a
clear statistical interpretation. The well-known close relation between Jordan
operator algebras and C*-algebras then provides the connection to the
quantum-mechanical Hilbert space formalism, thus resulting in a novel axiomatic
approach to general quantum mechanics that includes the types II and III von
Neumann algebras.
