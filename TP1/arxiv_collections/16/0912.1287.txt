We propose an analytical method for understanding the problem of
multi-channel electron transfer reaction in solution, modeled by a particle
undergoing diffusive motion under the influence of one donor and several
acceptor potentials. The coupling between the donor potential and acceptor
potentials are assumed to be represented by Dirac Delta functions. The
diffusive motion in this paper is represented by the Smoluchowski equation. Our
solution requires the knowledge of the Laplace transform of the Green's
function for the motion in all the uncoupled potentials.
