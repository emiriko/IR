We consider the superconducting state of $d+s$ symmetry with finite
concentration of Anderson impurities in the limit $\Delta_s/\Delta_d \ll 1$.
The model consists of a BCS-like term in the Hamiltonian and the Anderson
impurity treated in the self-consistent large-$N$ mean field approximation.
  Increasing impurity concentration or lowering the ratio $\Delta_s/\Delta_d$
drives the system through a transition from a state with two sharp peaks at low
energies and exponentially small density of states at the Fermi level to one
with $N(0) \simeq (\Delta_s/\Delta_d)^2$. This transition is discontinuous if
the energy of the impurity resonance is the smallest energy scale in the
problem.
