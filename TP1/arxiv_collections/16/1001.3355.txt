Modern Internet services, such as those at Google, Yahoo!, and Amazon, handle
billions of requests per day on clusters of thousands of computers. Because
these services operate under strict performance requirements, a statistical
understanding of their performance is of great practical interest. Such
services are modeled by networks of queues, where each queue models one of the
computers in the system. A key challenge is that the data are incomplete,
because recording detailed information about every request to a heavily used
system can require unacceptable overhead. In this paper we develop a Bayesian
perspective on queueing models in which the arrival and departure times that
are not observed are treated as latent variables. Underlying this viewpoint is
the observation that a queueing model defines a deterministic transformation
between the data and a set of independent variables called the service times.
With this viewpoint in hand, we sample from the posterior distribution over
missing data and model parameters using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We evaluate
our framework on data from a benchmark Web application. We also present a
simple technique for selection among nested queueing models. We are unaware of
any previous work that considers inference in networks of queues in the
presence of missing data.
