We have studied the soliton propagation through a segment containing random
point-like scatterers. In the limit of small concentration of scatterers when
the mean distance between the scatterers is larger than the soliton width, a
method has been developed for obtaining the statistical characteristics of the
soliton transmission through the segment. The method is applicable for any
classical particle transferring through a disordered segment with the given
velocity transformation after each act of scattering. In the case of weak
scattering and relatively short disordered segment, the transmission time delay
of a fast soliton is mostly determined by the shifts of the soliton center
after each act of scattering. For sufficiently long segments the main
contribution to the delay is due to the shifts of the amplitude and velocity of
a fast soliton after each scatterer. Corresponding crossover lengths for both
cases of light and heavy solitons have been obtained. We have also calculated
the exact probability density function of the soliton transmission time delay
for a sufficiently long segment. In the case of weak identical scatterers it is
a universal function which depends on a sole parameter - mean number of
scatterers in a segment.
