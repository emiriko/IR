An attempt is made to explain the recently reported occurrence of ultradense
deuterium as an isothermal transition of Rydberg matter into a high density
phase by quantum mechanical exchange forces. It is conjectured that the
transition is made possible by the formation of vortices in a Cooper pair
electron fluid, separating the electrons from the deuterons, with the deuterons
undergoing Bose-Einstein condensation in the core of the vortices. If such a
state of deuterium should exist at the reported density of about 100,000 g/cm3,
it would greatly facility the ignition of a thermonuclear detonation wave in
pure deuterium, by placing the deuterium in a thin disc, to be ignited by a
pulsed ultrafast laser or particle beam of modest energy.
