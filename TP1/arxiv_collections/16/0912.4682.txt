We study the dynamical evolution of globular clusters containing primordial
binaries, including full single and binary stellar evolution using our Monte
Carlo cluster evolution code updated with an adaptation of the single and
binary stellar evolution codes SSE/BSE from Hurley et. al (2000, 2002). We
describe the modifications we have made to the code. We present several test
calculations and comparisons with existing studies to illustrate the validity
of the code. We show that our code finds very good agreement with direct N-body
simulations including primordial binaries and stellar evolution. We find
significant differences in the evolution of the global properties of the
simulated clusters using stellar evolution compared to simulations without any
stellar evolution. In particular, we find that the mass loss from stellar
evolution acts as a significant energy production channel simply by reducing
the total gravitational binding energy and can significantly prolong the
initial core contraction phase before reaching the binary-burning quasi steady
state of the cluster evolution as noticed in Paper IV. We simulate a large grid
of clusters varying the initial cluster mass, binary fraction, and
concentration and compare properties of the simulated clusters with those of
the observed Galactic globular clusters (GGCs). We find that our simulated
cluster properties agree well with the observed GGC properties. We explore in
some detail qualitatively different clusters in different phases of their
evolution, and construct synthetic Hertzprung-Russell diagrams for these
clusters.
