We believe that a recent, unconventional theoretical work published in
Physical Review Letters 103, 113601 (2009) by Sekatsky, Brunner, Branciard,
Gisin, Simon, albeit appealing at fist sight, is highly questionable.
Furthermore, the criticism raised by these Authors against a real experiment on
Micro - Macro entanglement recently published in Physical Review Letters (100,
253601, 2008) is found misleading and to miss its target.
