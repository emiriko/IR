High field electron spin resonance, nuclear magnetic resonance and
magnetization studies addressing the ground state of the quasi two-dimensional
spin-1/2 honeycomb lattice compound InCu{2/3}V{1/3}O{3} are reported.
Uncorrelated finite size structural domains occurring in the honeycomb planes
are expected to inhibit long range magnetic order. Surprisingly, ESR data
reveal the development of two collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) sublattices
below ~ 20 K whereas NMR results show the presence of the staggered internal
field. Magnetization data evidence a spin reorientation transition at ~ 5.7 T.
Quantum Monte-Carlo calculations show that switching on the coupling between
the honeycomb spin planes in a finite size cluster yields a Neel-like AFM spin
structure with a substantial staggered magnetization at finite temperatures.
This may explain the occurrence of a robust AFM state in InCu{2/3}V{1/3}O{3}
despite an unfavorable effect of structural disorder.
