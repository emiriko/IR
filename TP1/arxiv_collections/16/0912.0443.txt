The Higgs boson is the most important, though yet undiscovered ingredient of
the standard model of particle physics. Its detection is therefore one of the
most important goals of high energy physics that can guide future research in
theoretical physics. Enormous efforts have been undertaken to prove the
existence of the Higgs boson, and the physics community is excitedly awaiting
the restart of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. But how sure can we be that
the Higgs exits at all? The German philosopher Immanuel Kant recommended
betting at such controversial questions, and Stephen Hawking announced a $100
bet against the Higgs. But seriously, online prediction markets, which are a
generalized form of betting, do provide the best possible probability estimates
for future events. It is proposed that the scientific community uses this
platforms for evaluation. See also an online description
