The paper deals with the complete classification of a subclass of complex
filiform Leibniz algebras in dimensions 5 and 6. This subclass arises from the
naturally graded filiform Lie algebras. We give a complete list of algebras. In
parametric families cases, the corresponding orbit functions (invariants) are
given. In discrete orbits case, we show a representative of the orbits.
