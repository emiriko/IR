The behavior of orbits in charged-particle beam transport systems, including
both linear and circular accelerators as well as final focus sections and
spectrometers, can depend sensitively on nonlinear fringe-field and
high-order-multipole effects in the various beam-line elements. The inclusion
of these effects requires a detailed and realistic model of the interior and
fringe fields, including their high spatial derivatives. A collection of
surface fitting methods has been developed for extracting this information
accurately from 3-dimensional field data on a grid, as provided by various
3-dimensional finite-element field codes. Based on these realistic field
models, Lie or other methods may be used to compute accurate design orbits and
accurate transfer maps about these orbits. Part I of this work presents a
treatment of straight-axis magnetic elements, while Part II will treat bending
dipoles with large sagitta. An exactly-soluble but numerically challenging
model field is used to provide a rigorous collection of performance benchmarks.
