  This paper describes the Planck Low Frequency Instrument tuning activities
performed through the ground test campaigns, from Unit to Satellite Levels.
Tuning is key to achieve the best possible instrument performance and tuning
parameters strongly depend on thermal and electrical conditions. For this
reason tuning has been repeated several times during ground tests and it has
been repeated in flight before starting nominal operations. The paper discusses
the tuning philosophy, the activities and the obtained results, highlighting
developments and changes occurred during test campaigns. The paper concludes
with an overview of tuning performed during the satellite cryogenic test
campaign (Summer 2008) and of the plans for the just started in-flight
calibration.
