The continuum-discretized coupled-channels (CDCC) method is used to study the
breakup of weakly-bound nuclei at intermediate energies collisions. For large
impact parameters, the Eikonal CDCC (E-CDCC) method was applied. The effects of
Lorentz contraction on the nuclear and Coulomb potentials have been
investigated in details. Such effects tend to increase cross sections
appreciably. We also show that, for loosely-bound nuclei, the contribution of
the so-called close field is small and can be neglected.
