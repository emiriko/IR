Some times ago, a Lagrangian density has been proposed by the author where
only the local symmetries of the Lorentz subgroup of (A)ds group is retained.
This formalism has been found to produce some results encompassing that of
standard Einstein-Hilbert formalism. In the present article, the conserved
axial vector matter currents, constructed in some earlier paper, have been
found to be a result of Noether's theorem.
