We derive the transport equations of quark-gluon plasma in the quasi-linear
approximation. The equations are either of the Balescu-Lenard or Fokker-Planck
form. The plasma's dynamics is assumed to be governed by longitudinal
chromoelectric fields. The isotropic plasma, which is stable, and the
two-stream system, which is unstable, are considered in detail. A process of
equilibration is briefly discussed in both cases. The peaks of the two-stream
distribution are shown to rapidly dissolve in time.
