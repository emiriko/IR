The Parkes Pulsar Timing Array project aims to make a direct detection of a
gravitational-wave background through timing of millisecond pulsars. In this
article, the main requirements for that endeavour are described and recent and
ongoing progress is outlined. We demonstrate that the timing properties of
millisecond pulsars are adequate and that technological progress is timely to
expect a successful detection of gravitational waves within a decade, or
alternatively to rule out all current predictions for gravitational wave
backgrounds formed by supermassive black-hole mergers.
