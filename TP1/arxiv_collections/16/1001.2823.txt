It has long been a primary objective of cosmology to understand the apparent
isotropy in our universe and to provide a mathematical formulation for its
evolution. A school of thought for its explanation is quiescent cosmology,
which already possesses a mathematical framework, namely the definition of an
Isotropic Singularity, but only for the initial state of the universe. A
complementary framework is necessary in order to also describe possible final
states of the universe. Our new definitions of an Anisotropic Future Endless
Universe and an Anisotropic Future Singularity, whose structure and properties
differ significantly from those of the Isotropic Singularity, offer a promising
realisation for this framework. The combination of the three definitions
together may then provide the first complete formalisation of the quiescent
cosmology concept.
