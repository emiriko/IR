Contrary to the sequential world, the processes involved in a distributed
system do not necessarily know when a computation is globally finished. This
paper investigates the problem of the detection of the termination of local
computations. We define four types of termination detection: no detection,
detection of the local termination, detection by a distributed observer,
detection of the global termination. We give a complete characterisation
(except in the local termination detection case where a partial one is given)
for each of this termination detection and show that they define a strict
hierarchy. These results emphasise the difference between computability of a
distributed task and termination detection. Furthermore, these
characterisations encompass all standard criteria that are usually formulated :
topological restriction (tree, rings, or triangu- lated networks ...),
topological knowledge (size, diameter ...), and local knowledge to distinguish
nodes (identities, sense of direction). These results are now presented as
corollaries of generalising theorems. As a very special and important case, the
techniques are also applied to the election problem. Though given in the model
of local computations, these results can give qualitative insight for similar
results in other standard models. The necessary conditions involve graphs
covering and quasi-covering; the sufficient conditions (constructive local
computations) are based upon an enumeration algorithm of Mazurkiewicz and a
stable properties detection algorithm of Szymanski, Shi and Prywes.
