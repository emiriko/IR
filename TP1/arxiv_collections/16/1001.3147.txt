We show that the parameter space of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
includes a region where the down-type fermion masses are generated by the
loop-induced couplings to the up-type Higgs doublet. In this region the
down-type Higgs doublet does not acquire a vacuum expectation value at tree
level, and has sizable couplings in the superpotential to the tau leptons and
bottom quarks. Besides a light standard-like Higgs boson, the Higgs spectrum
includes the nearly degenerate states of a heavy spin-0 doublet which can be
produced through their couplings to the $b$ quark and decay predominantly into
\tau^+\tau^- or \tau\nu.
