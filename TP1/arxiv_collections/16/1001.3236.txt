I present an argument, based on the topology of the universe, why there are
three generations of fermions. The argument implies a preferred gauge group of
SU(5), but with SO(10) representations of the fermions. The breaking pattern
SU(5) to SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) is preferred over the pattern SU(5) to SU(4)xU(1). On
the basis of the argument one expects an asymmetry in the early universe
microwave data, which might have been detected already.
