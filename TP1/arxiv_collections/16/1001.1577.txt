Aims. In this work we re-investigated the empirical relation between the hard
X-ray peak flux and the outburst waiting time found previously in the black
hole transient GX 339-4. We tested the relation using the observed hard X-ray
peak flux of the 2007 outburst of GX 339-4, clarified issues about faint
flares, and estimated the lower limit of hard X-ray peak flux for the next
outburst. Methods. We included Swift/BAT data obtained in the past four years.
Together with the CGRO/BATSE and RXTE/HEXTE light curves, the observations used
in this work cover a period of 18 years. Results. The observation of the 2007
outburst confirms the empirical relation discovered before. This strengthens
the apparent link between the mass in the accretion disk and the peak
luminosity of the brightest hard state that the black hole transient can reach.
We also show that faint flares with peak fluxes smaller than about 0.12 crab do
not affect the empirical relation. We predict that the hard X-ray peak flux of
the next outburst should be larger than 0.65 crab, which will make it at least
the second brightest in the hard X-ray since 1991.
