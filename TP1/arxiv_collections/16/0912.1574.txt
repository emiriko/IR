We study weakly disordered quantum wires whose width is large compared to the
Fermi wavelength. It is conjectured that such wires diplay universal metallic
behaviour as long as their length is shorter than the localization length
(which increases with the width). The random matrix theory that accounts for
this behaviour - the DMPK theory- rests on assumptions that are in general not
satisfied by realistic microscopic models. Starting from the Anderson model on
a strip, we show that a twofold scaling limit nevertheless allows to recover
rigorously the fundaments of DMPK theory, thus opening a way to settle some
conjectures on universal metallic behaviour.
