This Letter describes the current most precise measurement of the $W$ boson
pair production cross section and most sensitive test of anomalous $WW\gamma$
and $WWZ$ couplings in $p \bar p$ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96
TeV. The $WW$ candidates are reconstructed from decays containing two charged
leptons and two neutrinos, where the charged leptons are either electrons or
muons. Using data collected by the CDF II detector from 3.6 fb$^{-1}$ of
integrated luminosity, a total of 654 candidate events are observed with an
expected background contribution of $320 \pm 47$ events. The measured total
cross section is $\sigma (p \bar p \to W^+ W^- + X) = 12.1 \pm 0.9
\textrm{(stat)} ^{+1.6}_{-1.4} \textrm{(syst)}$ pb, which is in good agreement
with the standard model prediction. The same data sample is used to place
constraints on anomalous $WW\gamma$ and $WWZ$ couplings.
