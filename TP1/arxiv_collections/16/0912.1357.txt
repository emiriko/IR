The relationship between the "knowledge base" and the "globalization" of
communication systems is discussed from the perspective of communication
theory. I argue that inter-human communication takes place at two levels. At
the first level information is exchanged and provided with meaning and at the
second level meaning can reflexively be communicated. Human language can be
considered as the evolutionary achievement which enables us to use these two
channels of communication simultaneously. Providing meaning from the
perspective of hindsight is a recursive operation: a meaning that makes a
difference can be considered as knowledge. If the production of knowledge is
socially organized, the perspective of hindsight can further be codified. This
adds globalization to the historically stabilized patterns of communications.
Globalization can be expected to transform the communications in an
evolutionary mode. However, the self-organization of a knowledge-based society
remains an expectation with the status of a hypothesis.
