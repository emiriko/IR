We study the vector-vector interaction within the framework of the hidden
gauge formalism for the sector with quantum numbers charm C=0 and strangeness
S=0 in the region around 4000 MeV. We get five poles, three of which could be
identified with the Y(3940), Z(3930) and X(4160). These poles appear with
quantum numbers I=0 and $J^{PC}=0^{++},2^{++}$ and $2^{++}$, respectively, and
can be considered as hadronic molecules made of $D^*\bar{D}^*$,
$D_s^*\bar{D}^*_s$.
