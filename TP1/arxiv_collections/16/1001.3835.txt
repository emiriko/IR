The SM predictions for CP violating effects in D meson systems are highly
suppressed at the per mill level. Therefore, any experimental evidence for a
sizable CP violation in D0-D0bar mixing would unambiguously point towards a New
Physics (NP) signal. Within supersymmetric scenarios, the popular alignment
models can naturally account for large, non-standard effects in D0-D0bar
mixing. We demonstrate that, within alignment models, detectable CP violating
effects in D0-D0bar mixing would unambiguously imply a lower bound for the
electric dipole moment (EDM) of hadronic systems, like the neutron EDM and the
mercury EDM, in the reach of future experimental sensitivities. The
simultaneous evidence of CP violation in D meson systems together with non
vanishing hadronic EDMs would strongly support the idea of SUSY alignment
models and disfavour gauge-mediated SUSY breaking models, SUSY models with MFV
and non-Abelian SUSY flavour models. As a byproduct of our analysis, we study
the correlation between the time dependent CP asymmetry in decays to CP
eigenstates S_f and the semileptonic asymmetry a_SL both model independently
and in SUSY alignment models.
