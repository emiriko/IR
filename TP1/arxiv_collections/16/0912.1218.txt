We find that the tree-level predictions of the forward-backward production
asymmetries on the Z resonance for b and c quarks, A_FB, in an SO(5) x U(1)
gauge-Higgs unification model are markedly close to the central values of the
Particle Data Group data unlike the standard model. The decay width of Z boson
is evaluated and the S and T parameters are discussed.
