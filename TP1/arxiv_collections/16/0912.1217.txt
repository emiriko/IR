Quantum walks play an important role in the area of quantum algorithms. Many
interesting problems can be reduced to searching marked states in a quantum
Markov chain. In this context, the notion of quantum hitting time is very
important, because it quantifies the running time of the algorithms. Markov
chain-based algorithms are probabilistic, therefore the calculation of the
success probability is also required in the analysis of the computational
complexity. Using Szegedy's definition of quantum hitting time, which is a
natural extension of the definition of the classical hitting time, we present
analytical expressions for the hitting time and success probability of the
quantum walk on the complete graph.
