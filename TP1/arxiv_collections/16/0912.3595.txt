The problem of DNA-DNA interaction mediated by divalent counterions is
studied using computer simulation. Although divalent counterions cannot
condense free DNA molecules in solution, we show that if DNA configurational
entropy is restricted, divalent counterions can cause DNA reentrant
condensation similar to that caused by tri- or tetra-valent counterions.
DNA-DNA interaction is strongly repulsive at small or large counterion
concentration and is negligible or slightly attractive for a concentration in
between. Implications of our results to experiments of DNA ejection from
bacteriophages are discussed. The quantitative result serves to understand
electrostatic effects in other experiments involving DNA and divalent
counterions.
