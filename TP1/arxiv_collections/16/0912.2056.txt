I outline a possible logical path from the formulation of physics of
classical mechanics to "abstract" systems like cellular automata. The goal of
this article is that of illustrating why physicists often study extremely
simplified models, instead of just numerically integrating the fundamental
equations of physics. This exposition is obviously only partial and based on my
expertise and my interests.
