Infrared-Faint Radio Sources (IFRSs) are a class of radio objects found in
the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS) which have no observable
mid-infrared counterpart in the Spitzer Wide-area Infrared Extragalactic
(SWIRE) survey. The extended Chandra Deep Field South now has even deeper
Spitzer imaging (3.6 to 70 micron) from a number of Legacy surveys. We report
the detections of two IFRS sources in IRAC images. The non-detection of two
other IFRSs allows us to constrain the source type. Detailed modeling of the
SED of these objects shows that they are consistent with high redshift (z > 1)
AGN.
