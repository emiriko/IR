Quarkonia and B-Physics are among the first areas to be investigated with the
first data collected by ATLAS. The ATLAS detector at CERN's LHC is preparing to
take data from proton-proton collisions expected to start by the end of 2009.
Investigation of the decay of B-hadrons represents a complementary approach to
direct searches for Physics beyond the Standard Model. Early B-physics data
will provide valuable information on the detector performance, as well as allow
calibration studies in support of new Physics searches. Meaningful quarkonia
studies performed with early data are expected to have the reach to make
authoritative statements about the underlying production mechanism and provide
cross-sections in this new energy regime. We review various aspects of prompt
quarkonium production at the LHC: the accessible ranges in transverse momentum
and pseudo-rapidity, spin alignment of vector states, separation of color octet
and color singlet production mechanism and feasibility of observing radiative
chi_c decays
