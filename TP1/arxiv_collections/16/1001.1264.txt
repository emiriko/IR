A recently developed formulation for treating two- and three-nucleon bound
states in a three-dimensional formulation based on spin-momentum operators is
extended to nucleon-nucleon scattering. Here the nucleon-nucleon t-matrix is
represented by six spin-momentum operators accompanied by six scalar functions
of momentum vectors. We present the formulation and provide numerical examples
for the deuteron and nucleon-nucleon scattering observables. A comparison to
results from a standard partial wave decomposition establishes the reliability
of this new formulation.
