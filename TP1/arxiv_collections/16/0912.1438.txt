We show that a topological investigation of the phase space of a
Semiconductor Ring Laser can be used to devise switching schemes which are
alternative to optical pulse injection of counter-propagating light. To provide
physical insight in these switching mechanisms, a full bifurcation analysis and
an investigation of the topology is performed on a two-dimensional asymptotic
model. Numerical simulations confirm the topological predictions.
