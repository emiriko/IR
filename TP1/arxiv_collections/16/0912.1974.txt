Direct coupling between a transport solver and local, nonlinear gyrokinetic
calculations using the multiscale gyrokinetic code TRINITY [M. Barnes, Ph.D.
thesis, arxiv:0901.2868] is described. The coupling of the microscopic and
macroscopic physics is done within the framework of multiscale gyrokinetic
theory, of which we present the assumptions and key results. An assumption of
scale separation in space and time allows for the simulation of turbulence in
small regions of the space-time grid, which are embedded in a coarse grid on
which the transport equations are implicitly evolved. This leads to a reduction
in computational expense of several orders of magnitude, making
first-principles simulations of the full fusion device volume over the
confinement time feasible on current computing resources. Numerical results
from TRINITY simulations are presented and compared with experimental data from
JET and ASDEX Upgrade plasmas.
