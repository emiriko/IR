We suggest and demonstrate a novel source of two-photon multipartite
entangled states which exploits the transverse spatial structure of spontaneous
parametric downconversion together with a programmable spatial light modulator
(SLM). The 1D SLM is used to perform polarization entanglement purification and
to realize arbitrary phase-gates between polarization and momentum degrees of
freedom of photons. We experimentally demonstrate our scheme by generating
two-photon three qubit linear cluster states with high fidelity using a diode
laser pump with a limited coherence time and power on the crystal as low as
2.5$mW.
