We have combined the large SN Ia database of the Canada-France-Hawaii
Telescope Supernova Legacy Survey and catalogs of galaxies with photometric
redshifts, VLA 1.4 GHz radio sources, and Spitzer infrared sources. We present
eight SNe Ia in early-type host galaxies which have counterparts in the radio
and infrared source catalogs. We find the SN Ia rate in subsets of radio and
infrared early-type galaxies is ~1-5 times the rate in all early-type galaxies,
and that any enhancement is always <~ 2 sigma. Rates in these subsets are
consistent with predictions of the two component "A+B" SN Ia rate model. Since
infrared properties of radio SN Ia hosts indicate dust obscured star formation,
we incorporate infrared star formation rates into the "A+B" model. We also show
the properties of SNe Ia in radio and infrared galaxies suggest the hosts
contain dust and support a continuum of delay time distributions for SNe Ia,
although other delay time distributions cannot be ruled out based on our data.
