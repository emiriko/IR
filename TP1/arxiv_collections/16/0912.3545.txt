We present an analysis of Spitzer IRS spectroscopy of 83 active galaxies from
the extended 12 micron sample. We find rank correlations between several
tracers of star formation which suggest that (1) the PAH feature is a reliable
tracer of star formation, (2) there is a significant contribution to the
heating of the cool dust by stars, (3) the H$_2$ emission is also primarily
excited by star formation. The 55-90 vs. 20-30 spectral index plot is also a
diagnostic of the relative contribution of Starburst to AGN. We see there is a
large change in spectral index across the sample. Thus, the contribution to the
IR spectrum from the AGN and starburst components can be comparable in
magnitude but the relative contribution also varies widely across the sample.
We find rank correlations between several AGN tracers. We search for
correlations between AGN and Starburst tracers and we conclude that the AGN and
Starburst tracers are not correlated. This is consistent with our conclusion
that the relative strength of the AGN and Starburst components varies widely
across the sample. Thus, there is no simple link between AGN fueling and Black
Hole Growth and star formation in these galaxies. The distribution of Sil 10
micron and 18 micron strengths is consistent with the clumpy torus models of
Sirocky et al. We find a rank correlation between the [NeV] 14 micron line and
the 6.7 micron continuum which may be due to an extended component of hot dust.
The Sy 2s with a Hidden Broad Line Region (HBLR) have a higher ratio of AGN to
Starburst contribution to the SED than Sy 2s without an HBLR. This may
contribute to the detection of the HBLR in polarized light. The Sy 2s with an
HBLR are more similar to the Sy 1s than they are to the Sy 2s without an HBLR.
