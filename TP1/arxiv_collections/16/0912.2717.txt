We briefly review the properties of radially growing interfaces and their
connection to biological growth. We focus on simplified models which result
from the abstraction of only considering domain growth and not the interface
curvature. Linear equations can be exactly solved and the phenomenology of
growth can be inferred from the explicit solutions. Nonlinear equations pose
interesting open questions that are summarized herein.
