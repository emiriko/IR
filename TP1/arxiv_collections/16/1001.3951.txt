After extensively reviewing general relativistic gravitomagnetism, both
historically and phenomenologically, we review in detail the so-called magnetic
components of gravitational waves (GWs), which have to be taken into account in
the context of the total response functions of interferometers for GWs
propagating from arbitrary directions. Following the more recent approaches of
this important issue, the analysis of such magnetic components will be reviewed
in both of standard General Theory of Relativity (GTR) and Scalar Tensor
Gravity. Thus, we show in detail that such a magnetic component becomes
particularly important in the high-frequency portion of the range of ground
based interferometers for GWs which arises from the two different theories of
gravity. Our reviewed results show that if one neglects the magnetic
contribution to the gravitational field of a GW, approximately 15% of the
potential observable signal could, in principle, be lost.
