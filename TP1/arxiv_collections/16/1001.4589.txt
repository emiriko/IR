The Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) is an array of pseudo-correlation
radiometers on board the Planck satellite, the ESA mission dedicated to
precision measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background. The LFI covers three
bands centred at 30, 44 and 70 GHz, with a goal bandwidth of 20% of the central
frequency.
  The characterization of the broadband frequency response of each radiometer
is necessary to understand and correct for systematic effects, particularly
those related to foreground residuals and polarization measurements. In this
paper we present the measured band shape of all the LFI channels and discuss
the methods adopted for their estimation. The spectral characterization of each
radiometer was obtained by combining the measured spectral response of
individual units through a dedicated RF model of the LFI receiver scheme.
  As a consistency check, we also attempted end-to-end spectral measurements of
the integrated radiometer chain in a cryogenic chamber. However, due to
systematic effects in the measurement setup, only qualitative results were
obtained from these tests. The measured LFI bandpasses exhibit a moderate level
of ripple, compatible with the instrument scientific requirements.
