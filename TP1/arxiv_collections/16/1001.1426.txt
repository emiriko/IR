The CoRoT satellite exoplanetary team announces its sixth transiting planet
in this paper. We describe and discuss the satellite observations as well as
the complementary ground-based observations - photometric and spectroscopic -
carried out to assess the planetary nature of the object and determine its
specific physical parameters. The discovery reported here is a `hot Jupiter'
planet in an 8.9d orbit, 18 stellar radii, or 0.08 AU, away from its primary
star, which is a solar-type star (F9V) with an estimated age of 3.0 Gyr. The
planet mass is close to 3 times that of Jupiter. The star has a metallicity of
0.2 dex lower than the Sun, and a relatively high $^7$Li abundance. While

no sign of activity spectroscopically in e.g., the [Ca ] H&K lines.
