We investigate proton rapidity correlations for a fireball that fragments due
to non-equilibrium effects at the phase transition from deconfined to hadronic
phase. Such effects include spinodal fragmentation in case of first order phase
transition at lower collision energies, and cavitation due to sudden rise of
the bulk viscosity at the crossover probed at RHIC and the LHC. Our study is
performed on samples of Monte Carlo events. Correlation function in relative
rapidity appears to be a sensitive probe of fragmentation. We show that
resonance decays make the strength of the correlation even stronger.
