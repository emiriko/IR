In the present work we explore electron transport properties through a
quantum interferometer attached symmetrically to two one-dimensional
semi-infinite metallic electrodes, namely, source and drain. The interferometer
is made up of two sub-rings where individual sub-rings are penetrated by
Aharonov-Bohm fluxes $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$, respectively. We adopt a simple
tight-binding framework to describe the model and all the calculations are done
based on the single particle Green's function formalism. Our exact numerical
calculations describe two-terminal conductance and current as functions of
interferometer-to-electrode coupling strength, magnetic fluxes threaded by left
and right sub-rings of the interferometer and the difference of these two
fluxes. Our theoretical results provide several interesting features of
electron transport across the interferometer, and these aspects may be utilized
to study electron transport in Aharonov-Bohm geometries.
