When my "Handbook of Integer Sequences" came out in 1973, Philip Morrison
gave it an enthusiastic review in the Scientific American and Martin Gardner
was kind enough to say in his Mathematical Games column that "every
recreational mathematician should buy a copy forthwith." That book contained
2372 sequences. Today the "On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences" contains
117000 sequences. This paper will describe seven that I find especially
interesting. These are the EKG sequence, Gijswijt's sequence, a numerical
analog of Aronson's sequence, approximate squaring, the integrality of n-th
roots of generating functions, dissections, and the kissing number problem.
