The classical statistics of turbulence are shown to be not specific to
turbulence and can be derived from a solution for recurring unsteady state
viscous flow. Care must be exercised in using them to make deductions about
turbulence structures and mechanisms. The conditionally averaged statistics,
particularly involving the velocities of the ejections in the burst phase, are
more distinctive of turbulence.
