The multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz is applied to the study of
boundary critical phenomena. We compute averages of local operators as a
function of the distance from the boundary and the surface contribution to the
ground state energy. Furthermore, assuming a uniform tensor structure, we show
that the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz implies an exact
relation between bulk and boundary critical exponents known to exist for
boundary critical systems.
