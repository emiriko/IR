We report 29Si-NMR study on a single crystal of the heavy-fermion
superconductor CeIrSi3 without an inversion symmetry along the c-axis. The
29Si-Knight shift measurements under pressure have revealed that the spin
susceptibility for the ab-plane decreases slightly below Tc, whereas along the
c-axis it does not change at all. The result can be accounted for by the spin
susceptibility in the superconducting state being dominated by the strong
antisymmetric (Rashba-type) spin-orbit interaction that originates from the
absence of an inversion center along the c-axis and it being much larger than
superconducting condensation energy. This is the first observation which
exhibits an anisotropy of the spin susceptibility below Tc in the
noncentrosymmetric superconductor dominated by strong Rashba-type spin-orbit
interaction.
