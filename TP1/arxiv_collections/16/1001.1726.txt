The purpose of the work presented is the calibration of a lamp filament of
tungsten was from electrical measurements that are simple and precise, and for
determining the temperature of tungsten against the current intensity value
crossing the lamp.These data are then used to calibrate the lamp in terms of
luminance directly used to calibrate sensors such as optical pyrometers or
other photometric sensor.
