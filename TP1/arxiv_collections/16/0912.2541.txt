We compare the trace anomaly, strangeness and baryon number fluctuations
calculated in lattice QCD with expectations based on hadron resonance gas
model. We find that there is a significant discrepancy between the hadron
resonance gas and the lattice data. This discrepancy is largely reduced if the
hadron spectrum is modified to take into account the larger values of the quark
mass used in lattice calculations as well as the finite lattice spacing errors.
We also give a simple parametrization of QCD equation of state, which combines
hadron resonance gas at low temperatures with lattice QCD at high temperatures.
We compare this parametrization with other parametrizations of the equation of
state used in hydrodynamical models and discuss differences in hydrodynamic
flow for different equations of state.
