Consider a flock of birds that fly interacting between them. The interactions
are modelled through a hierarchical system in which each bird, at each time
step, adjusts its own velocity according to his past velocity and a weighted
mean of the relative velocities of its superiors in the hierarchy. We consider
the additional fact, that each of the birds can fail to see any of its
superiors with certain probability, that can depend on the distances between
them. For this model with random interactions we prove that the flocking
phenomena, obtained for similar deterministic models, holds true.
