Diverse analysis approaches have been proposed to distinguish data missing
due to death from nonresponse, and to summarize trajectories of longitudinal
data truncated by death. We demonstrate how these analysis approaches arise
from factorizations of the distribution of longitudinal data and survival
information. Models are illustrated using cognitive functioning data for older
adults. For unconditional models, deaths do not occur, deaths are independent
of the longitudinal response, or the unconditional longitudinal response is
averaged over the survival distribution. Unconditional models, such as random
effects models fit to unbalanced data, may implicitly impute data beyond the
time of death. Fully conditional models stratify the longitudinal response
trajectory by time of death. Fully conditional models are effective for
describing individual trajectories, in terms of either aging (age, or years
from baseline) or dying (years from death). Causal models (principal
stratification) as currently applied are fully conditional models, since group
differences at one timepoint are described for a cohort that will survive past
a later timepoint. Partly conditional models summarize the longitudinal
response in the dynamic cohort of survivors. Partly conditional models are
serial cross-sectional snapshots of the response, reflecting the average
response in survivors at a given timepoint rather than individual trajectories.
Joint models of survival and longitudinal response describe the evolving health
status of the entire cohort. Researchers using longitudinal data should
consider which method of accommodating deaths is consistent with research aims,
and use analysis methods accordingly.
