Within a semiclassical description of above-threshold ionization (ATI) we
identify the interplay between intracycle and intercycle interferences. The
former is imprinted as a modulation envelope on the discrete multiphoton peaks
formed by the latter. This allows to unravel the complex interference pattern
observed for the full solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation
(TDSE) in terms of diffraction at a grating in the time domain. These
modulations can be clearly seen in the dependence of the ATI spectra on the
laser wavelength. Shifts in energy modulation result from the effect of the
long Coulomb tail of the atomic potential.
