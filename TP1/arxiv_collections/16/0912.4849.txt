We propose the possibilities of designing nano-scale rectifiers using
mesoscopic rings. A single mesoscopic ring is used for half-wave rectification,
while full-wave rectification is achieved using two such rings and in both
cases each ring is threaded by a time varying magnetic flux $\phi$ which plays
a central role in the rectification action. Within a tight-binding framework,
all the calculations are done based on the Green's function formalism. We
present numerical results for the two-terminal conductance and current which
support the general features of half-wave and full-wave rectifications. The
analysis may be helpful in fabricating mesoscopic or nano-scale rectifiers.
