Clusters generated by the product-rule growth model of Achlioptas, D'Souza,
and Spencer on a two-dimensional square lattice are shown to obey qualitatively
different scaling behavior than standard (random growth) percolation. The
threshold with unrestricted bond placement (allowing loops) is found precisely
using several different criteria based upon both moments and wrapping
probabilities, yielding p_c = 0.526565 +/- 0.000005, consistent with the recent
result of Radicchi and Fortunato. The correlation-length exponent nu is found
to be close to 1. The qualitative difference from regular percolation is shown
dramatically in the behavior of the percolation probability P_(infinity) (size
of largest cluster), the susceptibility, and of the second moment of finite
clusters, where discontinuities appears at the threshold. The critical
cluster-size distribution does not follow a consistent power-law for the range
of system sizes we study L </- 8192) but may approach a power-law with tau > 2
for larger L.
