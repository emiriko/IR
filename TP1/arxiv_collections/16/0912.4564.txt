The middle levels conjecture asserts that there is a Hamiltonian cycle in the
middle two levels of $2k+1$-dimensional hypercube. The conjecture is known to
be true for $k \leq 17$ [I.Shields, B.J.Shields and C.D.Savage, Disc. Math.,
309, 5271--5277 (2009)]. In this note, we verify that the conjecture is also
true for $k=18$ by constructing a Hamiltonian cycle in the middle two levels of
37-dimensional hypercube with the aid of the computer. We achieve this by
introducing a new decomposition technique and an efficient algorithm for
ordering the Narayana objects.
