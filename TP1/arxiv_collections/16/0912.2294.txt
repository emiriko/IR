Today's high-capacity telecommunication systems are unimaginable without the
use of optical fibres and accompanying optical components which are briefly
presented in this paper with an accent on the receivers of optical signal. An
overview of main characteristics of the key elements and the description of the
most popular modulation formats in modern optical systems is shown. Some
achievements and the directions of the further development in this area are
also mentioned.
