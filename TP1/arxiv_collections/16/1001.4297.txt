Automated tracking of animal movement allows analyses that would not
otherwise be possible by providing great quantities of data. The additional
capability of tracking in realtime - with minimal latency - opens up the
experimental possibility of manipulating sensory feedback, thus allowing
detailed explorations of the neural basis for control of behavior. Here we
describe a new system capable of tracking the position and body orientation of
animals such as flies and birds. The system operates with less than 40 msec
latency and can track multiple animals simultaneously. To achieve these
results, a multi target tracking algorithm was developed based on the Extended
Kalman Filter and the Nearest Neighbor Standard Filter data association
algorithm. In one implementation, an eleven camera system is capable of
tracking three flies simultaneously at 60 frames per second using a gigabit
network of nine standard Intel Pentium 4 and Core 2 Duo computers. This
manuscript presents the rationale and details of the algorithms employed and
shows three implementations of the system. An experiment was performed using
the tracking system to measure the effect of visual contrast on the flight
speed of Drosophila melanogaster. At low contrasts, speed is more variable and
faster on average than at high contrasts. Thus, the system is already a useful
tool to study the neurobiology and behavior of freely flying animals. If
combined with other techniques, such as `virtual reality'-type computer
graphics or genetic manipulation, the tracking system would offer a powerful
new way to investigate the biology of flying animals.
