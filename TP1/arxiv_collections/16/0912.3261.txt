A phase transition describes the sudden change of state in a physical system,
such as the transition between a fluid and a solid. Quantum gases provide the
opportunity to establish a direct link between experiment and generic models
which capture the underlying physics. A fundamental concept to describe the
collective matter-light interaction is the Dicke model which has been predicted
to show an intriguing quantum phase transition. Here we realize the Dicke
quantum phase transition in an open system formed by a Bose-Einstein condensate
coupled to an optical cavity, and observe the emergence of a self-organized
supersolid phase. The phase transition is driven by infinitely long-ranged
interactions between the condensed atoms. These are induced by two-photon
processes involving the cavity mode and a pump field. We show that the phase
transition is described by the Dicke Hamiltonian, including counter-rotating
coupling terms, and that the supersolid phase is associated with a
spontaneously broken spatial symmetry. The boundary of the phase transition is
mapped out in quantitative agreement with the Dicke model. The work opens the
field of quantum gases with long-ranged interactions, and provides access to
novel quantum phases.
