We define the total curvature of a semialgebraic embedding of a graph in the
3-dimensional Euclidean space. We prove that it satisfies a Chern-Lashof type
inequality and we describe when the equality holds. We also prove a
generalization of a classical result of Fary and Milnor stating that certain
graphs cannot be knotted if they are not too curved. The techniques employed
are Morse theoretic.
