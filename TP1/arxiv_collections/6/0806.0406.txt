Knot theory is the study of isotopy classes of embeddings of the circle $S^1$
into a 3-manifold, specifically $R^3$. The F\'ary-Milnor Theorem says that any
curve in $R^3$ of total curvature less than $4\pi$ is unknotted. More
generally, a (finite) graph consists of a finite number of edges and vertices.
Given a topological type of graphs $\Gamma$, what limitations on the isotopy
class of $\Gamma$ are implied by a bound on total curvature? What does ``total
curvature" mean for a graph? We define a natural notion of net total curvature
of a graph $\Gamma$ in $R^3$, and prove that if $\Gamma$ is homeomorphic to the
$\theta$-graph, then the net total curvature of $\Gamma$ \geq 3\pi$; and if it
is $< 4\pi$, then $\Gamma$ is isotopic in $R^3$ to a planar $\theta$-graph.
Further, the net total curvature $= 3\pi$ only when $\Gamma$ is a convex plane
curve plus a chord. We begin our discussion with piecewise smooth graphs, and
extend all these results to continuous graphs in the final section. In
particular, we show that continuous graphs of finite total curvature are
isotopic to polygonal graphs.
