We present results from a detailed experimental investigation of LaFeAsO, the
parent material in the series of "FeAs" based oxypnictide superconductors. Upon
cooling this material undergoes a tetragonal-orthorhombic crystallographic
phase transition at ~160 K followed closely by an antiferromagnetic ordering
near 145 K. Analysis of these phase transitions using temperature dependent
powder X-ray and neutron diffraction measurements is presented. A magnetic
moment of ~0.35 Bohr magnetons per iron is derived from Mossbauer spectra in
the low temperature phase. Evidence of the structural transition is observed at
temperatures well above the structural transition (up to near 200 K) in the
diffraction data as well as the polycrystalline elastic moduli probed by
resonant ultrasound spectroscopy measurements. The effects of the two phase
transitions on the transport properties (resistivity, thermal conductivity,
Seebeck coefficient, Hall coefficient), heat capacity, and magnetization of
LaFeAsO are also reported, including a dramatic increase in the magnitude of
the Hall coefficient below 160 K. The results suggest that the structural
distortion leads to a localization of carriers on Fe, producing small local
magnetic moments which subsequently order antiferromagnetically upon further
cooling. Evidence of strong electron-phonon interactions in the
high-temperature tetragonal phase is also observed.
