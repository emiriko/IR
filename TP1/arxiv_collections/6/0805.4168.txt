We study the passage (translocation) of a self-avoiding polymer through a
membrane pore in two dimensions. In particular, we numerically measure the
probability distribution Q(T) of the translocation time T, and the distribution
P(s,t) of the translocation coordinate s at various times t. When scaled with
the mean translocation time <T>, Q(T) becomes independent of polymer length,
and decays exponentially for large T. The probability P(s,t) is well described
by a Gaussian at short times, with a variance that grows sub-diffusively as
t^{\alpha} with \alpha~0.8. For times exceeding <T>, P(s,t) of the polymers
that have not yet finished their translocation has a non-trivial stable shape.
