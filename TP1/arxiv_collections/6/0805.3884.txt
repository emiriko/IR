Resonant Raman spectra (RRS) of O-H and O-D vibration and libration modes,
their combinations and higher harmonics have been observed in LiTaO3
polycrystalline thin films. RRS peaks are superimposed on photoluminescence
(PL) spectrum. Monochromatic light from a xenon lamp is used as excitation
source. PL spectrum shows two broad peaks, first near the band gap in UV
(4.4-4.8eV) and another in the sub band gap region (< 4.0 eV). Band gap PL
along with RRS peaks are reported for the first time. Photoluminescence
excitation spectrum (PLE) shows a peak at 4.8 eV. Peak positions and full width
at half maximum (FWHM) of RRS peaks depend upon the excitation energy.
Dispersions of the fundamental and the third harmonic of the stretching mode of
O-H with excitation energy are about 800 cm-1/eV and 2000 cm-1/eV respectively.
This dispersion is much higher than reported in any other material.
