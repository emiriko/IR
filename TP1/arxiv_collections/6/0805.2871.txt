Measurements of the double-differential charged pion production cross-section
in the range of momentum 100 MeV/c < p < 800 MeV/c and angle 0.35 < \theta <
2.15 rad in proton-beryllium, proton-carbon, proton-aluminium, proton-copper,
proton-tin, proton-tantalum and proton-lead collisions are presented. The data
were taken with the large acceptance HARP detector in the T9 beam line of the
CERN PS. The pions were produced by proton beams in a momentum range from 3
GeV/c to 12.9 GeV/c hitting a target with a thickness of 5% of a nuclear
interaction length.
