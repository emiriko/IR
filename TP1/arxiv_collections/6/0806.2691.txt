Triple donor devices have the potential to exhibit adiabatic tunneling via
the CTAP (Coherent Tunneling Adiabatic Passage) protocol which is a candidate
transport mechanism for scalable quantum computing. We examine theoretically
the statistics of dopant placement using counted ion implantation by employing
an analytical treatment of CTAP transport properties under hydrogenic
assumptions. We determine theoretical device yields for proof of concept
devices for different implant energies. In particular, we determine a
significant theoretical device yield (~80%) for 14keV phosphorus in silicon
with nominal 20nm spacing.
