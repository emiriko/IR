We propose a scheme to implement quantum computation in decoherence-free
subspace with superconducting devices inside a cavity by unconventional
geometric manipulation. Universal single-qubit gates in encoded qubit can be
achieved with cavity assisted interaction. A measurement-based two-qubit
Controlled-Not gate is produced with parity measurements assisted by an
auxiliary superconducting device and followed by prescribed single-qubit gates.
The measurement of currents on two parallel devices can realize a projective
measurement, which is equivalent to the parity measurement on the involved
devices.
