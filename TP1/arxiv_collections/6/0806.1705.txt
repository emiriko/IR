In this paper we look at a special type of discrete subgroups of
$PSL_{n+1}(\Bbb{C})$ called Schottky groups. We develop some basic properties
of these groups and their limit set when $n > 1$, and we prove that Schottky
groups only occur in odd dimensions, {\it i.e.}, they cannot be realized as
subgroups of $PSL_{2n+1}(\Bbb{C})$.
