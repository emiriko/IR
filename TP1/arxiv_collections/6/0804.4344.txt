In this paper we present results illustrating the power and flexibility of
one-bit teleportations in quantum bus computation. We first show a scheme to
perform a universal set of gates on continuous variable modes, which we call a
quantum bus or qubus, using controlled phase-space rotations, homodyne
detection, ancilla qubits and single qubit measurement. The resource usage for
this scheme is lower than any previous scheme to date. We then illustrate how
one-bit teleportations into a qubus can be used to encode qubit states into a
quantum repetition code, which in turn can be used as an efficient method for
producing GHZ states that can be used to create large cluster states. Each of
these schemes can be modified so that teleportation measurements are
post-selected to yield outputs with higher fidelity, without changing the
physical parameters of the system.
