In this paper, we investigate limitations imposed by sequential attacks on
the performance of a differential-phase-shift (DPS) quantum key distribution
(QKD) protocol with weak coherent pulses. Specifically, we analyze a sequential
attack based on optimal unambiguous discrimination of the relative phases
between consecutive signal states emitted by the source. We show that this
attack can provide tighter upper bounds for the security of a DPS QKD scheme
than those derived from sequential attacks where the eavesdropper aims to
identify the state of each signal emitted by the source unambiguously.
