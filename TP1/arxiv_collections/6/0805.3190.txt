In the original BB84 protocol, the bit basis and the phase basis are used
with equal probability. Lo et al (J. of Cryptology, 18, 133-165 (2005))
proposed to modify the ratio between the two bases by increasing the final key
generation rate. However, the optimum ratio has not been derived. In this
letter, in order to examine this problem, the ratio between the two bases is
optimized for exponential constraints given Eve's information
distinguishability and the final error probability.
