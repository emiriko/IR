We investigate the idea of the Higgs doublet as a pseudo-Goldstone boson in
perturbative extensions of the Standard Model, motivated by the desire to
ameliorate its hierarchy problem without conflict with the electroweak
precision data. Two realistic supersymmetric models with global SU(3) symmetry
are proposed, one for large and another for small values of tan\beta. The two
models demonstrate two different mechanisms for EWSB and the Higgs mass
generation. Their experimental signatures are quite different. Our
constructions show that a pseudo-Goldstone Higgs doublet in perturbative
extensions is just as plausible as in non-perturbative ones.
