We calculate the contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of leptons in
the type-I and type-III seesaw models. We show that, even if the scale of the
new physics is pushed down to the electroweak scale, this contribution is not
large enough to explain the measured discrepancy of the muon anomalous magnetic
moment.
