We evaluate in this work the hydrodynamic transport coefficients of a
granular binary mixture in $d$ dimensions. In order to eliminate the observed
disagreement (for strong dissipation) between computer simulations and
previously calculated theoretical transport coefficients for a monocomponent
gas, we obtain explicit expressions of the seven Navier-Stokes transport
coefficients with the use of a new Sonine approach in the Chapman-Enskog
theory. Our new approach consists in replacing, where appropriate in the
Chapman-Enskog procedure, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution weight function
(used in the standard first Sonine approximation) by the homogeneous cooling
state distribution for each species. The rationale for doing this lies in the
fact that, as it is well known, the non-Maxwellian contributions to the
distribution function of the granular mixture become more important in the
range of strong dissipation we are interested in. The form of the transport
coefficients is quite common in both standard and modified Sonine
approximations, the distinction appearing in the explicit form of the different
collision frequencies associated with the transport coefficients. Additionally,
we numerically solve by means of the direct simulation Monte Carlo method the
inelastic Boltzmann equation to get the diffusion and the shear viscosity
coefficients for two and three dimensions. As in the case of a monocomponent
gas, the modified Sonine approximation improves the estimates of the standard
one, showing again the reliability of this method at strong values of
dissipation.
