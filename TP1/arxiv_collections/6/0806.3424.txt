We study an S--I type epidemic model in an age-structured population, with
mortality due to the disease. A threshold quantity is found that controls the
stability of the disease-free equilibrium and guarantees the existence of an
endemic equilibrium. We obtain conditions on the age-dependence of the
susceptibility to infection that imply the uniqueness of the endemic
equilibrium. An example with two endemic equilibria is shown. Finally, we
analyse numerically how the stability of the endemic equilibrium is affected by
extra-mortality and by the possible periodicities induced by the demographic
age-structure.
