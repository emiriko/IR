In this paper we present the first steps for obtaining a discrete Quantum
Mechanics making use of the Umbral Calculus. The idea is to discretize the
continuous Schroedinger equation substituting the continuous derivatives by
discrete ones and the space-time continuous variables by well determined
operators that verify some Umbral Calculus conditions. In this way we assure
that some properties of integrability and symmetries of the continuous equation
are preserved and also the solutions of the continuous case can be recovered
discretized in a simple way. The case of the Schroedinger equation with a
potential depending only in the space variable is discussed.
