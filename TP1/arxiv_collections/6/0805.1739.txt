We propose fast all-optical control of surface polaritons (SPs) by placing an
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) medium at an interface between
two materials. EIT provides longitudinal compression and a slow group velocity
while matching properties of the two materials at the interface provides strong
transverse confinement. In particular we show that an EIT medium near the
interface between a dielectric and a negative-index metamaterial can establish
tight longitudinal and transverse confinement plus extreme slowing of SPs, in
both transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarizations, while
simultaneously avoiding losses.
