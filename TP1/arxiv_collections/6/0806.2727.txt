We report first principles calculations of the phonon dispersions of PbTe
both for its observed structure and under compression. At the experimental
lattice parameter we find a near instability of the optic branch at the zone
center, in accord with experimental observations.This hardens quickly towards
the zone boundary. There is also a very strong volume dependence of this mode,
which is rapidly driven away from an instability by compression. These results
are discussed inrelation to the thermal conductivity of the material.
