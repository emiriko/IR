We show that several effects considered nuclear effects are not nuclear in
the sense that they do not only occur in nucleus-nucleus and hadron-nucleus
collisions but, as well, they are present in hadron-hadron (proton-proton)
collisions. The matter creation mechanism in hh, hA and AA collisions is always
the same. The pT suppression of particles produced in large multiplicity events
compared to low multiplicity events, the elliptic flow and the Cronin effect
are predicted to occur in pp collisions at LHC energies as a consequence of the
obtained high density partonic medium.
