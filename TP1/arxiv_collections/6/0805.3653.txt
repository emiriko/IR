We show that the literature on pion exchange between charm and bottom mesons
is inconsistent. We derive the formalism explicitly, expose differences between
papers in the literature and clarify the implications. We show that the X(3872)
can be a bound state but that results are very sensitive to a poorly
constrained parameter. We confirm that bound states in the B Bbar sector are
possible. The circumstances whereby exotic combinations can bind with cc or bb
quantum numbers are explored.
