Recent experimental progress in cavity optomechanics has allowed cooling of
mesoscopic mechanical oscillators via dynamic backaction provided by the
parametric coupling to either an optical or an electrical resonator. Here we
analyze the occurrence of normal-mode splitting in backaction cooling at high
input power. We find that a hybridization of the oscillator's motion with the
fluctuations of the driving field occurs and leads to a splitting of the
mechanical and optical fluctuation spectra. Moreover, we find that cooling
experiences a classical limitation through the cavity lifetime.
