Random deposition model with surface diffusion over several next nearest
neighbours is studied. The results agree with the results obtained by Family
for the case of nearest neighbour diffusion [F. Family, J. Phys. A 19(8), L441,
1986]. However for larger diffusion steps, the growth exponent and the
roughness exponent show interesting dependence on diffusion length.
