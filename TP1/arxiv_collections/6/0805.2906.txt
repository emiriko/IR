We present a concise review of the plans of the ATLAS and CMS collaborations
to search for new physics using dijet events. The inclusive cross section as a
function of jet p$_{T}$, the dijet mass distribution and the dijet ratio's CMS
techniques are presented together with their potential of discovery with a
focus on the integrated luminosities of 10, 100 and 1000 pb$^{-1}$.
Analogously, the inclusive jet and angular distribution searches in the dijet
channel from ATLAS are presented together with the potential of discovery given
in terms of needed integrated luminosity.
