We present a closed-form, computable expression for the expected number of
times any transition event occurs during the transient phase of a reducible
Markov chain. Examples of events include time to absorption, number of visits
to a state, traversals of a particular transition, loops from a state to
itself, and arrivals to a state from a particular subset of states. We give an
analogous expression for time-average events, which describe the steady-state
behavior of reducible chains as well as the long-term behavior of irreducible
chains.
