The influence of an initial momentum on the appearance of "quantum
resonances" in the delta-kicked rotor system is explored experimentally. We
show that for certain initial momenta, a resonance can be negated entirely,
whereas at others a resonance can be made to appear. At a larger number of
kicks, all resonances are shown to narrow. We show that as a consequence, the
individual "diffraction peaks" may split. We compare our results to numerical
simulations as well as analytical theory.
