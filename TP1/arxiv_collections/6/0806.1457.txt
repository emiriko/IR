In 2004, J.C. Tong found bounds for the approximation quality of a regular
continued fraction convergent of a rational number, expressed in bounds for
both the previous and next approximation. We sharpen his results with a
geometric method and give both sharp upper and lower bounds. We also calculate
the asymptotic frequency that these bounds occur.
