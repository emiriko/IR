The purpose of this paper is to describe a general and simple setting for
defining $(g,p+q)$-string operations on a Poincar\'e duality space and more
generally on a Gorenstein space. Gorenstein spaces include Poincar\'e duality
spaces as well as classifying spaces or homotopy quotients of connected Lie
groups. Our presentation implies directly the homotopy invariance of each
$(g,p+q)$-string operation as well as it leads to explicit computations.
