The numerical study of QED radiative corrections in the low x region for the
H1 experiment at HERA was performed. The analytical program TERAD91 was used to
obtain the values of the radiative correction factor for the first measurement
of the proton structure function F2(x,Q2) in the range x= 10^{-2} - 10^{-4} and
5 < Q2 < 80 GeV2.
