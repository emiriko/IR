The model suggested by Love and Franey for description of the nucleon-nucleon
interaction was used as the base. The new fitting of the model parameters was
done in the energy range from 100 MeV up to 1100 MeV. It is based on the modern
partial-wave-analysis solution for NN-amplitudes. The three observables:
differential cross section, vector analyzing power, and spin correlation
coefficient -- were obtained at every energy. The results are compared with
existing the experimental data.
