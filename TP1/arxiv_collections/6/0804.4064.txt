The extensive ab initio total energy calculations using the VASP-PAW method
with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation
potential are applied to systematic investigation of structural, electronic and
magnetic properties in quaternary oxybismuthides LaOMBi (where M = Sc, Ti...Ni,
Cu). The energy spectrum features similar to lanthanum-iron oxyarsenide LaOFeAs
and non-magnetic ground state are indicative of superconductivity possible in
lanthanum-nickel oxybismuthide LaONiBi.
