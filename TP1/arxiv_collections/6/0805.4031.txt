We study non-minimal quantum fields in the gravitational field of
2-dimensional dilaton black holes and the de Sitter spacetime. We found that
the Green functions for non-minimal massless fields in a particular class of
dilaton black holes and in the de Sitter spacetime are almost identical. Using
this symmetry exact solutions are derived for quasinormal modes and bound
states in these background geometries. The problem of stability of dilaton
black holes is discussed.
