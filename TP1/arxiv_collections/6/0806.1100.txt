Currently engineering efficient and successful event-driven applications
based on the emerging Complex Event Processing (CEP) technology, is a laborious
trial and error process. The proposed CEP design pattern approach should
support CEP engineers in their design decisions to build robust and efficient
CEP solutions with well understood tradeoffs and should enable an
interdisciplinary and efficient communication process about successful CEP
solutions in different application domains.
