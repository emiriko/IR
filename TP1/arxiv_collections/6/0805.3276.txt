We discuss bound-states of D-branes in truly L-R asymmetric and thus
non-geometric Type II vacuum configurations with extended supersymmetry. We
argue for their stability as a result of residual supersymmetry and coupling to
R-R potentials surviving in the massless spectrum. We then identify the open
string excitations of these L-R asymmetric BPS D-branes. Finally, we briefly
comment on possible applications and extensions.
