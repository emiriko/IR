Within a light-cone quantum-chromodynamics dipole formalism based on the
Green function technique, we study nuclear shadowing in deep-inelastic
scattering at small Bjorken xB < 0.01. Such a formalism incorporates naturally
color transparency and coherence length effects. Calculations of the nuclear
shadowing for the \bar{q}q Fock component of the photon are based on an exact
numerical solution of the evolution equation for the Green function, using a
realistic form of the dipole cross section and nuclear density function. Such
an exact numerical solution is unavoidable for xB > 0.0001, when a variation of
the transverse size of the \bar{q}q Fock component must be taken into account.
The eikonal approximation, used so far in most other models, can be applied
only at high energies, when xB < 0.0001 and the transverse size of the \bar{q}q
Fock component is "frozen" during propagation through the nuclear matter. At xB
< 0.01 we find quite a large contribution of gluon suppression to nuclear
shadowing, as a shadowing correction for the higher Fock states containing
gluons. Numerical results for nuclear shadowing are compared with the available
data from the E665 and NMC collaborations. Nuclear shadowing is also predicted
at very small xB corresponding to LHC kinematical range. Finally the model
predictions are compared and discussed with the results obtained from other
models.
