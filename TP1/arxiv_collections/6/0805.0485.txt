Low-temperature spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy is employed to
study spin transport across single Cobalt-Phathalocyanine molecules adsorbed on
well characterized magnetic nanoleads. A spin-polarized electronic resonance is
identified over the center of the molecule and exploited to spatially resolve
stationary spin states. These states reflect two molecular spin orientations
and, as established by density functional calculations, originate from a
ferromagnetic molecule-lead superexchange interaction mediated by the organic
ligands.
