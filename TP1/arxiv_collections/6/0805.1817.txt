We use supercomputer simulations to show that inter-atomic interactions can
strongly affect the phase evolution of Bose-Einstein condensates that are
diffracted from atom chips, thereby explaining recent experiments. Interactions
broaden and depopulate non-central diffraction orders and so,
counter-intuitively, they actually reduce the spatial width of the diffracted
cloud. This means, more generally, that the experiments cannot be fully
described by non-interacting theories and, consequently, interferometers that
use many interacting atoms to enhance sensitivity require complex calibration.
We identify device geometries required to approximate non-interacting behavior.
