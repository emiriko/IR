Independent of the technology, it is generally expected that future nanoscale
devices will be built from vast numbers of densely arranged devices that
exhibit high failure rates. Other than that, there is little consensus on what
type of technology and computing architecture holds most promises to go far
beyond today's top-down engineered silicon devices. Cellular automata (CA) have
been proposed in the past as a possible class of architectures to the von
Neumann computing architecture, which is not generally well suited for future
parallel and fine-grained nanoscale electronics. While the top-down engineered
semi-conducting technology favors regular and locally interconnected
structures, future bottom-up self-assembled devices tend to have irregular
structures because of the current lack precise control over these processes. In
this paper, we will assess random dynamical networks, namely Random Boolean
Networks (RBNs) and Random Threshold Networks (RTNs), as alternative computing
architectures and models for future information processing devices. We will
illustrate that--from a theoretical perspective--they offer superior properties
over classical CA-based architectures, such as inherent robustness as the
system scales up, more efficient information processing capabilities, and
manufacturing benefits for bottom-up designed devices, which motivates this
investigation. We will present recent results on the dynamic behavior and
robustness of such random dynamical networks while also including manufacturing
issues in the assessment.
