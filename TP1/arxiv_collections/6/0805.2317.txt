The MINOS experiment is now making precise measurements of the nu_mu
disappearance oscillations seen in atmospheric neutrinos, and will extend our
reach towards the so far unseen theta_13 by looking for nu_e appearance in the
nu_mu beam. It does so by using the intense, well-understood NuMI neutrino beam
created at Fermilab and observing it 735 km away at the Soudan Mine in
Northeast Minnesota. Results from MINOS' first two years of operations will be
presented.
