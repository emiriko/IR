The magnetic properties of La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 (LCMO) manganite thin films were
studied with magnetometry and ferromagnetic resonance as a function of film
thickness. They maintain the colossal magnetoresistance behavior with a
pronounced metal-insulator transition around 150-200 K, except for the very
thinnest films studied (3 nm). Nevertheless, LCMO films as thin as 3 nm remain
ferromagnetic, without a decrease in saturation magnetization, indicating an
absence of dead-layers, although below approx. 6 nm the films remain insulating
at low temperature. Magnetization hysteresis loops reveal that the magnetic
easy axes lie in the plane of the film for thicknesses in the range of 4-15 nm.
Ferromagnetic resonance studies confirm that the easy axes are in-plane, and
find a biaxial symmetry in-plane with two, perpendicular easy axes. The
directions of the easy axes with respect to the crystallographic directions of
the cubic SrTiO3 substrate differ by 45 degrees in 4 nm and 15 nm thick LCMO
films.
