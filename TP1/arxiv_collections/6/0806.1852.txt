We investigate the bias dependence of the tunneling conductance between a
spin-polarized (SP) scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip and the surface
conduction states of a normal metal with a Kondo adatom. Quantum interference
between tip-host metal and tip-adatom-host metal conduction paths is studied in
the full range of the Fano parameter $q$. The spin-polarized STM gives rise to
a splitting of the Kondo peak and asymmetry in the zero-bias anomaly depending
on the lateral tip-adatom distance. For increasing lateral distances, the Kondo
peak-splitting shows a strong suppression and the spin-polarized conductance
exhibits the standard Fano-Kondo profile.
