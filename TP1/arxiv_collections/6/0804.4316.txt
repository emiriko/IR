Recently, quantum error-correcting codes were proposed that capitalize on the
fact that many physical error models lead to a significant asymmetry between
the probabilities for bit flip and phase flip errors. An example for a channel
which exhibits such asymmetry is the combined amplitude damping and dephasing
channel, where the probabilities of bit flips and phase flips can be related to
relaxation and dephasing time, respectively. We give systematic constructions
of asymmetric quantum stabilizer codes that exploit this asymmetry. Our
approach is based on a CSS construction that combines BCH and finite geometry
LDPC codes.
