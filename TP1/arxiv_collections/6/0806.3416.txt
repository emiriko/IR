We evaluate the tunneling conductance of clean Ferromomagnet/Superconductor
junctions via a fully self-consistent numerical solution of the microscopic
Bogoliubov-DeGennes equations. We present results for a relevant range of
values of the Fermi wavevector mismatch (FWM), the spin polarization, and the
interfacial scattering strength. For nonzero spin polarization, the conductance
curves vary nonmonotonically with FWM. The FWM dependence of the
self-consistent results is stronger than that previously found in
non-self-consistent calculations, since, in the self-consistent case, the
effective scattering potential near the interface depends on the FWM. The
dependence on interfacial scattering is monotonic. These results confirm that
it is impossible to characterize both the the FWM and the interfacial
scattering by a single effective parameter and that analysis of experimental
data via the use of such one-parameter models is unreliable.
