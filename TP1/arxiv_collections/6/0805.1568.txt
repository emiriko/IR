In this letter we discuss the validity of the ergodicity hypothesis in
theories of violent relaxation in long-range interacting systems. We base our
reasoning on the Hamiltonian Mean Field model and show that the life-time of
quasi-stationary states resulting from the violent relaxation does not allow
the system to reach a complete mixed state. We also discuss the applicability
of a generalization of the central limit theorem. In this context, we show that
no attractor exists in distribution space for the sum of velocities of a
particle other than the Gaussian distribution. The long-range nature of the
interaction leads in fact to a new instance of sluggish convergence to a
Gaussian distribution.
