A two-orbital model for Fe-pnictide superconductors is investigated using
computational techniques on two-dimensional square clusters. The hopping
amplitudes are derived from orbital overlap integrals, or by band structure
fits, and the spin frustrating effect of the plaquette-diagonal Fe-Fe hopping
is remarked. A spin 'striped' state is stable in a broad range of couplings in
the undoped regime, in agreement with neutron scattering. Adding two electrons
to the undoped ground state of a small cluster, the dominant pairing operators
are found. Depending on parameters, two pairing operators were identified: they
involve inter-xz-yz orbital combinations forming spin singlets or triplets,
transforming according to the B_2g and A_2g representations of the D_4h group,
respectively.
