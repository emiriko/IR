We present a full calculation of the amplitudes for $B_{d[s]} \to \gamma
\gamma$ in a simple ACD model that extends an incomplete one in a previous
paper. We find cancellations between the contributions from different KK towers
and a small decrease relative to the SM predictions. It is conjectured that
radiative QCD corrections might actually lead to an enhancement in the
branching ratios and {\bf CP} asymmetries, but no more than modest ones.
