For a general spin glass model with asymmetric couplings we prove a family of
identities involving expectations of generalized overlaps and magnetizations in
the quenched state. Those identities holds pointwise in the Nishimori line and
are reached at the rate of the inverse volume while, in the general case, they
can be proved in integral average.
