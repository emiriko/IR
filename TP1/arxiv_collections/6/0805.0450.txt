Many complex systems, including sand-pile models, slider-block models, and
earthquakes, have been discussed whether they obey the principles of
self-organized criticality. Behavior of these systems can be investigated from
two different points of view: interoccurrent behavior in a region and recurrent
behavior at a given point on a fault or at a given fault. The interoccurrent
frequency-size statistics are known to be scale-invariant and obey the
power-law Gutenberg-Richter distribution. This paper investigates the recurrent
frequency-size behavior of characteristic events at a given point on a fault or
at a given fault. For this purpose sequences of creep events at a creeping
section of the San Andreas fault are investigated. The applicability of the
Brownian passage-time, lognormal, and Weibull distributions to the recurrent
frequency-size statistics of slip events is tested and the Weibull distribution
is found to be a best-fit distribution. To verify this result the behaviors of
the numerical slider-block and sand-pile models are investigated and the
applicability of the Weibull distribution is confirmed. Exponents of the
best-fit Weibull distributions for the observed creep event sequences and for
the slider-block model are found to have close values from 1.6 to 2.2 with the
corresponding aperiodicities of the applied distribution from 0.47 to 0.64.
