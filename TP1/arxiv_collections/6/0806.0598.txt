We develop a diagrammatic perturbation treatment to calculate the
zero-temperature equation of state of the dilute gas mixture of a single spin
component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and a normal Fermi gas of
indistinguishable (single spin) fermion particles. We find that the mean-field
description breaks down near the mechanical instability related to the phase
separation phenomenon. Our analysis shows that the instability is caused by the
competition of the usual short-range and fermion-mediated boson-boson
interactions, which result in a boson compressibility that diverges. In the low
BEC-density limit, we show that the diagrammatic analysis simplifies, we sum
part of the higher order diagrams, and we discuss the effects of other
higher-order contributions.
