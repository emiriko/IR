We construct examples of free-by-cyclic hyperbolic groups which fiber in
infinitely many ways over Z. The construction involves adding a specialized
square 2-cell to a non-positively curved, squared 2-complex defined by labeled
oriented graphs. The fundamental groups of the resulting complexes are
hyperbolic, free-by-cyclic and can be mapped onto Z in infinitely many ways.
