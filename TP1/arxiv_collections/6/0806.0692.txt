Several spin and flavor dependent parameters characterizing the strangeness
content of the nucleon have been calculated in the chiral constituent quark
model with configuration mixing (\chiCQM_{config}) which is known to provide a
satisfactory explanation of the ``proton spin crisis'' and related issues. In
particular, we have calculated the strange spin polarization \Delta s, the
strangeness contribution to the weak axial vector couplings \Delta_8 etc.,
strangeness contribution to the magnetic moments \mu(p)^s etc., the strange
quark flavor fraction f_s, the strangeness dependent quark flavor ratios
\frac{2 \bar s}{u+d} and \frac{2 \bar s}{\bar u+ \bar d} etc.. Our results are
consistent with the recent experimental observations.
