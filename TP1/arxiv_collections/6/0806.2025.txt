In this paper we give a method for calculating the rank of a general elliptic
curve over the field of rational functions in two variables. We reduce this
problem to calculating the cohomology of a singular hypersurface in a weighted
projective 4-space. We then give a method for calculating the cohomology of a
certain class of singular hypersurfaces, extending work of Dimca for the
isolated singularity case.
