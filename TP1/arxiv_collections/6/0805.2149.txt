DC and ac magnetization, resistivity, specific heat, and neutron diffraction
data reveal that stoichiometric LaOFeP is metallic and non-superconducting
above T = 0.35 K, with gamma = 12.5 mJ/mol*K. Neutron diffraction data at room
temperature and T = 10 K are well described by the stoichiometric, tetragonal
ZrCuSiAs structure and show no signs of structural distortions or long range
magnetic ordering, to an estimated detectability limit of 0.07 uB/Fe. We
propose a model, based on the shape of the iron-pnictide tetrahedron, that
explains the differences between LaOFeP and LaOFeAs, the parent compound of the
recently discovered high-Tc oxyarsenides, which, in contrast, shows both
structural and spin density wave (SDW) transitions.
