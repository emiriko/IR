We discuss photogenerated midgap states of a one-dimensional (1D) dimerized
Mott insulator, potassium-tetracyanoquinodimethane (K-TCNQ). Two types of
phonon modes are taken into account: intermolecular and intramolecular
vibrations. We treat these phonon modes adiabatically and analyze a theoretical
model by using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG). Our numerical
results demonstrate that the intermolecular lattice distortion is necessary to
reproduce the photoinduced midgap absorption in K-TCNQ. We find two types of
midgap states. One is a usual polaronic state characterized by a localized
elementary excitation. The other is superposition of two types of excitations,
a doped-carrier state and a triplet-dimer state, which can be generally
observed in 1D dimerized Mott insulators, not limited to K-TCNQ.
