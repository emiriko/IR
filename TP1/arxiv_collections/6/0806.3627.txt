We study the electronic states of the magnetically ordered Mn3Pt alloy within
the density functional theory. Mn3Pt has been believed that one third of Mn
atoms have no magnetic moment in an antiferromagnetic phase (so-called the
F-phase) realized in the temperature range of 400 K < T < 475 K. We show that
this experimentally suggested spin configuration is energetically so much
unfavorable that it would be irrelevant to the F-phase. We discuss the
possibility that the spin moments on the one third of Mn atoms are not
paramagnetic but thermally fluctuating in the F-phase. The present results have
an immediate connection with the recent neutron scattering study [T. Ikeda and
Y. Tsunoda, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn., vol. 72, pp. 2614-2621, October. 2003.].
