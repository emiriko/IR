The newly introduced Transition Distribution Amplitudes (TDAs) are discussed
for the $\pi$-$\gamma$ transitions. Relations between $\pi$-$\gamma$ and
$\gamma$-$\pi$ TDAs for different cases are given. Numerical values for the
$\pi$-$\gamma$ TDAs in different models are compared. GPD's features are
extended to TDAs and the role of PCAC highlighted. We give hints for the
evaluation of cross sections for meson pair production in our approach.
