We show that for any Cayley graph, the probability (at any $p$) that the
cluster of the origin has size n decays at a well-defined exponential rate
(possibly 0). For general graphs, we relate this rate being positive in the
supercritical regime with the amenability/nonamenability of the underlying
graph.
