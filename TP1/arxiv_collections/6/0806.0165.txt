Fascinating developments in optical pulse engineering over the last 20 years
lead to the generation of laser pulses as short as few femtosecond, providing a
unique tool for high resolution time domain spectroscopy. However, a number of
the processes in nature evolve with characteristic times of the order of 1 fs
or even shorter. Time domain studies of such processes require at first place
sub-fs resolution, offered by pulse depicting attosecond localization. The
generation, characterization and proof of principle applications of such pulses
is the target of the attoscience.
