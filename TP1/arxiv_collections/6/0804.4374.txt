The conditions for observation of the particle coordinates, required by logic
of the Special Relativity and filtering the quantum field effects, are
described. A general relation between the corresponding density of probability
and the wave function is found. It is a relativistic invariant describing
probability of the particle emergences in space -time. This density is
concretized for bosons, both scalar and vector (including photon), charged and
neutral, also electron. The Heisenberg's uncertainty relations have been
approved in regards to relativistic particle. As applied to the quantum field,
this new construction is transformed to new characteristic of the particles
distribution in space-time, which complete distribution throughout impulses.
The operators of these distributions and the invariant relativistic description
for free quantum fields have been obtained. These new properties of the
particles and fields are proposed for experimental investigations.
