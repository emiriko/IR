An electrostatic in-plane overlap varying energy harvester is modeled and
simulated using a circuit simulator. Both linear and nonlinear models are
investigated. The nonlinear model includes mechanical stoppers at the
displacement extremes. Large amplitude excitation signals, both narrow and wide
band, are used to emulate environmental vibrations. Nonlinear behavior is
significant at large displacement due to the impact on mechanical stoppers. For
a sinusoidal excitation the mechanical stoppers cause the output power to
flatten and weakly decrease. For a wide band excitation, the output power first
increases linearly with the power spectral density of the input signal, then
grows slower than linearly.
