The aim of this paper is to extend the aggregation convergence results given
in (Dacunha-Castelle and Fermin 2005, Dacunha-Castelle and Fermin 2008) to
doubly stochastic linear and nonlinear processes with weakly dependent
innovations. First, we introduce a weak dependence notion for doubly stochastic
processes, based in the weak dependence definition given in (Doukhan and
Louhichi 1999), and we exhibe several models satisfying this notion, such as:
doubly stochastic Volterra processes and doubly stochastic Bernoulli scheme
with weakly dependent innovations. Afterwards we derive a central limit theorem
for the partial aggregation sequence considering weakly dependent doubly
stochastic processes. Finally, show a new SLLN for the covariance function of
the partial aggregation process in the case of doubly stochastic Volterra
processes with interactive innovations.
