In linear transport, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem relates equilibrium
current correlations to the linear conductance coefficient. For nonlinear
transport, there exist fluctuation relations that rely on Onsager's principle
of microscopic reversibility away from equilibrium. However, both theory and
experiments have shown deviations from microreversibility in the form of
magnetic field asymmetric current-voltage relations. We present novel
fluctuation relations for nonlinear transport in the presence of magnetic
fields that relate current correlation functions at any order at equilibrium to
response coefficients of current cumulants of lower order. We illustrate our
results with the example of an electrical Mach-Zehnder interferometer.
