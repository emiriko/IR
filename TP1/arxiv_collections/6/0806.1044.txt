Over n-dimensional manifolds, I classify ternary differential operators
acting on the spaces of weighted densities and invariant with respect to the
Lie algebra of vector fields. For n=1, some of these operators can be expressed
in terms of the de Rham exterior differential, the Poisson bracket, the Grozman
operator and the Feigin-Fuchs anti-symmetric operators; four of the operators
are new, up to dualizations and permutations. For n>1, I list multidimensional
conformal tranvectors, i.e.,operators acting on the spaces of weighted
densities and invariant with respect to o(p+1,q+1), where p+q=n. Except for the
scalar operator, these conformally invariant operators are not invariant with
respect to the whole Lie algebra of vector fields.
