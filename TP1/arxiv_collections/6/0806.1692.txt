We describe a connection between the combinatorics of generators for certain
groups and the combinatorics of Helly's 1913 theorem on convex sets. We use
this connection to prove fixed point theorems for actions of these groups on
nonpositively curved metric spaces. These results are encode d in a property
that we introduce called ``property $\FA_r$'', which reduces to Serre's
property $\FA$ when $r=1$. The method applies to $S$-arithmetic groups in
higher $\Q$-rank, to simplex reflection groups (including some non-arithmetic
ones), and to higher rank Chevalley groups over polynomial and other rings (for
example $\SL_n(\Z[x_1,..., x_d]), n>2$).
