A mean-field approach (MFA) is proposed for the analysis of orientational
order in a two-dimensional system of stochastic self-propelled particles
interacting by local velocity alignment mechanism. The treatment is applied to
the cases of ferromagnetic (F) and liquid-crystal (LC) alignment. In both
cases, MFA yields a second order phase transition for a critical noise strength
and a scaling exponent of 1/2 for the respective order parameters. We find that
the critical noise amplitude $\eta_c$ at which orientational order emerges in
the LC case is smaller than in the F-alignment case, i.e.
$\eta^{LC}_{C}<\eta^{F}_{C}$. A comparison with simulations of individual-based
models with F- resp. LC-alignment shows that the predictions about the critical
behavior and the qualitative relation between the respective critical noise
amplitudes are correct.
