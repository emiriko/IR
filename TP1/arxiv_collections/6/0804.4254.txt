The neutron electric dipole moment (EDM) provides unique information on CP
violation and physics beyond the Standard Model. We first review the history of
experimental searches for neutron electric dipole moment. The status of future
neutron EDM experiments, including experiments using ultra-cold neutrons
produced in superfluid helium, will then be presented.
