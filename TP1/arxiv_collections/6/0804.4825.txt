The measurement of single leptons from the semi-leptonic decay of
heavy-flavor hadrons has long been a means for studying heavy-quark production.
PHENIX has measured single muons in pp collisions at forward rapidity and
single electrons in both pp and AuAu collisions at mid-rapidity at
sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV. The most recent PHENIX single lepton results are presented
in the context of state-of-the-art pQCD calculations. An updated azimuthal
anisotropy, v2(pT), measurement for heavy-flavor single electrons in AuAu
collisions is also presented.
