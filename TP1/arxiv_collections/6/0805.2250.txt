Isotopic fluctuations in fragment formation are investigated in a
quasi-analytical description of the spinodal decomposition scenario. By
exploiting the fluctuation-dissipation relations the covariance matrix of
density fluctuations is derived as a function of the wave vector for nuclear
matter at given values of density, charge asymmetry, temperature, and of the
time that the system spends in the instability region. Then density
fluctuations in ordinary space are implemented with a Fourier transform
performed in a finite cubic lattice. Inside this box, domains with different
density coexist, from which clusters of nucleons eventually emerge. Within our
approach, the isotopic distributions are determined by the N/Z ratio of the
leading unstable isoscalarlike mode and by isovectorlike fluctuations present
in the matter undergoing the spinodal decomposition. Hence the average value of
the N/Z ratio of clusters and the width of the relative distribution reflect
the properties of the symmetry energy. Generating a large number of events,
these calculations allow a careful investigation of the cluster isotopic
content as a function of the cluster density. A uniform decrease of the average
charge asymmetry and of the width of the isotopic distributions with increasing
density is observed. Finally we remark that the results essentially refer to
the early break--up of the system.
