We consider a discrete-time dynamical process on graphs, firstly introduced
in connection with a protocol for controlling large networks of spin 1/2
quantum mechanical particles [Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 100501 (2007)]. A
description is as follows: each vertex of an initially selected set has a
packet of information (the same for every element of the set), which will be
distributed among vertices of the graph; a vertex v can pass its packet to an
adjacent vertex w only if w is its only neighbour without the information. By
mean of examples, we describe some general properties, mainly concerning
homeomorphism, and redundant edges. We prove that the cardinality of the
smallest sets propagating the information in all vertices of a balanced m-ary
tree of depth k is exactly (m^{k+1}+(-1)^{k})/(m+1). For binary trees, this
number is related to alternating sign matrices.
