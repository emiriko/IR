Using quantization in the Fock space of operators we compute the
non-equilibrium steady state in an open Heisenberg XY spin 1/2 chain of finite
but large size coupled to Markovian baths at its ends. Numerical and
theoretical evidence is given for a far from equilibrium quantum phase
transition with spontaneous emergence of long-range order in spin-spin
correlation functions, characterized by a transition from saturation to linear
growth with the size of the entanglement entropy in operator space.
