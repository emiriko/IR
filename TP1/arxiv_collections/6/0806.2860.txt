We study the problem of maximizing sum rates in a Gaussian
interference-limited channel that models multiuser communication in a CDMA
wireless network or DSL cable binder.
  Using tools from nonnegative irreducible matrix theory, in particular the
Perron-Frobenius Theorem and the Friedland-Karlin inequalities, we provide
insights into the structural property of optimal power allocation strategies
that maximize sum rates. Our approach is similar to the treatment of linear
models in mathematical economies, where interference is viewed in the context
of competition. We show that this maximum problem can be restated as a
maximization problem of a convex function on a closed convex set. We suggest
three algorithms to find the exact and approximate values of the optimal sum
rates. In particular, our algorithms exploit the eigenspace of specially
crafted nonnegative {\it interference matrices}, which, with the use of
standard optimization tools, can provide useful upper bounds and feasible
solutions to the nonconvex problem.
