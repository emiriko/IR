Radiations produced by neutrino-antineutrino annihilation at the Z0 pole can
be used to heat up the primary stage of a thermonuclear warhead and can in
principle detonate the device remotely. Neutrino-antineutrino annihilation can
also be used as a tactical assault weapon to target hideouts that are
unreachable by conventional means.
