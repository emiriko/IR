The electronic and magnetic properties of cobalt-based layered oxypnictides,
LaCoOX (X = P, As), are investigated. LaCoOP and LaCoOAs show metallic type
conduction, and the Fermi edge is observed by hard x-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy. Ferromagnetic transitions occur at 43 K for LaCoOP and 66 K for
LaCoOAs. Above the transition temperatures, temperature dependence of the
magnetic susceptibility follows the Curie-Weiss law. X-ray magnetic circular
dichroism (XMCD) is observed at the Co L2,3-edge, but not at the other edges.
The calculated electronic structure shows a spin polarized ground state. These
results indicate that LaCoOX are itinerant ferromagnets and suggest that their
magnetic properties are governed by spin fluctuation.
