A connected component of an affine algebraic group is called periodic if all
its elements have finite order. We give a characterization of periodic
components in terms of automorphisms with finite number of fixed points. It is
also discussed which connected groups have finite extensions with periodic
components. The results are applied to the study of the normalizer of a maximal
torus in a simple algebraic group.
