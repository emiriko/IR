The $^{18}{\rm O}(p,\alpha)^{15}{\rm N}$ reaction is of primary importance in
several astrophysical scenarios, including fluorine nucleosynthesis inside AGB
stars as well as oxygen and nitrogen isotopic ratios in meteorite grains. Thus
the indirect measurement of the low energy region of the $^{18}{\rm
O}(p,\alpha)^{15}{\rm N}$ reaction has been performed to reduce the nuclear
uncertainty on theoretical predictions. In particular the strength of the 20
and 90 keV resonances have been deduced and the change in the reaction rate
evaluated.
