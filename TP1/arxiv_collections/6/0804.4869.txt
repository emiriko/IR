We present a formalism for studying the behaviour of quantum systems coupled
to nonequilibrium environments exhibiting nonGaussian fluctuations. We discuss
the role of a qubit as a detector of the statistics of environmental
fluctuations, as well as nonMarkovian effects in both weak and strong coupling
limits. We also discuss the differences between the influences of classical and
quantum environments. As examples of the application of this formalism we study
the dephasing and relaxation of a charge qubit coupled to nonequillibrium
electron transport through single and double quantum dots.
