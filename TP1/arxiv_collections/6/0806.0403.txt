We use ab initio density functional calculations to study the chemical
functionalization of single-wall carbon nanotubes and graphene monolayers by
silyl (SiH3) radicals and hydrogen. We find that silyl radicals form strong
covalent bonds with graphene and nanotube walls, causing local structural
relaxations that enhance the sp3 character of these graphitic nanostructures.
Silylation transforms all carbon nanotubes into semiconductors, independent of
their chirality. Calculated vibrational spectra suggest that specific frequency
shifts can be used as a signature of successful silylation.
