Decays of hidden-charm scalar tetra-quark mesons as the partners of
D_{s0}(2317) which has successfully been assigned to the iso-triplet scalar
tetra-quark [c,n][sbar,nbar]_{I=1} meson are studied. Because OZI-rule allowed
strong decays are kinematically limited, their radiative decays are expected to
be important.
