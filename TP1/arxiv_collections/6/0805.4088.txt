A consistent description of the pi0 pi0 invariant mass distribution in the
phi(1020) -> f0(980) gamma -> pi0 pi0 gamma decay and the pi0 eta in phi(1020)
-> a0(980) gamma -> pi0 eta gamma is suggested. A search for the consequences
of the flavor SU(3) symmetry for the scalar mesons can be based on such an
analysis. In order to accurately treat the pseudoscalar meson dynamics, which
is very important for the scalar meson decays, we employ Resonance Chiral
Theory.
