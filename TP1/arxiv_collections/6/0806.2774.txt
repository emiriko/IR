We use the Hubbard type model to describe the coexistence between
superconductivity (SC) and ferromagnetism (F). Our Hamiltonian contains
single-site and two-site interactions. All inter-site interactions will have
included the inter-site kinetic correlation: $<c_{i\sigma}^{+}c_{j\sigma}>$,
within the Hartree-Fock approximation. To obtain the SC transition temperature
$T_{SC}$ and Curie temperature $T_{C}$ we use the Green's functions method. The
numerical results show that the singlet SC is eliminated by F, but the triplet
SC is either enhanced or depleted by F, depending on the carrier concentration
and direction of a superconducting spin pair with respect to magnetization. The
kinetic correlation is capable of creating superconductivity. We find that the
ferromagnetism created by change of the bandwidth can coexist with singlet
superconductivity. In the case of triplet superconductivity the ferromagnetism
creates different critical SC temperatures for the $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ phase
(the pair's spin parallel and antiparallel to magnetization, respectively).
