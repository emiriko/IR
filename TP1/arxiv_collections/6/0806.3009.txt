We recall Mexican needlets from [5]. We derive an estimate for certain types
of Legendre series, which we apply to the statistical properties of Mexican
needlets. More precisely, we shall show that, under isotropy and Gaussianity
assumptions, the Mexican needlet coefficients of a random field on the sphere
are asymptotically uncorrelated, as the frequency parameter goes to infinity.
This property is important in the analysis of cosmic microwave background
radiation.
