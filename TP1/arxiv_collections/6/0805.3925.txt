Magnetotransport measurements were done on $\Nb/\Al_2\O_3/\Cu/\Ni/\Nb$
superconductor-insulator-ferromagnet-superconductor Josephson tunnel junctions.
Depending on ferromagnetic $\Ni$ interlayer thickness and geometry the standard
(1d) magnetic field dependence of critical current deviates from the text-book
model for Josephson junctions. The results are qualitatively explained by a
short Josephson junction model based on anisotropy and 2d remanent
magnetization.
