Resistivity, specific heat and magnetic susceptibility measurements performed
on SrFe2As2 samples evidence a behavior very similar to that observed in
LaFeAsO and BaFe2As2 with the difference that the formation of the SDW and the
lattice deformation occur in a pronounced first order transition at T_0=205K.
Comparing further data evidences that the Fe-magnetism is stronger in SrFe2As2
and in EuFe2As2 than in the other layered FeAs systems investigated up to now.
Full potential LDA band structure calculations confirm the large similarity
between the compounds, especially for the relevant low energy Fe 3d states. The
relation between structural details and magnetic order is analyzed.
