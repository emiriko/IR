It has been shown that for the Reissner-Nordstrom solution to the vacuum
Einstein field equations charge, like mass, has a unique space-time signature
[Found. Phys. 38, 293-300 (2008)]. The presence of charge results in a negative
curvature. This work, which includes a discussion of effective mass, is
extended here to the Kerr-Newman solution.
