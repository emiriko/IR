We show that paradoxical consequences of violations of Bell's inequality are
induced by the use of an unsuitable probabilistic description for the
EPR-Bohm-Bell experiment. The conventional description (due to Bell) is based
on a combination of statistical data collected for different settings of
polarization beam splitters (PBSs). In fact, such data consists of some
conditional probabilities which only partially define a probability space.
Ignoring this conditioning leads to apparent contradictions in the classical
probabilistic model (due to Kolmogorov). We show how to make a completely
consistent probabilistic model by taking into account the probabilities of
selecting the settings of the PBSs. Our model matches both the experimental
data and is consistent with classical probability theory.
