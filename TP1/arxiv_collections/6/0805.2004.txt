We present precision calculations of the transverse-momentum spectrum, the
invariant-mass distribution and the total cross section for Z' production at
hadron colliders. We implement joint resummation at the next-to-leading
logarithmic accuracy and consistently match the obtained result with the pure
perturbative result at the first order in the strong coupling constant. We
confront our numerical predictions with the Monte Carlo generator PYTHIA and
with a new implementation of extra neutral gauge bosons in the Monte Carlo
generator MC@NLO. The impact of scale dependence is also studied.
