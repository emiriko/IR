In this thesis we concentrate on the determination of the spin of an
intermediate particle by using a decay chain. In SUSY the gluino is especially
interesting for searches at the LHC, since it is a Majorana fermion which can
produce like-sign dileptons in the final state. In UED the like-sign dilepton
signature could occur as well from the decay of a bosonic KK-gluon. As we will
show, angular distributions of the outgoing b-jets in SUSY and UED differ due
to the different coupling structures. The effect from the different boosts of
gluino and heavy gluon is shown to be much smaller. The hadronic UED cross
section for KK-gluon KK-quark collisions is calculated in leading order and
compared to the gluino squark collision in SUSY. The analytically given
partonic cross sections are compared at the threshold.
