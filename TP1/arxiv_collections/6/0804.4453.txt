Dipole magnetic moments of several long isotopic chains are analyzed within
the self-consistent Finite Fermi System theory based on the Generalized Energy
Density Functional method with exact account for the pairing and quasi-particle
continuum. New data for nuclei far from the beta-stability valley are included
in the analysis. For a number of semi-magic isotopes of the tin and lead chains
a good description of the data is obtained, with accuracy of 0.1 - 0.2 mu_N. A
chain of non-magic isotopes of copper is also analyzed in detail. It is found
that the systematic analysis of magnetic moments of this long chain yields rich
information on the evolution of the nuclear structure of the Cu isotopes. In
particular, it may give a signal of deformation for the ground state of some
nuclei in the chain.
