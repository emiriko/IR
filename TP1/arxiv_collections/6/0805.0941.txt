The rapid incursion of new technologies such as MEMS and smart sensor device
manufacturing requires new tailor-made packaging designs. In many applications
these devices are exposed to humid environments. Since the penetration of
moisture into the package may result in internal corrosion or shift of the
operating parameters, the reliability testing of hermetically sealed packages
has become a crucial question in the semiconductor industry.
