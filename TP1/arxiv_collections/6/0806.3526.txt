We have studied the electronic and magnetic structures of the ternary iron
arsenides AFe$_2$As$_2$ (A = Ba, Ca, or Sr) using the first-principles density
functional theory. The ground states of these compounds are in a collinear
antiferromagnetic order, resulting from the interplay between the nearest and
the next-nearest neighbor superexchange antiferromagnetic interactions bridged
by As $4p$ orbitals. The correction from the spin-orbit interaction to the band
structure is small. The pressure can reduce dramatically the magnetic moment
and diminish the collinear antiferromagnetic order. Based on the calculations,
we propose that the low energy dynamics of these materials is described
effectively by a $t-J_H-J_1-J_2$-type model.
