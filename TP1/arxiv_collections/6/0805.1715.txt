Two principles explain emergence. First, in the Receipt's reference frame,
Deg(S) = 4/3 Deg(R), where Supply S is an isotropic radiative energy source,
Receipt R receives S's energy, and Deg is a system's degrees of freedom based
on its mean path length. S's 1/3 more degrees of freedom relative to R enables
R's growth and increasing complexity. Second, rho(R) = Deg(R) times rho(r),
where rho(R) represents the collective rate of R and rho(r) represents the rate
of an individual in R: as Deg(R) increases due to the first principle, the
multiplier effect of networking in R increases. A universe like ours with
isotropic energy distribution, in which both principles are operative, is
therefore predisposed to exhibit emergence, and, for reasons shown, a
ubiquitous role for the natural logarithm.
