By means of first-principles calculations, we studied stable lattice
structures and estimated superconducting transition temperature of CaSi$_2$ at
high pressure. Our simulation showed stability of the AlB$_2$ structure in a
pressure range above 17 GPa. In this structure, doubly degenerated optical
phonon modes, in which the neighboring silicon atoms oscillate alternately in a
silicon plane, show prominently strong interaction with the conduction
electrons. In addition there exists a softened optical mode (out-of-plan motion
of silicon atoms), whose strength of the electron-phonon interaction is nearly
the same as the above mode. The density of states at the Fermi level in the
AlB$_2$ structure is higher than that in the trigonal structure. These findings
and the estimation of the transition temperature strongly suggest that higher
$T_{\rm c}$ is expected in the AlB$_2$ structure than the trigonal structures
which are known so far.
