Singularities in macroscopic systems at discontinuous phase transitions are
replaced in finite systems by sharp but continuous changes. Both the energy
differences between metastable and stable phases and the energy barriers
separating these phases decrease with decreasing particle number. Then, for
small enough systems, random heterophasic oscillations of the entire system
become an observable form of thermal motion. Under certain conditions, these
oscillations take the form of oscillatory nucleation. We discuss mechanisms and
observation conditions for these random transitions between phases.
