The midrapidity inclusive densities of different secondaries are calculated
in the framework of the Quark-Gluon String Model. The transfer of baryon number
in rapidity space due to the gluon string junction propagation leads to a
significant effect on the net baryon production. The numerical results are in
reasonable agreement with RHIC experimental data.
