In a recent paper, the partition function (character) of ten-dimensional pure
spinor worldsheet variables was calculated explicitly up to the fifth
mass-level. In this letter, we propose a novel application of Pade approximants
as a tool for computing the character of pure spinors. We get results up to the
twelfth mass-level. This work is a first step towards an explicit construction
of the complete pure spinor partition function.
