The implications of restricting the covariance principle within a Gaussian
gauge are developed both on a classical and a quantum level. Hence, we
investigate the cosmological issues of the obtained Schr\"odinger Quantum
Gravity with respect to the asymptotically early dynamics of a generic
Universe. A dualism between time and the reference frame fixing is then
inferred.
