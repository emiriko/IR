By measuring the dynamic and traditional magnetization relaxations we
investigate the vortex dynamics of the newly discovered superconductor
SmFeAsO_0.9F_0.1 with Tc = 55K. It is found that the relaxation rate is rather
large reflecting a small characteristic pinning energy. Moreover it shows a
weak temperature dependence in wide temperature region, which resembles the
behavior of the cuprate superconductors. Combining with the resistive data
under different magnetic fields, a vortex phase diagram is obtained. Our
results strongly suggest that the model of collective vortex pinning applies to
this new superconductor very well.
