By requiring invariance directly under the Yangian symmetry, we rederive
Beisert's quantum R-matrix, in a form that carries explicit dependence on the
representation labels, the braiding factors, and the spectral parameters u_i.
In this way, we demonstrate that there exist a rewriting of its entries, such
that the dependence on the spectral parameters is purely of difference form.
Namely, the latter enter only in the combination u_1-u_2, as indicated by the
shift automorphism of the Yangian. When recasted in this fashion, the entries
exhibit a cleaner structure, which allows to spot new interesting relations
among them. This permits to package them into a practical tensorial expression,
where the non-diagonal entries are taken care by explicit combinations of
symmetry algebra generators.
