We report first-principles calculations of acoustic surface plasmons on the
(0001) surface of Be, as obtained in the random-phase approximation of
many-body theory. The energy dispersion of these collective excitations has
been obtained along two symmetry directions. Our results show a considerable
anisotropy of acoustic surface plasmons, and underline the capability of
experimental measurements of these plasmons to {\it map} the electron-hole
excitation spectrum of the quasi two-dimensional Shockley surface state band
that is present on the Be(0001) surface.
