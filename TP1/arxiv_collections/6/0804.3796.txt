This paper discusses that there is significant benefit in providing stronger
security at lower layers of the network stack for hosts connected to a network.
It claims to reduce the attack vulnerability of a networked host by providing
security mechanisms in a programmable Network Interface Card (NIC). Dynamic
access control mechanisms are implemented in hardware to restrict access to the
services provided, only to authenticated hosts. This reduces server
vulnerability to various layer 2 attacks. Also the services will be immune to
zero-day vulnerabilities due to the minimal code execution paths. To this end,
it presents architecture and implementation details of a programmable network
interface card equipped with these measures. It works alongside, and augments,
existing security protocols making deployment practical.
