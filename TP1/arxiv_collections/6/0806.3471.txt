In this paper we present the self-stabilizing implementation of a class of
token based algorithms. In the current work we only consider interactions
between weak nodes. They are uniform, they do not have unique identifiers, are
static and their interactions are restricted to a subset of nodes called
neighbours. While interacting, a pair of neighbouring nodes may create mobile
agents (that materialize in the current work the token abstraction) that
perform traversals of the network and accelerate the system stabilization. In
this work we only explore the power of oblivious stateless agents.
  Our work shows that the agent paradigm is an elegant distributed tool for
achieving self-stabilization in Tiny Interaction Protocols (TIP). Nevertheless,
in order to reach the full power of classical self-stabilizing algorithms more
complex classes of agents have to be considered (e.g. agents with memory,
identifiers or communication skills). Interestingly, our work proposes for the
first time a model that unifies the recent studies in mobile robots(agents)
that evolve in a discrete space and the already established population
protocols paradigm.
