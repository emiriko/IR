We present a detailed study on the magnetic order in the undoped mother
compound LaOFeAs of the recently discovered Fe-based superconductor
LaO$_{1-x}$F$_x$FeAs. In particular, we present local probe measurements of the
magnetic properties of LaOFeAs by means of $^{57}$Fe M\"ossbauer spectroscopy
and muon spin relaxation in zero external field along with magnetization and
resistivity studies. These experiments prove a commensurate static magnetic
order with a strongly reduced ordered moment of 0.25(5) $\mu_B$ at the iron
site below T_N = 138 K, well separated from a structural phase transition at
T_N = 156 K. The temperature dependence of the sublattice magnetization is
determined and compared to theory. Using a four-band spin density wave model
both, the size of the order parameter and the quick saturation below T_N are
reproduced.
