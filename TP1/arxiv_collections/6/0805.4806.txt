A possible mechanism of electronic phase separation in the systems with
orbital ordering is analyzed. We suggest a simple model taking into account an
interplay between the delocalization of charge carriers introduced by doping
and the cooperative ordering of local lattice distortions. The proposed
mechanism is quite similar to the double exchange usually invoked for
interpretation of phase separation in doped magnetic oxides like manganites,
but can be efficient even in the absence of any magnetic ordering. It is
demonstrated that the delocalized charge carriers favor the formation of
nanoscale inhomogeneities with the orbital structure different from that in the
undoped material. The directional character of orbitals leads to
inhomogeneities of different shapes and sizes.
