Interference is one of the most fundamental features which characterizes
quantum systems. Here we provide an exhaustive analysis of the interfere
dynamics associated with wave-packet superpositions from both the standard
quantum-mechanical perspective and the Bohmian one.
  From this analysis, clear and insightful pictures of the physics involved in
this kind of processes are obtained, which are of general validity (i.e.,
regardless of the type of wave packets considered) in the understanding of more
complex cases where interference is crucial (e.g., scattering problems, slit
diffraction, quantum control scenarios or, even, multipartite interactions). In
particular, we show how problems involving wave-packet interference can be
mapped onto problems of wave packets scattered off potential barriers.
