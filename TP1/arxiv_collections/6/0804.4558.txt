Two particle azimuthal correlations with strange trigger particles
($K^0_S,\Lambda,\Xi$) are presented in Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV in STAR at RHIC. The near-side associated yield is
investigated as a function of centrality, $p_T$, and strangeness content of the
trigger to investigate possible flavour or meson/baryon differences. The system
size dependence of both the jet-like correlations and the long range
pseudorapidity correlations is studied to give insight into the origin of these
two components.
