We investigate chiral properties of local (non-derivative) fields of baryons
consisting of three quarks with flavor SU(3) symmetry. We construct explicitly
independent local three-quark fields belonging to definite Lorentz and flavor
representations. Chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken and therefore the
baryon fields can have different chiral representations. It turns out that the
allowed chiral representations are strongly correlated with the Lorentz group
representations due to the color and spatial structure of the local three-quark
fields. We discuss some implications of the allowed chiral symmetry
representations on phenomenological Lagrangians with chiral U(3)_L \otimes
U(3)_R symmetry.
