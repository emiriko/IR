A statistical model for forward stimulated Brillouin scattering (FSBS) is
developed for a spatially incoherent, monochromatic, laser beam propagating in
a plasma. A threshold for the average power in a speckle is found, well below
the self-focusing one, above which the laser beam spatial incoherence can not
prevent the coherent growth of FSBS. Three-dimensional simulations confirm its
existence and reveal the onset of beam spray above it. From these results, we
propose a new figure of merit for the control of the propagation through a
plasma of a spatially incoherent laser beam.
