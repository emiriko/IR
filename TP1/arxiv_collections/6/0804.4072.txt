The most general supersymmetric seesaw mechanism has too many parameters to
be predictive and thus can not be excluded by any measurements of lepton
flavour violating (LFV) processes. We focus on the simplest version of the
type-I seesaw mechanism assuming minimal supergravity boundary conditions. We
compute branching ratios for the LFV scalar tau decays, ${\tilde \tau}_2 \to
(e,\mu) + \chi^0_1$, as well as loop-induced LFV decays at low energy, such as
$l_i \to l_j + \gamma$ and $l_i \to 3 l_j$, exploring their sensitivity to the
unknown seesaw parameters. We find some simple, extreme scenarios for the
unknown right-handed parameters, where ratios of LFV branching ratios correlate
with neutrino oscillation parameters. If the overall mass scale of the left
neutrinos and the value of the reactor angle were known, the study of LFV
allows, in principle, to extract information about the so far unknown
right-handed neutrino parameters.
