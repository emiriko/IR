We study an indefinite Sturm-Liouville problem due to Richardson whose
complicated eigenvalue dependence on a parameter has been a puzzle for decades.
In atomic physics a process exists that inverts the usual Schrodinger situation
of an energy eigenvalue depending on a coupling parameter into the so-called
Sturmian problem where the coupling parameter becomes the eigenvalue which then
depends on the energy. We observe that the Richardson equation is of the
Sturmian type. This means that the Richardson and its related Schrodinger
eigevalue functions are inverses of each other and that the Richardson spectrum
is therefore no longer a puzzle.
