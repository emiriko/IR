We study the behaviour of charge oscillations in Superconducting Cooper Pair
Boxes weakly interacting with an environment. We found that, due to the noise
and dissipation induced by the environment, the stability properties of these
nanodevices differ according to whether the charge oscillations are interpreted
as an effect of macroscopic quantum coherence, or semiclassically in terms of
the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. More specifically, occupation number states,
used in the quantum interpretation of the oscillations, are found to be much
more unstable than coherent ones, typical of the semiclassical explanation.
