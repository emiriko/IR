We consider W-states and generalized W-states for $n$-qubit systems. We
obtain conditions to use these states as quantum resources to teleport unknown
states. Only a limited class of multi-qubit states can be teleported. For
$one$-qubit states, we use protocols which are simple extensions of the
conventional teleportation protocol. We also show that these resource states
can be used to transmit {\em at most} $n + 1$ classical bits by sending $n$
qubits if the appropriate conditions are met. Therefore these states are not
suitable for maximal teleportation or superdense coding when $ n > 3$.
