The Balian-Veneroni variational approach has been implemented using a
3-dimensional time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) code with realistic Skyrme
interactions and used to investigate the mass dispersions from giant dipole
resonances in S-32 and Sn-132 decaying through particle emission. The
fluctuations obtained are shown to be quantitatively larger than the standard
TDHF results.
