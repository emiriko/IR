We continue to investigate the physical interpretation of the Riemann zeta
function as a FZZT brane partition function associated with a matrix/gravity
correspondence begun in arxiv:0708.0645. We derive the master matrix of the
$(2,1)$ minimal and $(3,1)$ minimal matrix model. We use it's characteristic
polynomial to understand why the zeros of the FZZT partition function, which is
the Airy function, lie on the real axis. We also introduce an iterative
procedure that can describe the Riemann $\Xi$ function as a deformed minimal
model whose deformation parameters are related to a Konsevich integrand.
Finally we discuss the relation of our work to other approaches to the Riemann
$\Xi$ function including expansion in terms of Meixner-Pollaczek polynomials
and Riemann-Hilbert problems.
