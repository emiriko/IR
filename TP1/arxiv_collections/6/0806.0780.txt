The neoclassical prescription to use an equation of motion to determine the
electrostatic field within a tokamak plasma is fraught with difficulties.
Herein we examine two popular expressions for the equilibrium electrostatic
field so determined and show that one fails to withstand a formal scrutiny
thereof while the other fails to respect the vector nature of the diamagnetic
current. Reconsideration of the justification for the presence of the
equilibrium electrostatic field indicates that no field is needed for a neutral
plasma when considering the net bound current defined as the curl of the
magnetization. With any shift in the toroidal magnetic flux distribution, a
dynamic electric field is generated with both radial and poloidal components,
providing an alternate explanation for any measurements thereof.
