We perform a fully relativistic calculation of the D(e,e'p)n reaction in the
impulse approximation. We employ the Gross equation to describe the deuteron
ground state, and we use the SAID parametrization of the full NN scattering
amplitude to describe the final state interactions (FSIs). We include both
on-shell and positive-energy off-shell contributions in our FSI calculation. We
show results for momentum distributions and angular distributions of the
differential cross section, as well as for various asymmetries. We identify
kinematic regions where various parts of the final state interactions are
relevant, and discuss the theoretical uncertainties connected with calculations
at high missing momenta.
