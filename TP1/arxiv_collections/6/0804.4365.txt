We prove the existence of periodic solutions in a class of nonlinear partial
differential equations, including the nonlinear Schroedinger equation, the
nonlinear wave equation, and the nonlinear beam equation, in higher dimension.
Our result covers cases where the bifurcation equation is infinite-dimensional,
such as the nonlinear Schroedinger equation with zero mass, for which solutions
which at leading order are wave packets are shown to exist.
