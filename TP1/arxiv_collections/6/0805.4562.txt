Measurements of J/$\psi$ production by the PHENIX experiment in p+p, d+Au,
Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV are reviewed. The results
show a suppression beyond what can be explained by cold nuclear matter effects
in the most central Au+Au and to a lesser extent in Cu+Cu collisions. In
addition, the suppression observed at mid rapidity in Au+Au is smaller than at
forward rapidity, a tendency opposite to what is expected from the higher
energy density at mid rapidity. Regeneration, a possible explanation, can be
tested by measuring the elliptic flow parameter v$_2$ of J/$\psi$.
