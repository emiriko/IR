We present a calculation for $\eta$ production in the $p-^6Li$ fusion near
threshold including the $\eta-^7Be$ final state interaction (FSI). We consider
the $^6Li$ and $^7Be$ nuclei as $\alpha-d$ and $\alpha-^3He$ clusters
respectively. The calculations are done for the lowest states of $^7Be$ with $J
= ({3\over2}^-, {1\over2}^-)$ resulting from the $L = $1 radial wave function.
The $\eta-^7Be$ interaction is incorporated through the $\eta-^7Be$ $T-$matrix,
constructed from the medium modified matrices for the $\eta-^3He$ and
$\eta-\alpha$ systems. These medium modified matrices are obtained by solving
few body equations, where the scattering in nuclear medium is taken into
account.
