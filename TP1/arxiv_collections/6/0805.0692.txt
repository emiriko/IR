Discrimination of the detection of fast neutrons and gamma rays in a liquid
scintillator detector has been investigated using digital pulse-processing
techniques. An experimental setup with a 252Cf source, a BC-501 liquid
scintillator detector, and a BaF2 detector was used to collect waveforms with a
100 Ms/s, 14 bit sampling ADC. Three identical ADC's were combined to increase
the sampling frequency to 300 Ms/s. Four different digital pulse-shape analysis
algorithms were developed and compared to each other and to data obtained with
an analogue neutron-gamma discrimination unit. Two of the digital algorithms
were based on the charge comparison method, while the analogue unit and the
other two digital algorithms were based on the zero-crossover method. Two
different figure-of-merit parameters, which quantify the neutron-gamma
discrimination properties, were evaluated for all four digital algorithms and
for the analogue data set. All of the digital algorithms gave similar or better
figure-of-merit values than what was obtained with the analogue setup. A
detailed study of the discrimination properties as a function of sampling
frequency and bit resolution of the ADC was performed. It was shown that a
sampling ADC with a bit resolution of 12 bits and a sampling frequency of 100
Ms/s is adequate for achieving an optimal neutron-gamma discrimination for
pulses having a dynamic range for deposited neutron energies of 0.3-12 MeV. An
investigation of the influence of the sampling frequency on the time resolution
was made. A FWHM of 1.7 ns was obtained at 100 Ms/s.
