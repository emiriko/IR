Mean value and cross-covariance function of chaotic binary sequences are
evaluated for chaotic maps with specific properties. We also take into account
the effect of fixed- and floating-point representations on statistical
properties of chaotic generators. Thus, one is able to obtain possible
candidates for pseudo-random binary sequences generation. Results of
statistical tests applied to chaotic binary sequences are presented. The
chaotic binary sequences thus obtained could be used for security improvement
in IEEE 802.11 standard.
