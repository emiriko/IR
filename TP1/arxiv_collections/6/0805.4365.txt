We demonstrate that perfect state transfer can be achieved using an
engineered spin chain and clean local end-chain operations, without requiring
the initialization of the state of the medium nor fine tuning of
control-pulses. This considerably relaxes the prerequisites for obtaining
reliable transfer of quantum information across interacting-spin systems.
Moreover, it allows us to shed light on the interplay among purity,
entanglement and operations on a class of many-body systems potentially useful
for quantum information processing tasks.
