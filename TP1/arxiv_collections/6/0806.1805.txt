We present a coupled Boltzmann and hydrodynamics approach to relativistic
heavy ion reactions. This hybrid approach is based on the Ultra-relativistic
Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) transport approach with an intermediate
hydrodynamical evolution for the hot and dense stage of the collision. This
implementation allows to compare microscopic transport calculations with
hydrodynamic calculations using exactly the same initial conditions and
freeze-out procedure. Here, the results of the different calculations for
particle multiplicities, the mean transverse mass excitation function and the
HBT radii at all SPS energies are discussed in the context of the available
data.
