We present a generalized theory of microphase separation for charged-neutral
diblock copolymer melt. Stability limit of the disordered phase for salt-free
melt has been calculated using Random Phase Approximation (RPA) and
self-consistent field theory (SCFT). Explicit analytical free energy
expressions for different classical ordered microstructures (lamellar, cylinder
and sphere) are presented. We demonstrate that chemical mismatch required for
the onset of microphase separation ($\chi^{\star} N$) in charged-neutral
diblock melt is higher and the period of ordered microstructures is lower than
those for the corresponding neutral-neutral diblock system. Theoretical
predictions on the period of ordered structures in terms of Coulomb
electrostatic interaction strength, chain length, block length, and the
chemical mismatch between blocks are presented. SCFT has been used to go beyond
the stability limit, where electrostatic potential and charge distribution are
calculated self-consistently. Stability limits calculated using RPA are in
perfect agreement with the corresponding SCFT calculations. Limiting laws for
stability limit and the period of ordered structures are presented and
comparisons are made with an earlier theory. Also, transition boundaries
between different morphologies have been investigated.
