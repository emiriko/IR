The fine structure constant alpha ~ 1/137 appears as a lifetime scaling
factor for the 36 metastable (t > 10^-21 sec) elementary particles -- 34
hadrons and the mu and tau leptons. The hadrons divide into 24 long-lived
unpaired-quark (UQ) and 3 short-lived paired-quark (PQ) ground states (the
lowest-mass states for each u, d, s, c, b quark flavor combination), plus 7
excited states. The lifetime ratios include six factors of alpha, six factors
of alpha^4, and one factor of alpha^3 (the leptons). This experimental lifetime
alpha-quantization has seven salient features, where (1)-(3) show powers of
alpha and (4)-(7) show smaller scaling effects): (1) A low-mass (m < 1 Gev)
particle alpha-chain of linked alpha and alpha^4 lifetime ratios that extends
from the neutron to the eta' meson and spans 11 powers of alpha. (2) Four
unpaired-quark lifetime clusters (UQ)(pi, s, b, c) that contain 23 ground
states which are sorted by the quark priorities c > b > s. (3) Four
paired-quark clusters (PQ)(pi, s, b, c), and four alpha^4 pairing gaps between
the fast PQ decays (which conserve flavor) and the slow UQ decays (which do
not). (4) IR integer-ratio scaling inside UQ clusters, with integer lifetime
ratios of 2, 3, or 4. (5) RP random perturbations that produce ~10% deviations
from exact IR scaling. (6) Hadronic BC-scaling, which reflects the empirical BC
= t(b)/t(c) ~ 3 lifetime ratios that occur between unpaired b-quark states and
corresponding unpaired c-quark states. (7) Leptonic BC-scaling, shown in the
lifetime equation (t(tau) x BC) / t(mu) = alpha^3, which is accurate to 2% for
BC = 3.0, and which utilizes an alpha^3 scaling factor. The UQ and PQ lifetime
clusters clearly reflect their u, d, s, c, b quark substructures
