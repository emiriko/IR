We discuss our recently proposed S3(down)xS3(up)
flavour-permutation-symmetric mixing observables, giving expressions for them
in terms of (moduli-squared) of the mixing matrix elements. We outline their
successful use in providing flavour-symmetric descriptions of
(non-flavour-symmetric) lepton mixing schemes. We develop our partially unified
flavour-symmetric description of both quark and lepton mixings, providing
testable predictions for CP-violating phases in both B decays and neutrino
oscillations.
