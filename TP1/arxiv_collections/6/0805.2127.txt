A low-energy non-unitary leptonic mixing matrix is a generic effect of some
theories of new physics accounting for neutrino masses. We show how the extra
CP-phases of a general non-unitary matrix allow for sizeable CP-asymmetries in
the $\nu_\mu\to \nu_\tau$ channel. This CP-asymmetries turns out to be an
excellent probe of such new physics.
