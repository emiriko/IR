We investigate the spin-dependent dynamical response of a quantum ring with a
spin-orbit interaction upon the application of linearly polarized, picosecond,
asymmetric electromagnetic pulses. The oscillations of the generated dipole
moment are sensitive to the parity of the occupation number in the ring and to
the strength of the spin-orbit coupling. It is shown how the associated
emission spectrum can be controlled via the pulse strength or a gate voltage.
In addition, we inspect how a static magnetic flux can modify the
non-equilibrium dynamics. In presence of the spin-orbit interaction and for a
paramagnetic ring, the applied pulse results in a spin-split, non-equilibrium
local charge density. The resulting temporal spin polarization is directed
perpendicular to the light-pulse polarization axis and oscillates periodically
with the frequency of the spin-split charge density. The spin-averaged
non-equilibrium charge density possesses a left-right symmetry with respect to
the pulse polarization axis. The calculations presented here are applicable to
nano-meter rings fabricated in heterojuctions of III-V and II-VI semiconductors
containing several hundreds electrons.
