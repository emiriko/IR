It has been recently pointed out that the presence of a nonmagnetic impurity
in a Heisenberg antiferromagnet generates an alternating order of the
surrounding spins which is independent of temperature in a wide range. Quantum
Monte Carlo simulations in the two-dimensional $S=1/2$ case confirmed this
picture, but showed a counterintuitive enhancement of the alternating order
around the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. We propose here an explanation in
terms of the effect of vortex excitations.
