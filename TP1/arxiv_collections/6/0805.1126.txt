The problem of diffusive bond-dissociation in a double well potential under
application of an external force is scrutinized. We compute the probability
distribution of rupture forces and present a detailed discussion of the
influence of finite rebinding probabilities on the dynamic force spectrum. In
particular, we focus on barrier crossing upon extension, i.e. under linearly
increased load, and upon relaxation starting from completely separated bonds.
For large loading rates the rupture force and the rejoining force depend on the
loading rate in the expected manner determined by the shape of the potential.
For small loading rates the mean forces obtained from pull and relax modes
approach each other as the system reaches equilibrium. We investigate the
dependence of the rupture force distributions and mean rupture forces on
external parameters like cantilever stiffness and influence of a soft linker.
We find that depending on the implementation of a soft linker the equilibrium
rupture force is either unaffected by the presence of the linker or changes in
a predictable way with the linker-compliance. Additionally, we show that it is
possible to extract the equilibrium constant of the on- and off-rates from the
determination of the equilibrium rupture forces.
