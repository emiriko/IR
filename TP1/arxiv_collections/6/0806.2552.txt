We evaluate new complexity measures on the symbolic dynamics of coupled tent
maps and cellular automata. These measures quantify complexity in terms of
$k$-th order statistical dependencies that cannot be reduced to interactions
between $k-1$ units. We demonstrate that these measures are able to identify
complex dynamical regimes.
