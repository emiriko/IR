A new calculation of R_{dAu} has been performed using the 2003 d+Au data and
the higher-statistics 2005 p+p data. These nuclear modification factors are
compared to calculations using nuclear-modified PDFs and a J/psi breakup cross
section is extracted. These values are then used to project the cold nuclear
matter effects in Au+Au collisions. Additionally, a more data-driven projection
is performed.
