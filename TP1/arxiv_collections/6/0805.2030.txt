We study behavior of J/psi in hot gluonic matter using
  QCD sum rules. Taking into account temperature dependences of the gluon
condensates extracted from lattice thermodynamics for the pure SU(3) system, we
find that the mass and width of J/psi exhibit rapid change across the critical
temperature.
