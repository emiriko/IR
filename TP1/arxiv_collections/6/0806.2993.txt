The need to regularize loop integrals in a manner that preserves gauge
invariance, for example, using the Pauli-Villars method, requires a subtraction
that in the large mass limit hides its high momentum origin. This gives rise to
the illusion that only nonrelativistic kaon loop momenta are relevant, when in
fact this is not the case, as we show.
