We suppose that the baryon asymmetry is produced by thermal leptogenesis
(with flavour effects), at temperatures $\sim 10^{9} - 10^{10}$ GeV, in the
supersymmetric seesaw with universal and real soft terms. The parameter space
is restricted by assuming that $l_\alpha \to l_\beta \gamma$ processes will be
seen in upcoming experiments. We study the sensitivity of the baryon asymmetry
to the phases of the lepton mixing matrix, and find that leptogenesis can work
for any value of the phases. We also estimate the contribution to the electric
dipole moment of the electron, arising from the seesaw, and find that it is
(just) beyond the sensitivity of next generation experiments ($\lsim 10^{-29}
e$ cm). The fourteen dimensional parameter space is efficiently explored with a
Monte Carlo Markov Chain, which concentrates on the regions of interest.
