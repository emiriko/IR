A Steinhaus matrix is a binary square matrix of size $n$ which is symmetric,
with diagonal of zeros, and whose upper-triangular coefficients satisfy
$a_{i,j}=a_{i-1,j-1}+a_{i-1,j}$ for all $2\leq i<j\leq n$. Steinhaus matrices
are determined by their first row. A Steinhaus graph is a simple graph whose
adjacency matrix is a Steinhaus matrix. We give a short new proof of a theorem,
due to Dymacek, which states that even Steinhaus graphs, i.e. those with all
vertex degrees even, have doubly-symmetric Steinhaus matrices. In 1979 Dymacek
conjectured that the complete graph on two vertices $K_2$ is the only regular
Steinhaus graph of odd degree. Using Dymacek's theorem, we prove that if
$(a_{i,j})_{1\leq i,j\leq n}$ is a Steinhaus matrix associated with a regular
Steinhaus graph of odd degree then its sub-matrix $(a_{i,j})_{2\leq i,j\leq
n-1}$ is a multi-symmetric matrix, that is a doubly-symmetric matrix where each
row of its upper-triangular part is a symmetric sequence. We prove that the
multi-symmetric Steinhaus matrices of size $n$ whose Steinhaus graphs are
regular modulo 4, i.e. where all vertex degrees are equal modulo 4, only depend
on $\lceil \frac{n}{24}\rceil$ parameters for all even numbers $n$, and on
$\lceil \frac{n}{30}\rceil$ parameters in the odd case. This result permits us
to verify the Dymacek's conjecture up to 1500 vertices in the odd case.
