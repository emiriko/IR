Density functional calculations for K_{0.5}Li_{0.5}NbO_3 show strong A-site
driven ferroelectricity, even though the average tolerance factor is
significantly smaller than unity and there is no stereochemically active A-site
ion. This is due to the frustration of tilt instabilities by A-site disorder.
There are very large off-centerings of the Li ions, which contribute strongly
to the anisotropy between the tetragonal and rhombohedral ferroelectric states,
yielding a tetragonal ground state even without strain coupling.
