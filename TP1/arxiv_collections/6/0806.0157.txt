We revisit the problem of estimates of moments of random n-dimensional
matrices of Wigner ensemble by using the approach elaborated by Ya. Sinai and
A. Soshnikov and further developed by A. Ruzmaikina. Our main subject is given
by the structure of closed even walks and their graphs that arise in these
studies. We show that the total degree of a vertex of such a graph depends not
only on the self-intersections degree of but also on the total number of all
non-closed instants of self-intersections of the walk. This result is used to
fill the gaps of earlier considerations.
