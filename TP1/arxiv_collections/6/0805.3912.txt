We propose a set-valued framework for the well-posedness of birth-and-growth
process. Our birth-and-growth model is rigorously defined as a suitable
combination, involving Minkowski sum and Aumann integral, of two very general
set-valued processes representing nucleation and growth respectively. The
simplicity of the used geometrical approach leads us to avoid problems arising
by an analytical definition of the front growth such as boundary regularities.
In this framework, growth is generally anisotropic and, according to a
mesoscale point of view, it is not local, i.e. for a fixed time instant, growth
is the same at each space point.
