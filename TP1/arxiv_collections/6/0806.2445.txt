We calculate the Pauli-limited upper critical field and the
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) instability for {\it dirty} d-wave
superconductors within the quasiclassical theory using the self-consistent
$\hat{t}$-matrix approximation for impurities. We find that the phase diagram
depends sensitively on the scattering rate and phase shift of nonmagnetic
impurities. The transition into the superconducting state is always second
order for weak (Born) scattering, while in the unitarity (strong) scattering
limit a first-order transition into both uniform and spatially modulated
superconducting states is stabilized. Contrary to general belief, we find that
the FFLO phase is robust against disorder and survives impurity scattering
equivalent to a $T_c$ suppression of roughly 40%. Our results bear on the
search of FFLO states in heavy-fermion and layered organic superconductors.
