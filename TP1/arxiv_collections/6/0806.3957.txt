Recent results obtained by the HARP collaboration on the measurements of the
double-differential production cross-section of positive and negative pions in
proton interactions with nuclear targets from Beryllium to Lead are presented.
They cover production at small angles (30-210 mrad) and relatively large
momenta up to 8 GeV/c as well as large angles (0.35 - 2.15 rad) and small
momenta (0.1 - 0.8 GeV/c). These results are relevant for a detailed
understanding of neutrino fluxes in accelerator neutrino experiments, better
prediction of atmospheric neutrino fluxes, optimization of a future neutrino
factory design and for improvement of hadronic generators widely used by the
HEP community in the simulation of hadronic interactions.
