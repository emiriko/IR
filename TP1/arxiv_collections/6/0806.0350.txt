We show that the dynamics of simple disordered models, like the directed Trap
Model and the Random Energy Model, takes place at a coexistence point between
active and inactive dynamical phases. We relate the presence of a dynamic phase
transition in these models to the extreme value statistics of the associated
random energy landscape.
