Deficiency in expressive power of the first-order logic has led to developing
its numerous extensions by fixed point operators, such as Least Fixed-Point
(LFP), inflationary fixed-point (IFP), partial fixed-point (PFP), etc. These
logics have been extensively studied in finite model theory, database theory,
descriptive complexity. In this paper we introduce unifying framework, the
logic with iteration operator, in which iteration steps may be accessed by
temporal logic formulae. We show that proposed logic FO+TAI subsumes all
mentioned fixed point extensions as well as many other fixed point logics as
natural fragments. On the other hand we show that over finite structures FO+TAI
is no more expressive than FO+PFP. Further we show that adding the same
machinery to the logic of monotone inductions (FO+LFP) does not increase its
expressive power either.
