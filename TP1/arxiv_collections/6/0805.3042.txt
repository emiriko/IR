We study the coherent scattering process of a single photon confined in an
one-dimensional (1D) coupled cavity-array, where a $\Lambda$-type three-level
atom is placed inside one of the cavities in the array and behaves as a
functional quantum node (FQN). We show that, through the electromagnetic
induced transparency (EIT) mechanism, the $\Lambda$-type FQN bears complete
control over the reflection and transmission of the incident photon along the
cavity-array. We also demonstrate the emergence of a quasibound state of the
single photon inside a secondary cavity constructed by two distant FQN's as two
end mirrors, from which we are motivated to design an all-optical single photon
storage device of quantum coherence.
