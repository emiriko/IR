We critically examine the question of scaling of the Deep Inelastic
  Scattering process in the medium Bjorken x region on a scalar boson in the
framework of the AdS/QCD correspondence. To get the right polarization
structure of the forward electroproduction amplitude, we show that one needs to
add (at least) the scalar to scalar and scalar to vector hadronic amplitudes.
This illustrates how the partonic picture may emerge from a simple scenario
based on the AdS/QCD correspondence, provided one allows the conformal
dimension of the hadronic field to equal 1 and use the concept of "hadron -
parton duality" .
