We present STAR's measurements of azimuthal correlations between non-photonic
electrons and charged hadrons in p+p, Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV. In
p+p collisions, from the non-photonic e-h correlation we have extracted the
relative B meson semi-leptonic decay contributions to non-photonic electrons up
to electron $p_t \sim 9$ GeV/$c$. In central Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions where a
dense medium is created, we find that the e-h correlation on the away side of
the trigger non-photonic electron has been modified in comparison with the
expectation from PYTHIA simulations.
