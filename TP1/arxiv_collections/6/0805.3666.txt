We construct the states that are invariant under the action of the
generalized squeezing operator $\exp{(z{a^{\dagger k}}-z^*a^k)}$ for arbitrary
positive integer $k$. The states are given explicitly in the number
representation. We find that for a given value of $k$ there are $k$ such
states. We show that the states behave as $n^{-k/4}$ when occupation number
$n\to\infty$. This implies that for any $k\geq3$ the states are normalizable.
For a given $k$, the expectation values of operators of the form $(a^{\dagger}
a)^j$ are finite for positive integer $j < (k/2-1)$ but diverge for integer
$j\geq (k/2-1)$. For $k=3$ we also give an explicit form of these states in the
momentum representation in terms of Bessel functions.
