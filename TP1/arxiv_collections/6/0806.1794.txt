We stabilize an ultraviolet diode laser system at 369.5 nm to the optical
absorption signal from Yb+ ions in a hollow-cathode discharge lamp. The error
signal for stabilization is obtained by Zeeman spectroscopy of the 3 GHz-wide
absorption feature. The frequency stability is independently measured by
comparison against the fluorescence signal from a laser-cooled crystal of
174Yb+ ions in a linear Paul trap. We measure a frequency fluctuation of 1.7
MHz RMS over 1000 s, and a frequency drift of 20 MHz over 7 days. Our method is
suitable for use in quantum information processing experiments with trapped ion
crystals.
