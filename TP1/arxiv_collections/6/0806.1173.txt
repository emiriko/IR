We compute the posterior distributions of the initial population and
parameter of binary branching processes, in the limit of a large number of
generations. We compare this Bayesian procedure with a more na\"ive one, based
on hitting times of some random walks. In both cases, central limit theorems
are available, with explicit variances.
