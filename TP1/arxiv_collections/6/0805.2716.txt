Electronic transport in a triple quantum dot shuttle device in the presence
of an ac field is analyzed within a fully quantum mechanical framework. A
generalized density matrix formalism is used to describe the time evolution for
electronic state occupations in a dissipative phonon bath. In the presence of
an ac gate voltage, the electronic states are dressed by photons and the
interplay between photon and vibrational sidebands produces current
characteristics that obey selection rules. Varying the ac parameters allows to
tune the tunneling current features. In particular, we show that coherent
destruction of tunneling can be achieved in our device.
