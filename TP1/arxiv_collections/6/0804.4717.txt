asteroids or comets have received remarkable attention in the world. In small
body explorations, especially, detailed in-situ surface exploration by tiny
rover is one of effective and fruitful means and is expected to make strong
contributions towards scientific studies. JAXA ISAS is promoting MUSES C
mission, which is the worlds first sample and return attempt to or from the
near earth asteroid. Hayabusa spacecraft in MUSES C mission took the tiny
rover, which was expected to perform the in-situ surface exploration by
hopping. This paper describes the system design, mobility and intelligence of
the developed unmanned explorer. This paper also presents the ground
experimental results and the flight results.
