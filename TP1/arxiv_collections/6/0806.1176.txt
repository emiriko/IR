The modern notion of a black hole singularity is considered with reference to
the Schwarzschild solution to Einstein's field equations of general relativity.
A brief derivation of both the original and the modern line elements is given.
The argument is put forward that the singularity occurring within the
Schwarzschild line element that has been associated with the radius of the
black hole event horizon is, in fact, merely a mathematical occurrence and does
not exist physically. The real aim here, however, is to attempt to open up the
whole problem, draw some conclusions, but finally to urge everyone to consider
the points raised with no preconceived opinions and then come to their own
final conclusion.
