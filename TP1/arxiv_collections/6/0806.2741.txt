We propose a novel method that uses the oscillation of an atomic excited wave
packet observed through a pump-probe technique to accurately determine the zero
time delay between a pair of ultrashort laser pulses. This physically-based
approach provides an easy fix for the intractable problem of synchronizing two
different femtosecond laser pulses in a practical experimental environment,
especially where an in situ time zero measurement with high accuracy is
required.
