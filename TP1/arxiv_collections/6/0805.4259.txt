A notion of geometric symmetry is introduced that generalizes the classical
concepts of Killing fields and other affine collineations. There is a sense in
which flows under these new vector fields minimize deformations of the
connection near a specified observer. Any exact affine collineations that may
exist are special cases. The remaining vector fields can all be interpreted as
analogs of Poincare and other well-known symmetries near timelike worldlines.
Approximate conservation laws generated by these objects are discussed for both
geodesics and extended matter distributions. One example is a generalized Komar
integral that may be taken to define the linear and angular momenta of a
spacetime volume as seen by a particular observer. This is evaluated explicitly
for a gravitational plane wave spacetime.
