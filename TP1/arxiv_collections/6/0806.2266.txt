Thermalization is one of the key questions in understanding the matter
created in Au+Au collisions at RHIC. Heavy-flavor quark collectivity could be
used to indicate the degree of thermalization of the light-flavor quarks. Heavy
quark energy loss could give important information on color charge density of
the medium. Direct reconstruction of open charm hadrons is essential for these
measurements. The Heavy Flavor Tracker (HFT) is a proposed upgrade of the STAR
experiment. Full GEANT simulation of tracking with HFT was performed, showing
its excellent capability to reconstruct open charm hadrons in broad p_T range
at midrapidity. Estimated errors on measurement of D0 meson v_2 and R_{CP} are
presented.
