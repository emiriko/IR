We analyze the production and subsequent decay of the neutral Higgs bosons of
the MSSM into electrically neutral quark pairs qq'=bs,tc of different flavors
at the LHC and compare with the direct FCNC production mechanisms. The
cross-sections are computed in the unconstrained MSSM with minimal
flavor-mixing sources and taking into account the stringent bounds from
radiative B-meson decays. We extend the results previously found for these FCNC
processes, which are singularly uncommon in the SM. Specifically, we report
here on the SUSY-EW contribution of the Higgs-mediated FCNC cross-section into
bs and tc final states and the SUSY-QCD and SUSY-EW contributions to
bs-production. In this way, the complete map of MSSM predictions for the
qq'-pairs produced at the LHC becomes available. The upshot is that the most
favorable channels are: 1) the Higgs boson FCNC decays into bs, and 2) the
direct production of tc pairs, both of them at the 1 pb level and mediated by
SUSY-QCD effects. If, however, the latter are suppressed, we find a small
SUSY-EW yield for the tc-production through Higgs decays but, at the same time,
a cross-section of 0.1-1 pb for bs-production, which implies a significant
number (10^4-10^5) of bs-pairs per 100 inverse femtobarn of integrated
luminosity.
