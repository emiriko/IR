We have performed a detailed Monte Carlo study of a diffusionless
$(1+1)$-dimensional solid-on-solid model of particle deposition and evaporation
that not only tunes the roughness of an equilibrium surface but also
demonstrates the need for more than two exponents to characterize it. The
tunable parameter, denoted by $\mu$, in this model is the dimensionless surface
tension per unit length. For $\mu < 0$, the surface becomes increasingly
spikier and its average width grows linearly with time; for $\mu = 0$, its
width grows as $\sqrt{t}$. On the other hand, for positive $\mu$, the surface
width shows the standard scaling behavior, $\la \sigma_m(t)\ra \sim
M^{\alpha}f(t/M^{\alpha /\beta})$ where $M$ is the substrate size and $f(x) \to
const (x^{\beta})$ for $x$ large (small). The roughness exponent, $\alpha =
1/2$ for $\mu \leq 2$, and $ = 3/5, 4/5 & \sim 1$ for $\mu = 5, 6 & 7$
respectively; the growth exponent, $\beta = 1/4$ for $\mu \leq 2$ and $= 1/2$
for $\mu > \sim 3.5$ respectively. These exponents are different from those of
the height-difference correlation function,$\alpha ' = 1/2, \beta ' = 1/4$ and
$z' = 2$, for higher values of $\mu$ suggesting thereby that the surface could
be self-constraining.
