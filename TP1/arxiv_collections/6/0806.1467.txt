In this paper we investigate the hadron and photon production at forward
rapidities in $pp$ and $pA$ collisions considering two phenomenological models
based on the Color Glass Condensate formalism. The predictions of these models
for the hadron spectra are compared with the dAu and pp RHIC data and the
nuclear modification factor $R_{hA}$ is estimated. Our results demonstrate that
the analysis of the transverse momentum dependence of this factor allows to
discriminate between the phenomenological models. Furthermore, we predict
$R_{hA}$ for photon production at forward rapidities at RHIC and LHC energies
and study the $p_T$ dependence of the photon to pion production ratio.
