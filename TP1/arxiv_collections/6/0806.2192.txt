It has been conjectured that black hole interacting with its surroundings
will obey the Generalized Second Law ($GSL$) of thermodynamics. Conservation of
$GSL$ is due to the fully thermal nature of Hawking radiation and an upper
bound on entropy. We study these aspects for a
Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{\textbf{o}}$m ($RN$)black hole and conjecture that $GSL$
may be conserved if the equation of state of radiation near the horizon is
modified. An upper bound on $S/E$, similar to the Bekenstein form evolves in
the calculation.
