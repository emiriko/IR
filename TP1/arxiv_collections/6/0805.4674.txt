Novel results for the self-consistent single-particle spectral function and
self-energy are presented for non-degenerate one-component Coulomb systems at
various densities and temperatures. The GW^0-method for the dynamical
self-energy is used to include many-particle correlations beyond the
quasi-particle approximation. The self-energy is analysed over a broad range of
densities and temperatures (n=10^17/cm^3-10^27/cm^3, T=10^2 eV/k_B-10^4
eV/k_B). The spectral function shows a systematic behaviour, which is
determined by collective plasma modes at small wavenumbers and converges
towards a quasi-particle resonance at higher wavenumbers. In the low density
limit, the numerical results comply with an analytic scaling law that is
presented for the first time. It predicts a power-law behaviour of the
imaginary part of the self-energy, Im Sigma ~ -n^(1/4). This resolves a long
time problem of the quasi-particle approximation which yields a finite
self-energy at vanishing density.
