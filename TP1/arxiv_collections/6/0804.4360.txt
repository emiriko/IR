In this letter we propose a model that demonstrates the effect of free
surface on the lattice resistance experienced by a moving dislocation in
nanodimensional systems. This effect manifests in an enhanced velocity of
dislocation due to the proximity of the dislocation line to the surface. To
verify this finding, molecular dynamics simulations for an edge dislocation in
bcc molybdenum are performed and the results are found to be in agreement with
the numerical implementations of this model. The reduction in this effect at
higher stresses and temperatures, as revealed by the simulations, confirms the
role of lattice resistance behind the observed change in the dislocation
velocity.
