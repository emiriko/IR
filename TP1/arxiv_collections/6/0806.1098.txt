We calculate the leading order diphoton generalized distribution amplitude by
calculating the amplitude of the process gamma* gamma -> gamma gamma in the low
energy and high photon virtuality region at the Born order and in the leading
logarithmic approximation. As in the case of the anomalous photon structure
functions, the gamma gamma generalized distribution amplitude exhibits a
characteristic \ln Q^2 behaviour and obeys inhomogeneous evolution equations.
