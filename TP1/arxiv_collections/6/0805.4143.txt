We investigate mesoscopic fluctuations in the spin polarization generated by
a static electric field and by Rashba spin-orbit interaction in a disordered 2D
electron gas. In a diagrammatic approach we find that the out-of-plane
polarization -- while being zero for self-averaging systems -- exhibits large
sample-to-sample fluctuations which are shown to be well within experimental
reach. We evaluate the disorder-averaged variance of the susceptibility and
find its dependence on magnetic field, spin-orbit interaction, dephasing, and
chemical potential difference.
