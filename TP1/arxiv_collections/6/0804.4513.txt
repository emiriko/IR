Quantum transition and information properties of the Coulomb coupled trion
(electron-electron-hole) in the double quantum dots under the influence of the
time-dependent electric field have been studied. Tuning the Hubbard interaction
strength amongst the states of electron-hole complexes and the parameters of
the ac field, two strikingly different kinds of approximate qubit can be
constructed within the eight trion states. The similarity and difference
between the electron dynamic entanglement and overlapping of the wavefunction
with the Bell state have been elucidated through analyzing these two kinds of
qubit.
