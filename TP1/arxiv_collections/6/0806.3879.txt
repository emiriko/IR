We study the solutions for fundamental string rotating in a background
generated by a 1+1 dimensional intersection of two orthogonal stacks of
fivebranes in type IIB string theory. We show the existence of magnon like
solutions for the string moving simultaneously in the two spheres in this
background and find the relevant dispersion relation among the various
conserved charges.
