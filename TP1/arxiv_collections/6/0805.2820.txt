A "Two-Spaceship Paradox" in special relativity is resolved and discussed. We
demonstrate a nonstandard resolution to the "two-spaceship paradox" by explicit
calculation using Generalized Principle of limiting 4-dimensional symmetry
proposed in previous paper [1].The physical and geometrical meaning of the
nonholonomic transformations used in special relativity is determined.
