The current and the shot noise in a graphene sheet were analyzed in the
ballistic regime for arbitrary voltage drops between leads and the sheet in the
limit of infinite aspect ratio of the sheet width to its length, when
quantization of transversal wave vectors is not essential. The cases of
coherent and incoherent ballistic transport were compared. At high voltages the
difference with coherent transport is not essential. But at low voltages
conductance and Fano-factor dependences for incoherent transport become
non-monotonous so that the conductance has a minimum and the Fano factor has a
maximum at non-zero voltage bias.
