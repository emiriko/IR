We present an updated phenomenological analysis of the minimal flavor
violating (MFV) effective theory, both at small and large tan beta, in the
sector of Delta F=1 processes. We evaluate the bounds on the scale of new
physics derived from recent measurements (in particular from B to Xs gamma, B
to Xs l+ l-, Bs to mu+ mu- and K to pi nu bar nu) and we use such bounds to
derive a series of model-independent predictions within MFV for future
experimental searches in the flavor sector.
