This paper considers the robust ${\cal D}$-stability margin problem under
polynomic structured real parametric uncertainty. Based on the work of De
Gaston and Safonov (1988), we have developed techniques such as, a parallel
frequency sweeping strategy, different domain splitting schemes, which
significantly reduce the computational complexity and guarantee the
convergence.
