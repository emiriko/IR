Convergence of the solutions of nonhomogeneous linear singularly perturbed
systems to that of the corresponding reduced singular system on the half-line
[0, $\infty $) is considered. To include the situation on a neighborhood of
initial instant, a boundary layer, a distributional approach to convergence is
adopted. An explicit analytical expression for the limit as a distribution is
proved.
