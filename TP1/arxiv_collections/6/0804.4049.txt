We have developed a technique utilizing a double quantum well heterostructure
that allows us to study the effect of a nearby ground-plane on the metallic
behavior in a GaAs two-dimensional hole system (2DHS) in a single sample and
measurement cool-down, thereby maintaining a constant disorder potential. In
contrast to recent measurements of the effect of ground-plane screening of the
long-range Coulomb interaction in the insulating regime, we find surprisingly
little effect on the metallic behavior when we change the distance between the
2DHS and the nearby ground-plane.
