An economic technique for calculation of polarized bremsstrahlung process is
proposed, assuming typical atomic momentum transfer $q\ll m$. The adopted
approach is based on the natural reduction of the matrix element to the form
$V^{\alpha}\gamma^{\alpha}+A_{5}\gamma ^{5}$. Polarization distribution in the
fully differential cross-section is analyzed. It is found that at a given
momentum transfer to the atom polarization in the plane of small radiation
angles is oriented along circles passing through two common points. It is shown
that with angular selection of radiated photons carried out, even with momentum
transfers to the atom being integrated over, for particular radiation angles
polarization may stay as high as 100%. Without angular selection of photons,
only by control of the recoil, it is impossible to gain radiation polarization
above 50%.
