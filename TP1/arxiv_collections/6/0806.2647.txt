The one-dimensional shock structures of magnetosonic waves (MSWs) propagating
in a dissipative quantum plasma medium is studied. A quantum
magnetohydrodynamic (QMHD) model is used to take into account the quantum force
term due to Bohm potential and the pressure-like spin force term for electrons.
The nonlinear evolution (Korteweg de-Vries-Burger) equation, derived to
describe the dynamics of small amplitude MSWs, where the dissipation is
provided by the plasma resistivity, is solved numerically to obtain both
oscillatory and monotonic shock structures. The shock strength decreases with
increasing the effects of collective tunneling and increases with increasing
the effects of spin alignment. The theoretical results could be of importance
for astrophysical (e.g., magnetars) as well as for ultracold laboratory plasmas
(e.g., Rydberg plasmas).
