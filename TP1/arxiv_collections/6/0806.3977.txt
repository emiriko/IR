Models of generalized parton distributions at zero skewness are used to
relate the behavior of deep inelastic scattering quark distributions, evaluated
at high x, to the transverse charge density evaluated at small distances. We
obtain an interpretation of the recently obtained negative central charge
density of the neutron. The d quarks dominate the neutron structure function
for large values of Bjorken x, where the large momentum of the struck quark has
a significant impact on determining the center of momentum, and thus the
``center'' of the nucleon in the transverse position plane.
