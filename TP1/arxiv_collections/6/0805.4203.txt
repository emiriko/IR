Two-dimensional ($p_{x}+ip_{y}$) superfluids/superconductors offer a
playground for studying intriguing physics such as quantum teleportation,
non-Abelian statistics, and topological quantum computation. Creating such a
superfluid in cold fermionic atom optical traps using p-wave Feshbach resonance
is turning out to be challenging. Here we propose a method to create a
$p_{x}+ip_{y}$ superfluid directly from an s-wave interaction making use of a
topological Berry phase, which can be artificially generated. We discuss ways
to detect the spontaneous Hall mass current, which acts as a diagnostic for the
chiral p-wave superfluid.
