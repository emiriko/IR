We present the methods for an early measurement of the inclusive W->ev
production cross section in pp collisions at sqrt(s)= 14 TeV. The methods are
studied assuming 10 inverse picobarn integrated luminosity of the data and
conditions of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the early data taking
period.
