Recent experiments with superconducting qubits are motivated by the goal of
fabricating a quantum computer, but at the same time they illuminate the more
fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics. In this paper we analyze the physics
of switching current measurements from the point of view of macroscopic quantum
mechanics.
