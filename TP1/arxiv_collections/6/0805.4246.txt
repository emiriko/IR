The short-range structure of the 2+1 flavour QCD vacuum is studied through
visualisations of the topological charge density. Of particular interest is a
new Gaussian weighted smearing algorithm which is applied to the rough
topological charge density to disclose underlying long range structure. The
results provide support for the view of the QCD vacuum as a sandwich of
sign-alternating sheets of charge, with a long-range structure hidden beneath.
