We present the first study to examine the validity of the relativistic
impulse approximation (RIA) for describing elastic proton-nucleus scattering at
incident laboratory kinetic energies lower than 200 MeV. For simplicity we
choose a $^{208}$Pb target, which is a spin-saturated spherical nucleus for
which reliable nuclear structure models exist. Microscopic scalar and vector
optical potentials are generated by folding invariant scalar and vector
scattering nucleon-nucleon (NN) amplitudes, based on our recently developed
relativistic meson-exchange model, with Lorentz scalar and vector densities
resulting from the accurately calibrated PK1 relativistic mean field model of
nuclear structure. It is seen that phenomenological Pauli blocking (PB) effects
and density-dependent corrections to $\sigma$N and $\omega$N meson-nucleon
coupling constants modify the RIA microscopic scalar and vector optical
potentials so as to provide a consistent and quantitative description of all
elastic scattering observables, namely total reaction cross sections,
differential cross sections, analyzing powers and spin rotation functions. In
particular, the effect of PB becomes more significant at energies lower than
200 MeV, whereas phenomenological density-dependent corrections to the NN
interaction {\it also} play an increasingly important role at energies lower
than 100 MeV.
