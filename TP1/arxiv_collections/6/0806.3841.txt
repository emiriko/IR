The dependencies of the melting point and the lattice parameter of supported
metal nanoclusters as functions of clusters height are theoretically
investigated in the framework of the uniform approach. The vacancy mechanism
describing the melting point and the lattice parameter shifts in nanoclusters
with decrease of their size is proposed. It is shown that under the high vacuum
conditions (p<10^-7 torr) the essential role in clusters melting point and
lattice parameter shifts is played by the van der Waals forces of
cluster-substrate interation. The proposed model satisfactorily accounts for
the experimental data.
