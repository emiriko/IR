Using spin density functional theory we study the electronic and magnetic
properties of atomically thin, suspended chains containing silver and oxygen
atoms in an alternating sequence. Chains longer than 4 atoms develop a
half-metallic ground state implying fully spin polarized charge carriers. The
conductances of the chains exhibit weak even-odd oscillations around an
anomalously low value of 0.1G_0 (G_0 = 2e^2h) which coincide with the averaged
experimental conductance in the long chain limit. The unusual conductance
properties are explained in terms of a resonating-chain model which takes the
reflection probability and phase-shift of a single bulk-chain interface as the
only input. The model also explains the conductance oscillations for other
metallic chains.
