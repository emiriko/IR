Since it was first applied to the study of nuclear interactions by Wigner and
Dyson, almost 60 years ago, Random Matrix Theory (RMT) has developed into a
field of its own within applied mathematics, and is now essential to many parts
of theoretical physics, from condensed matter to high energy. The fundamental
results obtained so far rely mostly on the theory of random matrices in one
dimension (the dimensionality of the spectrum, or equilibrium probability
density). In the last few years, this theory has been extended to the case
where the spectrum is two-dimensional, or even fractal, with dimensions between
1 and 2. In this article, we review these recent developments and indicate some
physical problems where the theory can be applied.
