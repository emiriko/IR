We report Pauli spin blockade in an impurity defined carbon nanotube double
quantum dot. We observe a pronounced current suppression for negative
source-drain bias voltages which is investigated for both symmetric and
asymmetric coupling of the quantum dots to the leads. The measured differential
conductance agrees well with a theoretical model of a double quantum dot system
in the spin-blockade regime which allows us to estimate the occupation
probabilities of the relevant singlet and triplet states. This work shows that
effective spin-to-charge conversion in nanotube quantum dots is feasible and
opens the possibility of single-spin readout in a material that is not limited
by hyperfine interaction with nuclear spins.
