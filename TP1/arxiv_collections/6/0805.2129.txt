In type III seesaw utilized to explain the observed solar and atmospheric
neutrino oscillations the Standard Model (SM) particle spectrum is extended by
introducing three SU(2)_L triplet fermion fields. This can have important
implications for the SM Higgs boson mass (M_H) bounds based on vacuum stability
and perturbativity arguments. We compute the appropriate renormalization group
equations for type III seesaw, and then proceed to identify regions of the
parameter space such that the SM Higgs boson mass window is enlarged to 125 GeV
< M_H < 174 GeV, with the type III seesaw scale close to TeV. We also display
regions of the parameter space for which the vacuum stability and
perturbativity bounds merge together for large neutrino Yukawa couplings.
Comparison with type I seesaw is also presented.
