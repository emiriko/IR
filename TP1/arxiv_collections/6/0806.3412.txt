We introduce a new class of pseudoprimes-so called "overpseudoprimes" which
is a special subclass of super-Poulet pseudoprimes. Denoting via h(n) the
multiplicative order of 2 modulo n, we show that odd number n is
overpseudoprime iff value of h(n) is invariant of all divisors d>1 of n. In
particular, we prove that all composite Mersenne numbers 2^p-1,where p is
prime, and squares of Wieferich primes are overpseudoprimes. We give also a
generalization of the results on arbitrary base a>1 and prove that every
overpseudoprime is strong pseudoprime of the same base.
