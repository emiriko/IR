The ADHMN construction of magnetic monopoles is given in terms of the
(normalizable) solutions of an associated Weyl equation. We focus here on
solving this equation directly by algebro-geometric means. The (adjoint) Weyl
equation is solved using an ans\"atz of Nahm in terms of Baker-Akhiezer
functions. The solution of Nahm's equation is not directly used in our
development.
