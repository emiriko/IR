Quasi-free photoproduction of eta-mesons off nucleons bound in the deuteron
has been measured with the CBELSA/TAPS detector for incident photon energies up
to 2.5 GeV at the Bonn ELSA accelerator. The eta-mesons have been detected in
coincidence with recoil protons and recoil neutrons, which allows a detailed
comparison of the quasi-free n(gamma,eta)n and p(gamma,eta)p reactions. The
excitation function for eta-production off the neutron shows a pronounced
bump-like structure at W=1.68 GeV (E_g ~ 1 GeV), which is absent for the
proton.
