The Standard Model correctly describes all interactions at (and below) the
electroweak scale. However it does not explain the peculiar pattern of quark,
lepton and neutrino masses. Also charge quantization is not understood. These
are well known motivations to go beyond the Standard Model and to build a Grand
Unified Theory. This extension has several good predictions but the proton
lifetime is huge compared to similar weak decays. This hierarchy problem
suggests two possible extensions of the standard quantum field theory: a non
linear version of the Schroedinger functional equation and Third Quantization.
We will make a comment on the safety of collider physics in the context of the
non linear extension of QFT.
