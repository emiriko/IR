We show characterizations of the class of Cullen-regular functions in the
sense of Gentili-Struppa for any domain $\Omega$ in terms of the Fueter
operator. We then state a Integral Theorem and discuss how it can be used to
define a more general version of Cullen-regularity, that does not require the
function to be of class $C^{1}$.
