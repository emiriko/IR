The Penrose-Banzhaf index and the Shapley-Shubik index are the best-known and
the most used tools to measure political power of voters in simple voting
games. Most methods to calculate these power indices are based on counting
winning coalitions, in particular those coalitions a voter is decisive for. We
present a new combinatorial formula how to calculate both indices solely using
the set of minimal winning coalitions.
