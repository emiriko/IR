Research on spreadsheet errors began over fifteen years ago. During that
time, there has been ample evidence demonstrating that spreadsheet errors are
common and nontrivial. Quite simply, spreadsheet error rates are comparable to
error rates in other human cognitive activities and are caused by fundamental
limitations in human cognition, not mere sloppiness. Nor does ordinary "being
careful" eliminate errors or reduce them to acceptable levels.
