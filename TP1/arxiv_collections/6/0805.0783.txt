Separation logic is a recent extension of Hoare logic for reasoning about
programs with references to shared mutable data structures. In this paper, we
provide a new interpretation of the logic for a programming language with
higher types. Our interpretation is based on Reynolds's relational
parametricity, and it provides a formal connection between separation logic and
data abstraction.
