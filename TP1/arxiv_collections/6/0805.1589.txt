Exclusive photoproduction of dileptons, gamma p ->l+ l- p, will be measured
in ultraperipheral collisions at LHC. The mechanism where the lepton pair comes
from a heavy timelike photon radiated from a quark interferes with the pure QED
process gamma gamma ->l+ l- As an analog of deeply virtual Compton scattering,
this timelike Compton scattering is a way to study generalized parton
distributions in the nucleon or the nucleus. High energy kinematics will enable
to focus on gluon distributions. Nuclear effects may be scrutinized in heavy
ion collisions.
