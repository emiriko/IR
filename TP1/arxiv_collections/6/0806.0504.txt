We present a model for the description of nuclear matter and finite nuclei,
and at the same time, for the study of medium modifications of nucleon
properties. The nucleons are described as nontopological solitons which
interact through the self-consistent exchange of scalar and vector mesons. The
model explicitly incorporates quark degrees of freedom into nuclear many-body
systems and provides satisfactory results on the nuclear properties. The
present model predicts a significant increase of the nucleon radius at normal
nuclear matter density. It is very interesting to see the nucleon properties
change from the nuclear surface to the nuclear interior.
