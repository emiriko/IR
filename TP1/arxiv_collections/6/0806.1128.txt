We report on visible light emission from Si-nanocrystal based optically
active microdisk resonators. The room temperature photoluminescence (PL) from
single microdisks shows the characteristic modal structure of
whispering-gallery modes. The emission is both TE and TM-polarized in 300 nm
thick microdisks, while thinner ones (135 nm) support only TE-like modes.
Thinner disks have the advantage to filter out higher order radial mode
families, allowing for measuring only the most intense first order modal
structure. We reveal subnanometer linewidths and corresponding quality factors
as high as 2800, limited by the spectral resolution of the experimental setup.
Moreover,we observe a modification of mode linewidth by a factor 13 as a
function of pump power. The origin of this effect is attributed to an excited
carrier absorption loss mechanism.
