In this talk I will review my work on the description of high energy
scattering in QCD, in particular the fireball observed at RHIC, as well as
predictions for the LHC. The aim is to see how much we can learn about actual
QCD (nonsupersymmetric, $N_c=3$), without knowing the details of the gravity
dual of QCD. Experimental predictions are consistent with data, and important
consequences are obtained for the LHC, in particular for the $pp$ collisions.
The RHIC and LHC correspond to the regime of Froissart bound saturation, in the
Heisenberg model. Asymptotically, the RHIC fireball is mapped to a dual black
hole in the IR of the dual. A simple (and unique) scalar field theory model for
the RHIC fireball indeed exhibits the properties of the dual black hole: a
thermal horizon and aparent information loss.
