We construct the free field representation of the affine currents,
energy-momentum tensor and screening currents of the first kind of the current
superalgebra $gl(m|n)_k$ uniformly for $m=n$ and $m\neq n$. The energy-momentum
tensor is given by a linear combination of two Sugawara tensors associated with
the two independent quadratic Casimir elements of $gl(m|n)$.
