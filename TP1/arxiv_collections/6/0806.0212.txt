A method to create paired atom laser beams from a metastable helium atom
laser via four-wave mixing is demonstrated. Radio frequency outcoupling is used
to extract atoms from a Bose Einstein condensate near the center of the
condensate and initiate scattering between trapped and untrapped atoms. The
unequal strengths of the interactions for different internal states allows an
energy-momentum resonance which leads to the creation of pairs of atoms
scattered from the zero-velocity condensate. The resulting scattered beams are
well separated from the main atom laser in the 2-dimensional transverse atom
laser profile. Numerical simulations of the system are in good agreement with
the observed atom laser spatial profiles, and indicate that the scattered beams
are generated by a four-wave mixing process, suggesting that the beams are
correlated.
