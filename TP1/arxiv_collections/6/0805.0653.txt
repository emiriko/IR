An analysis of electroweak corrections to the anomalous dipole moments of
lepton from some special two-loop diagrams where a closed neutralino/chargino
loop is inserted into relevant one-loop diagrams of the standard model is
presented in the split supersymmetry scenarios. Considering the translational
invariance of the inner loop momenta and the electromagnetic gauge invariance,
we get all dimension 6 operators and their coefficients. After applying
equations of motion to the external leptons, we obtain the anomalous dipole
moments of lepton. The numerical results imply that there is parameter space
where the contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment from this
sector is perhaps significant, and the contribution to the electron electric
dipole moment from this sector is sizable enough to be observed in next
generation experiments.
