We extend a tight-binding method to include the effects of spin-orbit
coupling, and apply it to the study of the electronic properties of the
actinide elements Th, U, and Pu. These tight-binding parameters are determined
for the fcc crystal structure using the equivalent equilibrium volumes. In
terms of the single particle energies and the electronic density of states, the
overall quality of the tight-binding representation is excellent and of the
same quality as without spin-orbit coupling. The values of the optimized
tight-binding spin-orbit coupling parameters are comparable to those determined
from purely atomic calculations.
