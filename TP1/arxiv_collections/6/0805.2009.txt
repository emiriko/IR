The ground state of the multi-flavor 2-dimensional quantum electrodynamics
(QED_2) is determined in the presence of finite baryon density, and it is shown
that the model possesses two phases, the low density phase where the external
baryon density is totally screened, and the high density phase, where the
screening is only partial. The renormalization of the bosonized version of the
model is also performed for both the zero and the finite density model giving
massless multi-flavor QED_2 in both cases.
