A new kind of Multi-gap Resistive Plate Chamber (MRPC) has been built for the
large-area Muon Telescope Detector (MTD) for the STAR experiment at RHIC. These
long read-out strip MRPCs (LMRPCs) have an active area of 87.0 x 17.0 cm2 and
ten 250 um-thick gas gaps arranged as a double stack. Each read-out strip is
2.5 cm wide and 90 cm long. The signals are read-out at both ends of each
strip. Cosmic ray tests indicate a time resolution of ~70 ps and a detection
efficiency of greater than 95%. Beam tests performed at T963 at Fermilab
indicate a time resolution of 60-70 ps and a spatial resolution of ~1 cm along
the strip direction.
