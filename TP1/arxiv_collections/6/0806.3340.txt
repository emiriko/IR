The prediction and prevention of spinal injury is an important aspect of
preventive health science. The spine, or vertebral column, represents a chain
of 26 movable vertebral bodies, joint together by transversal viscoelastic
intervertebral discs and longitudinal elastic tendons. This paper proposes a
new locally-coupled loading-rate hypothesis}, which states that the main cause
of both soft- and hard-tissue spinal injury is a localized Euclidean jolt, or
SE(3)-jolt, an impulsive loading that strikes a localized spine in several
coupled degrees-of-freedom simultaneously. To show this, based on the
previously defined covariant force law, we formulate the coupled Newton-Euler
dynamics of the local spinal motions and derive from it the corresponding
coupled SE(3)-jolt dynamics. The SE(3)-jolt is the main cause of two basic
forms of spinal injury: (i) hard-tissue injury of local translational
dislocations; and (ii) soft-tissue injury of local rotational disclinations.
Both the spinal dislocations and disclinations, as caused by the SE(3)-jolt,
are described using the Cosserat multipolar viscoelastic continuum model.
