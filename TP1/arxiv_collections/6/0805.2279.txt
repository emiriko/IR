The kinematic distributions in two-particle inclusive processes at an e+e-
collider arising from standard-model s-channel exchange of a virtual gamma or Z
and the interference of the standard-model contribution with contributions from
physics beyond the standard model involving s-channel exchanges are derived
entirely in terms of the space-time signature of such new physics. Transverse
as well as longitudinal polarizations of the electron and positron beams are
taken into account. We show how these model-independent distributions can be
used to deduce some general properties of the nature of the interaction. We
then specialize to two specific two-particle final states, viz., ZH, where H is
one of the Higgs bosons in a model with an extended Higgs sector, and f fbar,
where f, fbar are a pair of conjugate charged fermions, wherein distributions
of two (of the possibly several) decay products are measured. We show how some
of the properties of the distributions have been realized in the analysis of
physics beyond the standard model in earlier work which made use of
two-particle angular distributions.
