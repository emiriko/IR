''Massless'' spin-2 field equation in de Sitter space, which is invariant
under the conformal transformation, has been obtained. The frame work utilized
is the symmetric rank-2 tensor field of the conformal group. Our method is
based on the group theoretical approach and six-cone formalism, initially
introduced by Dirac. Dirac's six-cone is used to obtain conformally invariant
equations on de Sitter space. The solution of the physical sector of massless
spin-2 field (linear gravity) in de Sitter ambient space is written as a
product of a generalized polarization tensor and a massless minimally coupled
scalar field. Similar to the minimally coupled scalar field, for quantization
of this sector, the Krein space quantization is utilized. We have calculated
the physical part of the linear graviton two-point function. This two-point
function is de Sitter invariant and free of pathological large distance
behavior.
