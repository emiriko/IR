Electromagnetic characteristics of single-walled finite-length carbon
nanotubes - absorption cross-section and field enhancement in the near zone -
are theoretically studied in a wide frequency range from terahertz to visible.
The analysis is based on the impedance-type effective boundary conditions and
the integral equation technique. Comparison with experimental results is
carried out allowing qualitative physical interpretation of low-frequency
(far-IR and terahertz) absorption band observed in experiments. Potentiality of
CNTs for the IR photothermolysis of living cells is discussed. Strong local
field enhancement is predicted to be inherent to metallic CNTs in the
near-field zone providing necessary mechanism for far-IR and terahertz
near-field optics.
