The ferroelectric properties of MnWO4 single crystal have been investigated.
Despite a relatively low remanent polarization, we show that the sample is
ferroelectric. The shape of the ferroelectric loop of MnWO4 strongly depends on
magnetic field and temperature. While its dependence does not directly
correlate with the magnetocapacitance effect before the paraelectric
transition, the effect of magnetic field on the ferroelectric polarization loop
supports magnetoelectric coupling.
