We prove the existence of infinitely many periodic solutions and complicated
dynamics, due to the presence of a topological horseshoe, for the classical
Volterra predator--prey model with a periodic harvesting. The proof relies on
some recent results about chaotic planar maps combined with the study of
geometric features which are typical of linked twist maps.
