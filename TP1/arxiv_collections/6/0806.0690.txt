This paper extends our recently developed Life Space Foam (LSF) model of
motivated cognitive dynamics \cite{IA}. LSF uses adaptive path integrals to
generate Lewinian force--fields on smooth manifolds, in order to characterize
the dynamics of individual goal--directed action. According to explanatory
theories growing in acceptance in cognitive neuroscience, one of the key
properties of this dynamics, capable of linking it to microscopic-level
cortical neurodynamics, is its meta-stability and the resulting phase
transitions. Our extended LSF model incorporates the notion of phase
transitions and complements it with embedded geometrical chaos. To describe
this LSF phase transition, a general path--integral is used, along the
corresponding LSF topology change. As a result, our extended LSF model is able
to rigorously represent co-action by two or more actors in the common
LSF--manifold. The model yields substantial qualitative differences in
geometrical properties between bilateral and multi-lateral co-action due to
intrinsic chaotic coupling between $n$ actors when $n\geq 3$.
