We show that the electromagnetic excitations of the Kerr black hole have very
strong back reaction on metric. In particular, the electromagnetic excitations
aligned with the Kerr congruence form the light-like beams which overcome
horizon, forming the holes in it, which allows matter to escape interior. So,
there is no information lost inside the black hole. This effect is based
exclusively on the analyticity of the algebraically special solutions.
