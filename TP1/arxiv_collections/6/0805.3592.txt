The optical quantum computer is one of the few experimental systems to have
demonstrated small scale quantum information processing. Making use of cavity
quantum electrodynamics approaches to operator measurements, we detail an
optical network for the deterministic preparation of arbitrarily large
two-dimensional cluster states. We show that this network can form the basis of
a large scale deterministic optical quantum computer that can be fabricated
entirely on chip.
