The prediction and prevention of traumatic brain injury is a very important
aspect of preventive medical science. This paper proposes a new coupled
loading-rate hypothesis for the traumatic brain injury (TBI), which states that
the main cause of the TBI is an external Euclidean jolt, or SE(3)-jolt, an
impulsive loading that strikes the head in several coupled degrees-of-freedom
simultaneously. To show this, based on the previously defined covariant force
law, we formulate the coupled Newton-Euler dynamics of brain's micro-motions
within the cerebrospinal fluid and derive from it the coupled SE(3)-jolt
dynamics. The SE(3)-jolt is a cause of the TBI in two forms of brain's rapid
discontinuous deformations: translational dislocations and rotational
disclinations. Brain's dislocations and disclinations, caused by the
SE(3)-jolt, are described using the Cosserat multipolar viscoelastic continuum
brain model.
