Systems of systems (SoS) are a hot topic in our "fully connected global
world". Our aim is not to provide another definition of what SoS are, but
rather to focus on the adequacy of reusing standard system architecting
techniques within this approach in order to improve performance, fault
detection and safety issues in large-scale coupled systems that definitely
qualify as SoS, whatever the definition is. A key issue will be to secure the
availability of the services provided by the SoS despite the evolution of the
various systems composing the SoS. We will also tackle contracting issues and
responsibility transfers, as they should be addressed to ensure the expected
behavior of the SoS whilst the various independently contracted systems evolve
asynchronously.
