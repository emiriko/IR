In the context of the recent interest in solvable models of scattering
mediated by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians (cf. H. F. Jones, Phys. Rev. D 76,
125003 (2007)) we show that and how the well known variability of our ad hoc
choice of the metric $\Theta$ which defines the physical Hilbert space of
states can help us to clarify several apparent paradoxes. We argue that with a
suitable $\Theta$ a fully plausible physical picture of the scattering is
recovered. Quantitatively, our new recipe is illustrated on an exactly solvable
toy model.
