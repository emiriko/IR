I will present an overview of identified particle spectra at high $p_T$
($p_T{}^{>}_{\sim}$ 5 GeV/$c$) in both p+p collisions and AA collisions at
RHIC. In p+p collisions, summary of particle ratios of K, $\eta$, $\omega$,
$\rho$, $\phi$, $p$, $\bar{p}$, $\Lambda$ and heavy-flavor (open charm,
$J/\Psi$) to $\pi$ at high-pt will be compiled and compared to the ratios of
integrated yields. The spectra are used in $x_t$ scaling study and compared to
pQCD calculations. These will help us establish particle composition in jets
and the quark and gluon contributions to hadron production at high $p_T$.
Similar jet chemistry has been extracted in Au+Au data in search for a
quantitative measure of color charge dependence of jet energy loss.
