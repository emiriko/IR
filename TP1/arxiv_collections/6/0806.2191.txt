At interfaces between polar and nonpolar perovskite oxides, an unusual
electron-doping has been previously observed, due to electronic
reconstructions. We report on remote hole-doping at an interface composed of
only polar layers, revealed by high-resolution hard x-ray core-level
photoemission spectroscopy. In LaAlO3/LaVO3/LaAlO3 trilayers, the vanadium
valence systematically evolves from the bulk value of V3+ to higher oxidation
states with decreasing LaAlO3 cap layer thickness. These results provide a
synthetic approach to hole-doping transition metal oxide heterointerfaces
without invoking a polar discontinuity.
