SmFeAsO and the isostructural superconducting SmFeAs(O0.93F0.07) samples were
prepared. Characterization by means of Rietveld refinement of X-ray powder
diffraction data, scanning electron microscope observation, transmission
electron microscope analysis, resistivity and magnetization measurements were
carried out. Sintering treatment strongly improves the grain connectivity, but,
on the other hand, induces a competition between the thermodynamic stability of
the oxy-pnictide and Sm2O3, hence worsening the purity of the sample. In the
pristine sample both magnetization and resistivity measurements clearly
indicate that two different sources of magnetism are present: the former
related to Fe ordering at 140 K and the latter due to the Sm ions that orders
antiferromagnetically at low temperature. The feature at 140 K disappears in
the F-substituted sample and, at low temperatures a superconducting transition
appears. The magnetoresistivity curves of the F-substituted sample probably
indicates very high critical field values.
