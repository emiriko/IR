In advancing discrete-based computational cancer models towards clinical
applications, one faces the dilemma of how to deal with an ever growing amount
of biomedical data that ought to be incorporated eventually in one form or
another. Model scalability becomes of paramount interest. In an effort to start
addressing this critical issue, here, we present a novel multi-scale and
multi-resolution agent-based in silico glioma model. While "multi-scale" refers
to employing an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-driven molecular
network to process cellular phenotypic decisions within the micro-macroscopic
environment, "multi-resolution" is achieved through algorithms that classify
cells to either active or inactive spatial clusters, which determine the
resolution they are simulated at. The aim is to assign computational resources
where and when they matter most for maintaining or improving the predictive
power of the algorithm, onto specific tumor areas and at particular times.
Using a previously described 2D brain tumor model, we have developed four
different computational methods for achieving the multi-resolution scheme,
three of which are designed to dynamically train on the high-resolution
simulation that serves as control. To quantify the algorithms' performance, we
rank them by weighing the distinct computational time savings of the simulation
runs versus the methods' ability to accurately reproduce the high-resolution
results of the control. Finally, to demonstrate the flexibility of the
underlying concept, we show the added value of combining the two highest-ranked
methods.
