Magnetization process of the mixed spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 Ising-Heisenberg
diamond chain is examined by combining three exact analytical techniques: Kambe
projection method, decoration-iteration transformation and transfer-matrix
method. Multiple frustration-induced plateaus in a magnetization process of
this geometrically frustrated system are found provided that a relative ratio
between the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg- and Ising-type interactions exceeds
some particular value. By contrast, there is just a single magnetization
plateau if the frustrating Heisenberg interaction is sufficiently small
compared to the Ising one.
