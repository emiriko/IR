We consider two different collective spin systems subjected to strong
dissipation -- on the same scale as interaction strengths and external fields
-- and show that either continuous or discontinuous dissipative quantum phase
transitions can occur as the dissipation strength is varied. First, we consider
a well known model of cooperative resonance fluorescence that can exhibit a
second-order quantum phase transition, and analyze the entanglement properties
near the critical point. Next, we examine a dissipative version of the
Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick interacting collective spin model, where we find that
either first- or second-order quantum phase transitions can occur, depending
only on the ratio of the interaction and external field parameters. We give
detailed results and interpretation for the steady state entanglement in the
vicinity of the critical point, where it reaches a maximum. For the first-order
transition we find that the semiclassical steady states exhibit a region of
bistability.
