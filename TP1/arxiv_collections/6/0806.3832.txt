It is shown that on a finite phase plane the $kq$-coordinates and the sites
of a von Neumann lattice are conjugate to one another. This elementary result
holds when the number $M$ defining the size of the phase plane can be expressed
as a product, $M=M_{1}M_{2}$, with $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ being relatively prime.
As a consequence of this result a hitherto unknown wave function is defined
giving the probability of simultaneously measuring the momentum and coordinate
on the von Neumann lattice.
