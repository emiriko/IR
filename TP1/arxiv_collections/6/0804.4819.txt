We study the minimum backlog problem (MBP). This online problem arises, e.g.,
in the context of sensor networks. We focus on two main variants of MBP.
  The discrete MBP is a 2-person game played on a graph $G=(V,E)$. The player
is initially located at a vertex of the graph. In each time step, the adversary
pours a total of one unit of water into cups that are located on the vertices
of the graph, arbitrarily distributing the water among the cups. The player
then moves from her current vertex to an adjacent vertex and empties the cup at
that vertex. The player's objective is to minimize the backlog, i.e., the
maximum amount of water in any cup at any time.
  The geometric MBP is a continuous-time version of the MBP: the cups are
points in the two-dimensional plane, the adversary pours water continuously at
a constant rate, and the player moves in the plane with unit speed. Again, the
player's objective is to minimize the backlog.
  We show that the competitive ratio of any algorithm for the MBP has a lower
bound of $\Omega(D)$, where $D$ is the diameter of the graph (for the discrete
MBP) or the diameter of the point set (for the geometric MBP). Therefore we
focus on determining a strategy for the player that guarantees a uniform upper
bound on the absolute value of the backlog.
  For the absolute value of the backlog there is a trivial lower bound of
$\Omega(D)$, and the deamortization analysis of Dietz and Sleator gives an
upper bound of $O(D\log N)$ for $N$ cups. Our main result is a tight upper
bound for the geometric MBP: we show that there is a strategy for the player
that guarantees a backlog of $O(D)$, independently of the number of cups.
