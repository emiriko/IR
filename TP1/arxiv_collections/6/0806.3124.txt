Linear covariant gauges, such as Feynman gauge, are very useful in
perturbative calculations. Their nonperturbative formulation is, however,
highly non-trivial. In particular, it is a challenge to define linear covariant
gauges on a lattice. We consider a class of gauges in lattice gauge theory that
coincides with the perturbative definition of linear covariant gauges in the
formal continuum limit. The corresponding gauge-fixing procedure is described
and analyzed in detail, with an application to the pure SU(2) case. In
addition, results for the gluon propagator in the two-dimensional case are
given.
