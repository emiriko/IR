We have obtained the explicit versions and precisions for the Hodge-Riemann
decomposition of formes on affine algebraic curve V. The main application
consists in the construction of Faddeev-Green function for Laplacian on V.
Basing on this [HM](arXiv:0804.3951 and J.Geom.Anal., 2008,18), we extended
from the case X in C to the case of bordered Riemann surface X in V the
R.Novikov (1988) scheme for the effective reconstruction of conductivity
function sigma on X through Dirichlet-to-Neumann mapping on bX for solutions of
d(sigma d^cU)=0. In Sec.4 we give a correction of the paper [HM].
