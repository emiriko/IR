We present experimental results on turbulence generated in thin fluid layers
in the presence of a large-scale coherent flow, or a spectral condensate. It is
shown that the condensate modifies the third-order velocity moment in a much
wider interval of scales than the second one. The modification may include the
change of sign of the third moment in the inverse cascade. This observation may
help resolve a controversy on the energy flux in mesoscale atmospheric
turbulence (10-500 km): to recover a correct energy flux from the third
velocity moment one needs first to subtract the coherent flow. We find that the
condensate also increases the velocity flatness.
