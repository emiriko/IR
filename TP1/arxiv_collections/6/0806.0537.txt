We present two novel methods for performing logic operations. Our methods are
based on using the time dimension for programming and data representation. The
first method is based on varying the sampling moment in time of a neuronal
action potential, and the second method is based on a neural delay system,
where the generation of the action potential is delayed by specific time
lengths, to be sampled at a fixed moment in time. Both methods are supported by
explicit examples.
