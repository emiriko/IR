This paper considers a wide family of semiparametric repeated measures
regression models, in which the main interest is on estimating population-level
quantities such as mean, variance, probabilities etc. Examples of our framework
include generalized linear models for clustered/longitudinal data, among many
others. We derive plug-in kernel-based estimators of the population level
quantities and derive their asymptotic distribution. An example involving
estimation of the survival function of hemoglobin measures in the Kenya
hemoglobin study data is presented to demonstrate our methodology.
