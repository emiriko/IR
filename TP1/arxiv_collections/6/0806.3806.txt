It is demonstrated that the well-known Smale-horseshoe chaos exists in the
time evolution of the one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) driven by
the time-periodic harmonic or inverted-harmonic potential. A formally exact
solution of the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation is constructed, which
describes the matter shock waves with chaotic or periodic amplitudes and
phases. When the periodic driving is switched off and the number of condensed
atoms is conserved, we obtained the exact stationary states and non-stationary
states. The former contains the stable non-propagated shock wave, and in the
latter the shock wave alternately collapses and grows for the harmonic trapping
or propagates with exponentially increased shock-front speed for the
antitrapping. It is revealed that existence of chaos play a role for
suppressing the blast of matter wave. The results suggest a method for
preparing the exponentially accelerated BEC shock waves or the stable
stationary states.
