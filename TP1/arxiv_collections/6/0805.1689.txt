We present a Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) technique to study the source
parameters of gravitational-wave signals from the inspirals of stellar-mass
compact binaries detected with ground-based gravitational-wave detectors such
as LIGO and Virgo, for the case where spin is present in the more massive
compact object in the binary. We discuss aspects of the MCMC algorithm that
allow us to sample the parameter space in an efficient way. We show sample runs
that illustrate the possibilities of our MCMC code and the difficulties that we
encounter.
