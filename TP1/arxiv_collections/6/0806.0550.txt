A master equation expressing the classical integrability of two-dimensional
non-linear sigma models is found. The geometrical properties of this equation
are outlined. In particular, a closer connection between integrability and
T-duality transformations is emphasised. Finally, a whole new class of
integrable non-linear sigma models is found and all their corresponding Lax
pairs depend on a spectral parameter.
