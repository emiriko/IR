Inspired by the classical category theorems of Halmos and Rohlin for the
discrete measure preserving transformations, we prove analogous results in the
abstract setting of unitary and isometric C_0-semigroups on a separable Hilbert
space. More presicely, we show that the set of all weakly stable unitary groups
(isometric semigroups) is of first category, while the set of all almost weakly
stable unitary groups (isometric semigroups) is residual for an appropriate
topology.
