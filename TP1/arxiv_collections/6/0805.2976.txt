Synchronization processes in populations of locally interacting elements are
in the focus of intense research in physical, biological, chemical,
technological and social systems. The many efforts devoted to understand
synchronization phenomena in natural systems take now advantage of the recent
theory of complex networks. In this review, we report the advances in the
comprehension of synchronization phenomena when oscillating elements are
constrained to interact in a complex network topology. We also overview the new
emergent features coming out from the interplay between the structure and the
function of the underlying pattern of connections. Extensive numerical work as
well as analytical approaches to the problem are presented. Finally, we review
several applications of synchronization in complex networks to different
disciplines: biological systems and neuroscience, engineering and computer
science, and economy and social sciences.
