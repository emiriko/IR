We try to embed a t-design in a finite commutative group in such a way that
the sum of the k points of a block is zero. We can compute the number of blocks
of the boolean 2-design having all the non zero vectors of $(Z_2)^n$ as the set
of points and the k-subsets of elements the sum of which is zero as blocks.
