Recursion relations are succinctly obtained for $(++... +)$ and $(-++... +)$
amplitudes in the context of the space-cone gauge in QCD. We rely on the
helicity symmetry of the problems to dictate our choices of reference twistors
and the momentum shifts to complexify the amplitudes. Of great importance is
the power of gauge Lorentz invariance, which is enough to determine the soft
factors in the latter cases.
