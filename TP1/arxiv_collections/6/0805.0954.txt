We consider the problem of optimizing a nonlinear objective function over a
weighted independence system presented by a linear-optimization oracle. We
provide a polynomial-time algorithm that determines an r-best solution for
nonlinear functions of the total weight of an independent set, where r is a
constant that depends on certain Frobenius numbers of the individual weights
and is independent of the size of the ground set. In contrast, we show that
finding an optimal (0-best) solution requires exponential time even in a very
special case of the problem.
