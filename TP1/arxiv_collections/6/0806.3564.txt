We consider classical and quantum propagators for two different time
intervals. If these propagators follow one another in a Fibonacci sequence we
get a discrete quasiperiodic system. A theorem due to Nielsen provides a novel
conserved quantity for this system. The Nielsen quantity controls the
transition between commutative and non-commutative propagation in time. The
quasiperiodically kicked oscillator moreover is dominated by quasiperiodic
analogues of the Floquet theorem.
