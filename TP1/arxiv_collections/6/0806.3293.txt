There is general agreement that the MiSaTaQuWa equations should describe the
motion of a "small body" in general relativity, taking into account the leading
order self-force effects. However, previous derivations of these equations have
made a number of ad hoc assumptions and/or contain a number of unsatisfactory
features. For example, all previous derivations have invoked, without proper
justification, the step of "Lorenz gauge relaxation", wherein the linearized
Einstein equation is written down in the form appropriate to the Lorenz gauge,
but the Lorenz gauge condition is then not imposed--thereby making the
resulting equations for the metric perturbation inequivalent to the linearized
Einstein equations. In this paper, we analyze the issue of "particle motion" in
general relativity in a systematic and rigorous way by considering a
one-parameter family of metrics, $g_{ab} (\lambda)$, corresponding to having a
body (or black hole) that is "scaled down" to zero size and mass in an
appropriate manner. We prove that the limiting worldline of such a
one-parameter family must be a geodesic of the background metric, $g_{ab}
(\lambda=0)$. Gravitational self-force--as well as the force due to coupling of
the spin of the body to curvature--then arises as a first-order perturbative
correction in $\lambda$ to this worldline. No assumptions are made in our
analysis apart from the smoothness and limit properties of the one-parameter
family of metrics. Our approach should provide a framework for systematically
calculating higher order corrections to gravitational self-force, including
higher multipole effects, although we do not attempt to go beyond first order
calculations here. The status of the MiSaTaQuWa equations is explained.
