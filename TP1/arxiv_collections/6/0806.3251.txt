Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis and Maldacena have recently proposed a dual
gravitational description for a family of superconformal Chern Simons theories
in three spacetime dimensions. In this note we perform the one loop computation
that determines the field theory superconformal index of this theory and
compare with the index computed over the Fock space of dual supersymmetric
gravitons. In the appropriate limit (large $N$ and large $k$) we find a perfect
match.
