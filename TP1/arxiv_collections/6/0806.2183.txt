We describe an effective resonant interaction between two localized wave
modes of different nature: a plasmon-polariton at a metal surface and a
self-focusing beam (spatial soliton) in a non-linear dielectric medium.
Propagating in the same direction, they represent an exotic coupled-waveguide
system, where the resonant interaction is controlled by the soliton amplitude.
This non-linear system manifests hybridized plasmon-soliton eigenmodes, mutual
conversion, and non-adiabatic switching, which offer exciting opportunities for
manipulation of plasmons via spatial solitons.
