We present a simple analytical tool which gives an approximate insight into
the stationary behavior of nonlinear systems undergoing the influence of a weak
and rapid noise from one dominating source, e.g. the kinetic equations
describing a genetic switch with the concentration of one substrate fluctuating
around a constant mean. The proposed method allows for predicting the
asymmetric response of the genetic switch to noise, arising from the
noise-induced shift of stationary states. The method has been tested on an
example model of the lac operon regulatory network: a reduced Yildirim-Mackey
model with fluctuating extracellular lactose concentration. We calculate
analytically the shift of the system's stationary states in the presence of
noise. The results of the analytical calculation are in excellent agreement
with the results of numerical simulation of the noisy system. The simulation
results suggest that the structure of the kinetics of the underlying
biochemical reactions protects the bistability of the lactose utilization
mechanism from environmental fluctuations. We also show that, in the
consequence of the noise-induced shift of stationary states, the presence of
fluctuations stabilizes the behavior of the system in a selective way: although
the extrinsic noise facilitates, to some extent, switching off the lactose
metabolism, the same noise prevents it from switching on.
