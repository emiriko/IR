The set of known dialects of the genetic code (GC) is analyzed from the
viewpoint of the genetic octave Yin-Yang-algebra. This algebra was described in
the previous author's publications. The algebra was discovered on the basis of
structural features of the GC in the matrix form of its presentation ("matrix
genetics"). The octave Yin-Yang-algebra is considered as the pre-code or as the
model of the GC. From the viewpoint of this algebraic model, for example, the
sets of 20 amino acids and of 64 triplets consist of sub-sets of "male",
"female" and "androgynous" molecules, etc. This algebra permits to reveal
hidden peculiarities of the structure and evolution of the GC and to propose
the conception of "sexual" relationships among genetic molecules. The first
results of the analysis of the GC systems from such algebraic viewpoint say
about the close connection between evolution of the GC and this algebra. They
include 8 evolutionary rules of the dialects of the GC. The evolution of the GC
is appeared as the struggle between male and female beginnings. The hypothesis
about new biophysical factor of "sexual" interactions among genetic molecules
is put forward. The matrix forms of presentation of elements of the genetic
octave Yin-Yang-algebra are connected with Hadamard matrices by means of the
simple U-algorithm. Hadamard matrices play a significant role in the theory of
quantum computers, in particular. It gives new opportunities for possible
understanding the GC systems as quantum computer systems. Revealed algebraic
properties of the GC permit to put forward the problem of algebraization of
bioinformatics on the basis of the algebras of the GC. Our investigation is
connected with the question: what is life from the viewpoint of algebra? The
algebraic version of the origin of the GC is discussed.
