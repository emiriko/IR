An analytical model for the soliton-potential interaction is presented, by
constructing a collective coordinate for the system. Most of the characters of
the interaction are derived analytically while they are calculated by other
models numerically. We will find that the behaviour of the soliton is like a
point particle living under the influence of a complicated potential which is a
function of soliton velocity and the potential parameters. The analytic model
does not have a clear prediction for the islands of initial velocities in which
the soliton may reflect back or escape over the potential well.
