Lattice theory is used to explain the rest masses of the stable mesons and
baryons and their spin. From the mass of the charged pi-mesons follows the mass
of the muons. From the mass of the muons follows the mass of the electron. We
do not use hypothetical particles. Only photons, neutrinos and charge are
needed to explain the mass of the elementary particles.
