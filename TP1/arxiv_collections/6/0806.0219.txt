We consider 1-forms on, so called, essentially isolated determinantal
singularities (a natural generalization of isolated ones), show how to define
analogues of the Poincar\'e--Hopf index for them, and describe relations
between these indices and the radial index. For isolated determinantal
singularities, we discuss properties of the homological index of a holomorphic
1-form and its relation with the Poincar\'e--Hopf index.
