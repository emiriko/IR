We investigate two closely related subjects: (i) existence of a pure
persistent spin current in semiconducting mesoscopic device with a spin-orbit
interaction's (SOI), and (ii) the definition of the spin current in the
presence of SOI. Through physical argument from four physical pictures in
different aspects, we provide strong evidences that the persistent spin current
does exist in a device with SOI in the absence of any magnetic materials. This
persistent spin current is an analog of the persistent charge current in a
mesoscopic ring threaded by a magnetic flux, and it describes the real spin
motion and can be measured experimentally. We then investigate the definition
of the spin current. We point out that (i) the non-zero spin current in the
equilibrium SOI device is the persistent spin current, (ii) the spin current is
in general not conserved, and (iii) the Onsager relation is violated for the
spin transport no matter what definition of the spin current is used. These
issues, the non-zero spin current in the equilibrium case, the non-conserved
spin current, and the violation of the Onsager relation, are intrinsic
properties of spin transport. We note that the conventional definition of the
spin current has very clear physical intuition and describes the spin motion
very well. Therefore we feel that the conventional definition of the spin
current makes physical sense and there is no need to modify it. In addition,
the relationship between the persistent spin current and transport spin
current, the persistent linear and angular spin currents in the SOI region of
the hybrid ring, are discussed. Finally, we show that if the spin-spin
interaction is included into the Hamiltonian, the persistent spin current is
automatically conserved using the conventional definition.
