The process of phase separation of binary systems is described by the
Cahn-Hilliard equation. The main objective of this article is to give a
classification on the dynamic phase transitions for binary systems using either
the classical Cahn-Hilliard equation or the Cahn-Hilliard equation coupled with
entropy, leading to some interesting physical predictions. The analysis is
based on dynamic transition theory for nonlinear systems and new classification
scheme for dynamic transitions, developed recently by the authors.
