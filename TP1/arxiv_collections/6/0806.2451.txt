We demonstrate that Ta sheathed SmO1-xFxFeAs wires were successfully
fabricated by the powder-in-tube (PIT) method for the first time. Structural
analysis by mean of x-ray diffraction shows that the main phase of SmO1-xFxFeAs
was obtained by this synthesis method. The transition temperature of the
SmO0.65F0.35FeAs wires was confirmed to be as high as 52 K. Based on
magnetization measurements, it is found that a globe current can flow on
macroscopic sample dimensions with Jc of ~3.9x10^3 A/cm^2 at 5 K and self
field, while a high Jc about 2x10^5 A/cm^2 is observed within the grains,
suggesting that a significant improvement in the globle Jc is possible. It
should be noted that the Jc exhibits a very weak field dependence behavior.
Furthermore, the upper critical fields (Hc2) determined according to the
Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg formula are (T= 0 K) = 120 T, indicating a very
encouraging application of the new superconductors.
