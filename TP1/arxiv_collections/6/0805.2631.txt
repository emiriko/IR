We discuss the precession of spin-polarized Ultra Cold Neutrons (UCN) and
$^{3}$He atoms in uniform and static magnetic and electric fields and calculate
the spin relaxation effects from motional $v\times E$ magnetic fields. Particle
motion in an electric field creates a motional $v\times E$ magnetic field,
which when combined with collisions, produces variations of the total magnetic
field and results in spin relaxation of neutron and $^{3}$He samples. The spin
relaxation times $T_{1}$ (longitudinal) and $T_{2}$ (transverse) of
spin-polarized UCN and $^{3}$He atoms are important considerations in a new
search for the neutron Electric Dipole Moment at the SNS \emph{nEDM}
experiment. We use a Monte Carlo approach to simulate the relaxation of spins
due to the motional $v\times E$ field for UCN and for $^{3}$He atoms at
temperatures below $600,\mathrm{mK}$. We find the relaxation times for the
neutron due to the $v\times E$ effect to be long compared to the neutron
lifetime, while the $^{3}$He relaxation times may be important for the
\emph{nEDM} experiment.
