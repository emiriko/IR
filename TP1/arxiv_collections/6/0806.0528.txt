A brief outline of the history of the discrepancies within Newtonian
mechanics at the end of the nineteenth century is given. The framework of
general relativity is described briefly and the famous 'tests' of general
relativity are considered and alternative solutions discussed, with particular
attention concentrating on the advance of the perihelion of the planet Mercury.
The implications for the claims of relativity are discussed, all with reference
to both pre and post 1915 publications.
