Monte Carlo(MC) simulations produce evidence that annealed copolymers
incorporating two interconverting monomers, P and H, adsorb as homopolymers
with an effective adsorption energy per monomer, $\epsilon_{eff}$, that depends
on the PH equilibrium constants in the bulk and at the surface. The cross-over
exponent, $\Phi,$ is unmodified. The MC results on the overall PH ratio, the PH
ratio at the surface and in the bulk as well as the number of adsorbed monomers
are in quantitative agreement with this hypothesis and the theoretically
derived $\epsilon_{eff}$. The evidence suggests that the form of surface
potential does not affect $\Phi$ but does influence the PH equilibrium.
