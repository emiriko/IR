Photoproduction of beauty quarks in events with two jets and an electron
associated with one of the jets has been studied with the ZEUS detector at HERA
using an integrated luminosity of 120pb^-1. The fractions of events containing
b quarks, and also of events containing c quarks, were extracted from a
likelihood fit using variables sensitive to electron identification as well as
to semileptonic decays. Total and differential cross sections for beauty and
charm production were measured and compared with next-to-leading-order QCD
calculations and Monte Carlo models.
