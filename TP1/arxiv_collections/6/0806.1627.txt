We study atom-atom correlations and relative number squeezing in the
dissociation of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of molecular dimers made of
either bosonic or fermionic atom pairs. Our treatment addresses the role of the
spatial inhomogeneity of the molecular BEC on the strength of correlations in
the short time limit. We obtain explicit analytic results for the
density-density correlation functions in momentum space, and show that the
correlation widths and the degree of relative number squeezing are determined
merely by the shape of the molecular condensate.
