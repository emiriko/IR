In this paper, we will propose a new type of cipher named DICING_csb, which
is derived from our previous stream cipher DICING. It has applied a stream of
subkey and an encryption form of block ciphers, so it may be viewed as a
combinative of stream cipher and block cipher. Hence, the new type of cipher
has fast rate like a stream cipher and need no MAC.
