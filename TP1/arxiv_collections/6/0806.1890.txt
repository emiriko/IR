In this article, we provide existence results for a general class of nonlocal
and nonlinear second-order parabolic equations. The main motivation comes from
front propagation theory in the cases when the normal velocity depends on the
moving front in a nonlocal way. Among applications, we present level-set
equations appearing in dislocations' theory and in the study of Fitzhugh-Nagumo
systems.
