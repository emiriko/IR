We construct families of optical semi-discrete composite solitons (SDCSs),
with one or two independent propagation constants, supported by a planar slab
waveguide, XPM-coupled to a periodic array of stripes. Both structures feature
the cubic nonlinearity and support intrinsic modes with mutually orthogonal
polarizations. We report three species of SDCSs, odd, even, and twisted ones,
the first type being stable. Transverse motion of phase-tilted solitons, with
potential applications to beam steering, is considered too.
