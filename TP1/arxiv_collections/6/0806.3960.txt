We study the combinatorial representation theory of the ``planar rook
algebra" $P_n$. This algebra has a basis consisting of planar rook diagrams and
multiplication given by diagram concatenation. For each integer $0 \le k \le
n$, we construct natural representations $V^n_k$ which form a complete set of
non-isomorphic, irreducible $P_n$-representations. We explicitly decompose the
regular representation of $P_n$ into a direct sum of irreducible modules. We
compute the Bratteli diagram for the tower of algebras $P_0 \subseteq P_1
\subseteq P_2 \subseteq ...$ and show that this Bratteli diagram is Pascal's
triangle. In fact, we show that many of the binomial identities, both additive
and multiplicative, have interpretations in terms of the representation theory
of the planar rook algebra.
