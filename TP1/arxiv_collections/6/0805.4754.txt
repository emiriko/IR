Wikipedia is nowadays a widely used encyclopedia, and one of the most visible
sites on the Internet. Its strong principle of collaborative work and free
editing sometimes generates disputes due to disagreements between users. In
this article we study how the wikipedian community resolves the conflicts and
which roles do wikipedian choose in this process. We observed the users
behavior both in the article talk pages, and in the Arbitration Committee pages
specifically dedicated to serious disputes. We first set up a users typology
according to their involvement in conflicts and their publishing and management
activity in the encyclopedia. We then used those user types to describe users
behavior in contributing to articles that are tagged by the wikipedian
community as being in conflict with the official guidelines of Wikipedia, or
conversely as being well featured.
