In this Addendum to our recent paper, Phys. Rev. D 77, 054027 (2008), we
point out that a chiral restoration phase transition in a quarkyonic matter at
low temperatures is of second order within a manifestly confining and chirally
symmetric large $N_c$ model. This result is qualitatively different as compared
to NJL and NJL-like models that are not confining and might have some
implications for the existence or nonexistence of the critical end point in the
QCD phase diagram.
