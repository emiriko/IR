We discuss the effective potential of the conformal factor in the effective
average action approach to Quantum Einstein Gravity. Without invoking any
truncation or other approximations we show that if the theory has has a
non-Gaussian ultraviolet fixed point and is asymptotically safe the potential
has a characteristic behavior near the origin. We argue that this
characteristic behavior has already been observed in numerical simulations
within the Causal Dynamical Triangulation approach.
