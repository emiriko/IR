Although Einstein's name is closely linked with the celebrated relation E =
mc2 between mass and energy, a critical examination of the more than half dozen
"proofs" of this relation that Einstein produced over a span of forty years
reveals that all these proofs suffer from mistakes. Einstein introduced
unjustified assumptions, committed fatal errors in logic, or adopted low-speed,
restrictive approximations. He never succeeded in producing a valid general
proof applicable to a realistic system with arbitrarily large internal and
external (that is, translational) speeds. The first such general proof was
produced by Max Laue in 1911 (for "closed" systems with a time-independent
energy-momentum tensor) and it was generalized by Felix Klein in 1918 (for
arbitrary time-dependent "closed" systems).
