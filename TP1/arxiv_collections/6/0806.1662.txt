The practical realization of nano-scale electronics faces two major
challenges: the precise engineering of the building blocks and their assembly
into functional circuits. In spite of the exceptional electronic properties of
carbon nanotubes only basic demonstration-devices have been realized by
time-consuming processes. This is mainly due to the lack of selective growth
and reliable assembly processes for nanotubes. However, graphene offers an
attractive alternative. Here we report the patterning of graphene nanoribbons
(GNRs) and bent junctions with nanometer precision, well-defined widths and
predetermined crystallographic orientations allowing us to fully engineer their
electronic structure using scanning tunneling microscope (STM) lithography. The
atomic structure and electronic properties of the ribbons have been
investigated by STM and tunneling spectroscopy measurements. Opening of
confinement gaps up to 0.5 eV, allowing room temperature operation of GNR-based
devices, is reported. This method avoids the difficulties of assembling
nano-scale components and allows the realization of complete integrated
circuits, operating as room temperature ballistic electronic devices.
