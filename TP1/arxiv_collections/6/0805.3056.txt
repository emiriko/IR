The entanglement dynamics of two independent qubits each embedded in a
structured environment under conditions of inhibition of spontaneous emission
is analyzed, showing entanglement trapping. We demonstrate that entanglement
trapping can be used efficiently to prevent entanglement sudden death. For the
case of realistic photonic band-gap materials, we show that high values of
entanglement trapping can be achieved. This result is of both fundamental and
applicative interest since it provides a physical situation where the
entanglement can be preserved and manipulated, e.g. by Stark-shifting the qubit
transition frequency outside and inside the gap.
