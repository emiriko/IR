We study the behavior of fluids, confined by geometrically structured
substrates, upon approaching a critical point at T = Tc in their bulk phase
diagram. As generic substrate structures periodic arrays of wedges and ridges
are considered. Based on general renormalization group arguments we calculate,
within mean field approximation, the universal scaling functions for order
parameter profiles of a fluid close to a single structured substrate and
discuss the decay of its spatial variation into the bulk. We compare the excess
adsorption at corrugated substrates with the one at planar walls. The
confinement of a critical fluid by two walls generates effective critical
Casimir forces between them. We calculate corresponding universal scaling
functions for the normal critical Casimir force between a flat and a
geometrically structured substrate as well as the lateral critical Casimir
force between two identically patterned substrates.
