By using Dirichlet form techniques we construct the dynamics of a tagged
particle in an infinite particle environment of interacting particles for a
large class of interaction potentials. In particular, we can treat interaction
potentials having a singularity at the origin, non-trivial negative part and
infinite range, as e.g., the Lennard-Jones potential.
