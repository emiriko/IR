We have studied the interplay of valley polarization and the Coulomb
interaction on the energy spectrum, persistent current, and optical absorption
of a graphene quantum ring. We show that the interaction has a dramatic effect
on the nature of the ground state as a function of the magnetic flux, and that
the absence of the exchange interaction in opposite valleys means that the
singlet-triplet degeneracy is not lifted for certain states. The additional
level crossings (fractional flux periodicity) due to the interaction directly
leads to extra steps in the persistent current and intricate structures in the
absorption spectrum that should be experimentally observable. By varying the
width of the ring, the nature of the ground state at zero field can be varied
as well and this is manifest in the measurable properties we discuss.
