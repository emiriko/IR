For the first time we predict the conditions of superparaelectric phase
appearance in the ensemble of non-interacting spherical ferroelectric
nanoparticles. The superparaelectricity in nanoparticle was defined by analogy
with superparamagnetism, obtained earlier in small nanoparticles made of
paramagnetic material. Calculations of correlation radius, energetic barriers
of polarization reorientation and polarization response to external electric
field, were performed within Landau-Ginzburg phenomenological approach for
perovskites Pb(Zr,Ti)O3, BiFeO3 and uniaxial ferroelectrics rochelle salt and
triglycine sulfate.
