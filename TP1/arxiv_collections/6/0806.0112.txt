We try to define the more general form of iterative processes in which the
Pomeau-Manneville and the Feigenbaum scenario may occur along with their
specific scaling properties. Doing this we need to generalize other basic
concepts. Thus, what we call a periodic carousel is a generalization of what is
usually called a periodic orbit.
