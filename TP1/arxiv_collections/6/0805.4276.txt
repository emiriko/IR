We investigate the electronic dispersion of high-Tc superconductor on the
basis of the two-dimensional three-band Hubbard model with the electron-phonon
interaction together with the strong electron-electron interaction. In our
model, it is shown across the hole-doped region of high-Tc superconductor that
the electron-phonon interaction makes a dispersion kink, observed along the
nodal direction, and that the small isotope effect appears on the electronic
dispersion.
