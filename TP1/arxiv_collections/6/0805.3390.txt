In general, most of communication satellites were designed to be operated in
geostationary orbit. And many of them were designed in prolate dual-spin
configuration. As a prolate dual-spin vehicle, they have to be stabilized
against their internal energy dissipation effect. Several countries that
located in southern hemisphere, has shown interest to use communication
satellite. Because of those countries southern latitude, an idea emerged to
incline the communication satellite (due to its prolate dualspin configuration)
in elliptical orbit. This work is focused on designing Attitude Stability
System for prolate dual-spin satellite in the effect of perturbed field of
gravity due to the inclination of its elliptical orbit. DANDE (De-spin Active
Nutation Damping Electronics) provides primary stabilization method for the
satellite in its orbit. Classical Control Approach is used for the iteration of
DANDE parameters. The control performance is evaluated based on time response
analysis.
