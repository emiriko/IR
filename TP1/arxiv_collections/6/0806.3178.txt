In forced polymer translocation, the average translocation time, $\tau$,
scales with respect to pore force, $f$, and polymer length, $N$, as $\tau \sim
f^{-1} N^{\beta}$. We demonstrate that an artifact in Metropolis Monte Carlo
method resulting in breakage of the force scaling with large $f$ may be
responsible for some of the controversies between different computationally
obtained results and also between computational and experimental results. Using
Langevin dynamics simulations we show that the scaling exponent $\beta \le 1 +
\nu$ is not universal, but depends on $f$. Moreover, we show that forced
translocation can be described by a relatively simple force balance argument
and $\beta$ to arise solely from the initial polymer configuration.
