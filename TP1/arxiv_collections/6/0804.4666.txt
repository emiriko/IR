There are two main algorithmic approaches to sparse signal recovery:
geometric and combinatorial. The geometric approach starts with a geometric
constraint on the measurement matrix and then uses linear programming to decode
information about the signal from its measurements. The combinatorial approach
constructs the measurement matrix and a combinatorial decoding algorithm to
match. We present a unified approach to these two classes of sparse signal
recovery algorithms.
  The unifying elements are the adjacency matrices of high-quality unbalanced
expanders. We generalize the notion of Restricted Isometry Property (RIP),
crucial to compressed sensing results for signal recovery, from the Euclidean
norm to the l_p norm for p about 1, and then show that unbalanced expanders are
essentially equivalent to RIP-p matrices.
  From known deterministic constructions for such matrices, we obtain new
deterministic measurement matrix constructions and algorithms for signal
recovery which, compared to previous deterministic algorithms, are superior in
either the number of measurements or in noise tolerance.
