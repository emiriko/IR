We develop here algorithms which allow to find regimes of signal-recycled
Fabry-Perot--Michelson interferometer (for example, Advanced LIGO), optimized
concurrently for two (binary inspirals + bursts) and three (binary inspirals +
bursts + millisecond pulsars) types of gravitational waves sources. We show
that there exists a relatevely large area in the interferometer parameters
space where the detector sensitivity to the first two kinds of sources differs
only by a few percent from the maximal ones for each kind of source. In
particular, there exists a specific regime where this difference is ~0.5 for
both of them. Furthermore we show that even more multipurpose regimes are also
possible, that provide significant sensitivity gain for millisecond pulsars
with only minor sensitivity degradation for binary inspirals and bursts.
