The quantum teleportation with noisy EPR state is discussed. Using an optimal
decomposition technique, we compute the concurrence, entanglement of formation
and Groverian measure for various noisy EPR resources. It is shown analytically
that all entanglement measures reduce to zero when $\bar{F} \leq 2/3$, where
$\bar{F}$ is an average fidelity between Alice and Bob. This fact indicates
that the entanglement is a genuine physical resource for the teleportation
process. This fact gives valuable clues on the optimal decomposition for
higher-qubit mixed states. As an example, the optimal decompositions for the
three-qubit mixed states are discussed by adopting a teleportation with W-state
