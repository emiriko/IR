Events with three or more isolated leptons in the final state are known to be
signatures of new physics phenomena at high energy collider physics facilities.
Standard model sources of isolated trilepton final states include gauge boson
pair production such as $WZ$ and $W\gamma^*$, and $t\bar{t}$ production. We
demonstrate that leptons from heavy flavor decays, such as $b \to lX$ and $c
\to lX$, provide sources of trileptons that can be orders-of-magnitude larger
after cuts than other standard model backgrounds to new physics processes. We
explain the physical reason heavy flavor backgrounds survive isolation cuts. We
propose new cuts to control the backgrounds in the specific case of chargino
plus neutralino pair production in supersymmetric models. After these cuts are
imposed, we show that it should be possible to find at least a 4 sigma excess
for supersymmetry parameter space point LM9 with 30 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated
luminosity.
