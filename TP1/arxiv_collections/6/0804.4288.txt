The Tevatron proton-antiproton collider at Fermilab with its centre of mass
energy of 1.96 TeV is currently the only source for the production of top
quarks. This report reflects the current status of measurements of the top
quark pair production cross section and properties performed by the CDF and D0
Collaborations. Utilising datasets of up to two inverse fb, these measurements
allow unprecedented precision in probing the validity of the Standard Model.
