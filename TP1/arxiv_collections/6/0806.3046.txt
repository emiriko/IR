We define new generalizations of (q,t)-Catalan numbers applying nabla
operator on k-Schur functions indexed by column partitions. In some special
cases, we give a combinatorial interpretation of these numbers using
configurations of Dyck paths. In some other special cases, we also interpret
these new polynomial as Hilbert series of explicit sub-modules of the
alternating diagonal harmonics built using differential operators.
