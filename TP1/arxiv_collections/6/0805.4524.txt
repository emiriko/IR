We investigate hysteresis in the transport properties of Superconductor -
Normal metal - Superconductor (S-N-S) junctions at low temperatures by
measuring directly the electron temperature in the normal metal. Our results
demonstrate unambiguously that the hysteresis results from an increase of the
normal metal electron temperature once the junction switches to the resistive
state. In our geometry, the electron temperature increase is governed by the
thermal resistance of the superconducting electrodes of the junction.
