We determine the feasibility of detecting analogue Hawking radiation in a
Bose-Einstein condensate in the presence of atom loss induced heating. We find
that phonons created by three-body losses overshadow those due to analogue
Hawking radiation. To overcome this problem, three-body losses may have to be
suppressed, for example as proposed by Search et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92
140401 (2004)]. The reduction of losses to a few percent of their normal rate
is typically sufficient to suppress the creation of loss phonons on the time
scale of a fast analogue Hawking phonon detection.
