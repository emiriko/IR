We have developed the experimental approach to characterize spatial
distribution of the magnetic field produced by cantilever tips used in magnetic
resonance force microscopy (MRFM). We performed MRFM measurements on a well
characterized diphenyl-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) film and mapped the 3D field
profile produced by a Nd2Fe14B probe tip. Using our technique field profiles of
arbitrarily shaped probe magnets can be imaged.
