We discuss the time-of-flight expansion of dilute p-wave Fermi condensates on
the BEC side of Feshbach resonances, as a way to extract information about the
order parameter symmetry for superfluidity. We show that the cloud profile is
in general sensitive to the interaction strength between fermions, the
magnitude and direction of external magnetic fields, and to the angular
momentum projection of the order parameter. In particular, due to the
anisotropic nature of p-wave interactions we show that the time-of-flight
expansion of a p-wave superfluid is anisotropic even if the superfluid is
confined to a completely isotropic trap, unlike the case of Bose or s-wave
Fermi condensates, which under the same circumstances expand isotropically.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that expanding p-wave superfluids released from
axially symmetric traps experience anisotropy inversions, where the aspect
ratio between the axial and radial directions change during expansion, while
the axial symmetry can also be lost reflecting the spatial anisotropy of the
underlying interaction.
