In continuing the study of harmonic mapping from 2-dimensional Riemannian
simplicial complexes in order to construct minimal surfaces with singularity,
we obtain an a-priori regularity result concerning the real analyticity of the
free boundary curve. The free boundary is the singular set along which three
disk-type minimal surfaces meet. Here the configuration of the singular minimal
surface is obtained by a minimization of a weighted energy functional, in the
spirit of J.Douglas' approach to the Plateau Problem. Using the free boundary
regularity of the harmonic map, we construct a local uniformization of the
singular surface as a parameterization of a neighborhood of a point on the free
boundary by the singular tangent cone. In addition, applications of the local
uniformization are discussed in relation to H.Lewy's real analytic extension of
minimal surfaces.
