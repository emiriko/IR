The unitary gauge in the Higgs mechanism is to impose the condition of $\phi
=\phi^\dagger $ on the Higgs fields. However, this is not the gauge fixing but
simply a procedure for producing the massive vector boson fields by hand. The
Lagrangian density of the weak interactions should be reconsidered by starting
from the massive vector boson fields which couple to the fermion currents as
the initial ingredients.
