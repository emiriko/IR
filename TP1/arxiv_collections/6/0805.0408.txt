A theoretical model is developed for the interaction of intense femtosecond
laser pulses with solid targets on the basis of the two-temperature equation of
state for an irradiated substance. It allows the description of the dynamics of
the plasma formation and expansion. Comparison of available experimental data
on the amplitude and phase of the complex reflection coefficient of aluminum
with the simulation results provides new information on the transport
coefficients and absorption capacity of the strongly coupled Al plasma over a
wide range of temperatures and pressures.
