We propose a method to improve the quenched approximation. The method, based
on the worldline formalism, takes into account effects of quark loops. The idea
is useful mostly for AdS/CFT (holographic) calculations. To demonstrate the
method we estimate screening (string breaking) effects by a simple holographic
calculation.
