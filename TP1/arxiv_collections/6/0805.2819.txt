We study by Molecular Dynamics simulation the slowing down of particle motion
in a two-dimensional monatomic model: a Lennard-Jones liquid on the hyperbolic
plane. The negative curvature of the embedding space frustrates the long-range
extension of the local hexagonal order. As a result, the liquid avoids
crystallization and forms a glass. We show that, as temperature decreases, the
single particle motion displays the canonical features seen in real
glassforming liquids: the emergence of a "plateau" at intermediate times in the
mean square displacement and a decoupling between the local relaxation time and
the (hyperbolic) diffusion constant.
