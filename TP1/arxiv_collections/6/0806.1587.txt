We present two models of continuous opinion dynamics under bounded confidence
which are representable as nonnegative discrete dynamical systems, namely the
Hegselmann-Krause model (Hegselmann and Krause, Journal of Artificial Societies
and Social Simulation 5(3), 2002) and the Deffuant-Weisbuch model (Deffuant et
al, Advances in Complex Systems, 3, 2000). We fully characterize the set of
fixed points for both models. They are identical. Further on, we present
reformulations of both models on the more general level of densities of agents
in the opinion space as interactive Markov chains. We also characterize the
sets of fixed points as identical in both models.
