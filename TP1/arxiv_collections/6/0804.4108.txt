We study electronic transport through a one-dimensional, finite-length
quantum wire of correlated electrons (Luttinger liquid) coupled at arbitrary
position via tunnel barriers to two semi-infinite, one-dimensional as well as
stripe-like (two-dimensional) leads, thereby bringing theory closer towards
systems closer to setups realized in experiments. In particular, we compute the
temperature dependence of the linear conductance $G$ of a system without bulk
impurities. The appearance of new temperature scales introduced by the lengths
of overhanging parts of the leads and the wire implies a $G(T)$ which is much
more complex than the power-law behavior described so far for end-coupled
wires. Depending on the precise setup the wide temperature regime of power-law
scaling found in the end-coupled case is broken up in up to five fairly narrow
regimes interrupted by extended crossover regions. Our results can be used to
optimize the experimental setups designed for a verification of Luttinger
liquid power-law scaling.
