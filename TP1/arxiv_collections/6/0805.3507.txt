A variety of lepton flavour violating effects related to the recent discovery
of neutrino oscillations and mixings is here systematically discussed in terms
of an S_3-flavour permutational symmetry. After presenting some relevant
results on lepton masses and mixings, previously derived in a minimal
S_3-invariant extension of the Standard Model, we compute the branching ratios
of some selected flavour-changing neutral current processes (FCNC) as well as
the contribution of the exchange of neutral flavour-changing scalar to the
anomaly of the magnetic moment of the muon. We found that the minimal
S_3-invariant extension of the Standard Model describes successfully masses and
mixings, as well as, all flavour changing neutral current processes in
excellent agreement with experiment.
