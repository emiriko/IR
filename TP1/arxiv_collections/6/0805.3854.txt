We present a thorough analysis of single atom detection using optical
cavities. The large set of parameters that influence the signal-to-noise ratio
for cavity detection is considered, with an emphasis on detunings, probe power,
cavity finesse and photon detection schemes. Real device operating restrictions
for single photon counting modules and standard photodiodes are included in our
discussion, with heterodyne detection emerging as the clearly favourable
technique, particularly for detuned detection at high power.
