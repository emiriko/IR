Within the framework of the minimal non-minimal supersymmetric standard model
(MNMSSM) with tadpole terms, CP violation effects in the Higgs sector are
investigated at the one-loop level, where the radiative corrections from the
loops of the quark and squarks of the third generation are taken into account.
Assuming that the squark masses are not degenerate, the radiative corrections
due to the stop and sbottom quarks give rise to CP phases, which trigger the CP
violation explicitly in the Higgs sector of the MNMSSM. The masses, the
branching ratios for dominant decay channels, and the total decay widths of the
five neutral Higgs bosons in the MNMSSM are calculated in the presence of the
explicit CP violation. The dependence of these quantities on the CP phases is
quite recognizable, for given parameter values.
