An extension to the P3M algorithm for electrostatic interactions is
presented, that allows to efficiently compute dipolar interactions in periodic
boundary conditions. Theoretical estimates for the root-mean square error of
the forces, torques and the energy are derived. The applicability of the
estimates is tested and confirmed in several numerical examples. A comparison
of the computational performance of the new algorithm to state-of-the-art
dipolar Ewald summation methods shows a performance crossover from the Ewald
method to the dipolar P3M method for as few as 300 dipolar particles. In larger
systems, the new algorithm represents a substantial improvement in performance
with respect to the dipolar standard Ewald method.
