Experimental mirror energy differences (MED) for nuclei lying in the middle
and the second part of $1f_{7/2}$ shell are compared with shell model
calculations in the $1f_{7/2}$ and in the full $pf$ configuration spaces, as
well as with CSM calculations. MED plots are fully consistent with the
description which emerges from the interpretation of SM calculations: i.e. the
band crossing of the gs band with high-$K$ bands in $A$=51 and 50 mirror pairs,
as well as the seniority-3 quasi band-termination at $I^\pi$=19/2$^-$ in
$A$=49.
  Rotational alignment effects are excluded, contrarily to what even recently
proposed.
  Some inconsistencies, as well as definition improprieties, are pointed out in
the topical literature.
