We report upper critical field B_c2(T) data for disordered
(arsenic-deficient) LaO_0.9F_0.1FeAs_(1-delta) in a wide temperature and
magnetic field range up to 47 T. Because of the large linear slope of Bc2 about
-5.4 T/K to -6.6 T/K near Tc = 28.5 K the T-dependence of the in-plane Bc2(T)
shows a flattening near 23 K above 30 T which points to Pauli-limited behavior
with Bc2(0) about 63-68 T. Our results are discussed in terms of disorder
effects within conventional and unconventional superconducting pairings.
