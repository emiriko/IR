The exact stochastic decomposition of non-Markovian dissipative quantum
dynamics is combined with the time-dependent semiclassical initial value
formalism. It is shown that even in the challenging regime of moderate friction
and low temperatures, where non-Markovian effects are substantial, this
approach allows for the accurate description of dissipative dynamics in
anharmonic potentials over many oscillation periods until thermalization is
reached. The problem of convergence of the stochastic average at long times,
which plagues full quantum mechanical implementations, is avoided through a
joint sampling of the stochastic noise and the semiclassical phase space
distribution.
