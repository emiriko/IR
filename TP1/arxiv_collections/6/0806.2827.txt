It is shown that the gauge fixings of the Z and the W fields and three
scalars are via nonconserved axial-vector and charged vector currents of
massive fermions dynamically generated by fermion masses in the SM of EW
interactions. The top quark mass provides enough strength for this chiral
symmetry breaking. The masses of the three scalars are determined to be about
$10^{14}$ GeV. These scalars have negative probability. They are the
nonperturbative solutions of the SM. A new perturbation theory with dynamically
generated and fixed gauge fixings is constructed. The Faddeev-Popov procedure
is not invoked.
