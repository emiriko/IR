We consider the so called Legget inequalities which are deduced from the
assumption of general (local or non-local) realism plus the arrow of time
preservation. Then, instead of assuming cryto-nonlocal hidden variables, we
assume any (local or non-local) realism compatible with the joint and non-joint
expected values dictated by quantum mwechaanics. Hence, we prove that this
double assumption is not consistent, since the corresponding general Leggett
inequalities are violated by quantum mechanics. Thus, realism plus arrow of
time preservation and quntum mechanics are not compatible. In other words,
quantum mechanics cannot be completed with any (local or non-local) hidden
variables, provide we assume the common sense of the arrow of time. The result
would deserve to be experimentally tested and we discuss why it is not
invalidated by hidden variable theories as the one from Bohm.
