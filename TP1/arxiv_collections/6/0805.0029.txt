The concept of negative probabilities can be used to decompose the
interaction of two qubits mediated by a quantum controlled-NOT into three
operations that require only classical interactions (that is, local operations
and classical communication) between the qubits. For a single gate, the
probabilities of the three operations are 1, 1, and -1. This decomposition can
be applied in a probabilistic simulation of quantum computation by randomly
choosing one of the three operations for each gate and assigning a negative
statistical weight to the outcomes of sequences with an odd number of negative
probability operations. The exponential speed-up of a quantum computer can then
be evaluated in terms of the increase in the number of sequences needed to
simulate a single operation of the quantum circuit.
