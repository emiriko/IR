We perform a measurement of the CP asymmetry in b->sgamma decays using a
sample of 383 BB events collected by the BABAR detector at the PEP-II
asymmetric B factory. We reconstruct sixteen flavor-specific B decay modes
containing a high-energy photon and a hadronic system (Xs) containing an s
quark. We measure the \CP asymmetry to be -0.011+/- 0.030(stat)+/-0.014(syst)
for a photon energy threshold at 1.6 GeV and the hadronic system mass between
0.6 and 2.8 GeV/c2.
