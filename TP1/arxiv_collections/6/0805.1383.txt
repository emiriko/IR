We present a new method to compute the electronic structure of correlated
materials combining the hybrid functional method with the dynamical mean-field
theory. As a test example of the method we study cerium sesquioxide, a strongly
correlated Mott-band insulator. The hybrid functional part improves the
magnitude of the pd-band gap which is underestimated in the standard
approximations to density functional theory while the dynamical mean-field
theory part splits the 4f-electron spectra into a lower and an upper Hubbard
band.
