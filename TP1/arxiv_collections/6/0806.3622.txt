Using dynamic paraboloid model of Earth's magnetosphere, a large set of
particles' trajectory computations was performed. Based on its result, the
numerical algorithm for calculating effective cutoff rigidity dependence on
empiric parameters has been developed for further use in magnetospheric
transmission calculations.
