We have performed several high-pressure resistivity experiments on the
recently discovered superconductors La[O_{0.89}F_{0.11}]FeAs and
Ce[O_{0.88}F_{0.12}]FeAs. At ambient pressure, these materials have
superconducting onset temperatures T_c of 28 K and 44 K, respectively. While
the T_c of La[O_{0.89}F_{0.11}]FeAs goes through a maximum between 10-68 kbar,
in qualitative agreement with a recent report by Takahashi et al., the T_c of
Ce[O_{0.88}F_{0.12}]FeAs decreases monotonically over the measured pressure
range. At 265 kbar, the T_c of the cerium-based compound has been suppressed
below 1.1 K.
