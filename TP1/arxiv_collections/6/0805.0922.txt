The Through Silicon Via (TSV) process developed by Silex provides down to 30
micrometers pitch for through wafer connections in up to 600 micrometers thick
substrates. Integrated with MEMS designs it enables significantly reduced die
size and true "Wafer Level Packaging" - features that are particularly
important in consumer market applications. The TSV technology also enables
integration of advanced interconnect functions in optical MEMS, sensors and
microfluidic devices. In addition the Via technology opens for very interesting
possibilities considering integration with CMOS processing. With several
companies using the process already today, qualified volume manufacturing in
place and a line-up of potential users, the process is becoming a standard in
the MEMS industry. We provide a introduction to the via formation process and
also present some on the novel solutions made available by the technology.
