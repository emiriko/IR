The newly discovered iron-based superconductors have stimulated enormous
interests in the field of superconductivity. Since the new superconductor is a
layered system, the anisotropy is a parameter with the first priority to know.
Meanwhile any relevant message about the critical fields (upper critical field
and irreversibility line) are essentially important. By using flux method, we
have successfully grown the single crystals NdO0.82F0.18FeAs at ambient
pressure. Resistive measurements reveal a surprising discovery that the
anisotropy \Gamma = (mc/mab)^{1/2} is below 5, which is much smaller than the
theoretically calculated results. The data measured up to 400 K show a
continuing curved feature which prevents a conjectured linear behavior for an
unconventional metal. The upper critical fields determined based on the
Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg formula are H_{c2}^{H||ab}(T=0 K) = 304 T and
H_{c2}^{H||c}(T=0 K)=62-70 T, indicating a very encouraging application of the
new superconductors.
