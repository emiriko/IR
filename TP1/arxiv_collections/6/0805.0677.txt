A large-scale relativistic configuration-interaction (CI) calculation is
performed for the magnetic-dipole and the electric-quadrupole hyperfine
structure splitting in ^{7,6}Li and ^9Be^+. Numerical results for the 2^2S,
3^2S, 2^2P_{1/2}, and 2^2P_{3/2} states are reported. The CI calculation based
on the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian is supplemented with separate treatments
of the QED, nuclear-magnetization distribution, recoil, and negative-continuum
effects.
