We show that harmonic frequency mixing in quantum dots coupled to two leads
under the influence of time-dependent voltages of different frequency is
dominated by interaction effects. This offers a unique and direct spectroscopic
tool to access correlations, and holds promise for efficient frequency mixing
in nano-devices. Explicit results are provided for an Anderson dot and for a
molecular level with phonon-mediated interactions.
