We show that a photon detector, sensitive to the gradients of electromagnetic
fields, or to magnetic fields, should be a useful tool to characterize the
quantum properties of spatially-dependent optical fields. We discuss the
excitation of an atom on a magnetic dipole or electric quadrupole transitions
with the spiral photons of a Laguerre-Gauss (LG) or Bessel beams. We show that
these beams are not true hollow beams, due to the presence of magnetic fields
and gradients of electric fields on beam axis. This approach paves the way to
an analysis at the quantum level of the spatial structure and angular momentum
properties of singular light beams.
