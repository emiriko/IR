We show that for a generic simple closed curve C in the asymptotic boundary
of a Gromov hyperbolic 3-space with cocompact metric X, there exist a unique
least area plane P in X with asymptotic boundary C. This result has interesting
topological applications for constructions of canonical 2-dimensional objects
in 3-manifolds.
