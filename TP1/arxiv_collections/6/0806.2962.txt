The quantum marginal problem asks, given a set of reduced quantum states of a
multipartite system, whether there exists a joint quantum state consistent with
these reduced states. The quantum marginal problem is known to be hard to solve
in general as it is a variant of the N-representability problem. We provide
entropic bounds on the number of orthogonal solutions to the quantum marginal
problem.
