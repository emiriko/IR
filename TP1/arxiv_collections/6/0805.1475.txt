We investigate the influence of space curvature, and of the associated
"frustration", on the dynamics of a model glassformer: a monatomic liquid on
the hyperbolic plane. We find that the system's fragility, i.e. the sensitivity
of the relaxation time to temperature changes, increases as one decreases the
frustration. As a result, curving space provides a way to tune fragility and
make it as large as wanted. We also show that the nature of the emerging
"dynamic heterogeneities", another distinctive feature of slowly relaxing
systems, is directly connected to the presence of frustration-induced
topological defects.
