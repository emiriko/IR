Black-holes are considered to be theoretical laboratories for testing models
of quantum gravity. It is usually believed that any candidate for quantum
gravity must explain the microscopic origin of the Bekenstein-Hawking
($S_{_{\rm BH}}$) entropy. In this letter, we argue (i) the requirement for a
candidate approach to go beyond $S_{_{\rm BH}}$ and provide generic subleading
corrections, and (ii) the importance to {\it disentangle} and identify the
degrees of freedom leading to $S_{_{\rm BH}}$ and its subleading corrections.
Using the approach of entanglement of modes across the horizon, we show that
the microscopic degrees of freedom that lead to $S_{_{\rm BH}}$ and subleading
corrections are different. We further show, using microcanonical and canonical
ensemble approaches, that the quantum entanglement predicts generic power-law
corrections to $S_{_{\rm BH}}$ and that the corrections can be identified with
the kinematical properties of the event-horizon.
