Effects of a Kekule distortion on exciton instability in single-layer
graphene are discussed. In the framework of quantum electrodynamics the mass of
the electron generated dynamically is worked out using a Schwinger-Dyson
equation. For homogeneous lattice distortion it is shown that the generated
mass is independent of the amplitude of the lattice distortion at the one-loop
approximation. Formation of excitons induced by the homogeneous Kekule
distortion could appear only through direct dependence of the lattice
distortion.
