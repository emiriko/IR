Climate change is an important current issue and there is much debate about
the causes and effects. This article examines the changes in our climate,
comparing the recent changes with those in the past. There have been changes in
temperature, resulting in an average global rise over the last 300 years, as
well as widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea
level. There are many theories for the causes of the recent change in the
climate, including some natural and some human influenced. The most widely
believed cause of the climate change is increasing levels of Greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere and as the atmosphere plays an important role in making our
planet inhabitable, it is important to understand it in order to protect it.
However, there are other theories for the cause of climate change, the Sun and
cosmic rays, for example, are felt by some to have a significant role to play.
There is also well-established evidence that the three Milankovitch cycles
change the amount and alter the distribution of sunlight over the Earth,
heating and cooling it. There are many influences on our planet and they all
have differing levels of impact. The purpose of this article is to review the
present overall position and urge open, reasoned discussion of the problem.
