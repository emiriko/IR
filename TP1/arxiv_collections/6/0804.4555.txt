We study extended Berezin and Berezin-Toeplitz quantization for compact
Kaehler manifolds, two related quantization procedures which provide a general
framework for approaching the construction of fuzzy compact Kaehler geometries.
Using this framework, we show that a particular version of generalized Berezin
quantization, which we baptize "Berezin-Bergman quantization", reproduces
recent proposals for the construction of fuzzy Kaehler spaces. We also discuss
how fuzzy Laplacians can be defined in our general framework and study a few
explicit examples. Finally, we use this approach to propose a general explicit
definition of fuzzy scalar field theory on compact Kaehler manifolds.
