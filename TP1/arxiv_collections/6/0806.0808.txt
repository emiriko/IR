We calculate the Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) QCD corrections to Z b anti-b
production in hadronic collisions including full bottom-quark mass effects. We
present results for the total cross section and the invariant mass distribution
of the bottom-quark jet pair at the Fermilab Tevatron p anti-p collider. We
perform a detailed comparison with a calculation that considers massless bottom
quarks, as implemented in the Monte Carlo program MCFM. We find that neglecting
bottom-quark mass effects overestimates the total NLO QCD cross section for Z b
anti-b production at the Tevatron by about 7%, independent of the choice of the
renormalization and factorization scales. Moreover, bottom-quark mass effects
can impact the shape of the bottom-quark pair invariant mass distribution, in
particular in the low invariant mass region.
