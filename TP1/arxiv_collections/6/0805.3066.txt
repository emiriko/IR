Professor Jayanta Kumar Ghosh has contributed massively to various areas of
Statistics over the last five decades. Here, we survey some of his most
important contributions. In roughly chronological order, we discuss his major
results in the areas of sequential analysis, foundations, asymptotics, and
Bayesian inference. It is seen that he progressed from thinking about data
points, to thinking about data summarization, to the limiting cases of data
summarization in as they relate to parameter estimation, and then to more
general aspects of modeling including prior and model selection.
