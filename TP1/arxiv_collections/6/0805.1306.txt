In this paper we show existence and uniqueness of a solution for a system of
m variational partial differential inequalities with inter-connected obstacles.
This system is the deterministic version of the Verification Theorem of the
Markovian optimal m-states switching problem. The switching cost functions are
arbitrary. This problem is in relation with the valuation of firms in a
financial market.
