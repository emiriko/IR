Plate-like single crystals of SrFe2As2 as large as 3x3x0.5 mm3 have been
grown out of Sn flux. The SrFe2As2 single crystals show a structural phase
transition from a high temperature tetragonal phase to a low temperature
orthorhombic phase at To = 198 K, and do not show any sign of superconductivity
down to 1.8 K. The structural transition is accompanied by an anomaly in the
electrical resistivity, Hall resistivity, specific heat, and the anisotropic
magnetic susceptibility. In an intermediate temperature range from 198 K to 160
K, single crystal X-ray diffraction suggests a coexistence of the
high-temperature tetragonal and the low-temperature orthorhombic phases.
