The latest NA49 results on fluctuations of multiplicity and average
transverse-momentum analyzed on an event-by-event basis are presented for
central Pb+Pb interactions over the whole SPS energy range (20A - 158A GeV).
The scaled variance of the multiplicity distribution decreases with collision
energy whereas the $\Phi_{p_{T}}$ measure of $<p_T>$ fluctuations is small and
independent of collision energy. Thus in central Pb+Pb collisions these
fluctuations do not show an indication of the critical point of strongly
interacting matter.
