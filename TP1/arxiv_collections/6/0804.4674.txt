We provide a discussion of issues related to the center-of-mass motion and
cross-channel coupling in applications of the time-dependent Hartree-Fock
(TDHF) theory to heavy-ion collisions. We find that the entrance channel
dynamics of a heavy-ion collision as described by TDHF does not seem to be
significantly influenced by these effects, whereas the long-time evolution may
be less reliable.
