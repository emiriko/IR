Ab initio calculations and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that
the quantum confinement of surface electrons to nanoislands can significantly
affect the growth process at low temperatures. Formation of empty zones and
orbits of an adatom motion is demonstrated for Cu nanoislands on Cu(111).
