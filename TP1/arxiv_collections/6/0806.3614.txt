We discuss definitions of the quantum efficiency for binary-outcome qubit
detectors with imperfect fidelity, focusing on the subclass of quantum
non-demolition detectors. Quantum efficiency is analyzed for several models of
detectors, including indirect projective measurement, linear detector in
binary-outcome regime, detector of the superconducting phase qubit, and
detector based on tunneling into continuum.
