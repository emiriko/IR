In this paper we obtain some explicit expressions for the Euler
characteristic of a rank n coherent sheaf F on P^N and of its twists F(t) as
polynomials in the Chern classes c_i(F), also giving algorithms for the
computation. The employed methods use techniques of umbral calculus involving
symmetric functions and Stirling numbers.
