We present a theoretical analysis of the electron spin decoherence in single
Nitrogen-Vacancy defects in ultra-pure diamond. The electron spin decoherence
is due to the interactions with Carbon-13 nuclear spins in the diamond lattice.
Our approach takes advantage of the low concentration (1.1%) of Carbon-13 and
their random distribution in the diamond lattice by an algorithmic aggregation
of spins into small, strongly interacting groups. By making use of this
\emph{disjoint cluster} approach, we demonstrate a possibility of non-trival
dynamics of the electron spin that can not be described by a single time
constant. This dependance is caused by a strong coupling between the electron
and few nuclei and results, in particular, in a substantial echo signal even at
microsecond time scales. Our results are in good agreement with recent
experimental observations.
