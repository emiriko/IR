We are developing a Bayesian approach based on Markov chain Monte Carlo
techniques to search for and extract information about white dwarf binary
systems with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Here we present
results obtained by applying an initial implementation of this method to some
of the data sets released in Round 1B of the Mock LISA Data Challenges. For
Challenges 1B.1.1a and 1b the signals were recovered with parameters lying
within the 95.5% posterior probability interval and the correlation between the
true and recovered waveform is in excess of 99%. Results were not submitted for
Challenge 1B.1.1c due to some convergence problems of the algorithms, despite
this, the signal was detected in a search over a 2 mHz band.
