The formation of a novel spin-polarized 2D electron gas at the LaMnO$_3$
monolayer embedded in SrMnO$_3$ is predicted from the first-principles
density-functional calculations. The La (d) electrons become confined in the
direction normal to the interface in the potential well of the La layer,
serving as a positively-charged layer of electron donors. These electrons
mediate a ferromagnetic alignment of the Mn t$_{2g}$ spins near the interface
via the Anderson-Hasegawa double exchange and become, in turn, spin-polarized
due to the internal magnetic fields of the Mn moments.
