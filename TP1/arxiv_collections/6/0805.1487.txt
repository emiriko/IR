The paper is concerned with the time efficient processing of spatiotemporal
predicates, i.e. spatial predicates associated with an exact temporal
constraint. A set of such predicates forms a buffer query or a Spatio-temporal
Pattern (STP) Query with time. In the more general case of an STP query, the
temporal dimension is introduced via the relative order of the spatial
predicates (STP queries with order). Therefore, the efficient processing of a
spatiotemporal predicate is crucial for the efficient implementation of more
complex queries of practical interest. We propose an extension of a known
approach, suitable for processing spatial predicates, which has been used for
the efficient manipulation of STP queries with order. The extended method is
supported by efficient indexing structures. We also provide experimental
results that show the efficiency of the technique.
