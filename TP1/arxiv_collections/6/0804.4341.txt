We show that when a microsphere is illuminated by an evanescent wave, the
optical forces on- and off- whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonance can differ
by several orders of magnitude. Such size selective force allows one to
selectively manipulate the resonating particles, while leaving those particles
at off-resonance untouched. As WGM resonances have very high-Q's, this kind of
force could be deployed for size-selective manipulation with a very high
accuracy (~1/Q), as well as simultaneous particle-sorting according to their
size or resonant frequency.
