We show that if $E$ is an arbitrary acyclic graph then the Leavitt path
algebra $L_K(E)$ is locally $K$-matricial; that is, $L_K(E)$ is the direct
union of subalgebras, each isomorphic to a finite direct sum of finite matrix
rings over the field $K$. As a consequence we get our main result, in which we
show that the following conditions are equivalent for an arbitrary graph $E$:
(1) $L_K(E)$ is von Neumann regular. (2) $L_K(E)$ is $\pi$-regular. (3) $E$ is
acyclic. (4) $L_K(E)$ is locally $K$-matricial. (5) $L_K(E)$ is strongly
$\pi$-regular. We conclude by showing how additional regularity conditions
(unit regularity, strongly clean) can be appended to this list of equivalent
conditions.
