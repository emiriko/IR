Transverse entanglement between pairs of photons can be detected through
intensity correlation measurements in the near and far fields. We show
theoretically and experimentally that at intermediate zones, it is also
possible to detect transverse entanglement performing only intensity
correlation measurements. Our results are applicable to a number of physical
systems.
