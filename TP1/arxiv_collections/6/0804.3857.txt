Sturmian bound states emerging at a fixed energy and numbered by a complete
set of real eigencouplings are considered. For Sturm-Schroedinger equations
which are manifestly non-Hermitian we outline the way along which the correct
probabilistic interpretation of the system can constructively be re-established
via a new formula for the metric. PT-symmetrized Coulomb potential is chosen
for illustration purposes.
