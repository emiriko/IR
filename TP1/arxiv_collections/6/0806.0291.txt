High resolution photoemission measurements have been carried out on
non-superconducting LaOFeAs parent compound and various superconducting
R(O1-xFx)FeAs (R=La, Ce and Pr) compounds. We found that the parent LaOFeAs
compound shows a metallic character. Through extensive measurements, we have
identified several common features in the electronic structure of these
Fe-based compounds: (1). 0.2 eV feature in the valence band; (2). A universal
13~16 meV feature; (3). A clear Fermi cutoff showing zero leading-edge shift in
the superconducting state;(4). Lack of superconducting coherence peak(s); (5).
Near EF spectral weight suppression with decreasing temperature. These
universal features can provide important information about band structure,
superconducting gap and pseudogap in these Fe-based materials.
