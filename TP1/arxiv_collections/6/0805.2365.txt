We present selected new results on leptonic B meson decays from the BaBar
experiment: searches for the decays B0->l+l-, B+->l+nu and B0->l+tau-, and
B->Knunubar, where l=e or mu. The decay modes imply also their charge
conjugations. We observe no evidence for these decays and set upper limits on
their branching fractions.
