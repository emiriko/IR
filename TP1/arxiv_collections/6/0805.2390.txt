We test the resummation techniques used in developing Pad\'e and Effective
One Body (EOB) waveforms for gravitational wave detection. Convergence tests
show that Pad\'e approximants of the gravitational wave energy flux do not
accelerate the convergence of the standard Taylor approximants even in the test
mass limit, and there is no reason why Pad\'e transformations should help in
estimating parameters better in data analysis. Moreover, adding a pole to the
flux seems unnecessary in the construction of these Pad\'e-approximated flux
formulas. Pad\'e approximants may be useful in suggesting the form of fitting
formulas. We compare a 15-orbit numerical waveform of the Caltech-Cornell group
to the suggested Pad\'e waveforms of Damour et al. in the equal mass,
nonspinning quasi-circular case. The comparison suggests that the Pad\'e
waveforms do not agree better with the numerical waveform than the standard
Taylor based waveforms. Based on this result, we design a simple EOB model by
modifiying the ET EOB model of Buonanno et al., using the Taylor series of the
flux with an unknown parameter at the fourth post-Newtonian order that we fit
for. This simple EOB model generates a waveform having a phase difference of
only 0.002 radians with the numerical waveform, much smaller than 0.04 radians
the phase uncertainty in the numerical data itself. An EOB Hamiltonian can make
use of a Pad\'e transformation in its construction, but this is the only place
Pad\'e transformations seem useful.
