In this paper,we present a rigorous demonstration and discussion of the
quantum adiabatic theorem for systems having a non degenerate continuous
spectrum. A new strategy is initiated by defining a kind of gap, "a virtual
gap", for the continuous spectrum through the notion of eigendifferential
(Weyl's packet) and using the differential projector operator. Finally we
obtain the validity condition of the adiabatic approximation.
