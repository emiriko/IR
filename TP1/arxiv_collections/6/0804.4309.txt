Thermal photons are thought to be the ideal probe to measure the temperature
of the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy ion collisions. PHENIX has measured
direct photons with p_T < 5 GeV/c via their internal conversions into e+e-
pairs in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV and has now provided a
baseline measurement from p+p data.
