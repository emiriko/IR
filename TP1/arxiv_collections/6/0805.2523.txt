In this article we propose a maximal a posteriori (MAP) criterion for model
selection in the motif discovery problem and investigate conditions under which
the MAP asymptotically gives a correct prediction of model size. We also
investigate robustness of the MAP to prior specification and provide guidelines
for choosing prior hyper-parameters for motif models based on sensitivity
considerations.
