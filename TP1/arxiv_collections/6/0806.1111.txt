Atomic force microscopy using a magnetic tip is a promising tool for
investigating conductivity on the nano-scale. By the oscillating magnetic tip
eddy currents are induced in the conducting parts of the sample which can be
detected in the phase signal of the cantilever. However, the origin of the
phase signal is still controversial because theoretical calculations using a
monopole appoximation for taking the electromagnetic forces acting on the tip
into account yield an effect which is too small by more than two orders of
magnitude. In order to determine the origin of the signal we used especially
prepared gold nano patterns embedded in a non-conducting polycarbonate matrix
and measured the distance dependence of the phase signal. Our data clearly
shows that the interacting forces are long ranged and therefore, are likely due
to the electromagnetic interaction between the magnetic tip and the conducting
parts of the surface. Due to the long range character of the interaction a
change in conductivity of $\Delta\sigma=4,5\cdot10^{7} (\Omega$m$)^{-1}$ can be
detected far away from the surface without any interference from the
topography.
