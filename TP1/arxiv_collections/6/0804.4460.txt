Old and new ideas regarding Higgs physics are reviewed. We first summarize
the quadratic divergence / hierarchy problem which strongly suggests that the
SM Higgs sector will be supplemented by new physics at high scales. We next
consider means for delaying the hierarchy problem of the SM Higgs sector to
unexpectedly high scales. We then outline the properties of the most ideal
Higgs boson. The main advantages of a supersymmetric solution to the high scale
problems are summarized and the reasons for preferring the next-to-minimal
supersymmetric model over the minimal supersymmetric model in order to achieve
an ideal Higgs are emphasized. This leads us to the strongly motivated scenario
in which there is a Higgs $h$ with SM-like $WW,ZZ$ couplings and $\mh\sim
100\gev$ that decays via $h\to aa$ with $m_a<2m_b$, where $m_a>2m_\tau$ is
preferred, implying $a\to \tau^+ \tau^-$. The means for detecting an $h\to
aa\to 4\tau$ signal are then discussed. Some final cautionary and concluding
remarks are given.
