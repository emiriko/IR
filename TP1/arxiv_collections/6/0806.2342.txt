The influence of negative chemical pressure induced by gradual replacement of
Ca by Sr as well as of external pressure (up to 10 kbar) on the magnetism of
Ca3CoRhO6 has been investigated by magnetization studies. It is found that the
solid solution, Ca(3-x)Sr(x)CoRhO6, exists at least till about x= 1.0 without
any change in the crystal structure. Apart from insensitivity of the spin-chain
feature to volume expansion, the characteristic features of geometrical
frustration interestingly appear at the same temperatures for all compositions,
in sharp contrast to the response to Y substitution for Ca (reported
previously). Interestingly, huge frequency dependence of ac susceptibility
known for the parent compound persists for all compositions. We do not find a
change in the properties under external pressure. The stability of the magnetic
anomalies of this compound to the volume change (about 4%) is puzzling.
