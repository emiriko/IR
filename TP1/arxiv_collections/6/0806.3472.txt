This is the second of a series of four articles studying various
generalisations of Khovanov's diagram algebra. In this article we develop the
general theory of Khovanov's diagrammatically defined "projective functors" in
our setting. As an application, we give a direct proof of the fact that the
quasi-hereditary covers of generalised Khovanov algebras are Koszul.
