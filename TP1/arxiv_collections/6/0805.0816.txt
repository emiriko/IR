Recent developments in laser physics have called renewed attention to
Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams of paraxial light. In this paper we consider the
corresponding LG modes for the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, which
appear in the transversal plane at the laser beam's waist. We see how they
arise as Wigner transforms of Hermite-Gaussian modes, and we proceed to find a
closed form for their own Wigner transforms, providing an alternative to the
methods of Simon and Agarwal. Our main observation is that the Wigner transform
intertwines the creation and annihilation operators for the two classes of
modes.
