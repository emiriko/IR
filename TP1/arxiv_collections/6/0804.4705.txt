We prove that the most general solution of the Einstein equations with the
cosmological constant which admits a principal conformal Killing-Yano tensor is
the Kerr-NUT-(A)dS metric. Even when the Einstein equations are not imposed,
any spacetime admitting such hidden symmetry can be written in a canonical form
which guarantees the following properties: it is of the Petrov type D, it
allows the separation of variables for the Hamilton-Jacobi, Klein-Gordon, and
Dirac equations, the geodesic motion in such a spacetime is completely
integrable. These results naturally generalize the results obtained earlier in
four dimensions.
