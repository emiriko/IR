Almost hypercomplex manifolds with Hermitian and anti-Hermitian metrics are
considered. A linear connection $D$ is introduced such that the structure of
these manifolds is parallel with respect to D. Of special interest is the class
of the locally conformally equivalent manifolds of the manifolds with
covariantly constant almost complex structures and the case when the torsion of
D is D-parallel. Curvature properties of these manifolds are studied. An
example of 4-dimensional manifolds in the considered basic class is constructed
and characterized.
