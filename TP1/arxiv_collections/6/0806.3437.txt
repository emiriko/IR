We study the problem of \emph{local search} on a graph. Given a real-valued
black-box function f on the graph's vertices, this is the problem of
determining a local minimum of f--a vertex v for which f(v) is no more than f
evaluated at any of v's neighbors. In 1983, Aldous gave the first strong lower
bounds for the problem, showing that any randomized algorithm requires
$\Omega(2^{n/2 - o(1)})$ queries to determine a local minima on the
n-dimensional hypercube. The next major step forward was not until 2004 when
Aaronson, introducing a new method for query complexity bounds, both
strengthened this lower bound to $\Omega(2^{n/2}/n^2)$ and gave an analogous
lower bound on the quantum query complexity. While these bounds are very
strong, they are known only for narrow families of graphs (hypercubes and
grids). We show how to generalize Aaronson's techniques in order to give
randomized (and quantum) lower bounds on the query complexity of local search
for the family of vertex-transitive graphs. In particular, we show that for any
vertex-transitive graph G of N vertices and diameter d, the randomized and
quantum query complexities for local search on G are $\Omega(N^{1/2}/d\log N)$
and $\Omega(N^{1/4}/\sqrt{d\log N})$, respectively.
