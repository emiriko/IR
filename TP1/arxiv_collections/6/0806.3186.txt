We study the recently discovered phenomena of sudden death of entanglement
for a system of two qubits, each of them independently longitudinally damped by
a reservoir and subjected to a continuous driving. We show that driving
produces, in the interaction picture, an effective bath that has elements
amounting to various extra sources of noise (transverse, thermal squeezed,
thermal longitudinal). As a result, the time of sudden death decreases due to
driving, which we verify as well by direct numerical calculation. We suggest
that this phenomenon can be studied systematically using superconducting qubits
driven by microwave fields.
