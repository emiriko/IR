It is shown that response properties of a quantum harmonic oscillator are in
essence those of a classical oscillator, and that, paradoxical as it may be,
these classical properties underlie all quantum dynamical properties of the
system. The results are extended to non-interacting bosonic fields, both
neutral and charged.
