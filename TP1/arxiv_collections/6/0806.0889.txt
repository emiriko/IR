The reported discrepancy of the muon abnormal magnetic moment $a_\mu^{}$ has
impacts on the low energy phenomenology. In this paper we calculate the
corrections to $a_\mu$ in the standard model extended by the TeV scale seesaw
models. We show that the correction induced by the type-I seesaw model is
negative and of the order ${\cal O} (10^{-11})$, which can be neglected
compared with $a_\mu^{\rm SM}$. The correction induced by the type-II seesaw
model, which depends on the mass of the Higgs triplet $m_\Delta$ and the Yukawa
coupling $Y_\Delta$, can be of the order ${\cal O}(10^{-10})$ and compensate
for the discrepancy between $a_\mu^{\rm SM}$ and $a_{\mu}^{\rm exp}$. The
correction induced by the type-III seesaw model is also negative and can be of
the order ${\cal O}(10^{-10})$.
