For large d, we study quantum channels on C^d obtained by selecting randomly
N independent Kraus operators according to a probability measure mu on the
unitary group U(d). When mu is the Haar measure, we show that for
N>d/epsilon^2$, such a channel is epsilon-randomizing with high probability,
which means that it maps every state within distance epsilon/d (in operator
norm) of the maximally mixed state. This slightly improves on a result by
Hayden, Leung, Shor and Winter by optimizing their discretization argument.
Moreover, for general mu, we obtain a epsilon-randomizing channel provided N >
d (\log d)^6/epsilon^2$. For d=2^k (k qubits), this includes Kraus operators
obtained by tensoring k random Pauli matrices. The proof uses recent results on
empirical processes in Banach spaces.
