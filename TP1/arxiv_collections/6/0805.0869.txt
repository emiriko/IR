We consider a quantum two-level system perturbed by classical noise. The
noise is implemented as a stationary diffusion process in the off-diagonal
matrix elements of the Hamiltonian, representing a transverse magnetic field.
We determine the invariant measure of the system and prove its uniqueness. In
the case of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise, we determine the speed of convergence to
the invariant measure. Finally, we determine an approximate one-dimensional
diffusion equation for the transition probabilities. The proofs use both
spectral-theoretic and probabilistic methods.
