We study the QCD charge asymmetry in t\bar{t} production at the Tevatron. We
investigate the role of higher orders in perturbation theory by considering the
resummation of potentially large logarithmic corrections that arise near
partonic threshold. This requires us to employ the rapidity-dependent anomalous
dimension matrices that describe color mixing due to soft gluon emission in
both quark- and gluon-initiated processes. The charge asymmetry appears
directly in the resummed cross section at next-to-leading logarithm (NLL), and
we find that the first-order expansion of the NLL resummed charge asymmetry
reproduces the known fixed-order result for the asymmetry well. Beyond its
lowest order, the asymmetric component of the cross section is enhanced by the
same leading-logarithmic threshold corrections as the total cross section. As a
result, the charge asymmetry is robust with respect to the higher-order
perturbative corrections generated by threshold resummation. We observe that
the asymmetry increases with pair mass and with scattering angle.
