Using data taken with the CLEO-c detector at the Cornell Electron Storage
Ring, we have investigated the direct photon momentum spectrum in the decay
J/psi->gamma+gluon+gluon, via the 'tagged' process: e+e- -> psi(2S);
psi(2S)->J/psi pi+pi-; J/psi->photon + X. Including contributions from two-body
radiative decay processes, we find the ratio of the inclusive direct photon
branching fraction to that of the dominant three-gluon branching fraction to be
R=0.137+/-0.001+/-0.016+/-0.004, where the errors shown are statistical,
systematic, and the model-dependent uncertainty related to the extrapolation to
zero photon energy. The shape of the scaled photon energy spectrum in J/psi->gg
gamma is observed to be very similar to that of Upsilon(1S)->gg gamma. The R
value obtained is roughly consistent with that expected by a simple
quark-charge scaling of the value determined at the Upsilon(1S), but somewhat
higher than the value expected from the running of the strong coupling
constant.
