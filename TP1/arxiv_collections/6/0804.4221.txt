The Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), motivated by current
alternatives of quantum gravity, produces significant modifications to the
Hawking radiation and the final stage of black hole evaporation. We show that
incorporation of the GUP into the quantum tunneling process (based on the
null-geodesic method) causes correlations between the tunneling probability of
different modes in the black hole radiation spectrum. In this manner, the
quantum information becomes encrypted in the Hawking radiation, and information
can be recovered as non-thermal GUP correlations between tunneling
probabilities of different modes.
