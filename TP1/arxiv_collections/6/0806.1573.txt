We consider spin-orbit coupling effects in Na$_4$Ir$_3$O$_8$, a material in
which Ir$^{4+}$ spins form an hyper-kagom\'{e} lattice, a three-dimensional
network of corner-sharing triangles. We argue that both low temperature
thermodynamic measurements and the impurity susceptibility induced by dilute
substitution of Ti for Ir are suggestive of significant spin-orbit effects.
Because of uncertainties in the crystal-field parameters, we consider two
limits in which the spin-orbit coupling is either weak or strong compared to
the non-cubic atomic splittings. A semi-microscopic calculation of the exchange
Hamiltonian confirms that indeed large antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM)
and/or symmetric exchange anisotropy may be present. In the strong spin-orbit
limit, the Ir-O-Ir superexchange contribution consists of unfrustrated strong
symmetric exchange anisotropy, and we suggest that spin-liquid behavior is
unlikely. In the weak spin-orbit limit, and for strong spin-orbit and direct
Ir-Ir exchange, the Hamiltonian consists of Heisenberg and DM interactions. The
DM coupling is parametrized by a three component DM vector (which must be
determined empirically). For a range of orientation of this vector, frustration
is relieved and an ordered state occurs. For other orientations, even the
classical ground states are very complex. We perform spin-wave and exact
diagonalization calculations which suggest the persistence of a quantum spin
liquid in the latter regime. Applications to Na$_4$Ir$_3$O$_8$ and broader
implications are discussed.
