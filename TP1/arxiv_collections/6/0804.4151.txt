We have experimentally studied the reflection of a weak probe beam from a
dense atomic potassium vapor in the presence of a strong laser field tuned to
the atomic resonance transition. We have observed an Autler-Townes doublet
under hitherto unexplored conditions, namely that the Rabi frequency induced by
the strong laser field is much smaller than the self-broadened width of the
resonance transition of the unexcited vapor. We attribute our observation to a
reduction of the atomic decoherence by the strong drive field. We present a
theoretical model of nonlinear processes in a dense atomic gas to explain the
observed results.
