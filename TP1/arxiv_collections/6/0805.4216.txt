We explore the constraints on the spectrum of primary fields implied by
modularity of the elliptic genus of N=(2,2) 2D CFT's. We show that such
constraints have nontrivial implications for the existence of "extremal"
N=(2,2) conformal field theories. Applications to AdS3 supergravity and flux
compactifications are addressed.
