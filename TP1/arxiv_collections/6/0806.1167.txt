In general relativity, the instantaneous contributions to the gravitational
potentials cancel each other in observable, leaving the theory free of physical
instantaneous interactions. In models where these subtle cancellations are
spoiled by the presence of fields that break Lorentz invariance, physical
instantaneous interactions are possible. Such interactions are studied for a
model of Lorentz- violating massive gravity.
