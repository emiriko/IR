We present an approach of mass generation for Standard Model particles in
which fermions acquire masses from their interactions with physical vacuum and
gauge bosons acquire masses from charge fluctuations of vacuum. A remarkable
fact of this approach is that left-handed neutrinos are massive because they
have a weak charge. We obtain consistently masses of electroweak gauge bosons
in terms of fermion masses and running coupling constants of strong,
electromagnetic and weak interactions. On the last part of this work we focus
our interest to present some consequences of this approach as for instance we
first show a restriction about the possible number of fermion families. Next we
establish a prediction for top quark mass and finally fix the highest limit for
the summing of the square of neutrino masses.
