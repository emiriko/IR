We present an overview of the recent abundant measurements for charm
production at RHIC. The significant information of charm cross sections in
different collision system at 200 GeV and charmed hadron freeze-out and flow
properties extracted from these measurements are presented. The heavy flavor
energy loss in the medium and heavy flavor related azimuthal correlations in
heavy ion collisions are also discussed.
