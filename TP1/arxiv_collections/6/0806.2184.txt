A modified Newton's gravity is obtained as the weak field approximation of
the Einstein's equation in Finsler space. It is found that a specified Finsler
structure makes the modified Newton's gravity equivalent to the modified
Newtonian dynamics (MOND). In the framework of Finsler geometry, the flat
rotation curves of spiral galaxies can be deduced naturally without invoking
dark matter.
