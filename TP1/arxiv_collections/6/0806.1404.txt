We propose a simple yet effective method which allows one to attain large
reversible shape changes in shape memory bimetallic composites without training
procedure. It is based on the conservation of strongly anisotropic martensite
microstructure artificially created in the shape memory layer. This procedure
results in appearance of stress field when the shape memory layer is
transformed to the austenitic state which brings about two-way shape memory
effect. Utilization of this method for preparation of TiNi-based composite with
a thickness of 60 \mu m allowed us to achieve 0.9% reversible bending
deformation. It is also suggested that the implementation of this method during
preparation of piezoelectric or magnetostrictive composites permits to imprint
bias stress and thus to improve their characteristics without use of an
external load.
