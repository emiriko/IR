A theory concerning non-zero macroscopic chirality-dependent force between a
source mass and homochiral molecules due to the exchange of light particles is
presented in this paper. This force is proposed to have opposite sign for
molecules with opposite chirality. Using the central field approximation, we
calculate this force between a copper block and a vessel of chiral molecules
(methyl phenyl carbinol nitrite). The magnitude of force is estimated with the
published limits of the scalar and pseudo-scalar coupling constants. Based on
our theoretical model, this force may violate the equivalence principle when
the homochiral molecules are used to be the test masses.
