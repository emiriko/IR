Using Monte Carlo simulations, we study a Higgs transition in several
three-dimensional lattice realizations of the noncompact CP$^1$ model
(NCCP$^1$), a gauge theory with two complex matter fields with SU(2)
invariance. By comparing with a one-component theory, which is well understood
and has continuous transition in the inverted XY universality class, we argue
that the two-component case also has continuous Higgs transition with a larger
correlation length exponent (i.e., it is ``more continuous''). The transition
can become first order in the vicinity of a new ``Molecular'' phase, which
occurs in one of our models, but is continuous in a wide range of parameters
away from this phase. The situation is significantly clarified by studying a
model where the Molecular phase is entirely absent, and a wide regime with a
continuous transition can be readily established. The two-component theory is
also an effective description of the hedgehog-suppressed O(3) universality, and
results are relevant for the recently discussed ``deconfined quantum
criticality'' scenario for the continuous Valence Bond Solid to Neel quantum
phase transition.
