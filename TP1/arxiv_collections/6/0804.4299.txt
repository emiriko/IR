The late Kazuo Kondo left a hitherto unknown a priori particle theory which
provides predictions of massive particles which may be detected by the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC). This article briefly introduces Kondo's work and
documents the derivation and masses of his expected hyper-mesons,
hyper-hadrons, heavy leptons and massive neutrinos. Several particles in these
classes may have already been detected.
