We investigate the relevance of quantum effects in the study of bulk tachyon
dynamics. We analyze the behavior of a system which consists of a tachyon, the
graviton and the dilaton through the use of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in the
mini-superspace approximation, The singular behavior of the classical solution
for the system is modified so that the quantum behavior seems to be regular.
