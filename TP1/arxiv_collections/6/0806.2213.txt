In the present work, the temperature dependence of the scalar mesons
parameters is investigated in the framework of thermal QCD sum rules. We
calculate sigma-pole and the non-resonant two-pion continuum contributions to
the spectral density. Taking into account additional operators appearing at
finite temperature, the thermal QCD sum rules are derived. The temperature
dependence of the shifts in the mass and leptonic decay constant of scalar
sigma(600) meson is calculated.
