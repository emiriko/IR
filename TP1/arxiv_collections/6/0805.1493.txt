Let $f\colon M\to M$ be an expansive homeomorphism with dense topologically
hyperbolic periodic points, $M$ a compact manifold. Then there is a local
product structure in an open and dense subset of $M$. Moreover, if some
topologically hyperbolic periodic point has codimension one, then this local
product structure is uniform. In particular, we conclude that the homeomorphism
is conjugated to a linear Anosov diffeomorphism of a torus.
