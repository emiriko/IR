We report on zero field cooled magnetization relaxation experiments on a
concen- trated frozen ferrofluid exhibiting a low temperature superspin glass
transition. With a method initially developed for spin glasses, we investigate
the field dependence of the relaxations that take place after different aging
times. We extract the typical number of correlated spins involved in the aging
dynamics. This brings important insights into the dynamical correlation length
and its time growth. Our results, consistent with expressions obtained for spin
glasses, extend the generality of these behaviours to the class of superspin
glasses. Since the typical flipping time is much larger for superspins than for
atomic spins, our experiments probe a time regime much closer to that of
numerical simulations.
