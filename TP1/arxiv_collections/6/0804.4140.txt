We study the resonant transmission of light in a coupled-resonator optical
waveguide interacting with two nearly identical side cavities. We reveal and
describe a novel effect of the coupled-resonator-induced reflection (CRIR)
characterized by a very high and easily tunable quality factor of the
reflection line, for the case of the inter-site coupling between the cavities
and the waveguide. This effect differs sharply from the
coupled-resonator-induced transparency (CRIT) -- an all-optical analogue of the
electromagnetically-induced transparency -- which has recently been studied
theoretically and observed experimentally for the structures based on
micro-ring resonators and photonic crystal cavities. Both CRIR and CRIT effects
have the same physical origin which can be attributed to the Fano-Feshbach
resonances in the systems exhibiting more than one resonance. We discuss the
applicability of the novel CRIR effect to the control of the slow-light
propagation and low-threshold all-optical switching.
