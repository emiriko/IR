We consider the local dimension spectrum of a weak Gibbs measure on a C^1
non-uniformly hyperbolic system of Manneville- Pomeau type. We present the
spectrum in three ways: using invariant measures, uniformly hyperbolic ergodic
measures and equilibrium states. We are also proving analyticity of the
spectrum under additional assumptions. All three presentations are well known
for smooth uniformly hyperbolic systems.
