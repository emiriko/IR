Spin correlations are carefully investigated in elastic $e^{+}e^{-}$
scattering in QED, for initially \textit{polarized} as well as
\textit{unpolarized} particles, with emphasis placed on energy or speed of the
underlying particles involved in the process. An explicit expression is derived
for the corresponding transition probabilities in closed form to the leading
order. These expressions are unlike the ones obtained from simply combining
spins of the relevant particles which are of kinematic nature. It is remarkable
that these explicit results obtained from quantum field theory show a clear
violation of Bell's inequality at \textit{all} energies in support of quantum
theory in the relativistic regime. We hope that our explicit expression
obtained will lead to experiments in the manner described in the bulk of this
paper by monitoring speed.
