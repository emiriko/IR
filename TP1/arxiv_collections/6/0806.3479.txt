In a recent study, (Grigorov, 2006) analyzed temporal gene expression
profiles (Arbeitman et al., 2002) generated in a Drosophila experiment using
SSA in conjunction with Monte-Carlo SSA. The author (Grigorov, 2006) makes
three important claims in his article, namely:
  Claim1: A new method based on the theory of nonlinear time series analysis is
used to capture the global dynamics of the fruit-fly cycle temporal gene
expression profiles.
  Claim 2: Flattening of a significant part of the eigen-spectrum confirms the
hypothesis about an underly-ing high-dimensional chaotic generating process.
  Claim 3: Monte-Carlo SSA can be used to establish whether a given time series
is distinguishable from any well-defined process including deterministic chaos.
  In this report we present fundamental concerns with respect to the above
claims (Grigorov, 2006) in a systematic manner with simple examples. The
discussion provided especially discourages the choice of SSA for inferring
nonlinear dynamical structure form time series obtained in any biological
paradigm.
