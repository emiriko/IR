Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in ultra high vacuum and atomic
force microscopy, we investigate the corrugation of graphene flakes deposited
by exfoliation on a Si/SiO2 (300 nm) surface. While the corrugation on SiO2 is
long-range with a correlation length of about 25 nm, some of the graphene
monolayers exhibit an additional corrugation with a preferential wave length of
about 15 nm. A detailed analysis shows that the long range corrugation of the
substrate is also visible on graphene, but with a reduced amplitude, leading to
the conclusion that the graphene is partly freely suspended between hills of
the substrate. Thus, the intrinsic rippling observed previously on artificially
suspended graphene can exist as well, if graphene is deposited on SiO2.
