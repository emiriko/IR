We investigate the response of two three-body Coulomb systems when driven by
attosecond half-cycle pulses: The hydrogen molecular ion and the helium atom.
Using very short half-cycle pulses (HCPs) which effectively deliver ``kicks''
to the electrons, we first study how a carefully chosen sequence of HCPs can be
used to control to which of one of the two fixed atomic centers the electron
gets re-attached. Moving from one electron in two atomic centers to two
electrons in one atomic center we then study the double ionization from the
ground state of He by a sequence of attosecond time-scale HCPs, with each
electron receiving effectively a ``kick'' from each HCP. We investigate how the
net electric field of the sequence of HCPs affects the total and differential
ionization probabilities.
