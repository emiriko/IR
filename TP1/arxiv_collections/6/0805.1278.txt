In this paper, we will propose a new synchronous stream cipher named DICING,
which can be viewed as a clock-controlled one but with a new mechanism of
altering steps. It has satisfactory performance and there have not been found
weakness for the known attacks, the key sizes can be 128bits and 256bits
respectively.
