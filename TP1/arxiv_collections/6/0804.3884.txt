The main purpose of the following article is to give a proof of Y. Kawamata's
celebrated subadjunction theorem in the spirit of our previous work on Bergman
kernels. We will use two main ingredients : an $\displaystyle L^{2\over
m}$--extension theorem of Ohsawa-Takegoshi type (which is also a new result)
and a more complete version of our former results.
