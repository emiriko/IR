The density matrix, \rho, of a model polariton system is obtained numerically
from a master equation which takes account of pumping and losses. In the
stationary limit, the coherences between eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are
three orders of magnitude smaller than the occupations, meaning that the
stationary density matrix is approximately diagonal in the energy
representation. A weakly distorted grand canonical Gibbs distribution fits well
the occupations.
