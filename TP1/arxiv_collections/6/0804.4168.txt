The production of low mass e+e- pairs for m_{e+e-} < 300 MeV/c^2 and 1 < p_T
<5 GeV/c is measured in p+p and Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV.
Enhanced yield above hadronic sources is observed. Treating the excess as
internal conversions, the invariant yield of direct photons is deduced. In
central Au+Au collisions, the excess of direct photon yield over p+p is
exponential in transverse momentum, with inverse slope T = 221 +/- 19 (stat)
+/- 19 (syst) MeV. Hydrodynamical models with initial temperatures ranging from
300--600 MeV at times of ~ 0.6 - 0.15 fm/c after the collision are in
qualitative agreement with the data. Lattice QCD predicts a phase transition to
quark gluon plasma at ~ 170 MeV.
