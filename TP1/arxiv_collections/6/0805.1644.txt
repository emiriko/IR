In this article, Generalized Principle of "limiting 4-dimensional symmetry":
The laws of physics in non-inertial frames must display the 4-dimensional
symmetry of the Generalized Lorentz-Poincare group in the limit of zero
acceleration,is proposed.Classical solution of the relativistic length
expansion in general accelerated system revisited.
