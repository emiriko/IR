Expressions for electric and magnetic charges of dyons, which become massless
in the strong-coupling limit of the supersymmetric N=2 gauge theory with an
arbitrary gauge group are presented. Transitions into different vacua of the N
=1 gauge theory, when the N=2 supersymmetry is broken explicitly to the N =1
case, are discussed. The existence of a minimal set of light dyons, which are
necessary to describe this transition, is established. The total number of
these dyons equals the product of the rank and dual Coxeter number of the gauge
group. A conjecture, which states that this minimal set incorporates all
possible light dyons, is discussed. A relation of dyon charges with monodromies
at weak and strong couplings is outlined and comparison with known charges of
dyons for particular gauge groups is made.
