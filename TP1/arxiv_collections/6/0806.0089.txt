We show that every split del Pezzo surface of degree d=5,4,3 or 2 has a
universal torsor which is a dense open subset of the intersection of 6-d
dilatations of the affine cone over the corresponding generalized Grassmannian
G/P. Here a dilatation is the linear transformation by an element of the
'diagonal' torus. This gives a concise description of the quadratic equations
of universal torsors obtained by Popov and Derenthal. Any (possibly, non-split)
del Pezzo surface with a rational point has a universal torsor which embeds
into the same homogeneous space as a split surface of the same degree. The
proof uses a recent result of Ph. Gille and Raghunathan.
