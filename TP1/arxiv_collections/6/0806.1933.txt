Pairing symmetry in oxypnictides, a new family of multiband high-Tc
superconductors, is partially imposed by the positions of multiple Fermi
pockets, which itself can give rise to new order parameters, such as s+,-
states or the state of dx^2-y^2 symmetry. Other pairing states may appear on
small pockets for long range interactions, but they are expected to be
sensitive to defects. We identify the competing antiferromagnetic order with
the triplet exciton transition in the semi- metallic background and discuss
whether its coexistence with superconductivity explains the doping dependence
of Tc.
