Ghost imaging with thermal light in scattering media is investigated. We
demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally for the first time that the
image with high quality can still be obtained in the scattering media by ghost
imaging. The scattering effect on the qualities of the images obtained when the
object is illuminated directly by the thermal light and ghost imaging is
analyzed theoretically. Its potential applications are also discussed.
