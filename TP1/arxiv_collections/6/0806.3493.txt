We analyze the Bethe ansatz equations describing the complete spectrum of the
transition matrix of the partially asymmetric exclusion process on a finite
lattice and with the most general open boundary conditions. We extend results
obtained recently for totally asymmetric diffusion [J. de Gier and F.H.L.
Essler, J. Stat. Mech. P12011 (2006)] to the case of partial symmetry. We
determine the finite-size scaling of the spectral gap, which characterizes the
approach to stationarity at large times, in the low and high density regimes
and on the coexistence line. We observe boundary induced crossovers and discuss
possible interpretations of our results in terms of effective domain wall
theories.
