The complex scaled hyperspherical adiabatic expansion method is used to
compute momentum and energy distributions of the three $\alpha$-particles
emerging from the decay of low-lying $^{12}$C-resonances. The large distance
continuum properties of the wave functions are crucial and must be accurately
calculated. We discuss separately decays of natural parity states: two $0^+$,
one $1^{-}$, three $2^+$, one $3^-$, two $4^+$, one $6^+$, and one of each of
unnatural parity, $1^{+}$, $2^-$, $3^+$, $4^-$. The lowest natural parity state
of each $J^{\pi}$ decays predominantly sequentially via the $^{8}$Be ground
state whereas other states including unnatural parity states predominantly
decay directly to the continuum. We present Dalitz plots and systematic
detailed momentum correlations of the emerging $\alpha$-particles.
