High Tc superconductivity in La2-xSrxCuO4 coexists with (striped and glassy)
magnetic order. Here, we report NMR measurements of the 139La spin-lattice
relaxation, which displays a stretched-exponential time dependence, in both
pure and disordered x=0.12 single crystals. An analysis in terms of a
distribution of relaxation rates T1^-1 indicates that i) the spin-freezing
temperature is spatially inhomogeneous with an onset at Tg(onset)=20 K for the
pristine samples, and ii) the width of the T1^-1 distribution in the vicinity
of Tg(onset) is insensitive to an ~1% level of atomic disorder in CuO2 planes.
This suggests that the stretched-exponential 139La relaxation, considered as a
manifestation of the systems glassiness, may not arise from quenched disorder.
