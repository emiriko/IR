A method is proposed for obtaining three simultaneous projections of a target
from a single radiation pulse, which also allows the relative orientation of
successive targets to be determined. The method has application to femtosecond
X-ray diffraction, and does not require solution of the phase problem. We show
that the principle axes of a compact charge-density distribution can be
obtained from projections of its autocorrelation function, which is directly
accessible in diffraction experiments. The results may have more general
application to time resolved tomographic pump-probe experiments and time-series
imaging.
