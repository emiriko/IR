In this communication, the convergence of the 1/t and Wang - Landau
algorithms in the calculation of multidimensional numerical integrals is
analyzed. Both simulation methods are applied to a wide variety of integrals
without restrictions in one, two and higher dimensions. The errors between the
exact and the calculated values of the integral are obtained and the efficiency
and accuracy of the methods are determined by their dynamical behavior. The
comparison between both methods and the simple sampling Monte Carlo method is
also reported. It is observed that the time dependence of the errors calculated
with 1/t algorithm goes as N^{-1/2} (with N the MC trials) in quantitative
agreement with the simple sampling Monte Carlo method. It is also showed that
the error for the Wang - Landau algorithm saturates in time evidencing the
non-convergence of the methods. The sources for the error are also determined.
