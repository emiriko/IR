It is shown that the 4D Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations with a phantom scalar
field (a scalar field with a negative sign in front of the kinetic energy term
of its Lagrange density) has non-singular, spherically symmetry solutions.
These solutions have a combination of features found in other spherically
symmetric gravity plus field solutions. A stability analysis on these solutions
indicates they are unstable.
