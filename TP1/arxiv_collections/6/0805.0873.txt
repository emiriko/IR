In this study, we developed a top/down methodology for behavioral and
structural modeling of multi-domain microsystems. Then, we validated this
methodology through a study case : a piezoelectric microgenerator. We also
proved the effectiveness of VHDL-AMS language not only for modeling in
behavioral and structural levels but also in writing physical models that can
predict the experimental results. Finally, we validated these models by
presenting and discussing simulations results.
