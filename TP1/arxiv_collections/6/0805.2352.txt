The coexistence between Quantum Mechanics and Special Relativity is usually
formulated in terms of the no-signaling condition. Several authors have even
suggested that this condition should be included between the basic postulates
of Quantum Theory. However, there are several scenarios where signaling is, in
principle, possible: based on previous results and the analysis of the relation
between unitarity and signaling we present an example of a two-particle
interferometric arrangement for which the dynamics is, in principle, compatible
with superluminal transmission of information. This type of non-locality is not
in the line of Bell's theorem, but closer in spirit to the one-particle
acausality studied by Hegerfeldt and others. We analyze in this paper the
meaning of this non-locality and how to preserve the coexistence of the two
fundamental theories in this signaling scenario.
