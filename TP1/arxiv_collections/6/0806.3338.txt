A solution of the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation perturbed by a parametric
driver is studied. The frequency of the parametric perturbation varies slowly
and passes through a resonant value. It yields a change in a solution. We
obtain a connection formula for the asymptotic solution before and after the
resonance.
