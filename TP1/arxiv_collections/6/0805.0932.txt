This paper concerns a new design of RF MEMS switch combined with an
innovative process which enable low actuation voltage (<5V) and avoid stiction.
First, the structure described with principal design issues, the corresponding
anti-stiction system is presented and FEM simulations are done. Then, a short
description of the process flow based on two non polymer sacrificial layers.
Finally, RF measurements are presented and preliminary experimental protocol
and results of anti-stiction validation is detailed. Resulting RF performances
are -30dB of isolation and -0.45dB of insertion loss at 10 GHz.
