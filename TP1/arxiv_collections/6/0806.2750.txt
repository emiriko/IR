This paper has been withdrawn by the authors, because the authors have made
abundant revisions and resubmitted the modified new version entitled
"Laser-induced atomic fragment fluorescence spectroscopy: A facile technique
for molecular spectroscopy of spin-forbidden states" to arXiv:0812.4554. Thanks
for your attention.
