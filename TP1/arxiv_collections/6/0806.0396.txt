Theoretical investigations of spin transfer torque in magnetic tunnel
junctions using the tight-binding model in the framework of non-equilibrium
Green functions formalism are presented. We show that the behavior of the spin
transfer torque as a function of applied voltage can vary over a wide range
depending on the band parameters of the ferromagnetic electrodes and the
insulator that comprise the magnetic tunnel junction. The behavior of both the
parallel and perpendicular components of the spin torque is addressed. This
behavior is explained in terms of the spin and charge current dependence and on
the interplay between evanescent states in the insulator and the Fermi surfaces
of ferromagnetic electrodes comprising the junction. The origin of the
perpendicular (field-like) component of spin transfer torque at zero bias, i.e.
exchange coupling through the barrier between ferromagnetic electrodes is
discussed.
