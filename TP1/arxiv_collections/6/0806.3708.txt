Purpose: This paper presents the preliminary results of a semi-automatic
method for prostate segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) which aims
to be incorporated in a navigation system for prostate brachytherapy. Methods:
The method is based on the registration of an anatomical atlas computed from a
population of 18 MRI exams onto a patient image. An hybrid registration
framework which couples an intensity-based registration with a robust
point-matching algorithm is used for both atlas building and atlas
registration. Results: The method has been validated on the same dataset that
the one used to construct the atlas using the "leave-one-out method". Results
gives a mean error of 3.39 mm and a standard deviation of 1.95 mm with respect
to expert segmentations. Conclusions: We think that this segmentation tool may
be a very valuable help to the clinician for routine quantitative image
exploitation.
