For a prime number p>2, we give a direct proof of Breuil's classification of
killed by p finite flat group schemes over the valuation ring of a p-adic field
with perfect residue field. As application we prove that the Galois modules of
geometric points of such group schemes and of their characteristic p analogues
coming from Faltings's strict modules can be identified via the
Fontaine-Wintenberger field-of-norms functor.
