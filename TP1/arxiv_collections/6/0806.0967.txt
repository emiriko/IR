In an earlier work we showed that the gravitational interaction could be
reproduced as a retarded dispersion interaction (Casimir interaction) between
particles composed of hypothetical particles having harmonic oscillator
interactions. Here we derive the modification of the force when the vacuum
modes have a small but finite temperature. The resulting interaction is of
finite range. We give the result on analytical form.
