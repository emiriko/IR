We study numerically the effects of nonlinearity on the Anderson localization
in lattices with disorder in one and two dimensions. The obtained results show
that at moderate strength of nonlinearity an unlimited spreading over the
lattice in time takes place with an algebraic growth of number of populated
sites $\Delta n \propto t^{\nu}$. The numerical values of $\nu$ are found to be
approximately $0.15 - 0.2$ and 0.25 for the dimension $d=1$ and 2 respectively
being in a satisfactory agreement with the theoretical value $d/(3d+2)$. The
localization is preserved below a certain critical value of nonlinearity. We
also discuss the properties of the fidelity decay induced by a perturbation of
nonlinear field.
