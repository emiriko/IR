This paper studies affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties in the affine flag
manifold of a split group. Among other things, it proves emptiness for certain
of these varieties, relates some of them to those for Levi subgroups, extends
previous conjectures concerning their dimensions, and generalizes the superset
method.
