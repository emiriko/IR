We develop further the formalism of the non-Abelian gauge field theory on a
cell complex space-time and show how the gauge-invariant action and the
equations of motion for gauge fields interacting with spinors can be written
without a reference to the geometrical nature of the cells of the cell complex.
The general results are illustrated with examples of solutions of equations of
motion for U(N) and SU(N) gauge groups.
