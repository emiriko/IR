The dynamics of the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian is studied in the
semiclassical limit by reducing it to quantum normal form and deriving the
phase space dynamics of classically smooth observables. The resulting
systematic semiclassical approximation is used to analyze the Rabi oscillations
of a photon wave packet revealing subtle consequences of the uncertainty
principle.
