In the present work, a relation has been established between degree of
polarization and effective mass ratio (EMR) and magnetoresistance (MR) of
one-dimensional non-degenerate system (which can represent a nano-wire or a
linear chain of atoms and molecules in one dimension) by using a non-degenerate
Hubbard model, which includes diagonal and off-diagonal matrix elements of
Coulomb interaction. EMR is one of the most important property, which provides
information that how much itinerant the system is? Within the mean field
approximation, it is found that, due to the presence of off-diagonal elements,
the band narrowing effect dominates over the band splitting effect. The EMR
varies with degree of polarization. EMR for majority (up spin) carriers
decreases as magnetization increases below ferromagnetic transition
temperature. MR decreases as system is cooled below the ferromagnetic
transition temperature. A comparison of our results with existing experimental
observations is made.
