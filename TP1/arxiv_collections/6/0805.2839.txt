We investigate the possible superconducting pairing symmetries which would
account for the latest experimental results on the Bechgaard salts. Using a
renormalization group (R.G) technique we calculate the couplings of the singlet
and triplet interactions in the quasi 1D Hamiltonian. In the presence of
interchain interactions, the singlet and triplet couplings are of the same
order of magnitude. The renormalized couplings are then used in an RPA
calculation to evaluate the critical fields of superconductivity for the two
dominant order parameter symmetries in the R.G flow, i.e, the dx2-y2 and fy
symmetries. It is shown that, for the standard values of the anisotropy ratio
of the Fermi surface, the critical fields of the singlet symmetry are strongly
reduced. A reentrant superconductivity is however still present for the triplet
state.
