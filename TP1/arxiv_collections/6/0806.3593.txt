Quantum interference in coherent transport through single molecular rings may
provide a mechanism to control current in molecular electronics. We investigate
its applicability by using a single-particle Green function method combined
with ab initio electronic structure calculations. We find that the quantum
interference effect (QIE) depends strongly on the interaction between molecular
pi states and contact sigma states. It is absent in small molecular rings with
Au leads, such as benzene, due to strong pi-sigma hybridization, while it is
preserved in large rings, such as [18]annulene, which then could be used to
realize QIE transistors.
