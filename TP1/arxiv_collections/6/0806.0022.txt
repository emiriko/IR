Based on the classical Langevin equation, we have re-visited the problem of
orbital motion of a charged particle in two dimensions for a normal magnetic
field crossed with or without an in-plane electric bias. We are led to two
interesting fluctuation effects: First, we obtain not only a longitudinal
"work-fluctuation" relation as expected for a barotropic type system, but also
a transverse work-fluctuation relation perpendicular to the electric bias. This
"Hall fluctuation" involves the product of the electric and the magnetic
fields. And second, for the case of harmonic confinement without bias, the
calculated probability density for the orbital magnetic moment gives non-zero
even moments, not derivable as field derivatives of the classical free energy.
