In this paper, a heuristic method to compute the Selberg zeta function for
Hecke triangle groups, $G_q$ ($q>=3$) is described. The algorithm is based on
the transfer operator method and an overview of the relevant background is
given. We give numerical support for the claim that the method works and can be
used to compute the Selberg Zeta function for $G_q$ to any desired precision.
We also present some numerical results obtained by implementing the algorithm.
