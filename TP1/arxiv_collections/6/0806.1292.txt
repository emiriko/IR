Isochores are long genome segments relatively homogeneous in G+C. A heuristic
algorithm based on entropic segmentation has been developed by our group, and a
web server implementing all the required components is available. However, a
researcher may want to perform batch processing of many sequences
simultaneously in its local machine, instead of analyzing them on one by one
basis through the web. To this end, standalone versions are required. We report
here the implementation of two standalone programs, able to predict isochores
at the sequence level: 1) a command-line version (IsoFinder) for Windows and
Linux systems; and 2) a user-friendly version (IsoFinderWin) running under
Windows.
