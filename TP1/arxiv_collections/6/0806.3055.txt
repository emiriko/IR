The mechanism of rapid and selective heating of magnetic metal oxides under
the magnetic field of microwaves which continues beyond the Curie temperature $
T_{c} $ is identified by using the Heisenberg model. Monte Carlo calculations
based on the energy principle show that such heating is caused by non-resonant
response of electron spins in the unfilled 3d shell to the wave magnetic field.
Small spin reorientation thus generated leads to a large internal energy change
through the exchange interactions between spins, which becomes maximal around $
T_{c} $ for magnetite $ {\rm Fe}_{3}{\rm O}_{4} $. The dissipative spin
dynamics simulation yields the imaginary part of the magnetic susceptibility,
which becomes largest around $ T_{c} $ and for the microwave frequency around 2
GHz. Hematite $ {\rm Fe}_{2}{\rm O}_{3} $ with weak spontaneous magnetization
responds much less to microwaves as observed in experiments. The heating of
titanium oxide by microwave magnetic field only when oxygen defects are present
is also explained by our theory in terms of the absence of spontaneous
magnetization.
