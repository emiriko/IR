In this paper, we study the domain wall with time dependent displacement
vectors based on Lyra geometry in normal gauge i.e. displacement vector $f^*_i
= [ \beta (t), 0,0,0]$. The field theoretic energy momentum tensor is
considered with zero pressure perpendicular to the wall. We find an exact
solutions of Einstein equation for a scalar field $\phi$ with a potential
$V(\phi)$ describing the gravitational field of a plane symmetric domain wall.
We have seen that the hyper surfaces parallel to the wall ($ z = constant $)
are three dimensional de-sitter spaces. It is also shown that the gravitational
field experienced by test particle is attractive.
