We include the effects of anisotropy and polarization in the hydrodynamics of
inhomogeneous vortex tangles, thus generalizing the well known
Hall-Vinen-Bekarevich-Khalatnikov equations, which do not take them in
consideration. These effects contribute to the mutual friction force ${\bf
F}_{ns}$ between normal and superfluid components and to the vortex tension
force $\rho_s{\bf T}$. These equations are complemented by an evolution
equation for the vortex line density $L$, which takes into account these
contributions. These equations are expected to be more suitable than the usual
ones for rotating counterflows, or turbulence behind a cylinder, or turbulence
produced by a grid of parallel thin cylinders towed across a superfluid,
because in these situations polarization is expected to play a relevant role.
