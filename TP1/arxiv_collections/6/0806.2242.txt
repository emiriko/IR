We suggest a method to create turbulence in a Bose-Einstein condensate. The
method consists in, firstly, creating an ordered vortex array, and, secondly,
imprinting a phase difference in different regions of the condensate. By
solving numerically the two-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation we show that
the motion of the resulting positive and negative vortices is disordered.
