We consider a class of Fourier integral operators, globally defined on
$\mathbb{R}^{d}$, with symbols and phases satisfying product type estimates
(the so-called $SG$ or scattering classes). We prove a sharp continuity result
for such operators when acting on the modulation spaces $M^p$. The minimal loss
of derivatives is shown to be $d|1/2-1/p|$. This global perspective produces a
loss of decay as well, given by the same order. Strictly related, striking
examples of unboundedness on $L^p$ spaces are presented.
