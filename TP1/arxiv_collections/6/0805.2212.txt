The contribution of the fundamental gap E_ as well as those of the E_ +
Delta(so) and E+ transitions to the dielectric function of GaAs1-xNx alloys
near the band edge were determined from variable-angle spectroscopic
ellipsometry and modulated photoreflectance spectroscopy analyses. The
oscillator strength of the E_ optical transition increases weakly with nitrogen
incorporation. The two experimental techniques independently reveal that not
only the oscillator strength of the E+ transition but also that of E_ +
Delta(so) become larger compared to that of the fundamental gap as the N
content increases. Since the same conduction band is involved in both the E_
transition and its split-off replica, these results reveal that adding nitrogen
in GaAs1-xNx alloys affects not only the conduction but also the valence bands.
