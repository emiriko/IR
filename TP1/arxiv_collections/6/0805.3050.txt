In a recent article [1] we have explored alternative decompositions of the
Lorentz transformation by adopting the synchronization convention of the target
frame at the end and alternately at the outset. In this note we develop the
decomposition by assuming a correct universal synchronization that may be
outside the two inertial frames that are involved.
