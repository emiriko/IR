We express the Hamiltonian of the quantum trigonometric Calogero-Sutherland
model for the Lie algebra E8 and coupling constant k=1 by using the fundamental
irreducible characters of the algebra as dynamical independent variables. Then,
we compute the second order characters of the algebra and some higher order
characters.
