We study spin relaxation and dynamics of collective spin excitations in
correlated double--exchange ferromagnets. For this, we introduce an expansion
of the Green's functions equations of motion that treats non--perturbativerly
all correlations between a given number of spin and charge excitations and
becomes exact within a sub--space of states. Our method treats relaxation
beyond Fermi's Golden Rule while recovering previous variational results for
the spin--wave dispersion. We find that the momentum dependence of the
spin--wave dephasing rate changes qualitatively due to the on--site Coulomb
interaction, in a way that resembles experiment, and depends on its interplay
with the magnetic exchange interaction and itinerant spin lifetime. We show
that the collective spin relaxation and its dependence on the carrier
concentration depends sensitively on three--body correlations between a spin
excitation and a Fermi sea electron and hole. The above spin dynamics can be
controlled via the itinerant carrier population.
