We calculate the ion distributions around an interface in fluid mixtures of
highly polar and less polar fluids (water and oil) for two and three ion
species. We take into account the solvation and image interactions between ions
and solvent. We show that hydrophilic and hydrophobic ions tend to undergo a
microphase separation at an interface, giving rise to an enlarged electric
double layer. We also derive a general expression for the surface tension of
electrolyte systems, which contains a negative electrostatic contribution
proportional to the square root of the bulk salt density. The amplitude of this
square-root term is small for hydrophilic ion pairs, but is much increased for
hydrophilic and hydrophobic ion pairs. For three ion species including
hydrophilic and hydrophobic ions, we calculate the ion distributions to explain
those obtained by x-ray reflectivity measurements.
