We show that the application of the pinch technique to the conventional
Schwinger-Dyson equations for the gluon propagator, gluon-quark vertex, and
three-gluon vertex, gives rise to new equations endowed with special
properties. The new series coincides with the one obtained in the Feynman gauge
of the background field method, thus capturing the extensive gauge
cancellations implemented by the pinch technique at the level of individual
Green's functions. Its building blocks are the fully dressed pinch technique
Green's functions obeying Abelian all-order Ward identities instead of the
Slavnov-Taylor identites satisfied by their conventional counterparts. As a
result, and contrary to the standard case, the new series can be truncated
gauge invariantly at any order in the dressed loop expansion. The construction
is streamlined by resorting to the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism which allows
for a concise treatment of all the quantities appearing in the intermediate
steps. The theoretical and phenomenological implications of this novel
non-perturbative framework are discussed in detail.
