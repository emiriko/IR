The jet quenching parameter $\hat{q}$ is analyzed for a quark jet propagating
in an anisotropic plasma. The momentum anisotropy is calculated at high
temperature of the underlying quark-gluon plasma. $\hat{q}$ is explicitly
estimated in leading-logarithmic approximation by the broadening of the
massless quark interacting via gluon exchange. A plasma instability is present.
Strong indications are found that $\hat{q}$ is increasing with increasing
anisotropy. Possible implications for the saturation scale $Q_s$ in $A-A$
collisions are pointed out.
