We determine the hard-loop resummed propagator in an anisotropic QCD plasma
in general covariant gauges and define a potential between heavy quarks from
the Fourier transform of its static limit. We find that the potential exhibits
angular dependence and that binding of very small quarkonium states is stronger
than in an isotropic plasma.
