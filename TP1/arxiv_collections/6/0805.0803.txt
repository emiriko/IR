Stimulated Brillouin scattering with both pump and Stokes beams in resonance
with whispering gallery modes of an ultra high Q CaF_2 resonator is
demonstrated for the first time. The resonator is pumped with 1064 nm light and
has a Brillouin lasing threshold of 3.5 microwatt. Potential applications
include optical generation of microwaves and sensitive gyros.
