An explicit proof is developed to reinforce the accuracy of the quantum
adiabatic theorem in its original form without any inconsistency and/or
violation. Based on this proof, we discuss physical implications that give rise
to the violation of the quantum adiabatic approximation. We show that such a
violation can be obtained if and only if one violates the adiabatic criterion
itself or due to the existence of degeneracy at a later time. Subsequently,
comparison of our proof with respect to other recently developed proofs and
counter-examples are analyzed and discussed.
