We show how quasiprobability distribution functions defined over
$N^{2}$-dimensional discrete phase spaces can be used to treat physical systems
described by a finite space of states which exhibit spin tunneling effects.
This particular approach is then applied to the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model in
order to obtain the time evolution of the discrete Husimi function, and as a
by-product the energy gap for a symmetric combination of ground and first
excited states. Moreover, we also show how an angle-based potential approach
can be efficiently employed to explain qualitatively certain features of the
energy gap in terms of a spin tunneling. Entropy functionals are also discussed
in this context. Such results reinforce not only the formalism per se but also
the possibility of some future potential applications in other branches of
physics.
