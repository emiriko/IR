Suppose that there is a quantum operator that describes the horizon area of a
black hole. Then what would be the form of the ensuing quantum spectrum? In
this regard, it has been conjectured that the characteristic frequencies of the
black hole oscillations can be used to calibrate the spacing between the
spectral levels. The current article begins with a brief review of this
conjecture and some of its subsequent developments. We then suggest a simple
but vital modification to a recent treatment on the Kerr (or rotating black
hole) spectrum. As a consequence of this refinement, we are able to rectify a
prior inconsistency (as was found between two distinct calculations) and to
establish, unambiguously, a universal form for the Kerr and Schwarzschild
spectra.
