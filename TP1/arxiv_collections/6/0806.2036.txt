New simple field equations are proposed (Eqs. (5)), unifying Maxwell's
equations of the Standard Model electrodynamics (after the electroweak symmetry
is spontaneously broken) with the dynamics of cold dark matter. The cold dark
matter is represented here by sterile spin-1/2 Dirac fermions (sterinos) whose
mass is spontaneously generated by the nonzero vacuum expectation value of a
field of sterile scalars (sterons), while their interactions are mediated by
quanta of a sterile antisymmetric tensor field with a large mass. The new field
equations include a specific weak coupling of the Standard Model
electromagnetic field to the sterile fields. It has a spontaneous
quasi-magnetic structure. Such a coupling opens a photonic portal between the
Standard Model world and the sterile world.
