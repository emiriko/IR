We report on a complete free-space field implementation of a modified Ekert91
protocol for quantum key distribution using entangled photon pairs. For each
photon pair we perform a random choice between key generation and a Bell
inequality. The amount of violation is used to determine the possible knowledge
of an eavesdropper to ensure security of the distributed final key.
