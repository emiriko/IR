A computational study of the growth of two-dimensional nematic spherulites in
an isotropic phase was performed using a Landau-de Gennes type quadrupolar
ensor order parameter model for the first-order isotropic/nematic transition of
5CB (pentyl-cyanobiphenyl). An energy balance, taking anisotropy into account,
was derived and incorporated into the time-dependent model. Growth laws were
determined for two different spherulite morphologies of the form tn, with and
without the inclusion of thermal effects. Results show that incorporation of
the thermal energy balance correctly predicts the transition of the growth law
exponent from the volume driven regime (n=1) to the thermally limited regime
(approaching n=0.5), agreeing well with experimental observations. An
interfacial nemato-dynamic model is used to gain insight into the interactions
that result in the progression of different spherulite growth regimes.
