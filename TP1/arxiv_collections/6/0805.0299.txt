In this proceedings, we briefly review the methodology from [arXiv:0801.1665]
for quantitatively constraining theoretical model parameters from experimental
measurements including statistical and systematic uncertainties. We extend this
methodology to additional parton energy-loss calculations for single inclusive
high pT particle suppression, and also extend the comparisons to di-jet
observations. This is only the start of a process to give quantitative
constraints on the quark-gluon plasma, and substantial theoretical
uncertainties need to be reduced/resolved in a parallel path.
