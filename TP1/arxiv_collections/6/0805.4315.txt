The length of coding sequence series in microbial genomes were regarded as a
fluctuating system and characterized by the methods of statistical physics. The
distribution and the correlatin properties of 50 genomes including bacteria and
several archaea were investigated. The distribution was investigated by
rank-size analysis (Zipf's law. We found that coding sequence lengths series do
not obey Zipf's law contrary to natural languages. The distribution was found
to be more closely to an exponential distribution. The correlation appeared to
be similar to natural languages. Segmentation analysis of the series showed to
be short range memory systems.
