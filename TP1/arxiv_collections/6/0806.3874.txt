We provide a real algebraic symbolic-numeric algorithm for computing the real
variety $V_R(I)$ of an ideal $I$, assuming it is finite while $V_C(I)$ may not
be. Our approach uses sets of linear functionals on $R[X]$, vanishing on a
given set of polynomials generating $I$ and their prolongations up to a given
degree, as well as on polynomials of the real radical ideal of $I$, obtained
from the kernel of a suitably defined moment matrix assumed to be positive
semidefinite and of maximum rank. We formulate a condition on the dimensions of
projections of these sets of linear functionals, which serves as stopping
criterion for our algorithm. This algorithm, based on standard numerical linear
algebra routines and semidefinite optimization, combines techniques from
previous work of the authors together with an existing algorithm for the
complex variety. This results in a unified methodology for the real and complex
cases.
