A theoretical calculation is presented to describe the confined motion of
transmembrane molecules in cell membranes. The study is analytic, based on
Master equations for the probability of the molecules moving as random walkers,
and leads to explicit usable solutions including expressions for the molecular
mean square displacement and effective diffusion constants. One outcome is a
detailed understanding of the dependence of the time variation of the mean
square displacement on the initial placement of the molecule within the
confined region. How to use the calculations is illustrated by extracting
(confinement) compartment sizes from experimentally reported published
observations from single particle tracking experiments on the diffusion of
gold-tagged G-protein coupled mu-opioid receptors in the normal rat kidney cell
membrane, and by further comparing the analytical results to observations on
the diffusion of phospholipids, also in normal rat kidney cells.
