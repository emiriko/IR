The propagation of Dyakonov surface waves (DSWs) at the planar interface
between an isotropic material and a linear electro-optic birefringent material
can be dynamically controlled using the Pockels effect. The range of directions
for DSW propagation has been previously found to be rather narrow. By careful
choice of various parameters, this range of directions can be increased by more
than an order of magnitude.
