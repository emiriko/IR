In this paper we describe a check of the implementation of SANC system
generated modules into the framework of the WINHAC Monte Carlo event generator.
At this stage of work we limit ourselves to inclusion of complete one-loop
electroweak corrections to the charged-current Drell--Yan process. We perform
tuned comparisons of the results derived with the aid of two codes: 1) the
standard SANC integrator with YFS-inspired treatment of the ISR QED corrections
and 2) the WINHAC generator, upgraded with the SANC electroweak modules and
downgraded to the O(\alpha) QED corrections. The aim of these comparisons is to
prove the correctness of implementation of the SANC electroweak modules into
the WINHAC generator. This is achieved through the presented tuned comparisons.
