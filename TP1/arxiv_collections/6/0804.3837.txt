The Coulomb gauge model, involving an effective QCD Hamiltonian in the
Coulomb gauge, is applied to scalar hadrons. Mass predictions are presented for
both conventional q-qbar meson and q-qbar-q-qbar tetra-quark states. Mixing
matrix elements between these states were also computed and diagonalized to
provide a reasonable description of the scalar spectrum below 2 GeV.
