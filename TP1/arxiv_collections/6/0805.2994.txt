In this paper we derive the general equilibrium equations of a polymer chain
with a noncircular cross section by the variation of the free energy
functional. From the equilibrium equation of the elastic ribbon we derive
analytically the equilibrium conformations both of the helical ribbons and the
twisted ribbons. We find that the pitch angle of the helical ribbons depends on
the ratio of the torsional rigidity to the bending one. For the twisted
ribbons, the rotation rate depends on the spontaneous torsion, which is
determined by the elastic properties of the polymers. Our results for helical
and twisted ribbons strongly indicate that the formation of these structures is
determined by their elastic properties.
