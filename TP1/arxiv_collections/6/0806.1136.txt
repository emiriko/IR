Electrical conductance through various nanocontacts between gold electrodes
is studied by using the density functional theory, scalar-relativistic
pseudopotentials, generalized gradient approximation for the
exchange-correlation energy and the recursion-transfer-matrix method along with
channel decomposition. The nanocontact is modeled with pyramidal fcc(100) tips
and 1 to 5 gold atoms between the tips. Upon elongation of the contact by
adding gold atoms between the tips, the conductance at Fermi energy E_F evolves
from G ~ 3 G_0 to G ~ 1 G_0 (G_0 = 2e/h^2). Formation of a true one-atom point
contact, with G ~ 1 G_0 and only one open channel, requires at least one atom
with coordination number 2 in the wire. Tips that share a common vertex atom or
tips with touching vertex atoms have three partially open conductance channels
at E_F, and the symmetries of the channels are governed by the wave functions
of the tips. The long 5-atom contact develops conductance oscillations and
conductance gaps in the studied energy range -3 < E-E_F < 5 eV, which reflects
oscillations in the local density of electron states in the 5-atom linear "gold
molecule" between the electrodes, and a weak coupling of this "molecule" to the
tips.
