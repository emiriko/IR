A spin-isospin dependent Three-Dimensional formalism based on the momentum
vectors for the four-nucleon bound state is presented. The four-nucleon
Yakubovsky equations with two- and three-nucleon interactions are formulated as
a function of the vector Jacobi momenta. Our formalism, according to the number
of spin-isospin states that one takes into account, leads to only a strictly
finite number of the coupled three-dimensional integral equations to be solved.
The evaluation of the transition and permutation operators as well as the
coordinate transformations due to considering the continuous angle variables
instead of the discrete angular momentum quantum numbers are less complicated
in comparison with partial wave representation. With respect to partial wave
the present formalism with the smaller number of equations leads to higher
dimensionality of the integral equations. We have concluded that
Three-Dimensional formalism is less cumbersome for considering the
three-nucleon forces.
