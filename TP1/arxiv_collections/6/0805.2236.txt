We describe how non-minimal coupling term between the Higgs boson and gravity
can lead to the chaotic inflation in the Standard Model without introduction of
any additional degrees of freedom. Produced cosmological perturbations are
predicted to be in accordance with observations. The tensor modes of
perturbations are practically vanishing in the model.
