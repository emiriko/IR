In this paper, we present some high level information fusion approaches for
numeric and symbolic data. We study the interest of such method particularly
for classifier fusion. A comparative study is made in a context of sea bed
characterization from sonar images. The classi- fication of kind of sediment is
a difficult problem because of the data complexity. We compare high level
information fusion and give the obtained performance.
