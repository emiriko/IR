We provide explicit schemes for quantum information splitting (QIS) of real
or equatorial two qubit states among two parties, through the five particle
cluster and Brown states respectively. The schemes introduced are neither fully
deterministic nor completely probabilistic and are carried out in the case
where, the information that is to be shared is partially or fully known to the
sender. We show that, QIS can be accomplished with just two classical bits, as
against four classical bits, when the information is unknown to the sender.
