Resistance fluctuation phenomenon in antidot lattices in the quantum Hall
regime are studied. Magnetoresistance of finite antidot array systems in the
quantum Hall plateau transition regime exhibits two types of oscillatory
effect. One is the aperiodic resistance fluctuations (RFs) and the other is the
Aharonov-Bohm (AB)-type oscillations. Their dependences on the magnetic field
and the gate voltage are quite distinct. While the aperiodic RFs are attributed
to the complex evolution of the conducting network of compressible channels,
the AB-type oscillations are interpreted in terms of edge states formed around
individual antidots. The self-consistent screening effect is important for the
both phenomenon, whereas, the single electron charging effect plays a minor
role in the present case.
