We have studied the reflectance of the recently discovered superconductor
LaO_0.9F0.FeAs in a wide energy range from the far infrared to the visible
regime. We report on the observation of infrared active phonons, the plasma
edge (PE) and possible interband transitions. On the basis of this data and the
reported in-plane penetration depth lambda_L(0) about 254 nm [H. Luetkens et
al., Phys. Rev. Lett. v. 101, 0970009 (2008)] a disorder sensitive relatively
small value of the total electron electron-boson coupling constant
lambda_tot=lambda_e-ph+lambda_e-sp ~ 0.6 +- 0.35 can be estimated adopting an
effective single-band picture.
