(Abstract is abridged for arXiv.) Identified mid-rapidity particle spectra
and freeze-out properties are presented for 200 GeV pp, 200 GeV dAu and 62.4
GeV Au-Au collisions, measured in the STAR-TPC. Evolution of the identified
particle spectra ($\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, p and $\overline{p}$) with charged
particle multiplicity and event centrality is investigated in detail. Thermal
model fits to the measured particle ratios yield a chemical freeze-out
temperature $\sim$ 155 MeV in 200 GeV pp, 200 GeV dAu and 62.4 GeV Au-Au
collisions. The extracted chemical freeze-out temperature is close to the
critical phase transition temperature predicted by lattice QCD calculations.
The kinetic freeze-out temperature extracted from hydrodynamically motivated
blast-wave models shows a continuous drop from pp, dAu and peripheral to
central Au-Au collisions, while the transverse flow velocity increases from
$\sim$ 0.2 in pp to $\sim$ 0.6 in central 200 GeV Au-Au collisions. The kinetic
freeze-out parameters in 62.4 GeV and 200 GeV Au-Au collisions seem to be
governed only by event multiplicity/centrality. In order to study the effect of
resonance decays on the kinetic freeze-out parameters, the data are fitted with
the blast-wave model including resonances. It is found that the thus extracted
parameters are consistent with those obtained without including resonances, the
resonance decays do not modify the spectral shapes significantly in the
measured $p_{T}$ region in STAR.
