We determine the Lorentz transformations and the kinematic content and
dynamical framework of special relativity as purely an extension of Galileo's
thoughts. No reference to light is ever required: The theories of relativity
are logically independent of any properties of light. The thoughts of Galileo
are fully realized in a system of Lorentz transformations with a parameter
1/c^2, some undetermined, universal constant of nature; and are realizable in
no other. Isotropy of space plays a deep and pivotal role in all of this, since
here three-dimensional space appears at first blush, and persists until the
conclusion: Relativity can never correctly be fully developed in just one
spatial dimension.
