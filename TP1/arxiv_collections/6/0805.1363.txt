Quantum-critical behavior of the itinerant electron antiferromagnet
(V0.9Ti0.1)2O3 has been studied by single-crystal neutron scattering. By
directly observing antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations in the paramagnetic
phase, we have shown that the characteristic energy depends on temperature as
c_1 + c_2 T^{3/2}, where c_1 and c_2 are constants. This T^{3/2} dependence
demonstrates that the present strongly correlated d-electron antiferromagnet
clearly shows the criticality of the spin-density-wave quantum phase transition
in three space dimensions.
