We study the Langevin dynamics for the family of spherical spin glass models
of statistical physics, in the presence of a magnetic field. We prove that in
the limit of system size N approaching infinity, the empirical state
correlation, the response function, the overlap and the magnetization for these
N-dimensional coupled diffusions converge to the non-random unique strong
solution of four explicit non-linear integro-differential equations, that
generalize the system proposed by Cugliandolo and Kurchan in the presence of a
magnetic field. We then analyze the system and provide a rigorous derivation of
the FDT regime in a large area of the temperature-magnetization plane.
