Micro lens array is crucial in various kinds of optical and electronic
applications. A micro lens array with high numerical aperture (NA) and low
aberration is in particular needed. This research is aimed to design and
fabricate such a micro lens array with simple structure while keeps the same NA
of a same-diameter hemisphere lens. A bi-convex semispherical micro lens array,
with corresponding NA 0.379, by PDMS is first designed and analyzed.
Experiments are further conducted to fabricate the designed micro lens array by
the thermal reflow process. The formed profile is then sputtered with copper to
serve as the mold. The front and the rear micro lens array are fabricated by
plating PDMS to the mold and then assembled to form the designed micro lens
array.
