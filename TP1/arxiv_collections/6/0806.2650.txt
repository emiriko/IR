The formation of dust ion-acoustic shocks (DIASs) in a four-component quantum
plasma whose constituents are electrons, both positive and negative ions and
immobile charged dust grains, is studied. The effects of both the dissipation
due to kinematic viscosity and the dispersion caused by the charge separation
as well as the quantum tunneling due to the Bohm potential are taken into
account. The propagation of small but finite amplitude dust ion-acoustic waves
(DIAWs) is governed by the Korteweg-de Vries-Burger (KdVB) equation which
exhibits both oscillatory and monotonic shocks depending not only on the
viscosity parameters, but also on the quantum parameter H (the ratio of the
electron plasmon to the electron Fermi energy) and the positive to negative ion
density ratio. Large amplitude stationary shocks are recovered for a Mach
number exceeding its critical value. Unlike the small amplitude shocks, quite a
smaller value of the viscosity parameter, H and the density ratio may lead to
the large amplitude monotonic shock strucutres. The results could be of
importance in astrophysical and laser produced plasmas.
