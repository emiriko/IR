The thermodynamics of massless ideal gas of overlap quarks has been
investigated numerically for both zero and nonzero baryon chemical potential
$\mu$. While the parameter M has been shown to be irrelevant in the continuum
limit, it is shown numerically that the continuum limit can be reached with
relatively coarser lattices for certain range of M. Numerical limitation of the
existing method of introduction of chemical potential in the overlap formalism
is discussed. We have also studied the energy density of free domain wall
fermions in the absence of $\mu$ and estimated the extent of lattice in the
fifth dimension $L_5$ for which the overlap results are recovered.
Interestingly, this value of $L_5$ is also minimum for the same range of M
found in the overlap case.
