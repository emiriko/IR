We theoretically explore the generation of few-body analogs of fractional
quantum Hall states. We consider an array of identical few-atom clusters
(n=2,3,4), each cluster trapped at the node of an optical lattice. By
temporally varying the amplitude and phase of the trapping lasers, one can
introduce a rotating deformation at each site. We analyze protocols for
coherently transferring ground state clusters into highly correlated states,
producing theoretical fidelities in excess of 99%.
