The statistics of wavefunctions in the one-dimensional (1d) Anderson model of
localization is considered. It is shown that at any energy that corresponds to
a rational filling factor f=p/q there is a statistical anomaly which is seen in
expansion of the generating function (GF) to the order (q-2) in the disorder
parameter. We study in detail the principle anomaly at $f=1/2$ that appears in
the leading order. The transfer-matrix equation of the Fokker-Planck type with
a two-dimensional internal space is derived for GF. It is shown that the
zero-mode variant of this equation is integrable and a solution for the
generating function is found in the thermodynamic limit.
