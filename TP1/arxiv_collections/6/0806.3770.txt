Using a combined local density functional theory (LDA-DFT) and quantum Monte
Carlo (QMC) dynamic cluster approximation approach, the parameter dependence of
the superconducting transition temperature Tc of several single-layer
hole-doped cuprate superconductors with experimentally very different Tcmax is
investigated. The parameters of two different three-band Hubbard models are
obtained using the LDA and the downfolding Nth-order muffin-tin orbital
technique with N=0 and 1 respectively. QMC calculations on 4-site clusters show
that the d-wave transition temperature Tc depends sensitively on the
parameters. While the N=1 MTO basis set which reproduces all three $pd\sigma$
bands leads to a d-wave transition, the N=0 set which merely reproduces the LDA
Fermi surface and velocities does not.
