In this paper the interaction of high energy neutrinos with weak
gravitational fields is briefly explored. The form of the graviton-neutrino
vertex is motivated from Lorentz and gauge invariance and the non-relativistic
interpretations of the neutrino gravitational form factors are obtained. We
comment on the renormalization conditions, the preservation of the weak
equivalence principle and the definition of the neutrino mass radius. We
associate the neutrino gravitational form factors with specific angular
momentum states. Based on Feynman diagrams, spin-statistics, CP invariance and
symmetries of the angular momentum states in the neutrino-graviton vertex, we
deduce differences between the Majorana and Dirac cases. It is then proved that
in spite of the theoretical differences between the two cases, as far as
experiments are considered, they would be virtually indistinguishable for any
space-time geometry satisfying the weak field condition. We then calculate the
transition gravitational form factors for the neutrino by evaluating the
relevant Feynman diagrams at 1-loop and estimate a neutrino transition mass
radius. The form factor is seen to depend on the momentum transfer very weakly.
It is also seen that the neutrino transition mass radius is smaller than the
typical neutrino charge radius by a couple of orders of magnitude.
