Exclusive $\pi^o$ electroproduction from nucleons is suggested for extracting
the tensor charge and other quantities related to transversity from
experimental data. This process isolates C-parity odd and chiral odd
combinations of t-channel exchange quantum numbers. In a hadronic picture it
connects the meson production amplitudes to C-odd Regge exchanges with final
state interactions. In a description based on partonic degrees of freedom, the
helicity structure for this C-odd process relates to the quark helicity flip,
or chiral odd generalized parton distributions. This differs markedly from
deeply virtual Compton scattering, and both vector meson and charged $\pi$
electroproduction, where the axial charge can enter the amplitudes. Contrarily
the tensor charge enters the $\pi^o$ process. The connection through the
helicity description of the process to both the partonic and hadronic
perspectives is studied and exploited in model calculations to indicate how the
tensor charge and other transversity parameters can be related to cross section
and spin asymmetry measurements over a broad range of kinematics.
