The main aim of this paper is to investigate the structure of primitively
generated connected braided bialgebras $A$ with respect to the braided vector
space $P$ consisting of their primitive elements. When the Nichols algebra of
$P$ is obtained dividing out the tensor algebra $T(P) $ by the two-sided ideal
generated by its primitive elements of degree at least two, we show that $A$
can be recovered as a sort of universal enveloping algebra of $P$. One of the
main applications of our construction is the description, in terms of universal
enveloping algebras, of connected braided bialgebras whose associated graded
coalgebra is a quadratic algebra.
