Of the two techniques introduced by Bloch, Green-Griffiths and developed by
Siu, Demailly to establish Kobayashi hyperbolicity of generic high degree
complex algebraic hypersurfaces X in P^(n+1), the second one, initiated by
Clemens, Ein, Voisin and developed by Siu, Paun, Rousseau consists in
constructing meromorphic frames on the space of the so-called vertical k-jets
J_vert^k (X_univ) of the universal hypersurface X_univ parametrizing all X in
P^(n+1) of degree d. In 2004, Siu announced that there exists a constant c_n
such that the twisting of the tangent bundle to J_vert^n (X_univ) by O (c_n) is
globally generated (frame property). The present article provides c_n = (n^2 +
5n) / 2, recovering c_2 = 7 (Paun), c_3 = 12 (Rousseau). Applications to
effective degree estimates for algebraic degeneracy or hyperbolicity are
expected, especially in dimension n = 4, granted that the Demailly-Semple
algebra of jet polynomials invariant under reparametrization and under a
certain unipotent action is, for n = k = 4, generated by 16 fundamental
bi-invariants enjoying 41 groebnerized syzygies.
