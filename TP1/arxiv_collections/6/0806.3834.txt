In this paper, we introduce the notion of a normal form of one qubit quantum
circuits over the basis $\{H, P, T\}$, where $H$, $P$ and $T$ denote the
Hadamard, Phase and $\pi/8$ gates, respectively. This basis is known as the
{\it standard set} and its universality has been shown by Boykin et al. [FOCS
'99]. Our normal form has several nice properties: (i) Every circuit over this
basis can easily be transformed into a normal form, and (ii) Every two normal
form circuits compute same unitary matrix if and only if both circuits are
identical. We also show that the number of unitary operations that can be
represented by a circuit over this basis that contains at most $n$ $T$-gates is
exactly $192 \cdot (3 \cdot 2^n - 2)$.
