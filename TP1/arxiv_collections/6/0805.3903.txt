We present results of transmission measurements on CdTe quantum wells with
thin semimagnetic CdMnTe probe layers embedded in various positions along the
growth axis. The presence of the probes allow us to map the probability density
functions by two independent methods: analyzing the exciton energy position and
the exciton Zeeman splitting. We apply both approaches to map the first three
quantum well eigenstates and we find that both of them yield equally accurate
results.
