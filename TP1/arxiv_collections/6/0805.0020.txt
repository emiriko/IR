We study the problem of breakup of an air bubble in a Hele-Shaw cell. In
particular, we propose some sufficient conditions of breakup of the bubble, and
ways to find the contraction points of its parts. We also study regulated
contraction of a pair of bubbles (in which the rates of air extraction from the
bubbles is controlled), and study various asymptotic questions (such as the
asymptotics of contraction of a bubble to a degenerate critical point, and
asymptotics of contraction of a small bubble in presence of a big bubble).
