We have investigated direct and pulsed current induced electroresistance in
two manganites with different electronic and magnetic ground states:
charge-orbital ordered 50 % Ca doped NdMnO3 and 50 % Mn doped LaNiO3. It has
been shown that negative differential resistance observed at high current
density in these compounds is related to Joule heating. However, bi-level and
multi-level resistivity switching induced by variations in pulse width and
pulse period at low current density can not be attributable to Joule heating
alone. We discuss possible origins.
