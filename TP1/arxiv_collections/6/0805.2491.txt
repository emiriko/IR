We present a search for the production of neutral Higgs bosons phi decaying
into tau+tau- final states in ppbar collisions at a center-of-mass energy of
1.96 TeV. The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately
1 fb-1, were collected by the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider.
Limits on the production cross section times branching ratio are set. The
results are interpreted in the minimal supersymmetric standard model yielding
limits that are the most stringent to date at hadron colliders.
