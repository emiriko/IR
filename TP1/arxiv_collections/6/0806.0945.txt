The European Space Agency (ESA) has supported a range of studies in the field
of quantum physics and quantum information science in space for several years,
and consequently we have submitted the mission proposal Space-QUEST (Quantum
Entanglement for Space Experiments) to the European Life and Physical Sciences
in Space Program. We propose to perform space-to-ground quantum communication
tests from the International Space Station (ISS). We present the proposed
experiments in space as well as the design of a space based quantum
communication payload.
