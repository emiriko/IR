We are concerned with a viscous Burgers equation forced by a perturbation of
white noise type. We study the corresponding transition semigroup in a space of
continuous functions weighted by a proper potential, and we show that the
infinitesimal generator is the closure (with respect to a suitable topology) of
the Kolmogorov operator associated to the stochastic equation. In the last part
of the paper we use this result to solve the corresponding Fokker-Planck
equation.
