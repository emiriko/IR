In this paper, we consider robust control using randomized algorithms. We
extend the existing order statistics distribution theory to the general case in
which the distribution of population is not assumed to be continuous and the
order statistics is associated with certain constraints. In particular, we
derive an inequality on distribution for related order statistics. Moreover, we
also propose two different approaches in searching reliable solutions to the
robust analysis and optimal synthesis problems under constraints. Furthermore,
minimum computational effort is investigated and bounds for sample size are
derived.
