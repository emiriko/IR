We show that if a compact Kahler manifold X admits a cohomologically
hyperbolic surjective endomorphism then its Kodaira dimension is non-positive.
This gives an affirmative answer to a conjecture of Guedj in the holomorphic
case. The main part of the paper is to determine the geometric structure and
the fundamental groups (up to finite index) for those X of dimension 3.
