The discovery of $B_d - \bar B_d$ oscillations twenty years ago by the ARGUS
collaboration marked a watershed event. It persuaded a significant part of the
HEP community that the large time dependent \cp asymmetries predicted for some
$B_d$ decays might be within the reach of specially designed experiments. This
opened the successful era of the $B$ factories, which has a great future still
ahead. After sketching the status of heavy flavour physics I describe why we
need to continue a comprehensive heavy flavour program not only for its
intrinsic reasons -- it is even mandated as an integral part of the LHC
program. Notwithstanding the great success anticipated for the LHCb experiment
I explain why a Super-Flavour Factory is an essential complement to the LHC
program.
