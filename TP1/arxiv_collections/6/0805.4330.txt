A symmetry analysis of the valence shell in the boron buckyball B80, shows a
perfect match with the symmetry of the valence shell in C60 .The cap atoms
participate in the bonding by 30 orbitals which transform as the sigma bonds
along the 6-6 edges. Far reaching consequences for chemical and physical
properties of B80, which until now only exists in silico, are expected.
