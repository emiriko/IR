Quark coalescence models have been applied successfully to reproduce measured
hadron production data in relativistic heavy ion collisions at SPS and RHIC
energies, which finding strongly supports the formation of deconfined quark
matter in these collisions. The investigation of meson and baryon production is
an ideal tool to understand dynamical details of hadronization, especially
strange hadron numbers and ratios. We display latest results on the production
of strange particles in quark coalescence processes in heavy ion collisions at
different collider energies.
