We present parallel and sequential dense QR factorization algorithms that are
both optimal (up to polylogarithmic factors) in the amount of communication
they perform, and just as stable as Householder QR. Our first algorithm, Tall
Skinny QR (TSQR), factors m-by-n matrices in a one-dimensional (1-D) block
cyclic row layout, and is optimized for m >> n. Our second algorithm, CAQR
(Communication-Avoiding QR), factors general rectangular matrices distributed
in a two-dimensional block cyclic layout. It invokes TSQR for each block column
factorization.
