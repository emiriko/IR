Single crystals of SmFeAsO1-xFy of a size up to 120 micrometers have been
grown from NaCl/KCl flux at a pressure of 30 kbar and temperature of 1350-1450
C using the cubic anvil high-pressure technique. The superconducting transition
temperature of the obtained single crystals varies between 45 and 53 K.Obtained
crystals are characterized by a full diamagnetic response in low magnetic
fields and by a high critical current density in high magnetic fields.
Structural refinement has been performed on single crystal. Differential
thermal analysis investigations at 1 bar Ar pressure show decomposition of
SmFeAsO1-xFy at 1302 C.
