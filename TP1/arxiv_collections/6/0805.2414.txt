The area and perimeter dependence of the Josephson-like interlayer tunneling
signature of the coherent $\nu_T=1$ quantum Hall phase in bilayer
two-dimensional electron systems is examined. Electrostatic top gates of
various sizes and shapes are used to locally define distinct $\nu_T=1$ regions
in the same sample. Near the phase boundary with the incoherent $\nu_T=1$ state
at large layer separation, our results demonstrate that the tunneling
conductance in the coherent phase is closely proportional to the total area of
the tunneling region. This implies that tunneling at $\nu_T=1$ is a bulk
phenomenon in this regime.
