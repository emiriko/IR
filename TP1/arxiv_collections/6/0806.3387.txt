We study the dissipative dynamics of a biased two-level system (TLS) coupled
to a harmonic oscillator (HO), the latter interacting with an Ohmic
environment. Using Van-Vleck perturbation theory and going to second order in
the coupling between TLS and HO, we show how the Hamiltonian of the TLS-HO
system can be diagonalized analytically. Our model represents an improvement to
the usually used Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian as an initial rotating wave
approximation is avoided. By assuming a weak coupling to the thermal bath,
analytical expressions for the time evolution of the populations of the TLS are
found: the population is characterized by a multiplicity of damped oscillations
together with a complex relaxation dynamics towards thermal equilibrium. The
long time evolution is characterized by a single relaxation rate, which is
largest at resonance and whose expression can be given in closed analytic form.
