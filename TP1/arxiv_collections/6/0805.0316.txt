Inelastic neutron scattering provides a probe for studying the spin and
momentum structure of the superconducting gap. Here, using a two-orbital model
for the Fe-pnicitide superconductors and an RPA-BCS approximation for the
dynamic spin susceptibility, we explore the scattering response for various
gaps that have been proposed.
