The scaling of the longitudinal velocity structure functions, $S_q(r) = < |
\delta u (r) |^q > \sim r^{\zeta_q}$, is analyzed up to order $q=8$ in a
decaying rotating turbulence experiment from a large Particle Image Velocimetry
(PIV) dataset. The exponent of the second-order structure function, $\zeta_2$,
increases throughout the self-similar decay regime, up to the Ekman time scale.
The normalized higher-order exponents, $\zeta_q / \zeta_2$, are close to those
of the intermittent non-rotating case at small times, but show a marked
departure at larger times, on a time scale $\Omega^{-1}$ ($\Omega$ is the
rotation rate), although a strictly non-intermittent linear law $\zeta_q /
\zeta_2 = q/2$ is not reached.
