For a much-studied model of random copolymer at a selective interface we
prove that the slope of the critical curve in the weak-disorder limit is
strictly smaller than 1, which is the value given by the annealed inequality.
The proof is based on a coarse-graining procedure, combined with upper bounds
on the fractional moments of the partition function.
