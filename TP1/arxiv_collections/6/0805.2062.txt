We study the tunneling of chiral electrons in graphene through a region where
the electronic spectrum changes from the usual linear dispersion to a
hyperbolic dispersion, due to the presence of a gap. It is shown that contrary
to the tunneling through a potential barrier, the transmission of electrons is,
in this case, smaller than one for normal incidence. This mechanism may be
useful for designing electronic devices made of graphene.
