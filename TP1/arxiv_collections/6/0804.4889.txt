Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for a substochastic semigroup
on $L^1$ obtained through the Kato--Voigt perturbation theorem to be either
stochastic or strongly stable. We show how such semigroups are related to
piecewise deterministic Markov process, provide a probabilistic interpretation
of our results, and apply them to fragmentation equations.
