We have performed x-ray scattering measurements on single crystals of the
doped spin-Peierls compound Ti(1-x)Sc(x)OCl (x = 0, 0.01, 0.03). These
measurements reveal that the presence of non-magnetic dopants has a profound
effect on the unconventional spin-Peierls behavior of this system, even at
concentrations as low as 1%. Sc-doping suppresses commensurate fluctuations in
the pseudogap and incommensurate spin-Peierls phases of TiOCl, and prevents the
formation of a long-range ordered spin-Peierls state. Broad incommensurate
scattering develops in the doped compounds near Tc2 ~ 93 K, and persists down
to base temperature (~ 7 K) with no evidence of a lock-in transition. The width
of the incommensurate dimerization peaks indicates short correlation lengths on
the order of ~ 12 angstroms below Tc2. The intensity of the incommensurate
scattering is significantly reduced at higher Sc concentrations, indicating
that the size of the associated lattice displacement decreases rapidly as a
function of doping.
