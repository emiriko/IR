A superspace version of the Schr\"odinger equation with a delta potential is
studied using Fourier analysis. An explicit expression for the energy of the
single bound state is found as a function of the super-dimension M in case M is
smaller than or equal to 1. In the case when there is one commuting and 2n
anti-commuting variables also the wave function is given explicitly.
