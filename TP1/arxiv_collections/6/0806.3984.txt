We conjecture a new entropic uncertainty principle governing the entropy of
complementary observations made on a system given side information in the form
of quantum states, generalizing the entropic uncertainty relation of Maassen
and Uffink [Phys. Rev. Lett. 60, 1103 (1988)]. We prove a special case for
certain conjugate observables by adapting a similar result found by Christandl
and Winter pertaining to quantum channels [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 51, 3159
(2005)], and discuss possible applications of this result to the decoupling of
quantum systems and for security analysis in quantum cryptography.
