The primary objective of the Beyond Einstein Advanced Coherent Optical
Network (BEACON) mission is a search for new physics beyond general relativity
by measuring the curvature of relativistic space-time around Earth. This
curvature is characterized by the Eddington parameter \gamma -- the most
fundamental relativistic gravity parameter and a direct measure for the
presence of new physical interactions. BEACON will achieve an accuracy of 1 x
10^{-9} in measuring the parameter \gamma, thereby going a factor of 30,000
beyond the present best result involving the Cassini spacecraft. Secondary
mission objectives include: (i) a direct measurement of the "frame-dragging"
and geodetic precessions in the Earth's rotational gravitomagnetic field, to
0.05% and 0.03% accuracy correspondingly, (ii) first measurement of gravity's
non-linear effects on light and corresponding 2nd order spatial metric's
effects to 0.01% accuracy. BEACON will lead to robust advances in tests of
fundamental physics -- this mission could discover a violation or extension of
general relativity and/or reveal the presence of an additional long range
interaction in physics. BEACON will provide crucial information to separate
modern scalar-tensor theories of gravity from general relativity, probe
possible ways for gravity quantization, and test modern theories of
cosmological evolution.
