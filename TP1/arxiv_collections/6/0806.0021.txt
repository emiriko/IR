Using isoperimetry and symmetrization we provide a unified framework to study
the classical and logarithmic Sobolev inequalities. In particular, we obtain
new Gaussian symmetrization inequalities and connect them with logarithmic
Sobolev inequalities. Our methods are very general and can be easily adapted to
more general contexts.
