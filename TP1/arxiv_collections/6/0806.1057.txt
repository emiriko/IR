The differential cross section of the chargino-neutralino production, q qbar
--> chi+- chi0, followed by their decays into scalar tau leptons, chi+- chi0
--> (stau+- nu)(stau-+ tau+-) --> (stau+- nu)(stau-+ l+- nu nubar), is
calculated including the effect of spin correlations. In the case where stau is
long-lived, this final state can be fully reconstructed in a hadron-collider
experiment up to a discrete two-fold ambiguity. Distributions of various
kinematic variables can thus be observable and tell us about masses and spins
of superparticles and also parity/CP violation in interactions by comparing
with the cross-section formula. Observing non-trivial distributions derived in
this paper will be a good test of supersymmetry.
