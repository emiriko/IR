In the first part of this paper, a review is given on the mechanism for the
disappearance of an intrinsic stacking fault in a hard-sphere (HS) crystal
under gravity, which we recently discovered by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations [A.
Mori et al., J. Chem. Phys., 124 (2006), 17450; Mol. Phys. 105 (2007), 1377].
We have observed, in the case of fcc (001) stacking, that the intrinsic
stacking fault running along an oblique direction shrunk through the gliding of
a Shockley partial dislocation at the lower end of the stacking fault. In order
to address the shortcomings and approximations of previous simulations, such as
the use of periodic boundary condition (PBC) and the fact that the fcc (001)
stacking had been realized by the stress from the small PBC box, we present an
elastic strain energy calculation for an infinite system and a MC simulation
result for HSs in a pyramidal pit under gravity. In particular, the geometry of
the latter has already been tested experimentally [S. Matsuo et al., Appl.
Phys. Lett., 82 (2003), 4283]. The advantage of using a pyramidal pit as a
template as well as the feasibility of the mechanism we describe is
demonstrated.
