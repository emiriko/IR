The Tribolium genome contains 21 nuclear receptors, representing all of the
six known subfamilies. When compared to other species, this first complete set
for a Coleoptera reveals a strong conservation of the number and identity of
nuclear receptors in holometabolous insects. Two novelties are observed: the
atypical NR0 gene knirps is present only in brachyceran flies, while the NR2E6
gene is found only in Tribolium and in Apis. Using a quantitative analysis of
the evolutionary rate, we discovered that nuclear receptors could be divided
into two groups. In one group of 13 proteins, the rates follow the trend of the
Mecopterida genome-wide acceleration. In a second group of five nuclear
receptors, all acting together at the top of the ecdysone cascade, we observed
an overacceleration of the evolutionary rate during the early divergence of
Mecopterida. We thus extended our analysis to the twelve classic ecdysone
transcriptional regulators and found that six of them (ECR, USP, HR3, E75, HR4
and Kr-h1) underwent an overacceleration at the base of the Mecopterida
lineage. By contrast, E74, E93, BR, HR39, FTZ-F1 and E78 do not show this
divergence. We suggest that coevolution occurred within a network of regulators
that control the ecdysone cascade. The advent of Tribolium as a powerful model
should allow a better understanding of this evolution.
