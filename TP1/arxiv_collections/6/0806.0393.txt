We argue that the S=1/2 kagome antiferromagnet undergoes a quantum phase
transition when the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya coupling is increased. For $D<D_c$
the system is in a moment-free phase and for $D>D_c$ the system develops
antiferromagnetic long-range order. The quantum critical point is found to be
$D_c \simeq 0.1J$ using exact diagonalizations and finite-size scaling. This
suggests that the kagome compound ZnCu$_3(OH)$_6$Cl$_3$ may be in a quantum
critical region controlled by this fixed point.
