In the present Comment we show that, contrary to the recent findings of
Reisner et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 058302 (2007)], the excluded volume effect
does not play an important role in determining DNA behavior in nanochannels at
low ionic strength. We argue that the DNA extension data are described very
well without the notion of an effective polymer width using the entropic
depletion theory due to Odijk.
