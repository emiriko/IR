We introduce an analog of the Maxwell operator on a q-Minkowski space algebra
(treated as a particular case of the so-called Reflection Equation Algebra) and
on certain of its quotients. We treat the space of "quantum differential forms"
as a projective module in the spirit of the Serre-Swan approach. Also, we use
"braided tangent vector fields" which are q-analogs of Poisson vector fields
associated to the Lie bracket sl(2).
