In this article, we construct the canonical semipositive current or the
canonical measure ($=$ the potential of the canonical semipositive current) on
a smooth projective variety of nonnegative Kodaira dimension in terms of a
dynamical system of Bergman kernels. This current is considered to be a
generalization of a K\"{a}hler-Einstein metric and coincides the one
constructed independently by J. Song and G. Tian. The major difference between
their work and the present article is that they found the canonical measure in
terms of K\"{a}her-Ricci flows, while I found the canonical measure in terms of
the dynamical system of Bergman kernels. Hence the present approach can be
viewed as the discrete version of the K\"{a}hler-Ricci flow.
