Due to growing interest in quantum measurement, control and feedback, we
reproduce a manuscript from 1992, presenting a simple physical and mathematical
derivation of stochastic differential equations for wave functions of probed
quantum systems. V. P. Belavkins seminal quantum filtering theory with similar
equations, developed in the 1980es, was not known to the authors at the time of
writing of the present manuscript.
