Evolutionary dynamics can be studied in well-mixed or structured populations.
Population structure typically arises from the heterogeneous distribution of
individuals in physical space or on social networks. Here we introduce a new
type of space to evolutionary game dynamics: phenotype space. The population is
well-mixed in the sense that everyone is equally likely to interact with
everyone else, but the behavioral strategies depend on distance in phenotype
space. Individuals might behave differently towards those who look similar or
dissimilar. Individuals mutate to nearby phenotypes. We study the `phenotypic
space walk' of populations. We present analytic calculations that bring
together ideas from coalescence theory and evolutionary game dynamics. As a
particular example, we investigate the evolution of cooperation in phenotype
space. We obtain a precise condition for natural selection to favor cooperators
over defectors: for a one-dimensional phenotype space and large population size
the critical benefit-to-cost ratio is given by b/c=1+2/sqrt{3}. We derive the
fundamental condition for any evolutionary game and explore higher dimensional
phenotype spaces.
