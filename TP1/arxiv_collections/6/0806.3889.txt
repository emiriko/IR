The positive parity scalar D$_{s0}^*$(2317) and axial-vector D$_{s1}^*$(2460)
charmed strange mesons are generated by coupled-channel dynamics through the
s-wave scattering of Goldstone bosons off the pseudoscalar and vector
D(D$_s$)-meson ground states. The attraction leading to the specific masses of
these states reflects the chiral symmetry breaking scale which characterizes
the Weinberg-Tomozawa interaction in the chiral Lagrangian. Chiral corrections
to order Q$_\chi^2$ are calculated and found to be small. The D$_{s0}^*$(2317)
and D$_{s1}^*$(2460) mesons decay either strongly into the isospin-violating
$\pi^0$D$_s$ and $\pi^0$D$_s^*$ channels or electromagnetically. We show that
the $\pi^0$-$\eta$ and (K$^0$D$^+$-K$^+$D$^0$) mixings act constructively to
generate strong widths of the order of 140 keV. The one-loop contribution to
the radiative decay amplitudes of scalar and axial-vector states is calculated
using the electromagnetic Lagrangian to chiral order Q$_\chi^2$. We show the
importance of taking into account processes involving light vector mesons
explicitly in the dynamics of electromagnetic decays to obtain a satisfactory
description of the available data.
