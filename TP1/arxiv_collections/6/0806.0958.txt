In a preceding paper, Mukhopadhyay and I studied the diffusive motion of a
tagged molecule in a heterogeneous glass-forming liquid at temperatures just
above a glass transition. Among other features of this system, we postulated a
relation between heterogeneity and stretched-exponential decay of correlations,
and we also confirmed that systems of this kind generally exhibit non-Gaussian
diffusion on intermediate length and time scales. Here I extend this analysis
to higher temperatures approaching the point where the heterogeneities
disappear and thermal activation barriers become small. I start by modifying
the continuous-time random-walk theory proposed earlier, and supplement this
analysis with an extension of the excitation-chain theory of glass dynamics. I
also use a key result from the shear-transformation-zone theory of viscous
deformation of amorphous materials. Elements of each of these theories are then
used to interpret experimental data for ortho-terphenyl, specifially, the
diffusion and viscosity coefficients and neutron scattering measurements of the
self intermediate scattering function. Reconciling the theory with these data
sets provides insights about the crossover between super-Arrhenius and
Arrhenius dynamics, length scales of spatial heterogeneities, violation of the
Stokes-Einstein relation in glass-forming liquids, and the origin of stretched
exponential decay of correlations.
