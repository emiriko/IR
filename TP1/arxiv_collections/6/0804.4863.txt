We present the first results on scalar glueballs in cold, dense matter using
lattice simulations of two color QCD. The simulations are carried out on a $6^3
\times 12$ lattice and use a standard hybrid molecular dynamics algorithm for
staggered fermions for two values of quark mass. The glueball correlators are
evaluated via a multi-step smearing procedure. The amplitude of the glueball
correlator peaks in correspondence with the zero temperature chiral transition,
$\mu_c = m_\pi/2$, and the propagators change in a significant way in the
superfluid phase, while the Polyakov loop is mearly insensitive to the
transition. Standard analysis suggest that lowest mass in the $0^{++}$ gluonic
channel decreases in the superfluid phase, but these observations need to be
confirmed on larger and more elongated lattices These results indicate that a
nonzero density induces nontrivial modifications of the gluonic medium.
