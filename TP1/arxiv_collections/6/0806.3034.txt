By means of a molecular model, we examine hybrid nematic films with
antagonistic anchoring angles where one of the surfaces is in the strong
anchoring regime. If anchoring at the other surface is weak, and in the absence
of wetting by the isotropic phase, the anchoring transition may interact with
the capillary isotropic-nematic transition in interesting ways. For general
anchoring conditions on this surface we confirm the existence of the step-tilt,
biaxial phase and the associated transition to the linear,
constant-tilt-rotation, configuration. The step-like phase is connected with
the bulk isotropic phase for increasing film thickness so that the latter
transition is to be interpreted as the capillary isotropic-nematic transition.
Finally, we suggest possible global surface phase diagrams.
