In this contribution, we present the design of cylindrical electromagnetic
cloaks working at optical frequencies, making use of layered structures of
plasmonic and non-plasmonic materials. The simulated results confirm the
validity of the proposed approach and show a rather broad-band behavior of the
cloaking device.
