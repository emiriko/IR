We define natural topologies on the Colombeau algebras which are compatible
with the algebraic structure. These topologies reduces do Scarpalezos sharp
topologies when restricted. with this we take a positive step towards
topological methods of solving P.D. Equations in Colombeau algebras.
Applications will appear elsewhere.
