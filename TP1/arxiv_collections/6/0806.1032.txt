As a possible physical realization of a quantum information processor, a
system with stacked self-assembled InAs quantum dots buried in GaAs in adjacent
to the channel of a spin field-effect transistor has been proposed. In this
system, only one of the stacked qubits, i.e. the edge qubit (the qubit closest
to the channel), is measurable via "spin-blockade measurement." It is shown
that the state tomography of the whole chain of the qubits is still possible
even under such a restricted accessibility. The idea is to make use of the
entangling dynamics of the qubits. A recipe for the two-qubit system is
explicitly constructed and the effect of an imperfect fidelity of the
measurement is clarified. A general scheme for multiple qubits based on
repeated measurements is also presented.
