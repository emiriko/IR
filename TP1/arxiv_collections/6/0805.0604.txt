We show how stimulated parametric processes can be employed in experiments on
beyond the diffraction limit to overcome the problem of low visibility obtained
by using spontaneous down conversion operating in the high gain regime. We
further show enhancement of the count rate by several orders when stimulated
parametric processes are used. Both the two photon counts and the visibility
can be controlled by the phase of the stimulating coherent beam.
