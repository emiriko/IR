Since the beginning of Run II at the Fermilab Tevatron, the QCD physics
groups of the CDF and D0 experiments have worked to reach unprecedented levels
of precision for many QCD observables. Thanks to the large dataset - over 3
fb^-1 of integrated luminosity recorded by each experiment - many important new
measurements have recently been made public and will be summarized in this
paper.
