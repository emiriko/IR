We present a quantum algorithm that additively approximates the value of a
tensor network to a certain scale. When combined with existing results, this
provides a complete problem for quantum computation. The result is a simple new
way of looking at quantum computation in which unitary gates are replaced by
tensors and time is replaced by the order in which the tensor-network is
"swallowed". We use this result to derive new quantum algorithms that
approximate the partition function of a variety of classical statistical
mechanics models, including the Potts model.
