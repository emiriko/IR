This paper applies the formalism of classical, Gibbs-Boltzmann statistical
mechanics to the phenomenon of non-thermal damage. As an example, a non-thermal
fiber-bundle model with the global uniform (meanfield) load sharing is
considered. Stochastic topological behavior in the system is described in terms
of an effective temperature parameter thermalizing the system. An equation of
state and a topological analog of the energy-balance equation are obtained. The
formalism of the free energy potential is developed, and the nature of the
first order phase transition and spinodal is demonstrated.
