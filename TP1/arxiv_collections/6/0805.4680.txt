The Telex system is designed for sharing mutable data in a distributed
environment, particularly for collaborative applications. Users operate on
their local, persistent replica of shared documents; they can work disconnected
and suffer no network latency. The Telex approach to detect and correct
conflicts is application independent, based on an action-constraint graph (ACG)
that summarises the concurrency semantics of applications. The ACG is stored
efficiently in a multilog structure that eliminates contention and is optimised
for locality. Telex supports multiple applications and multi-document updates.
The Telex system clearly separates system logic (which includes replication,
views, undo, security, consistency, conflicts, and commitment) from application
logic. An example application is a shared calendar for managing multi-user
meetings; the system detects meeting conflicts and resolves them consistently.
