We construct a relative Chow-Kunneth decomposition for a conic bundle over a
surface such that the middle projector gives the Prym variety of the associated
double covering of the discriminant of the conic bundle. This gives a
refinement (up to an isogeny) of Beauville's theorem on the relation between
the intermediate Jacobian of the conic bundle and the Prym variety of the
double covering.
