When the time dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov intrinsic equations of motion
are solved in the case of seniority one nuclear systems, the unpaired nucleon
remains on the same orbital. The blocking effect hinders the possibility to
skip from one orbital to another. This unpleasant feature is by-passed with a
new set of pairing time dependent equations that allows the possibility that
the unpaired nucleon changes its single-particle level. These equations
generalize the time dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov equations of motion by
including the Landau-Zener effect. The derivation of these new equations is
presented in details. These equations are applied in the case of a
superasymmetric fission process, that is, in order to explain the fine
structure the 14C emission from 233Ra. A new version of the Woods-Saxon model
extended for two-center potentials is used in this context.
