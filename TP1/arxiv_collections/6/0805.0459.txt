In this study, we introduce general frame of MAny Connected Intelligent
Particles Systems (MACIPS). Connections and interconnections between particles
get a complex behavior of such merely simple system (system in
system).Contribution of natural computing, under information granulation
theory, are the main topics of this spacious skeleton. Upon this clue, we
organize two algorithms involved a few prominent intelligent computing and
approximate reasoning methods: self organizing feature map (SOM), Neuro- Fuzzy
Inference System and Rough Set Theory (RST). Over this, we show how our
algorithms can be taken as a linkage of government-society interaction, where
government catches various fashions of behavior: solid (absolute) or flexible.
So, transition of such society, by changing of connectivity parameters (noise)
from order to disorder is inferred. Add to this, one may find an indirect
mapping among financial systems and eventual market fluctuations with MACIPS.
