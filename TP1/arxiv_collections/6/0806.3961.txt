In this article we report the results of detailed interacting boson model
calculations with configuration mixing for the neutron-deficient Pb isotopes.
Calculated energy levels and $B(E2)$ values for $^{188-196}$Pb are discussed
and some care is suggested concerning the current classification on the basis
of level systematics of the $4_1^+$ and $6_1^+$ states in $^{190-194}$Pb.
Furthermore, quadrupole deformations are extracted for $^{186-196}$Pb and the
mixing between the different families (0p-0h, 2p-2h, and 4p-4h) is discussed in
detail. Finally, the experimental and the theoretical level systematics are
compared.
