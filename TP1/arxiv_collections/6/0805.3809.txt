Let $\Hn$ be the $(2n+1)$-dimensional Heisenberg group and $K$ a compact
group of automorphisms of $\Hn$ such that $(K\ltimes \Hn,K)$ is a Gelfand pair.
We prove that the Gelfand transform is a topological isomorphism between the
space of $K$-invariant Schwartz functions on $\Hn$ and the space of Schwartz
function on a closed subset of $\R^s$ homeomorphic to the Gelfand spectrum of
the Banach algebra of $K$-invariant integrable functions on $\Hn$.
