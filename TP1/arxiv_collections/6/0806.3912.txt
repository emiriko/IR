We introduce a Predictor-Corrector type method suitable for performing
many-particle Brownian Dynamics simulations. Since the method goes over to the
Gear's method for Molecular Dynamics simulation in the limit of vanishing
friction, we refer to it as a Gear-like algorithm. The algorithm has been
tested on a one-dimensional, stochastically damped harmonic oscillator model,
showing that it can cover a wide range of friction coefficients with a
high-order accuracy, excellent stability, and a very small energy drift on the
long time scales.
