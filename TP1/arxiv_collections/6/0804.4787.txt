The existence of a flat torsion-free connection, or left symmetric algebra
structure on a Lie algebra g gives rise to a canonically defined complex
structure on g+g and a symplectic structure on g+g^*. We verify that the
associated differential Gerstenhaber algebras controlling the deformation
theories of the complex and symplectic form are isomorphic. This provides a
class of examples of "weak mirror symmetry" as suggested by Merkulov. For
nilpotent algebras in dimension 4 and 6 the isomorphism classes of the
semi-direct products g+g and g+g^* are listed. A one-parameter family of
inequivalent pseudo-K\"ahler structures is given.
