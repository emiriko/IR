We propose a recipe to construct matrix representations of Nambu--Lie
3-algebras in terms of irreducible representations of underlying Lie algebra.
The case of Euclidean four-dimensional 3-algebra is considered in details. We
find that representations of this 3-algebra are not possible in terms of only
Hermitian matrices in spite of its Euclidean nature.
