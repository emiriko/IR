We consider the geometric phase and quantum tunneling in vicinity of diabolic
and exceptional points. We show that the geometric phase associated with the
degeneracy points is defined by the flux of complex magnetic monopole. In
weak-coupling limit the leading contribution to the real part of geometric
phase is given by the flux of the Dirac monopole plus quadrupole term, and the
expansion for its imaginary part starts with the dipolelike field. For a
two-level system governed by the generic non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we derive a
formula to compute the non-adiabatic complex geometric phase by integral over
the complex Bloch sphere. We apply our results to to study a two-level
dissipative system driven by periodic electromagnetic field and show that in
the vicinity of the exceptional point the complex geometric phase behaves as
step-like function. Studying tunneling process near and at exceptional point,
we find two different regimes: coherent and incoherent. The coherent regime is
characterized by the Rabi oscillations and one-sheeted hyperbolic monopole
emerges in this region of the parameters. In turn with the incoherent regime
the two-sheeted hyperbolic monopole is associated. The exceptional point is the
critical point of the system where the topological transition occurs and both
of the regimes yield the quadratic dependence on time. We show that the
dissipation brings into existence of pulses in the complex geometric phase and
the pulses are disappeared when dissipation dies out. Such a strong coupling
effect of the environment is beyond of the conventional adiabatic treatment of
the Berry phase.
