We demonstrate the optical generation of dynamic dark optical ring lattices,
which do not require Laguerre-Gauss beams, large optical coherence lengths or
interferometric stability. Simple control signals lead to spatial modulation
and reproducible rotation, offering manifold possibilities for complex dynamic
ring lattices. In conjunction with a magnetic trap, these scanned 2D intensity
distributions from a single laser beam will enable precision trapping and
manipulation of ultracold species using blue-detuned light. The technique is
ideal for azimuthal ratchet, Mott insulator and persistent current experiments
with quantum degenerate gases.
