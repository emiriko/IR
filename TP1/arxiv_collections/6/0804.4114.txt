We consider some nonlocal and nonpolynomial scalar field models originated
from p-adic string theory. Infinite number of spacetime derivatives is
determined by the operator valued Riemann zeta function through d'Alembertian
$\Box$ in its argument. Construction of the corresponding Lagrangians L starts
with the exact Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}_p$ for effective field of p-adic tachyon
string, which is generalized replacing p by arbitrary natural number n and then
taken a sum of $\mathcal{L}_n$ over all n. The corresponding new objects we
call zeta scalar strings. Some basic classical field properties of these fields
are obtained and presented in this paper. In particular, some solutions of the
equations of motion and their tachyon spectra are studied. Field theory with
Riemann zeta function dynamics is interesting in its own right as well.
