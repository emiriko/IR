We investigate existence and linear stability of coupled vortex solitons
supported by cascaded four-wave mixing in a Raman active medium excited away
from the resonance. We present a detailed analysis for the two- and
three-component vortex solitons and demonstrate the formation of stable and
unstable vortex solitons, and associated spatio-temporal helical beams, under
the conditions of the simultaneous frequency and vortex comb generation.
