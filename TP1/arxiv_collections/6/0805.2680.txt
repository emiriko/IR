We obtain the symplectic group $\SP(V)$ as the universal completion of an
amalgam of low rank subgroups akin to Levi components. We let $\SP(V)$ act
flag-transitively on the geometry of maximal rank subspaces of $V$. We show
that this geometry and its rank $\ge 3$ residues are simply connected with few
exceptions. The main exceptional residue is described in some detail. The
amalgamation result is then obtained by applying Tits' lemma. This provides a
new way of recognizing the symplectic groups from a small collection of small
subgroups.
