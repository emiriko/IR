We study the angular structure of polarization of light transmitted through a
nematic liquid crystal (NLC) cell by analyzing the polarization state as a
function of the incidence angles and the polarization of the incident wave. The
polarization resolved angular patterns emerging after the NLC cell illuminated
by the convergent light beam are described in terms of the polarization
singularities such as C-points (points of circular polarization) and L-lines
(lines of linear polarization). For the homeotropically aligned cell, the
Stokes polarimetry technique is used to measure the polarization resolved
conoscopic patterns at different values of the ellipticity of the incident
light impinging onto the cell. Using the exact analytical expressions for the
transfer matrix we show that variations of the ellipticity induce
transformations of the angular pattern exhibiting the effect of avoided L-line
crossings and characterized by topological events such as creation and
annihilation of the C-points. The predictions of the theory are found to be in
good agreement with the experimental results.
