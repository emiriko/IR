The behaviors of one-dimensional quantum random walks are strikingly
different from those of classical ones. However, when decoherence is involved,
the limiting distributions take on many classical features over time. In this
paper, we study the decoherence on both position and ``coin'' spaces of the
particle. We propose a new analytical approach to investigate these phenomena
and obtain the generating functions which encode all the features of these
walks. Specifically, from these generating functions, we find exact analytic
expressions of several moments for the time and noise dependence of position.
Moreover, the limiting position distributions of decoherent quantum random
walks are shown to be Gaussian in an analytical manner. These results
explicitly describe the relationship between the system and the level of
decoherence.
