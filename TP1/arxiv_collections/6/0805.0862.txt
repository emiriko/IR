Multilayered ceramic substrates with embedded micro patterns are becoming
increasingly important, for example, in harsh environment electronics and
microfluidic devices. Fabrication of these embedded micro patterns, such as
micro channels, cavities and vias, is a challenge. This study focuses on the
process of patterning micro features on ceramic green substrates using micro
embossing. A ceramic green tape that possessed near-zero shrinkage in the x-y
plane was used, six layers of which were laminated as the embossing substrate.
The process parameters that impact on the pattern fidelity were investigated
and optimized in this study. Micro features with line-width as small as several
micrometers were formed on the ceramic green substrates. The dynamic
thermo-mechanical analysis indicated that extending the holding time at certain
temperature range would harden the green substrates with little effect on
improving the embossing fidelity. Ceramic substrates with embossed micro
patterns were obtain d after co-firing. The embedded micro channels were also
obtained by laminating the green tapes on the embossed substrates.
