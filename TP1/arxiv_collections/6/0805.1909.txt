We study the quotient Q_i(A) of a free algebra A by the ideal M_i(A)
generated by relation that the i-th commutator of any elements is zero. In
particular, we completely describe such quotient for i=4 (for i<=3 this was
done previously by Feigin and Shoikhet). We also study properties of the ideals
M_i(A), e.g. when M_i(A)M_j(A) is contained in M_{i+j-1}(A) (by a result of
Gupta and Levin, it is always contained in M_{i+j-2}(A)).
