By combining the Minkowski inequality and the quantum Chernoff bound, we
derive easy-to-compute upper bounds for the error probability affecting the
optimal discrimination of Gaussian states. In particular, these bounds are
useful when the Gaussian states are unitarily inequivalent, i.e., they differ
in their symplectic invariants.
