In this short note, we analyze the assumptions made by McDougal et al (2006),
both explicit and implicit, in their estimation of the proportion of "true
recent infections" using the BED CEIA. This enables us to write down
expressions for the sensitivity, short term specificity and long term
specificity of a test for recent infection defined by a BED ODn below a
threshold. We then derive an identity which shows the relationship between
these parameters, allowing the elimination of sensitivity and short term
specificity from an expression relating the proportion of "true recent
infections" to the proportion of seropositive individuals testing below
threshold. This has two important consequences. Firstly, the simplified formula
is substantially more amenable to calibration. Secondly, naively treating the
parameters as independent would lead to an incorrect estimate of uncertainty
due to imperfect calibration.
