We present zero-temperature simulations for the single-particle density of
states of the Coulomb glass. Our results in three dimensions are consistent
with the Efros and Shklovskii prediction for the density of states.
Finite-temperature Monte Carlo simulations show no sign of a thermodynamic
glass transition down to low temperatures, in disagreement with mean-field
theory. Furthermore, the random-displacement formulation of the model undergoes
a transition into a distorted Wigner crystal for a surprisingly broad range of
the disorder strength.
