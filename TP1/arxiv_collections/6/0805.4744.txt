In this paper we propose a solution for the time evolution of the island
density with irreversible aggregation and a time dependent input of particle in
the space dimensions $d=1,2$. For this purpose we use the rate equation
resulting from a generalized mean field approach. A well-known technique for
growing surfaces at the atomic scale is molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Another
approach is the pulsed laser deposition method (PLD). The main difference
between MBE and PLD is that in the case of MBE we have a continuous rate of
deposition $F$ of adatoms on the surface whereas in the case of PLD the adatoms
are deposited during a pulse of a laser which is very short in comparison to
the time span $T$ between the pulses. The generalized mean field theory is a
useful model for both MBE and PLD with the most simple approximation,
point-like island. We show that the parameter $T$ distinguishes the MBE regime
from the PLD regime. We solve the rate equation for the PLD regime. We consider
the time evolution of the density of immobile islands. For large time $t\gg T$,
the PLD regime dominates the MBE regime and we find that the density of
immobile islands grows as $t^{1/2}$ whereas for MBE we find the known behavior
of the density, $t^{1/3}$ for $d=2$ and $t^{1/4}$ for $d=1$. We illustrate this
result with Monte-Carlo simulations for $d=1,2$.
