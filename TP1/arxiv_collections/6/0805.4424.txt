We study the transport through side-coupled double quantum dots, connected to
normal and superconducting (SC) leads with a T-shape configuration. We find,
using the numerical renormalization group, that the Coulomb interaction
suppresses SC interference in the side dot, and enhances the conductance
substantially in the Kondo regime. This behavior stands in total contrast to a
wide Kondo valley seen in the normal transport. The SC proximity penetrating
into the interfacial dot pushes the Kondo clouds, which screens the local
moment in the side dot, towards the normal lead to make the singlet bond long.
The conductance shows a peak of unitary limit as the cloud expands.
Furthermore, two separate Fano structures appear in the gate-voltage dependence
of the Andreev transport, where a single reduced plateau appears in the normal
transport.
