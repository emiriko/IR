We show that gradient shrinking, expanding or steady Ricci solitons have
potentials leading to suitable reference probability measures on the manifold.
For shrinking solitons, as well as expanding soltions with nonnegative Ricci
curvature, these reference measures satisfy sharp logarithmic Sobolev
inequalities with lower bounds characterized by the geometry of the manifold.
The geometric invariant appearing in the sharp lower bound is shown to be
nonnegative. We also characterize the expanders when such invariant is zero. In
the proof various useful volume growth estimates are also established for
gradient shrinking and expanding solitons. In particular, we prove that the
{\it asymptotic volume ratio} of any gradient shrinking soliton with
nonnegative Ricci curvature must be zero.
