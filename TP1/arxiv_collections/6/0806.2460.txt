We introduce a diffusion model for energetically inhomogeneous systems. A
random walker moves on a spin-S Ising configuration, which generates the energy
landscape on the lattice through the nearest-neighbors interaction. The
underlying energetic environment is also made dynamic by properly coupling the
walker with the spin lattice. In fact, while the walker hops across
nearest-neighbor sites, it can flip the pertaining spins, realizing a diffusive
dynamics for the Ising system. As a result, the walk is biased towards high
energy regions, namely the boundaries between clusters. Besides, the coupling
introduced involves, with respect the ordinary diffusion laws, interesting
corrections depending on either the temperature and the spin magnitude. In
particular, they provide a further signature of the phase-transition occurring
on the magnetic lattice.
