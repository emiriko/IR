We investigate a number of fermionic condensate phases on the honeycomb
lattice, to determine whether topological defects (vortices and edges) in these
phases can support bound states with zero energy. We argue that topological
zero modes bound to vortices and at edges are not only connected, but should in
fact be \emph{identified}. Recently, it has been shown that the simplest s-wave
superconducting state for the Dirac fermion approximation of the honeycomb
lattice at precisely half filling, supports zero modes inside the cores of
vortices (P. Ghaemi and F. Wilczek, 2007). We find that within the continuum
Dirac theory the zero modes are not unique neither to this phase, nor to half
filling. In addition, we find the \emph{exact} wavefunctions for vortex bound
zero modes, as well as the complete edge state spectrum of the phases we
discuss. The zero modes in all the phases we examine have even-numbered
degeneracy, and as such pairs of any Majorana modes are simply equivalent to
one ordinary fermion. As a result, contrary to bound state zero modes in $p_x+i
p_y$ superconductors, vortices here do \emph{not} exhibit non-Abelian exchange
statistics. The zero modes in the pure Dirac theory are seemingly topologically
protected by the effective low energy symmetry of the theory, yet on the
original honeycomb lattice model these zero modes are split, by explicit
breaking of the effective low energy symmetry.
