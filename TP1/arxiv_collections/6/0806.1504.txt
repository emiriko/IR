Using a dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo approximation we investigate
the d-wave superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in the doped 2D
repulsive Hubbard model with a weak inhomogeneity. The inhomogeneity is
introduced in the hoppings $\tp$ and $t$ in the form of a checkerboard pattern
where $t$ is the hopping within a $2\times2$ plaquette and $\tp$ is the hopping
between the plaquettes. We find inhomogeneity suppresses $T_c$. The
characteristic spin excitation energy and the strength of d-wave pairing
interaction decrease with decreasing $T_c$ suggesting a strong correlation
between these quantities.
