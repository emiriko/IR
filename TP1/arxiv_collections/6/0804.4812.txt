We study the electronic and lattice dynamical properties of compressed solid
germane in the pressure range up to 200 GPa with density functional theory. A
stable metallic structure, Aba2, with a base-centered orthorhombic symmetry was
found to be the lowest enthalpy phase for pressure from 23 to 177 GPa,
suggesting an insulator to metal phase transition around 23 GPa. The Aba2
structure is predicted to have higher superconducting transition temperature
than SiH4 reported recently, thus presenting new possibilities for exploring
high temperature superconductivity in this hydrogen-rich system.
