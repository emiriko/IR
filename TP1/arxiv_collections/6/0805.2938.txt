The paper concerns available steganographic techniques that can be used for
creating covert channels for VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) streams. Apart
from characterizing existing steganographic methods we provide new insights by
presenting two new techniques. The first one is network steganography solution
which exploits free/unused protocols' fields and is known for IP, UDP or TCP
protocols but has never been applied to RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol) and
RTCP (Real-Time Control Protocol) which are characteristic for VoIP. The second
method, called LACK (Lost Audio Packets Steganography), provides hybrid
storage-timing covert channel by utilizing delayed audio packets. The results
of the experiment, that was performed to estimate a total amount of data that
can be covertly transferred during typical VoIP conversation phase, regardless
of steganalysis, are also included in this paper.
