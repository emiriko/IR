The Desktop Grid offers solutions to overcome several challenges and to
answer increasingly needs of scientific computing. This technology consists
mainly in exploiting PC resources, geographically dispersed, to treat time
consuming applications and/or important storage capacity requiring
applications. However, as resources number increases, the need for scalability,
self-organisation, dynamic reconfiguration, decentralization and performance
becomes more and more essential. In this context, this paper evaluates the
scalability and performance of P2P tools for registering and discovering
services (Publish/Subscribe systems). Three protocols are used in this purpose:
Bonjour, Avahi and Pastry. We have studied the behaviour of these protocols
related to two criteria: the elapsed time for registrations services and the
needed time to discover new services.
