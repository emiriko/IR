We present the results on measurement of event-by-event pt fluctuations and
correlations for Cu+Cu collisions at sqrt{sNN} = 62.4 and 200 GeV from STAR
experiment at RHIC. These results are compared with those from Au+Au collisions
at sqrt{sNN} = 62.4 and 200 GeV to study the system size dependence. We find
that the dynamical pt fluctuations are finite and decrease with increasing
collision centrality. The pt correlations are studied as a function of
collision centrality and are observed to decrease as we go from peripheral to
central collisions. The square root of pt correlations scaled by mean pt are
observed to be independent of beam energy as well as colliding ion size.
