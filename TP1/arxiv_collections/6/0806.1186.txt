We study the dynamics of a deterministic walk confined in a narrow
two-dimensional space randomly filled with point-like targets. At each step,
the walker visits the nearest target not previously visited. Complex dynamics
is observed at some intermediate values of the domain width, when, while
drifting, the walk performs long intermittent backward excursions. As the width
is increased, evidence of a transition from ballistic motion to a weakly
non-ergodic regime is shown, characterized by sudden inversions of the drift
velocity with a probability slowly decaying with time, as $1/t$ at leading
order. Excursion durations, first-passage times and the dynamics of unvisited
targets follow power-law distributions. For parameter values below this scaling
regime, precursory patterns in the form of "wild" outliers are observed, in
close relation with the presence of log-oscillations in the probability
distributions. We discuss the connections between this model and several
evolving biological systems.
