A combination of Density Functional Theory and the Dynamical Mean Field
theory (DMFT) is used to calculate the magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity,
and the temperature dependence of the valence band photoemission spectra. The
continuous-time hybridization expansion quantum Monte-Carlo is utilized to
provide the first approximation-free DMFT solution of \emph{fcc} $\delta$-Pu
which includes the full rotationally-invariant exchange interaction. We predict
that $\delta$-Pu has a Pauli-like magnetic susceptibility near ambient
temperature, as in experiment, indicating that electronic coherence causes the
absence of local moments. Additionally, We show that volume expansion causes a
crossover from incoherent to coherent electronic behavior at increasingly lower
temperatures.
