We assess proposals for entangling two distant atoms by measurement of
emitted photons, analyzing how their performance depends on the photon
detection efficiency. We consider schemes based on measurement of one or two
photons and compare them in terms of the probability to obtain the detection
event and of the conditional fidelity with which the desired entangled state is
created. Based on an unravelling of the master equation, we quantify the
parameter regimes in which one or the other scheme is more efficient, including
the possible combination of the one-photon scheme with state purification. In
general, protocols based on one-photon detection are more efficient in set-ups
characterized by low photon detection efficiency, while at larger values
two-photon protocols are preferable. We give numerical examples based on
current experiments.
