We consider the continuum scaling limit of the infinite series of Yang-Baxter
integrable logarithmic minimal models LM(p,p') as `rational' logarithmic
conformal field theories with extended W symmetry. The representation content
is found to consist of 6pp'-2p-2p' W-indecomposable representations of which
2p+2p'-2 are of rank 1, 4pp'-2p-2p' are of rank 2, while the remaining
2(p-1)(p'-1) are of rank 3. We identify these representations with suitable
limits of Yang-Baxter integrable boundary conditions on the lattice. The
W-indecomposable rank-1 representations are all W-irreducible while we present
a conjecture for the embedding patterns of the W-indecomposable rank-2 and -3
representations. The associated W-extended characters are all given explicitly
and decompose as finite non-negative sums of W-irreducible characters. The
latter correspond to W-irreducible subfactors and we find that there are
2pp'+(p-1)(p'-1)/2 of them. We present fermionic character expressions for some
of the rank-2 and all of the rank-3 W-indecomposable representations. To
distinguish between inequivalent W-indecomposable representations of identical
characters, we introduce `refined' characters carrying information also about
the Jordan-cell content of a representation. Using a lattice implementation of
fusion on a strip, we study the fusion rules for the W-indecomposable
representations and find that they generate a closed fusion algebra, albeit one
without identity for p>1. We present the complete set of fusion rules and
interpret the closure of this fusion algebra as confirmation of the proposed
extended symmetry. Finally, 2pp' of the W-indecomposable representations are in
fact W-projective representations and they generate a closed fusion subalgebra.
