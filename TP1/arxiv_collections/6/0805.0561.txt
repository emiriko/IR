We analyze the appearance of non-Markovian effects in the dynamics of a
bipartite system coupled to a reservoir, which can be described within a class
of non-Markovian equations given by a generalized Lindblad structure. A novel
master equation, which we term quantum Bloch-Boltzmann equation, is derived,
describing both motional and internal states of a test particle in a quantum
framework. When due to the preparation of the system or to decoherence effects
one of the two degrees of freedom is amenable to a classical treatment and not
resolved in the final measurement, though relevant for the interaction with the
reservoir, non-Markovian behaviors such as stretched exponential or power law
decay of coherences can be put into evidence.
