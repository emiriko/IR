We present an entanglement criterion for two mode squeezed states which
relies on particle counting only. The proposed inequality is optimal for the
state under consideration and robust against particle losses up to 2/3. As it
does not involve measurements of quadratures - which is typically very
challenging for atomic modes - it renders the detection of atomic many-particle
entanglement feasible in many different settings. Moreover it bridges the gap
between entanglement verification for a qubit and criteria for continuous
variables measured by homodyne detection. We illustrate its application in the
context of superradiant light scattering from Bose Einstein condensates by
considering the creation of entanglement between atoms and light as well as
between two condensates in different momentum states. The latter scheme takes
advantage of leaving the Gaussian realm and features probabilistic entanglement
distillation.
