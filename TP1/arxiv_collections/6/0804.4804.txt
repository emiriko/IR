Proliferating cell populations at steady state growth often exhibit broad
protein distributions with exponential tails. The sources of this variation and
its universality are of much theoretical interest. Here we address the problem
by asymptotic analysis of the Population Balance Equation. We show that the
steady state distribution tail is determined by a combination of protein
production and cell division and is insensitive to other model details. Under
general conditions this tail is exponential with a dependence on parameters
consistent with experiment. We discuss the conditions for this effect to be
dominant over other sources of variation and the relation to experiments.
