The magnetic field probability P(B) is calculated from the Ginzburg-Landau
theory for various lattices of vortex lines in type-II superconductors: Ideal
triangular lattices, lattices with various shear strains and with a super
lattice of vacancies, and lattices of short vortices in films whose magnetic
field ''mushrooms'' near the surface.
