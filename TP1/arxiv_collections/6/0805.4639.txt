We examine the Newtonian potential in gravitational cohomology. This is given
by a symmetric, two-index tensor field, which satisfies the wave equation in
empty space. Furthermore, the associated gravitational field strength, obtained
by applying the coboundary operator to the potential, is constructed for the
case of a stationary point mass and shown to give the classical result.
