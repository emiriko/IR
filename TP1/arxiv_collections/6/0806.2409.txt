Smectic order on arbitrary curved substrate can be described by a
differential form of rank one (1-form), whose geometric meaning is the
differential of the local phase field of the density modulation. The exterior
derivative of 1-form is the local dislocation density. Elastic deformations are
described by superposition of exact differential forms. We use the formalism of
differential forms to systematically classify and characterize all low energy
smectic states on torus as well as on sphere. A two dimensional smectic order
confined on either manifold exhibits many topologically distinct low energy
states. Different states are not accessible from each other by local
fluctuations. The total number of low energy states scales as the square root
of the system area. We also address the energetics of 2D smectic on a curved
substrate and calculate the mean field phase diagram of smectic on a thin
torus. Finally, we discuss the motion of disclinations for spherical smectics
as low energy excitations, and illustrate the interesting connection between
spherical smectic and the theory of elliptic functions.
