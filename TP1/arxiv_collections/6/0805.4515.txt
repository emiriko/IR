The phenomenon of jet supression observed in highly energetic heavy ion
collisions is discussed. The focus is devoted to the stunning applications of
the AdS/CFT correspondence to describe these real time processes, hard to be
illuminated by other means. In particular, the introduction of as many flavors
as colors into the quark-gluon plasma is scrutinized.
