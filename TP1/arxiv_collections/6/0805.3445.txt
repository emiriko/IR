A superconducting tunnel junction is used to directly extract quasiparticles
from one of the leads of a single-Cooper-pair-transistor. The consequent
reduction in quasiparticle density causes a lower rate of quasiparticle
tunneling onto the device. This rate is directly measured by radio-frequency
reflectometry. Local cooling may be of direct benefit in reducing the effect of
quasiparticles on coherent superconducting nanostructures.
