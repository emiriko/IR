We do a re-analysis to asses the impact of the results of the Borexino
experiment and the recent 2.8 KTy KamLAND data on the solar neutrino
oscillation parameters. The current Borexino results are found to have no
impact on the allowed solar neutrino parameter space. The new KamLAND data
causes a significant reduction of the allowed range of $\Delta m^2_{21}$,
determining it with an unprecedented precision of 8.3% at 3$\sigma$. The
precision of $\Delta m^2_{21}$ is controlled practically by the KamLAND data
alone. Inclusion of new KamLAND results also improves the upper bound on
$\sin^2\theta_{12}$, but the precision of this parameter continues to be
controlled by the solar data. The third mixing angle is constrained to be
$\sin^2\theta_{13} < 0.063$ at $3\sigma$ from a combined fit to the solar,
KamLAND, atmospheric and CHOOZ results. We also address the issue of how much
further reduction of allowed range of $\Delta m^2_{21}$ and $\sin^2\theta_{12}$
is possible with increased statistics from KamLAND. We find that there is a
sharp reduction of the $3\sigma$ ``spread'' with enhanced statistics till about
10 KTy after which the spread tends to flatten out reaching to less than 4%
with 15 KTy data. For $\sin^2\theta_{12}$ however, the spread is more than 25%
even after 20 KTy exposure and assuming $\theta_{12} < \pi/4$, as dictated by
the solar data. We show that with a KamLAND like reactor ``SPMIN'' experiment
at a distance of $\sim$ 60 km, the spread of $\sin^2\theta_{12}$ could be
reduced to about 5% at $3\sigma$ level while $\Delta m_{21}^2$ could be
determined to within 4%, with just 3 KTy exposure.
