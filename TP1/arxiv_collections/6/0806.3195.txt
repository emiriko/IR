This paper concerns underdetermined linear instantaneous and convolutive
blind source separation (BSS), i.e., the case when the number of observed mixed
signals is lower than the number of sources.We propose partial BSS methods,
which separate supposedly nonstationary sources of interest (while keeping
residual components for the other, supposedly stationary, "noise" sources).
These methods are based on the general differential BSS concept that we
introduced before. In the instantaneous case, the approach proposed in this
paper consists of a differential extension of the FastICA method (which does
not apply to underdetermined mixtures). In the convolutive case, we extend our
recent time-domain fast fixed-point C-FICA algorithm to underdetermined
mixtures. Both proposed approaches thus keep the attractive features of the
FastICA and C-FICA methods. Our approaches are based on differential sphering
processes, followed by the optimization of the differential nonnormalized
kurtosis that we introduce in this paper. Experimental tests show that these
differential algorithms are much more robust to noise sources than the standard
FastICA and C-FICA algorithms.
