The generation of atomic entanglement is discussed in a system that atoms are
trapped in separate cavities which are connected via optical fibers. Two
distant atoms can be projected to Bell-state by synchronized turning off the
local laser fields and then performing a single quantum measurement by a
distant controller. The distinct advantage of this scheme is that it works in a
regime that $\Delta\approx\kappa\gg g$, which makes the scheme insensitive to
cavity strong leakage. Moreover, the fidelity is not affected by atomic
spontaneous emission.
