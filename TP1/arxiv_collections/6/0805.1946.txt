The high energy program of the HERA collider ended in March 2007. In total
the H1 and ZEUS experiments collected an integrated luminosity of about 1
fb$^{-1}$. Recent results of model independent searches for new physics from
both experiments are presented. Specifically, studies of the events with an
isolated lepton and missing transverse momentum and multi-lepton topologies,
where H1 and ZEUS data are combined, and a general signature based search are
discussed.
