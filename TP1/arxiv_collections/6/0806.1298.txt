Superconducting qubits coupled to electric or nanomechanical resonators
display effects previously studied in quantum electrodynamics (QED) and
extensions thereof. Here we study a driven qubit coupled to a low-frequency
tank circuit with particular emphasis on the role of dissipation. When the
qubit is driven to perform Rabi oscillations, with Rabi frequency in resonance
with the oscillator, the latter can be driven far from equilibrium. Blue
detuned driving leads to a population inversion in the qubit and lasing
behavior of the oscillator ("single-atom laser"). For red detuning the qubit
cools the oscillator. This behavior persists at the symmetry point where the
qubit-oscillator coupling is quadratic and decoherence effects are minimized.
Here the system realizes a "single-atom-two-photon laser".
