According to Bohr's complementarity principle, a particle possesses wave-like
properties only when the different paths the particle may take are
indistinguishable. In a canonical example of a two-path interferometer with a
which-path detector, observation of interference and obtaining which-path
information are mutually exclusive. Such duality has been demonstrated in
optics with a pair of correlated photons and in solid-state devices with
phase-coherent electrons. In the latter case, which-path information was
provided by a charge detector embedded near one path of a two-path electron
interferometer. Note that suppression of interference can always be understood
either as obtaining path information or as unavoidable back action by the
detector. The present study reports on dephasing of an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) ring
interferometer via a coupled charge detector adjacent to the ring. In contrast
to the two-path interferometer, charge detection in the ring does not always
provide path information. Indeed, we found that the interference was suppressed
only when path information could be acquired, even if only in principle. This
demonstrates that dephasing does not always take place by coupling the
`environment' to the interfering particle: path information of the particle
must be available too. Moreover, this is valid regardless of the strength of
environment-interferometer coupling, which refutes the general notion of the
effect of strong interaction with the environment. In other words, it verifies
that an acquisition of which-path information is more fundamental than the
back-action in understanding quantum mechanical complementarity.
