We show that electrically and magnetically frustrated Josephson junction
arrays (JJAs) realize topological order with a non-trivial ground state
degeneracy on manifolds with non-trivial topology. The low-energy theory has
the same gauge dynamics of the unfrustrated JJAs but for different,
"fractional" degrees of freedom, a principle reminescent of Jain's composite
electrons in the fractional quantum Hall effect.
