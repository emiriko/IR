The magnetization of ferromagnetic LaCoO3 films grown epitaxially on
piezoelectric substrates has been found to systematically decrease with the
reduction of tensile strain. The magnetization change induced by the reversible
strain variation reveals an increase of the Co magnetic moment with tensile
strain. The biaxial strain dependence of the Curie temperature is estimated to
be below 4K/% in the as-grown tensile strain state of our films. This is in
agreement with results from statically strained films on various substrates.
