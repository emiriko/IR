The ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density in a strongly coupled CFT
plasma can be computed using the AdS/CFT correspondence either from equilibrium
correlation functions or from the Janik-Peschanski dual of the boost invariant
plasma expansion. We point out that the previously found disagreement for eta/s
at finite t' Hooft coupling is resolved once the incoming-wave boundary
condition for metric fluctuations at the horizon of the dual geometry is
properly imposed.
