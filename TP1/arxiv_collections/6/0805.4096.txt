We investigate induced modules of doublet algebra in (1,p) logarithmic
models. We give fermionic formulas for the characters of induced modules and
coinvariants with respect to different subalgebras calculated in the
irreducible modules. The characters of coinvariants give multiplicities of
projective modules in fusion of induced modules.
