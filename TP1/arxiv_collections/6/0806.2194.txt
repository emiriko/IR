This paper proposes the Ricci-flow equation from Riemannian geometry as a
general geometric framework for various nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems
(and related dissipative solitons) in mathematical biology. More precisely, we
propose a conjecture that any kind of reaction-diffusion processes in biology,
chemistry and physics can be modelled by the combined geometric-diffusion
system. In order to demonstrate the validity of this hypothesis, we review a
number of popular nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems and try to show that
they can all be subsumed by the presented geometric framework of the Ricci
flow.
  Keywords: geometrical Ricci flow, nonlinear reaction-diffusion, dissipative
