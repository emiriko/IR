Two-dimensional complexes of C_20 fullerenes connected to each other by
covalent bonds have been studied. Several isomers with different types of
intercluster bonds have been revealed. The lifetimes of the (C_20)_MxM systems
with M = 2 and 3 have been directly calculated at T = 1800 - 3300 K making use
of molecular dynamics. It has been shown that these complexes lose their
periodic cluster structure due to either coalescence of two fullerenes C_20 or
decay of C_20 fullerenes. The activation energies of these processes exceed 2
eV.
