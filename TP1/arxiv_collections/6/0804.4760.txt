We report new STAR results on the consequences of highly energetic partons
propagating through the medium formed in heavy ion collisions using
correlations as an experimental probe. The recent results providing insights
about color factor effects and path length dependence of parton energy loss,
system size dependence of di-hadron fragmentation functions, conical emission
and ridge formation in heavy ion collisions are presented.
