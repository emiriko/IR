A full nexus between Newtonian and relativistic mechanics is set. Contrarily
to what is commonly thought, Newtonian mechanics can be amended to suit all
speeds up to c. It is demonstrated that when introducing the fact that the
pulse of oscillators, i.e. emitters and clocks, is sensitive to speed, the
Newtonian framework can be extended to all speeds. For this aim, it is
formulated the concept of actor scenario vs. observer scenario. This
differentiation is essential to avoid confusion between effective reality
(actor scenario) and appearance (observer scenario). Measurements are subjected
to kinematical aberrations, the observer scenario being inertial. These must be
removed to attain intrinsic reality, i.e. that of actors. The lack of
demarcation between the two scenarios leads to conceptual confusions. The
amended Newtonian mechanics is of full application. Here, it has been mainly
applied to the Newtonian Doppler effect, amended to suit all speeds.
