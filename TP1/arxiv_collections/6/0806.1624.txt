One or more heavy spin-1 fields may replace the Higgs boson in keeping
perturbative unitarity up to a few TeV. By means of two prototype chiral models
for the heavy spin-1 bosons, a "composite" model or a "gauge" model, we discuss
if and how the sole exchange of the same fields can also account for the
ElectroWeak Precision Tests. While this proves impossible in the gauge model,
the composite model hints to a positive solution, which we exploit to constrain
the phenomenological properties of the heavy vectors.
