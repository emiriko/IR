In a previous paper, we have developed a general theory of thermodynamic
limits. We apply it here to three different Coulomb quantum systems, for which
we prove the convergence of the free energy per unit volume.
  The first system is the crystal for which the nuclei are classical particles
arranged periodically in space and only the electrons are quantum particles. We
recover and generalize a previous result of Fefferman. In the second example,
both the nuclei and the electrons are quantum particles, submitted to a
periodic magnetic field. We thereby extend a seminal result of Lieb and
Lebowitz. Finally, in our last example we take again classical nuclei but
optimize their position. To our knowledge such a system was never treated
before.
  The verification of the assumptions introduced in the previous paper uses
several tools which have been introduced before in the study of large quantum
systems. In particular, an electrostatic inequality of Graf and Schenker is one
main ingredient of our new approach.
