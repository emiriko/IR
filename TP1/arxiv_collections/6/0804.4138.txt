We conclude a sequence of work by giving near-optimal sketching and streaming
algorithms for estimating Shannon entropy in the most general streaming model,
with arbitrary insertions and deletions. This improves on prior results that
obtain suboptimal space bounds in the general model, and near-optimal bounds in
the insertion-only model without sketching. Our high-level approach is simple:
we give algorithms to estimate Renyi and Tsallis entropy, and use them to
extrapolate an estimate of Shannon entropy. The accuracy of our estimates is
proven using approximation theory arguments and extremal properties of
Chebyshev polynomials, a technique which may be useful for other problems. Our
work also yields the best-known and near-optimal additive approximations for
entropy, and hence also for conditional entropy and mutual information.
