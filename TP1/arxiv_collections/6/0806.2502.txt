We investigate the continuous weak measurement of a solid-state qubit by
single electron transistors in nonlinear response regime. It is found that the
signal-to-noise ratio can violate the universal upper bound imposed quantum
mechanically to any linear response detectors. We understand the violation by
means of the cross-correlation of the detector currents.
