The introduction of intermediate states in the dynamics of the voter model
modifies the ordering process and restores an effective surface tension. The
logarithmic coarsening of the conventional voter model in two dimensions is
eliminated in favour of an algebraic decay of the density of interfaces with
time, compatible with Model A dynamics at low temperatures. This phenomenon is
addressed by deriving Langevin equations for the dynamics of appropriately
defined continuous fields. These equations are analyzed using field theoretical
arguments and by means of a recently proposed numerical technique for the
integration of stochastic equations with multiplicative noise. We find good
agreement with lattice simulations of the microscopic model.
