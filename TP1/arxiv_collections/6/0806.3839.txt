We demonstrate the possibility of existence of meta-stable N-body Efimov
states in trapped Bose systems with large scattering length. We calculate
spectra of trapped systems of N=3,4,5,6, and 7 bosons using a stochastic
variational method with a restricted correlated Gaussian basis. For each system
the calculations reveal a series of Efimov states where the energy and the
r.m.s. radius exhibit the characteristic exponential dependence upon the state
number. We also estimate the contribution of these states to the recombination
rate of Bose-Einstein condensates.
