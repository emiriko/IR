Following earlier suggestions, we now redefine our proposal for extending the
Jahn-Teller coupling beyond the framework of the electron-phonon interactions
so as to cover fermion-boson interactions on a broader energy scale. Our basic
unit is an extended "vibronic polaron" (VP), a fermion, itinerant or localized,
along with the associated distortion of its boson cloud. A fingerprint of the
itinerant unit is the helical form of VP propagation, else the occurrence of an
orbital angular momentum for the free carrier. Examples for extended VP's are
provided by LG-mode laser beams and, possibly, neutrino-meson coupled units.
Our VP theory relates to supersymmetry where it accounts for symmetry breaking,
both external and internal ones.
