We study the interaction of small amplitude, long wavelength solitary waves
in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam model with general nearest-neighbor interaction
potential. We establish global-in-time existence and stability of
counter-propagating solitary wave solutions. These solutions are close to the
linear superposition of two solitary waves for large positive and negative
values of time; for intemediate values of time these solutions describe the
interaction of two counterpropagating pulses. These solutions are stable with
respect to perturbations in $\ell^2$ and asymptotically stable with respect to
perturbations which decay exponentially at spatial $\pm \infty$.}
