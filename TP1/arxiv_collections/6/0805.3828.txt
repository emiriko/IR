The concept of integrable boundary conditions is applied to hydrodynamic type
systems. Examples of such boundary conditions for dispersionless Toda systems
are obtained. The close relation of integrable boundary conditions with
integrable reductions of multi-field systems is observed. The problem of
consistency of boundary conditions with the Hamiltonian formulation is
discussed. Examples of Hamiltonian integrable hydrodynamic type systems on a
segment and a semi-line are presented.
