The statistical multifragmentation model (SMM) has been widely used to
explain experimental data of intermediate energy heavy ion collisions. A later
entrant in the field is the canonical thermodynamic model (CTM) which is also
being used to fit experimental data. The basic physics of both the models is
the same, namely that fragments are produced according to their statistical
weights in the available phase space. However, they are based on different
statistical ensembles, and the methods of calculation are different: while the
SMM uses Monte-Carlo simulations, the CTM solves recursion relations. In this
paper we compare the predictions of the two models for a few representative
cases.
