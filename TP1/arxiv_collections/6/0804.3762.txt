We investigate here a new version of the Calculus of Inductive Constructions
(CIC) on which the proof assistant Coq is based: the Calculus of Congruent
Inductive Constructions, which truly extends CIC by building in arbitrary
first-order decision procedures: deduction is still in charge of the CIC
kernel, while computation is outsourced to dedicated first-order decision
procedures that can be taken from the shelves provided they deliver a proof
certificate. The soundness of the whole system becomes an incremental property
following from the soundness of the certificate checkers and that of the
kernel. A detailed example shows that the resulting style of proofs becomes
closer to that of the working mathematician.
