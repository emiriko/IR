We studied the shock propagation and its stability with the causal
dissipative hydrodynamics in 1+1 dimensional systems. We show that the presence
of the usual viscosity is not enough to stabilize the solution. This problem is
solved by introducing an additional viscosity which is related to the
coarse-graining scale of the theory.
