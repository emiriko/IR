We calculate triangle anomalies for fermions with non-canonical scaling
dimensions. The most well known example of such fermions (aka unfermions)
occurs in Seiberg duality where the matching of anomalies (including mesinos
with scaling dimensions between 3/2 and 5/2) is a crucial test of duality. By
weakly gauging the non-local action for an unfermion, we calculate the one-loop
three-current amplitude. Despite the fact that there are more graphs with more
complicated propagators and vertices, we find that the calculation can be
completed in a way that nearly parallels the usual case. We show that the
anomaly factor for fermionic unparticles is independent of the scaling
dimension and identical to that for ordinary fermions. This can be viewed as a
confirmation that unparticle actions correctly capture the physics of conformal
fixed point theories like Banks-Zaks or SUSY QCD.
