We use the regularized kernel polynomial method (RKPM) to numerically study
the effect disorder on a single layer of graphene. This accurate numerical
method enables us to study very large lattices with millions of sites, and
hence is almost free of finite size errors. Within this approach, both weak and
strong disorder regimes are handled on the same footing. We study the
tight-binding model with on-site disorder, on the honeycomb lattice. We find
that in the weak disorder regime, the Dirac fermions remain extended and their
velocities decrease as the disorder strength is increased. However, if the
disorder is strong enough, there will be a {\em mobility edge} separating {\em
localized states around the Fermi point}, from the remaining extended states.
This is in contrast to the scaling theory of localization which predicts that
all states are localized in two-dimensions (2D).
