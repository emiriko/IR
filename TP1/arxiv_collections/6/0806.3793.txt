We follow the line of reasoning that hidden broken symmetries are the root of
quantum oscillations observed in underdoped superconductors and examine the
role of bilayer splitting and incommensuration. This is a view that eschews the
notion of a featureless Mott liquid as the source of complexity. Instead, our
view is grounded in a conventional Fermi surface and quasiparticles. We show
that bilayer splitting and/or incommensurate $d$-density wave order can lead to
many interesting results, in particular a splitting of the main frequency of
the quantum oscillations.
