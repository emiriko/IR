We study possibility of efficient reflection of very cold neutrons (VCN) from
powders of nanoparticles. In particular, we measured the scattering of VCN at a
powder of diamond nanoparticles as a function of powder sample thickness,
neutron velocity and scattering angle. We observed extremely intense scattering
of VCN even off thin powder samples. This agrees qualitatively with the model
of independent nanoparticles at rest. We show that this intense scattering
would allow us to use nanoparticle powders very efficiently as the very first
reflectors for neutrons with energies within a complete VCN range up to
$10^{-4}$ eV.
