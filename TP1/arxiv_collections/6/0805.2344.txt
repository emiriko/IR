Effects of strong final-state interactions in the superscaling properties of
neutral-current quasielastic neutrino cross sections are investigated using the
Relativistic Impulse Approximation as guidance. First- and second-kind scaling
are analyzed for neutrino beam energies ranging from 1 to 2 GeV for the cases
of 12C, 16O and 40Ca. Different detection angles of the outgoing nucleon are
considered in order to sample various nucleon energy regimes. Scaling of the
second kind is shown to be very robust. Validity of first-kind scaling is found
to be linked to the kinematics of the process. Superscaling still prevails even
in the presence of very strong final-state interactions, provided that some
kinematical restrains are kept, and the conditions under which superscaling can
be applied to predict neutral-current quasielastic neutrino scattering are
determined.
