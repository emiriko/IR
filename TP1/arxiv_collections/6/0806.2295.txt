We use a recently developed self-consistent GW approximation to present first
principles calculations of the conduction band spin splitting in GaAs under
[110] strain. The spin orbit interaction is taken into account as a
perturbation to the scalar relativistic hamiltonian. These are the first
calculations of conduction band spin splitting under deformation based on a
quasiparticle approach; and because the self-consistent GW scheme accurately
reproduces the relevant band parameters, it is expected to be a reliable
predictor of spin splittings. We also discuss the spin relaxation time under
[110] strain and show that it exhibits an in-plane anisotropy, which can be
exploited to obtain the magnitude and sign of the conduction band spin
splitting experimentally.
