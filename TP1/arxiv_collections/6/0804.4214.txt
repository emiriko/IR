We give a new construction of primitive idempotents of the Hecke algebras
associated with the symmetric groups. The idempotents are found as evaluated
products of certain rational functions thus providing a new version of the
fusion procedure for the Hecke algebras. We show that the normalization factors
which occur in the procedure are related to the Ocneanu--Markov trace of the
idempotents.
