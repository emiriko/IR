In this paper we consider the effects of the T-parity violating anomalous
Wess-Zumino-Witten-Term in the Littlest Higgs model. Apart from tree level
processes, the loop induced decays of the heavy mirror particles into light
standard model fermions lead to a new and rich phenomenology in particular at
breaking scales f below 1 TeV. Various processes are calculated and their
signatures at present and future colliders are discussed. As a byproduct we
find an alternative production mechanism for the Higgs boson.
