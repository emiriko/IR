The lepton flavor violating process $J/\psi\to ll' (l\neq l')$ serves as an
ideal place to probe the unparticle theory. Such process can only occur at loop
level in the Standard model (SM), so that should be very suppressed, by
contrast in unparticle scenario, it happens at tree level and its contribution
may be sizable for practical measurement. Moreover, the BESIII will offer the
largest database on $J/\psi$ which makes more accurate measurements possible.
Furthermore, for such purely leptonic decays background is relatively low and
signal would be cleaner. Our work carefully investigates the possibility of
observing such processes from both theoretical and experimental aspects.
