We demonstrate that flavor symmetries in warped geometry can provide a
natural explanation for large mixing angles and economically explain the
distinction between the quark and lepton flavor sectors. We show how to
naturally generate Majorana neutrino masses assuming a gauged a U(1)_{B-L}
symmetry broken in the UV that generates see-saw masses of the right size. This
model requires lepton minimal flavor violation (LMFV) in which only Yukawa
matrices (present on the IR brane) break the flavor symmetries. The
symmetry-breaking is transmitted to charged lepton bulk mass parameters as well
to generate the hierarchy of charged lepton masses. With LMFV, a GIM-like
mechanism prevents dangerous flavor-changing processes for charged leptons and
permits flavor-changing processes only in the presence of the neutrino Yukawa
interaction and are therefore suppressed when the overall scale for the
neutrino Yukawa matrix is slightly smaller than one in units of the curvature.
In this case the theory can be consistent with a cutoff of 10 TeV and 3 TeV
Kaluza-Klein masses.
