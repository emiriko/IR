A row of parallely ordered and coupled molecular nanoshafts is shown to
develop a shuttling transport of charges at finite temperature. The appearance
of a cu rrent without applying an external bias voltage is reported as well as
a natura l diode effect allowing unidirectional charge transport along one
field directi on while blocking the opposite direction. The zero-bias voltage
current appears above a threshold of initial thermal and/or dislocation energy.
