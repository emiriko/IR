We present evidence for entangled solid vortex matter in a glassy state in a
layered superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+y}$ containing randomly
splayed linear defects. The interlayer phase coherence--probed by the Josephson
plasma resonance--is enhanced at high temperatures, reflecting the recoupling
of vortex liquid by the defects. At low temperatures in the vortex solid state,
the interlayer coherence follows a boomerang-shaped reentrant temperature path
with an unusual low field decrease in coherence, indicative of meandering
vortices. We uncover a distinct temperature scaling between in-plane and
out-of-plane critical currents with opposing dependencies on field and time,
consistent with the theoretically proposed "splayed-glass" state.
