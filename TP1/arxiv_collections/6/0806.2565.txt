We present a new mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) based on
a strong Yukawa dynamics. We consider an SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y gauge invariant model
endowed with the usual Standard model fermion multiplets and with two massive
scalar doublets. We show that, unlike in the Standard model, EWSB is possible
even with vanishing vacuum expectation values of the scalars. Such EWSB is
achieved dynamically by means of the (presumably strong) Yukawa couplings and
manifests itself by the emergence of fermion and gauge boson masses and scalar
mass-splittings, which are expressed in a closed form in terms of the fermion
and scalar proper self-energies. The `would-be' Nambu--Goldstone bosons are
shown to be composites of both the fermions and the scalars. We demonstrate
that the simplest version of the model is compatible with basic experimental
constraints.
