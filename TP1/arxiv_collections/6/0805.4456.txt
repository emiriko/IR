Possible contributions of the bilepton to the neutrinoless double beta
$(\beta\beta)_{0\nu}$ decay in the economical 3-3-1 model are discussed. We
show that the $(\beta\beta)_{0\nu}$ decay in this model is due to both
sources--Majorana $<M_{\nu}>_{L}$ and Dirac $<M_{\nu}>_{D}$ neutrino masses. If
the mixing angle between charged gauge bosons, the standard model $W$ and
bilepton $Y$, is in range of the ratio of neutrino masses $<M_{\nu}>_{L}/<
M_{\nu}>_{D}$, both the Majorana and Dirac masses simultaneously give
contributions dominant to the decay. As results, constraints on the bilepton
mass are also given.
