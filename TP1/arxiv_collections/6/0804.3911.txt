Cytoplasmic dyneins transport cellular organelles by moving on a microtubule
filament. It has been found recently that depending on the applied force and
the concentration of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules, dynein's step
size varies. Based on these studies, we propose a simple model for dynein's
unidirectional motion taking into account the variations in its step size. We
study how the average velocity and the relative dispersion in the displacement
vary with the applied load. The model is amenable to further extensions by
inclusion of details associated with the structure and the processivity of the
molecule.
