Let $L$ be a holomorphic line bundle on a compact complex manifold $X$ of
dimension $n,$ and let $e^{-\phi}$ be a continuous metric on $L.$ Fixing a
measure $d\mu$ on $X$ gives a sequence of Hilbert spaces consisting of
holomorphic sections of tensor powers of $L.$ We prove that the corresponding
sequence of scaled Bergman measures converges, in the high tensor power limit,
to the equilibrium measure of the pair $(K,\phi),$ where $K$ is the support of
$d\mu,$ as long as $d\mu$ is stably Bernstein-Markov with respect to
$(K,\phi).$ Here the Bergman measure denotes $d\mu$ times the restriction to
the diagonal of the pointwise norm of the corresponding orthogonal projection
operator. In particular, an extension to higher dimensions is obtained of
results concerning random matrices and classical orthogonal polynomials.
