We employ the analytical results for the spatial transformation of the
electromagnetic fields to obtain and analyze explicit expressions for the
structure of the electromagnetic fields in invisibility cloaks, beam splitters,
and field concentrators. We study the efficiency of nonideal electromagnetic
cloaks and discuss the effect of scattering losses on the cloak invisibility.
