The detection of pairs of sleptons, charginos and charged higgs bosons
produced via photon-photon fusion at the LHC is studied, assuming a couple of
benchmark points of the MSSM model. Due to low cross sections, it requires
large integrated luminosity, but thanks to the striking signature of these
exclusive processes the backgrounds are low, and are well known. Very forward
proton detectors can be used to measure the photon energies, allowing for
direct determination of masses of the lightest SUSY particle, of selectrons and
smuons with a few GeV resolution. Finally, the detection and mass measurement
of quasi-stable particles predicted by the so-called sweet spot supersymmetry
is discussed.
