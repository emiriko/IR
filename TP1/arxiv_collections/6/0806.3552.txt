Using the surface tension energy put in dependence on the number of
alpha-clusters in the core in a phenomenological model representing a nucleus
as a core and a nuclear molecule on its surface leads to widening the number of
isotopes to be described from the narrow strip of beta-stability to the
isotopes with N >= Z. The number of alpha-clusters in the molecule is obtained
from the analysis of experimental binding energies and the specific density of
the core binding energy \rho and the radii are calculated. It is shown that for
the isotopes of one Z with growing A the number of alpha-clusters of the
molecule decreases mostly to 3 and \rho increases to reach a saturation value
within \rho = 2.5 \div 2.7 MeV/fm^3 at the beta - stable isotopes, so the
narrow strip of the binding energies of the beta - stable isotopes with Z <= 84
is outlined by a function of one variable Z.
