In this paper we derive the environmental spectral density for flux, phase
and charge qubits when each of them is coupled to an environment with a
resonance. From the spectral density we obtain the characteristic spontaneous
emission (relaxation) lifetimes $T_1$ for each of these qubits, and show that
there is a substantial enhancement of $T_1$ beyond the resonant frequency of
the environment.
