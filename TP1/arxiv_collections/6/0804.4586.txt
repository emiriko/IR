An occurrence of an oscillating Universe is showed using an inhomogeneous
equation of state for dark energy fluid. The Hubble parameter described
presents a periodic behavior such that early and late time acceleration are
unified under the same mechanism. Also, it is considered a coupling between
dark energy fluid, with homogeneous and constant EoS, and matter, that gives a
periodic Universe too. The possible phantom phases and future singularities are
studied in the oscillating Universe under discussion. The equivalent
scalar-tensor representation for the same oscillating Universe is presented
too.
