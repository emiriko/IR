We study thermal rectification in single-walled carbon nanohorns (SWNHs) by
using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) method. It is found that the
horns with the bigger top angles show larger asymmetric heat transport due to
the larger structural gradient distribution. This kind of gradient behavior can
be further adjusted by applying external strain on the SWNHs. After being
carefully elongated along the axial direction, the thermal rectification in the
elongated SWNHs can become more obvious than that in undeformed ones. The
maximum rectification efficiency of SWNHs is much bigger than that of carbon
nanotube intramolecular junctions.
