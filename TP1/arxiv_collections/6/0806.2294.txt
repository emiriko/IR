We use the parabolic and hyperbolic equation with fractional time derivative
to describe the subdiffusion in a system with thin membrane. We find the
Green's function and solutions of the equation for the system where the
homogeneous solution is separated by a thin membrane from the pure solvent. The
solutions were obtained for two boundary conditions where the ratio of the
concentrations at the membrane surfaces does not change in time and where the
flux flowing through the membrane is proportional to the concentration
difference between membrane surfaces. We discuss the difference between the
solutions for parabolic and hyperbolic subdiffusion equations obtained for both
boundary conditions.
