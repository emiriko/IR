We report recent STAR results on medium modification of 2- and 3-particle
correlations in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC. In particular properties of an
additional extended correlation in pseudo-rapidity (``the ridge''), not present
in p+p or d+Au collisions, are discussed. Next, the shape modification of the
away-side correlation peak at low- and intermediate-$p_T$ is investigated to
look for signals of Mach cone shock waves or \v{C}erenkov gluon emission.
