Scattering of backward volume magnetostatic spin waves from a one-dimensional
magnonic crystal, realized by a grating of shallow grooves etched into the
surface of an yttrium-iron garnet film, was experimentally studied. Rejection
frequency bands were clearly observed. The rejection efficiency and the
frequency width of the rejection bands increase with increasing groove depth. A
theoretical model based on the analogy of a spin-wave film-waveguide with a
microwave transmission line was used to interpret the obtained experimental
results.
