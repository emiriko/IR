Many generic results have been proved, especially concerning the qualitative
behaviour of solutions of partial differential equations. Recently, a new
notion of "almost always", the prevalence, has been developped for vectorial
spaces. This notion is interesting since, for example, prevalence sets are
equivalent to the full Lebesgue measure sets in finite dimensional spaces. The
purpose of this article is to adapt the generic PDE's results to the notion of
prevalence. In particular, we consider the cases where Sard-Smale theorems or
arguments of analytic perturbations of the parameters are used.
