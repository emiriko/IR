In this paper, we proved that, for a semi-stable fibration of a proper smooth
surface to a proper smooth curve over a field of positive characteristic, if
the generic fiber is ordinary, then the semi-positivity theorem holds. As an
application, we constrcuted a counterexample to Parshin's conjecture on the
Miyaoka-Yau inequality.
