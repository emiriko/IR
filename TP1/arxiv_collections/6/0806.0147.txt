We report on the magnetic excitation spectrum of the coupled spin tetrahedral
system Cu$_{2}$Te$_{2}$O$_{5}$Cl$_{2}$ using Raman scattering on single
crystals. The transition to an ordered state at T$_{N}^{Cl}$=18.2 K evidenced
from thermodynamic data leads to the evolution of distinct low-energy magnetic
excitations superimposed by a broad maximum. These modes are ascribed to
magnons with different degree of localization and a two-magnon continuum. Two
of the modes develop a substantial energy shift with decreasing temperature
similar to the order parameter of other Neel ordered systems. The other two
modes show only a negligible temperature dependence and dissolve above the
ordering temperature in a continuum of excitations at finite energies. These
observations point to a delicate interplay of magnetic inter- and
intra-tetrahedra degrees of freedom and an importance of singlet fluctuations
in describing a spin dynamics.
