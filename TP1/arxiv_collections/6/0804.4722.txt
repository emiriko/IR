It is shown that 3D part of a spherically symmetric solution in conformal
Weyl gravity interacting with Maxwell electrodynamics is a Yamabe flow as well.
The Yamabe flow describes the transition from a horn of an initial wormhole to
a 3D Euclidean space both filled with a radial electric field. It is supposed
that such transition may describe appearing/disappearing quantum wormholes in a
spacetime foam.
