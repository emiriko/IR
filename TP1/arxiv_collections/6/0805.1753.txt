The isotropic XY model $(s=1/2)$ in a transverse field, with uniform
long-range interactions among the transverse components of the spins, on the
inhomogeneous periodic chain, is studied. The model, composed of $N$ segments
with $n$ different exchange interactions and magnetic moments, is exactly
solved by introducing the integral gaussian transformation and the generalized
Jordan-Wigner transformation, which reduce the problem to the diagonalization
of a finite matrix of $n$th order. The quantum transitions induced by the
transverse field are determined by analyzing the induced magnetization of the
cell and the equation of state. The phase diagrams for the quantum transitions,
in the space generated by the transverse field and the interaction parameters,
are presented. As expected, the model presents multiple, first- and
second-order quantum transitions induced by the transverse field, and it
corresponds to an extension of the models recently considered by the authors.
Detailed results are also presented, at T=0, for the induced magnetization and
isothermal susceptibility $\chi_{T}^{zz}$ as function of the transverse field.
