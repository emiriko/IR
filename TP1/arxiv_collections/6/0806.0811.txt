The room temperature magnetoelectric effect was observed in epitaxial iron
garnet films that appeared as magnetic domain wall motion induced by electric
field. The films grown on gadolinium-gallium garnet substrates with various
crystallographic orientations were examined. The effect was observed in (210)
and (110) films and was not observed in (111) films. Dynamic observation of the
domain wall motion in 400 V voltage pulses gave the value of domain wall
velocity in the range 30-50 m/s. The same velocity was achieved in magnetic
field pulse about 50 Oe.
