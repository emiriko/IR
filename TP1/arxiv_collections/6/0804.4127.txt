We study the influence of spatially varying reaction rates on a spatial
stochastic two-species Lotka-Volterra lattice model for predator-prey
interactions using two-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations. The effects of this
quenched randomness on population densities, transient oscillations, spatial
correlations, and invasion fronts are investigated. We find that spatial
variability in the predation rate results in more localized activity patches,
which in turn causes a remarkable increase in the asymptotic population
densities of both predators and prey, and accelerated front propagation.
