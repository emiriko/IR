The medium modification of dihadron fragmentation functions in the deeply
inelastic scattering (DIS) off a large nucleus is studied within the framework
of the higher-twist expansion in the collinear factorization formalism. It is
demonstrated that the modification due to multiple parton scattering in the
nuclear medium is similar to that of the single hadron fragmentation function.
However, the conditional distribution of the associated hadron given by the
ratio of dihadron to single hadron fragmentation function shows only slight
modification. The final results depend modestly on the nuclear density
distribution. Comparisons with the experimental results on two hadron
correlations as obtained by the HERMES collaboration at DESY are presented.
