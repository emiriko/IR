We have searched for bound states in the pion-Lambda-nucleon system by
solving the nonrelativistic Faddeev equations, as well as a relativistic
version, with input separable pion-nucleon, pion-Lambda, and Lambda-nucleon
interactions. A bound-state solution, driven by the Delta(1232) and Sigma(1385)
p-wave meson-baryon resonances, was found in the channel (I,JP)=(3/2,2+),
provided the Lambda lab momentum at which the Lambda-nucleon S=1,L=0,J=1 phase
shift becomes negative is larger than about 750-800 MeV/c. Other strange and
charmed pion-baryon-baryon systems that might have bound states of a similar
nature are listed.
