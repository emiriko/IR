The so-called supersymmetric flavour and CP problems are deeply related to
the origin of flavour and hence to the origin of the SM Yukawa couplings
themselves. We show that realistic SU(3) flavour symmetries with spontaneous CP
violation reproducing correctly the SM Yukawa matrices can simultaneously solve
both problems without ad hoc modifications of the SUSY model. We analyze the
leptonic electric dipole moments and lepton flavour violation processes in
these models. We show that the electron EDM and the decay mu -> e gamma are
naturally within reach of the proposed experiments if the sfermion masses are
measurable at the LHC.
