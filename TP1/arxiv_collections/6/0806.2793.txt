The present status of some selected topics on tau physics is presented:
charged-current universality tests, bounds on lepton-flavour violation, the
determination of alpha_s from the inclusive tau hadronic width, the measurement
of |V_{us}| through the Cabibbo-suppressed decays of the tau, and the
theoretical description of the "tau -> nu_tau K pi" spectrum.
