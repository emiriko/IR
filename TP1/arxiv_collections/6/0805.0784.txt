We determine the time evolution of fluctuations of the Polyakov loop after a
quench into the deconfined phase of SU(3) gauge theory from a simple classical
relativistic Lagrangian. We compare the structure factors, which indicate
spinodal decomposition followed by relaxation, to those obtained via Markov
Chain Monte Carlo techniques in SU(3) lattice gauge theory. We find that the
time when the structure factor peaks diverges like $\sim 1/k^2$ in the
long-wavelength limit. This is due to formation of competing Z(3) domains for
configurations where the Polyakov loop exhibits non-perturbatively large
variations in space, which delay thermalization of long wavelength modes. For
realistic temperatures, and away from the extreme weak-coupling limit, we find
that even modes with $k$ on the order of $T$ experience delayed thermalization.
Relaxation times of very long wavelength modes are found to be on the order of
the size of the system; thus, the dynamics of competing domains should
accompany the hydrodynamic description of the deconfined vacuum.
