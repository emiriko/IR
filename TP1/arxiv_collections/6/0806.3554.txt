We study the heavy-heavy-light quark ($QQq$) potential in SU(3) quenched
lattice QCD, and discuss one of the roles of the finite-mass valence quark in
the inter-quark potential. Monte Carlo simulations are performed with the
standard gauge action on the $16^4$ lattice at $\beta =6.0$ and the
$O(a)$-improved Wilson fermion action at four hopping parameters. For
statistical improvement, the gauge configuration is fixed with the Coulomb
gauge. We calculate the potential energy of $QQq$ systems as a function of the
inter-heavy-quark distance $R$ in the range of $R \le$ 0.8 fm. The $QQq$
potential is well described with a Coulomb plus linear potential, and the
effective string tension between the two heavy quarks is significantly smaller
than the string tension $\sigma \simeq 0.89$ GeV/fm. It would generally hold
that the effect of the finite-mass valence quark reduces the inter-two-quark
confinement force in baryons.
