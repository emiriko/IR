In this paper, the electromagnetic mass differences of heavy hadrons are
discussed, while ignoring the relevant hyperfine interactions. The effects of
one-photon exchange interaction and up-down quark mass difference are
parameterized. Two mass difference equations 2\Sigma_c^+ - (\Sigma_c^{++} +
\Sigma_c^0) = 2\Sigma_b^0 - (\Sigma_b^+ + \Sigma_b^-) and (\Xi_{cc}^+ -
\Xi_{cc}^{++}) + (\Xi_{bb}^- - \Xi_{bb}^{0}) =2(\Xi_{bc}^0 - \Xi_{bc}^{+}) for
the heavy baryons are obtained. In addition, the masses of \Sigma_b^0, \Xi_b^0,
and \Xi_{cc}^{++} are predicted based on the known experimental data.
