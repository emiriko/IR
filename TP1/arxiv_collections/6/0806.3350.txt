We consider variation of energy of the light-like particle in Riemann
space-time, find lagrangian, canonical momenta and forces. Equations of the
critical curve are obtained by the nonzero energy integral variation in
accordance with principles of the calculus of variations in mechanics. This
method is shown to not lead to violation of conformity of varied curve to the
null path in contradistinction of the interval variation. Though found
equations are differ from standard form of geodesics equations, for the
Schwarzschild space-time their solutions coincide with each other to within
parameter of differentiation.
