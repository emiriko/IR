The pi0 meson has been a crucial proble for observing jet quenching in
ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC. Measurements of the eta meson
in the same collisions have also shed light on a possible dependence of the
observed suppression on the particle species. The preliminary pi0 nuclear
modification factor R_AA from the 2004 RHIC run allowed a first systematic
comparison between a precise measurement with high statistics and theoretical
calculations, constraining model parameters such as the initial gluon density
dN^g/dy, and the transport coefficient qhat. The final pi0 spectra and R_AA are
shown as well as the first eta results obtained with both PHENIX
electromagnetic calorimeters.
