In the present contribution we introduce a strategy to quantify the
performance of modern infrared and collinear safe jet clustering algorithms in
processes which involve the reconstruction of heavy object decays. We determine
optimal choices for fictional narrow $Z'\to q\bar{q}$ and $H\to gg$ over a
range of masses, providing examples of simple quark-jet and gluon-jet samples
respectively. We show also that our estimates are robust against the presence
of high-luminosity pileup.
