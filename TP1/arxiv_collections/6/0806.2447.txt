This paper demonstrates how to add a measurement operator to quantum
lambda-calculi. A proof of the consistency of the semantics is given through a
proof of confluence presented in a sufficiently general way to allow this
technique to be used for other languages. The method described here may be
applied to probabilistic rewrite systems in general, and to add measurement to
more complex languages such as QML or Lineal, which is the subject of further
research.
