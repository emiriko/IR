A consistent classical mechanics formulation is presented in such a way that,
under quantization, it gives a noncommutative quantum theory with interesting
new features. The Dirac formalism for constrained Hamiltonian systems is
strongly used, and the object of noncommutativity ${\mathbf \theta}^{ij}$ plays
a fundamental rule as an independent quantity. The presented classical theory,
as its quantum counterpart, is naturally invariant under the rotation group
$SO(D)$.
