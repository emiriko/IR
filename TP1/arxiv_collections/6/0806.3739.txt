Answering a question of Cameron, Pretzel and Siemons proved that every
integer partition of $n\ge 2(k+3)(k+1)$ can be reconstructed from its set of
$k$-deletions. We describe a new reconstruction algorithm that lowers this
bound to $n\ge k^2+2k$ and present examples showing that this bound is best
possible.
