This article introduces a dynamical Ginzburg-Landau phase
transition/separation model for the mixture of liquid helium-3 and helium-4,
using a unified dynamical Ginzburg-Landau model for equilibrium phase
transitions. The analysis of this model leads to three critical length scales
L1 < L2 < L3, detailed theoretical phase diagrams and transition properties
with different length scales of the container.
