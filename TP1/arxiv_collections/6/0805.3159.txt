We demonstrate that the physical mechanism behind electroresistive switching
in oxide Schottky systems is electroformation, as in insulating oxides.
Negative resistance shown by the hysteretic current-voltage curves proves that
impact ionization is at the origin of the switching. Analyses of the
capacitance-voltage and conductance-voltage curves through a simple model show
that an atomic rearrangement is involved in the process. Switching in these
systems is a bulk effect, not strictly confined at the interface but at the
charge space region.
