We consider supersymmetric Wilson loops of the variety constructed by
Drukker, Giombi, Ricci, and Trancanelli, whose spatial contours lie on a
two-sphere. Working to second order in the 't Hooft coupling in planar N=4
Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory (SYM), we compute the vacuum expectation value
of a wavy-latitude and of a loop composed of two longitudes. We evaluate the
resulting integrals numerically and find that the results are consistent with
the zero-instanton sector calculation of Wilson loops in 2-d Yang-Mills on S^2
performed by Bassetto and Griguolo. We also consider the connected correlator
of two distinct latitudes to third order in the 't Hooft coupling in planar N=4
SYM. We compare the result in the limit where the latitudes become coincident
to a perturbative calculation in 2-d Yang-Mills on S^2 using a light-cone
Wu-Mandelstam-Leibbrandt prescription. We are not able to calculate the SYM
result at the required order in the separation between the latitudes necessary
for a match with 2-d Yang-Mills; the result, however, does not preclude such a
match.
