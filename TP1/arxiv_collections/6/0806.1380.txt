From the study of a functional equation of Gibbs measures we calculate the
limiting free energy of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass model at a
particular value of (low) temperature. This implies the following lower bound
for the ground state energy $\epsilon_0$ \[\epsilon_0\geq -0.7833\cdots,\]
close to the replica symmetry breaking and numerical simulations values.
