We show that the holographic principle in quantum gravity imposes a strong
constraint on life. The degrees of freedom of an organism can be estimated
according to the theory of Boolean networks, which is constrained by the
entropy bound. Hence we can explain the languages in protein sequences or in
DNA sequences. The overall evolution of biological complexity can be
illustrated. And some general properties of protein length distributions can be
explained by a linguistic mechanism.
