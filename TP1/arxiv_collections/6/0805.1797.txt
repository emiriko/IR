The SLIM experiment at the Chacaltaya high altitude laboratory was sensitive
to nuclearites and Q-balls, which could be present in the cosmic radiation as
possible Dark Matter components. It was sensitive also to strangelets, i.e.
small lumps of Strange Quark Matter predicted at such altitudes by various
phenomenological models. The analysis of 427 m^2 of Nuclear Track Detectors
exposed for 4.22 years showed no candidate event. New upper limits on the flux
of downgoing nuclearites and Q-balls at the 90% C.L. were established. The null
result also restricts models for strangelets propagation through the Earth
atmosphere.
