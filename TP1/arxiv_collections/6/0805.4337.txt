Binding energy of the $1^-$ state (ortho-positronium) in QED is calculated
using the one-photon exchange Bethe-Salpeter equation in the Feynman and
Coulomb gauges for different coupling constants $\alpha$. Calculations show
there is a remarkable difference in values of the binding energy for different
coupling constants in these two gauges.
