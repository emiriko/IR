We show that a binary-staircase optical element can be engineered to exhibit
an effective negative index of refraction, thereby expanding the range of
optical properties theoretically available for future optoelectronic devices.
The mechanism for achieving a negative-index lens is based on exploiting the
periodicity of the surface corrugation. By designing and nanofabricating a
plano-concave binary-staircase lens in the InP/InGaAsP platform, we have
experimentally demonstrated at 1.55 microns that such negative-index concave
lenses can focus plane waves. The beam propagation in the lens was studied
experimentally and was in excellent agreement with the three-dimensional
finite-difference time-domain numerical simulations.
