We present a capacitance-voltage study for arrays of vertical InAs nanowires.
MOS capacitors are obtained by insulating the nanowires with a conformal 10nm
HfO2 layer and using a top Cr/Au metallization as one of the capacitor's
electrodes. The described fabrication and characterization technique enables a
systematic investigation of the carrier density in the nanowires as well as of
the quality of the MOS interface.
