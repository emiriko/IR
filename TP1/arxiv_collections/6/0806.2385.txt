A preliminary investigation of a large class of Hidden Valley models is
presented. These models are more challenging than those considered in
arXiv:0712.2041 [hep-ph]; although they produce a new light resonance which
decays to heavy standard model fermions, they exhibit no light dilepton
resonance. A heavy $Z'$ decaying to v-hadrons, which in turn decay mainly to
bottom quarks and tau leptons, is considered; six case studies are
investigated, using a new Monte Carlo simulation package. It is found that the
one-to-one correspondence of jets and partons is badly broken, and the
high-multiplicity heavy-flavor signal probably cannot be isolated by counting
jets, with or without heavy-flavor tags. Instead, other measures, such as
counting and correlating vertices or displaced tracks, and possibly counting of
(non-isolated) muons and use of event-shape variables, should be combined with
scalar transverse energy and/or missing transverse energy to reduce
backgrounds. Within the resulting sample, searches for the v-pion mass
resonance in both di-jet and single-jet invariant mass can help confirm a
signal. The best observable in a perfect calorimeter seems to be single-jet
invariant mass for jets of larger radius ($R$=0.7), although this needs further
study in a realistic setting. A more detailed signal-to-background study is
needed as a next step, but will face the difficulty of estimating the various
high-multiplicity backgrounds.
