We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the second-order correlation
function of the characteristic polynomial of a Hermitian Wigner matrix at the
edge of the spectrum. We show that the suitably rescaled second-order
correlation function is asymptotically given by the Airy kernel, thereby
generalizing the well-known result for the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE).
Moreover, we obtain similar results for real-symmetric Wigner matrices.
