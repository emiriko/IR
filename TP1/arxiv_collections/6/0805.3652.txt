In the present paper we refute the criticism advanced in a recent preprint by
Figueiredo et al [1] about the possible application of the $q$-generalized
Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to a paradigmatic long-range-interacting many-body
classical Hamiltonian system, the so-called Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF) model.
We exhibit that, contrary to what is claimed by these authors and in accordance
with our previous results, $q$-Gaussian-like curves are possible and real
attractors for a certain class of initial conditions, namely the one which
produces nontrivial longstanding quasi-stationary states before the arrival,
only for finite size, to the thermal equilibrium.
