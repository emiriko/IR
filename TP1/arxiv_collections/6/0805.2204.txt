The visualization of chiral p-wave superfluidity in Fermi gases near p-wave
Feshbach resonances is theoretically examined. It is proposed that the
superfluidity becomes detectable in the entire BCS-BEC regimes through (i)
vortex visualization by the density depletion inside the vortex core and (ii)
intrinsic angular momentum in vortex free states. It is revealed that both (i)
and (ii) are closely connected with the Majorana zero energy mode of the vortex
core and the edge mode, which survive until the strong coupling BCS regime is
approached from the weak coupling limit and vanish in the BEC regime.
