MBE-grown, 5 nm-thick annealed Ga0.95Mn0.05As films with Tc~90K demonstrate
transition from metallic to insulating state below To~10K, where sheet
resistances Rsh~h/e2 and both longitudinal Rxx and transverse Rxy components
become comparable. Below metal-insulator transition we found giant anisotropic
magnetoresistance (GAMR), which depends on orientation of magnetization to
crystallographic axes and manifests itself in positive magnetoresistance near
50% for Rxx at T=1.7K, H//[110] crystallographic direction and parallel to
current in contrast to smaller and negative magnetoresistance for H//
direction. We connect GAMR with anisotropic spin-orbit interaction resulting in
formation of high- and low- resistance states with different localization along
non-equivalent easy axes.
