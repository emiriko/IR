This paper concerns the relationship between locally homogeneous geometric
structures on topological surfaces and the moduli of polystable Higgs bundles
on Riemann surfaces, due to Hitchin and Simpson. In particular we discuss the
uniformization of Riemann surfaces by hyperbolic geometry from this viewpoint,
and survey more recent developments in this theory.
