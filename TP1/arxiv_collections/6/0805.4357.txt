Dynamic nuclear polarization transfers spin polarization from electrons to
nuclei. We have achieved this by a new method, simultaneously exciting
transitions of electronic and nuclear spins. The efficiency of this technique
improves with increasing magnetic field. Experimental results are shown for
N@C60 with continuous-wave microwaves, which can be expected to produce even
higher polarization than the corresponding pulsed techniques for electron spins
greater than 1/2. The degree of nuclear polarization in this case can be easily
monitored through the intensities of the well resolved hyperfine components in
the EPR spectrum. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time is orders of
magnitude longer than that of the electrons.
