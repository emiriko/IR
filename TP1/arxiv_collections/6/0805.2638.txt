Dipole and quadrupole solitons in a two-dimensional optically induced
defocus- ing photonic lattice are theoretically predicted and experimentally
observed. It is shown that in-phase nearest-neighbor dipole and out-of-phase
next-nearest-neighbor dipoles exist and can be stable in the intermediate
intensity regime. The other types of dipoles are always unstable. In-phase
nearest-neighbor quadrupoles are also numerically obtained, and may also be
linearly stable. Out-of-phase, nearest-neighbor quadrupoles are found to be
typically unstable. These numerical results are found to be aligned with the
main predictions obtained analytically in the discrete nonlinear Schroedinger
model. Finally, experimental results are presented for both dipole and
quadrupole structures, indicating that self-trapping of such structures in the
defocusing lattice can be realized for the length of the nonlinear crystal (10
mm).
