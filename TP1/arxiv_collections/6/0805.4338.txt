Bayesian hypothesis testing is investigated when the prior probabilities of
the hypotheses, taken as a random vector, are quantized. Nearest neighbor and
centroid conditions are derived using mean Bayes risk error as a distortion
measure for quantization. A high-resolution approximation to the
distortion-rate function is also obtained. Human decision making in segregated
populations is studied assuming Bayesian hypothesis testing with quantized
priors.
