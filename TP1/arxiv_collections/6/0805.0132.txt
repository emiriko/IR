We compute the dynamics of excitation and two-body correlation for two-level
"pseudoatoms" in a 1D lattice. We adopt a simplified model where pair
excitation within a finite range is perfectly blocked. Each superatom is
initially in the ground state, and then subjected to an external driving laser
with Rabi frequency satisfying a Poissonian distribution, mimicking the
scenario as in Rydberg gases. We find that two-body quantum correlation drops
very fast with the distance between pseudoatoms. However, the total correlation
decays slowly even at large distance. Our results may be useful to the
understanding of Rydberg gases in the strong blockade regime.
