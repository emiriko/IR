We study the radiative lepton flavor violating l_1->l_2\gamma decays in the
two Higgs doublet model with localized new Higgs doublet in the Randall Sundrum
background. We estimate the contributions of the KK modes of new Higgs bosons
and left (right) handed charged lepton doublets (singlets) on the branching
ratios of the decays considered. We observe that there is an enhancement in the
branching ratios with the addition of new Higgs boson and lepton KK modes.
