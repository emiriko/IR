We discuss two dimensional N-extended supersymmetry in Euclidean signature
and its R-symmetry. For N=2, the R-symmetry is SO(2)\times SO(1,1), so that
only an A-twist is possible. To formulate a B-twist, or to construct Euclidean
N=2 models with H-flux so that the target geometry is generalised Kahler, it is
necessary to work with a complexification of the sigma models. These issues are
related to the obstructions to the existence of non-trivial twisted chiral
superfields in Euclidean superspace.
