The first-order formulation of the principal sigma model with a Lie group
target space is performed. By using the dualisation of the algebra and the
field content of the theory the field equations which are solely written in
terms of the field strengths are realized through an extended symmetry algebra
parametrization. The structure of this symmetry algebra is derived so that it
generates the realization of the field equations in a Bianchi identity of the
current derived from the extended parametrization.
