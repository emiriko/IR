Magnetotransport measurements have been performed on Fibonacci lateral
superlattices (FLSLs) -- two-dimensional electron gases subjected to a weak
potential modulation arranged in the Fibonacci sequence, LSLLSLS..., with
L/S=tau (the golden ratio). Complicated commensurability oscillation (CO) is
observed, which can be accounted for as a superposition of a series of COs each
arising from a sinusoidal modulation representing the characteristic length
scale of one of the self-similar generations in the Fibonacci sequence.
Individual CO components can be separated out from the magnetoresistance trace
by performing a numerical Fourier band-pass filter. From the analysis of the
amplitude of a single-component CO thus extracted, the magnitude of the
corresponding Fourier component in the potential modulation can be evaluated.
By examining all the Fourier contents observed in the magnetoresistance trace,
the profile of the modulated potential seen by the electrons can be
reconstructed with some remaining ambiguity about the interrelation of the
phase between different components.
