We present here an exact version of our response (dated April 27) to
Wernsdorfer's correspondence submitted to Nature Physics on March 31, 2008.
After consultation with a referee, Nature Physics chose not publish any part of
this exchange. We would therefore like to point out that our original study has
now been considered favorably by four separate referees chosen by Nature
Physics. Unfortunately, Wernsdorfer subsequently posted two further variations
of his correspondence on this archive (arXiv:0804.1246v1 and
arXiv:0804.1246v2). We note that aspects of the most recent posting (dated
after submission of our response) contradict the version submitted to Nature
Physics. However, none of the revisions add weight to Wernsdorfer's original
correspondence.
