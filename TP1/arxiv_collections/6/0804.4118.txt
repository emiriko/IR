We show that any number of parties can coherently exchange any one pure
quantum state for another, without communication, given prior shared
entanglement. Two applications of this fact to the study of multi-prover
quantum interactive proof systems are given. First, we prove that there exists
a one-round two-prover quantum interactive proof system for which no finite
amount of shared entanglement allows the provers to implement an optimal
strategy. More specifically, for every fixed input string, there exists a
sequence of strategies for the provers, with each strategy requiring more
entanglement than the last, for which the probability for the provers to
convince the verifier to accept approaches 1. It is not possible, however, for
the provers to convince the verifier to accept with certainty with a finite
amount of shared entanglement. The second application is a simple proof that
multi-prover quantum interactive proofs can be transformed to have near-perfect
completeness by the addition of one round of communication.
