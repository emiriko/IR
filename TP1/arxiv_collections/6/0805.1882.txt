The CMS detector is under construction for imminent operation at the Large
Hadron Collider at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland. The installation and
commissioning is performed in a surface hall. Thereafter, all the main heavy
elements of the detector, the disks and wheels, are lowered in the experimental
cavern starting at the end of 2006. The superconducting magnet of CMS requires
testing before lowering, providing a unique opportunity to operate all the
sub-detectors and sub-systems together and to take data with cosmic muons as an
important commissioning test. This is called the MTCC - Magnet Test and Cosmic
Challenge. The participating systems include a 60 degree sector of the Muon
System comprising gas detectors like the drift tubes (DTs), Cathode Strip
Chambers (CSCs) and Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs), both in the Barrel and
Endcaps. The tracking system comprises elements of the Silicon-Strip Tracker,
and parts of the Electromagnetic and Hadronic Calorimeter detected energy
depositions of the traversing muons. In this article, a description of the
operational experience and the lessons learnt are presented.
