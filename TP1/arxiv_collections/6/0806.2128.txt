We present here high precision magnetisation measurements in polycrystalline
$YBa_2Cu_3O_{x}$ samples, with oxygen content ranging from $x=6.19$ to
$x=7.00$. By analysing the temperature derivative of the susceptibility, we
found in the underdoped superconducting samples a singular point at a
temperature corresponding to $T_{mag}$, the temperature below which polarised
neutrons experiments have evidenced a symmetry breaking. We believe that this
is a thermodynamic indication for the existence of a phase transition in the
pseudogap state of underdoped $YBa_2Cu_3O_{x}$.
