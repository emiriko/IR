In this paper, we study transmission line resonances in high $T_C$ dc SQUIDs.
These resonances are exhibited in the characteristics of SQUIDs which are
fabricated on substrates with high dielectric constant, such as strontium
titanate. The power balance equation is analytically derived both for symmetric
and asymmetric SQUIDs. Using this, we investigate SQUID current - voltage
$I(V)$, voltage - flux $V(\Phi)$ and voltage modulation $\Delta V$
characteristics.
