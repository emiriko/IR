The interface for the next generation of Unmanned Vehicle Systems should be
an interface with multi-modal displays and input controls. Then, the role of
the interface will not be restricted to be a support of the interactions
between the ground operator and vehicles. Interface must take part in the
interaction management too. In this paper, we show that recent works in
pragmatics and philosophy provide a suitable theoretical framework for the next
generation of UV System's interface. We concentrate on two main aspects of the
collaborative model of interaction based on acceptance: multi-strategy approach
for communicative act generation and interpretation and communicative
alignment.
