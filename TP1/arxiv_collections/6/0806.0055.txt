The partly symmetric real Ginibre ensemble consists of matrices formed as
linear combinations of real symmetric and real anti-symmetric Gaussian random
matrices. Such matrices typically have both real and complex eigenvalues. For a
fixed number of real eigenvalues, an earlier work has given the explicit form
of the joint eigenvalue probability density function. We use this to derive a
Pfaffian formula for the corresponding summed up generalized partition
function. This Pfaffian formula allows the probability that there are exactly
$k$ eigenvalues to be written as a determinant with explicit entries. It can be
used too to give the explicit form of the correlation functions, provided
certain skew orthogonal polynomials are computed. This task is accomplished in
terms of Hermite polynomials, and allows us to proceed to analyze various
scaling limits of the correlations, including that in which the matrices are
only weakly non-symmetric.
