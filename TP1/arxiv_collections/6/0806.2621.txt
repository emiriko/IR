A single-site dynamical mean field study of a three band model with the
rotationally invariant interactions appropriate to the t_2g levels of a
transition metal oxide reveals a quantum phase transition between a
paramagnetic metallic phase and an incoherent metallic phase with frozen
moments. The Mott transitions occurring at electron densities n=2,3 per site
take place inside the frozen moment phase. The critical line separating the two
phases is characterized by a self energy with the frequency dependence
\Sigma(\omega)\sim \sqrt{\omega} and a broad quantum critical regime. The
findings are discussed in the context of the power law observed in the optical
conductivity of SrRuO_3.
