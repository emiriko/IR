We reformulate the result for the entropy production given in Phys. Rev.
Lett. 98, 080602 (2007) in terms of the relative entropy of microscopic
trajectories. By a combination with the Crook's theorem, we identify the path
variables that are sufficient to fully identify irreversibility. We show that
work saturates the relative entropy, and derive the entropy production for
stochastic descriptions.
