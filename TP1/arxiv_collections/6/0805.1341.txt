We use a nanowire quantum dot to probe high-frequency current fluctuations in
a nearby quantum point contact. The fluctuations drive charge transitions in
the quantum dot, which are measured in real-time with single-electron detection
techniques. The quantum point contact (GaAs) and the quantum dot (InAs) are
fabricated in different material systems, which indicates that the interactions
are mediated by photons rather than phonons. The large energy scales of the
nanowire quantum dot allow radiation detection in the long-wavelength infrared
regime.
