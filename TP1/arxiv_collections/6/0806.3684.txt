We built a model of the daily temperature based on a diffusion process and
address to extreme values not taken into account in the literature on this kind
of models. We first study, using non parametric tools, the trends on mean and
variance. In a second step we estimate a stationary model first non
parametrically and then using likelihood methods. Extreme values are taken into
account in the estimation of model and to obtain a definitive estimation we use
in a specific framework extreme theory for diffusions. A test of suitable model
by simulation is done.
