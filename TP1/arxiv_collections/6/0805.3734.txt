The dynamics of a many-body system coupled to an external environment
represents a fundamentally important problem. To this class of open quantum
systems pertains the study of energy transport and dissipation, dephasing,
quantum measurement and quantum information theory, phase transitions driven by
dissipative effects, etc. Here, we discuss in detail an extension of
time-dependent current-density-functional theory (TDCDFT), we named stochastic
TDCDFT [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 98}, 226403 (2007)], that allows the description
of such problems from a microscopic point of view. We discuss the assumptions
of the theory, its relation to a density matrix formalism, and the limitations
of the latter in the present context. In addition, we describe a numerically
convenient way to solve the corresponding equations of motion, and apply this
theory to the dynamics of a 1D gas of excited bosons confined in a harmonic
potential and in contact with an external bath.
