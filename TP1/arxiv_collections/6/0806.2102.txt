We study the possibility of preventing finite-time disentanglement caused by
dissipation by making use of "non-local quantum error correction. This is made
in comparison of previous results, where was shown that "local" quantum error
correction can delay disentanglement, but can also cause entanglement sudden
death when is not originally present.
