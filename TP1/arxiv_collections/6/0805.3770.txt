A universal quantum work relation is proved for isolated time-dependent
Hamiltonian systems in a magnetic field as the consequence of
microreversibility. This relation involves a functional of an arbitrary
observable. The quantum Jarzynski equality is recovered in the case this
observable vanishes. The Green-Kubo formula and the Casimir-Onsager reciprocity
relations are deduced thereof in the linear response regime.
