In the nano era in integrated circuit fabrication technologies, the
performance variability due to statistical process and circuit parameter
variations is becoming more and more significant. Considerable effort has been
expended in the EDA community during the past several years in trying to cope
with the so-called statistical timing problem. Most of this effort has been
aimed at generalizing the static timing analyzers to the statistical case. In
this paper, we take a pragmatic approach in pursuit of making the Monte Carlo
method for timing yield estimation practically feasible. The Monte Carlo method
is widely used as a golden reference in assessing the accuracy of other timing
yield estimation techniques. However, it is generally believed that it can not
be used in practice for estimating timing yield as it requires too many costly
full circuit simulations for acceptable accuracy. In this paper, we present a
novel approach to constructing an improvedMonte Carlo estimator for timing
yield which provides the same accuracy as the standard Monte Carlo estimator,
but at a cost of much fewer full circuit simulations. This improved estimator
is based on a novel combination of a variance reduction technique, importance
sampling, and a stochastic generalization of the logical effort formalism for
cheap but approximate delay estimation. The results we present demonstrate that
our improved yield estimator achieves the same accuracy as the standard Monte
Carlo estimator at a cost reduction reaching several orders of magnitude.
