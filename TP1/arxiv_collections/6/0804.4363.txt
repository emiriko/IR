We present a system size and energy dependence of $\phi$ meson production in
Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=62.4 GeV and 200 GeV measured by
the STAR experiment at RHIC. We find that the number of participant scaled
$\phi$ meson yields in heavy ion collisions over that of p+p collisions are
larger than 1 and increase with collision energy. We compare the results with
those of open-strange particles and discuss the physics implication.
