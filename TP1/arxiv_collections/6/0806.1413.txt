We survey recent results on the topological complexity of context-free
omega-languages which form the second level of the Chomsky hierarchy of
languages of infinite words. In particular, we consider the Borel hierarchy and
the Wadge hierarchy of non-deterministic or deterministic context-free
omega-languages. We study also decision problems, the links with the notions of
ambiguity and of degrees of ambiguity, and the special case of omega-powers.
