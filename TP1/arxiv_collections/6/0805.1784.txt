We discuss on the pairing mechanism of fermions with mismatch in their fermi
momenta due to a mass asymmetry. Using a variational ansatz for the ground
state we also discuss the BCS -BEC crossover of this system. It is shown that
the breached pairing solution with a single fermi surface is stable in the BEC
regime. We also include the temperatures effect on the fermion pairing within
an approximation that is valid for temperatures much below the critical
temperature.
