Using the linearity property of the Mullins-Herring equation when the
velocity is zero with a Gaussian noise, we obtain an analytic form for the
global mean-square surface width and height-height correlation function. This
can be used to read the critical exponents in any dimension. In particular for
d=1 we show that although the surface is super rough the system exhibits
Family-Vicsek scaling behavior.
