Quantum key distribution (QKD) has the potential for widespread real-world
applications. To date no secure long-distance experiment has demonstrated the
truly practical operation needed to move QKD from the laboratory to the real
world due largely to limitations in synchronization and poor detector
performance. Here we report results obtained using a fully automated, robust
QKD system based on the Bennett Brassard 1984 protocol (BB84) with low-noise
superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) and decoy levels.
Secret key is produced with unconditional security over a record 144.3 km of
optical fibre, an increase of more than a factor of five compared to the
previous record for unconditionally secure key generation in a practical QKD
system.
