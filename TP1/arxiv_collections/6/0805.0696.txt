The low-frequency Raman spectra of Na-and Cs-DNA water solutions have been
studied to determine the mode of counterion vibrations with respect to
phosphate groups of the DNA double helix. The obtained spectra are
characterized by the water band near 180 cm-1 and by several DNA bands near 100
cm-1. The main difference between Na- and Cs-DNA spectra is observed in case of
the band 100 cm-1. In Cs-DNA spectra this band has about twice higher intensity
than in Na-DNA spectra. The comparison of obtained spectra with the calculated
frequencies of Na- and Cs-DNA conformational vibrations [Perepelytsya S.M.,
Volkov S.N. Eur. Phys. J. E. 24, 261 (2007)] show that the band 100 cm-1 in the
spectra of Cs-DNA is formed by the modes of both H-bond stretching vibrations
and vibrations of caesium counterions, while in Na-DNA spectra the band 100
cm-1 is formed by the mode of H-bond stretching vibrations only. The modes of
sodium counterion vibrations have a frequency 180 cm-1, and they do not rise
above the water band. Thus, the increase in intensity of the band 100 cm-1 in
the spectra of Cs-DNA as compared with Na-DNA is caused by the mode of
ion-phosphate vibrations.
