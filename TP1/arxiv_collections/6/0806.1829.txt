The objective of the paper is to asses the specific spectral scaling
properties of magnetic reconnection associated fluctuations/turbulence at the
Earthward and tailward outflow regions observed simultaneously by the Cluster
and Double Star (TC-2) spacecraft on September 26, 2005. Systematic comparisons
of spectral characteristics, including variance anisotropy and scale-dependent
spectral anisotropy features in wave vector space were possible due to the
well-documented reconnection events, occurring between the positions of Cluster
(X = -14--16 $R_e$) and TC-2 (X = -6.6 $R_e$). Another factor of key importance
is that the magnetometers on the spacecraft are similar. The comparisons
provide further evidence for asymmetry of physical processes in
Earthward/tailward reconnection outflow regions. Variance anisotropy and
spectral anisotropy angles estimated from the multi-scale magnetic fluctuations
in the tailward outflow region show features which are characteristic for
magnetohydrodynamic cascading turbulence in the presence of a local mean
magnetic field. The multi-scale magnetic fluctuations in the Earthward outflow
region are exhibiting more power, lack of variance and scale dependent
anisotropies, but also having larger anisotropy angles. In this region the
magnetic field is more dipolar, the main processes driving turbulence are flow
breaking/mixing, perhaps combined with turbulence ageing and non-cascade
related multi-scale energy sources.
