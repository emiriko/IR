We model the continuous material component of the Kerr-Newman disk as a
discrete distribution of superluminal particles undergoing quantized orbital
rotation with velocity $v/c = a/r$. By matching the discrete distribution in
the continuous limit with the Kerr disk densities, we derive the quantized
energy and momentum states of the superluminal orbits. We conclude that the
Kerr-Newman disk may be modeled as a Dirac sea of these superluminal states and
we identify possible excited states of the disk.
