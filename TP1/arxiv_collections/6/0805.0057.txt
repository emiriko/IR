We present a new analysis on the quantum control for a quantum system coupled
to a quantum probe. This analysis is based on the coherent control for the
quantum system and a hyperthesis that the probe can be prepared in specified
initial states. The results show that a quantum system can be manipulated by
probe state-dependent coherent control. In this sense, the present analysis
provides a new control scheme which combines the coherent control and state
preparation technology.
