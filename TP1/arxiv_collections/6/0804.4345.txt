We propose a "thought technique" for detecting Gravitational Waves using
Einstein-Podolski-Rosen photon Entangled States. GWs decohere the entangled
photon pairs, introduce a relative rotation and de-synchronize Alice and Bob's
reference frames thus reducing the measured non-locality of correlated quanta
described by Bell's inequalities. Gravitational Waves, distorting quantum
encryption key statistics away from a pure white noise, act then as shadow
eavesdroppers. The deviation from the intrinsic white-noise randomness of a
Quantum Key Distribution process can reveal the presence of a gravitational
wave by analyzing the emerging color distortions in the key. Photon entangled
states provide the key advantage of revealing the polarization rotation
introduced by GWs without the need of previously fixed reference frames
