We present a model in which a 3-brane is embedded in a warped 5-dimensional
background with a dilaton and a Kalb-Ramond 2-form. We show that it is possible
to find static solutions of the form of charged dS/AdS-like black hole which
could have a negative mass parameter. The motion of the 3-brane in this bulk
generates an effective 4-dimensional bouncing cosmology induced by the negative
dark radiation term. This model avoids the instabilities that arises for
previous non-singular braneworld cosmologies in a Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m-AdS
bulk.}
