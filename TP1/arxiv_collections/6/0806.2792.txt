We study the electronic structure of multilayer graphene using a
$\pi$-orbital continuum model with nearest-neighbor intralayer and interlayer
tunneling. Using degenerate state perturbation theory, we show that the
low-energy electronic structure of arbitrarily stacked graphene multilayers
consists of chiral pseudospin doublets with a conserved chirality sum.
