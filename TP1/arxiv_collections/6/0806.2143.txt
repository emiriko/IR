We derive an analytical expression for the two-gluon production in the pA
(light-heavy) collisions, and focus specifically on the rapidity dependent
part. We approximate the gauge field from the heavy target as the Color Glass
Condensate which interacts with the light projectile whose source density
allows for a perturbative expansion. We discuss the longitudinal correlations
of produced particles. Our calculation goes in part beyond the eikonal limit
for the emitted gluons so that we can retain the exponential terms with respect
to the rapidity difference. Our expression can thus describe the short-range
correlations as well as the long-range ones for which our formula is reduced to
the known expression. In a special case of two high-pt gluons in the
back-to-back kinematics we find that dependence on the rapidity separation is
only moderate even in the diagrammatically connected part.
