Concise summary of the recent progress in the search for the world-volume
action for multiple M2 branes. After a recent discovery of simplified version
of BLG action, which is based on the ordinary Lie-algebra structure, does not
have coupling constants and extra dynamical fields, attention should be
switched to the study of M2 brane dynamics. A viable brane analogue of Polyakov
formalism and Belavin-Knizhnik theorem for strings can probably be provided by
Palatini formalism for 3d (super)gravity.
