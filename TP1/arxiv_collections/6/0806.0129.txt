By means of the notion of umbrae indexed by multisets, a general method to
express estimators and their products in terms of power sums is derived. A
connection between the notion of multiset and integer partition leads
immediately to a way to speed up the procedures. Comparisons of computational
times with known procedures show how this approach turns out to be more
efficient in eliminating much unnecessary computation.
