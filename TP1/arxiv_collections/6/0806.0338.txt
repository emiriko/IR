A driven granular material, e.g. a vibrated box full of sand, is a stationary
system which may be very far from equilibrium. The standard equilibrium
statistical mechanics is therefore inadequate to describe fluctuations in such
a system. Here we present numerical and analytical results concerning energy
and injected power fluctuations. In the first part we explain how the study of
the probability density function (pdf) of the fluctuations of total energy is
related to the characterization of velocity correlations. Two different regimes
are addressed: the gas driven at the boundaries and the homogeneously driven
gas. In a granular gas, due to non-Gaussianity of the velocity pdf or lack of
homogeneity in hydrodynamics profiles, even in the absence of velocity
correlations, the fluctuations of total energy are non-trivial and may lead to
erroneous conclusions about the role of correlations. In the second part of the
chapter we take into consideration the fluctuations of injected power in driven
granular gas models. Recently, real and numerical experiments have been
interpreted as evidence that the fluctuations of power injection seem to
satisfy the Gallavotti-Cohen Fluctuation Relation. We will discuss an
alternative interpretation of such results which invalidates the
Gallavotti-Cohen symmetry. Moreover, starting from the Liouville equation and
using techniques from large deviation theory, the general validity of a
Fluctuation Relation for power injection in driven granular gases is
questioned. Finally a functional is defined using the Lebowitz-Spohn approach
for Markov processes applied to the linear inelastic Boltzmann equation
relevant to describe the motion of a tracer particle. Such a functional results
to be different from injected power and to satisfy a Fluctuation Relation.
