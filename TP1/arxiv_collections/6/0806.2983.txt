Analysis of edge-state energies in the integer quantum Hall effect is carried
out within the semiclassical approximation. When the system is wide so that
each edge can be considered separatly, this problem is equivalent to that of a
one dimensional harmonic oscillator centered at x=x_c and an infinite wall at
x=0, and appears in numerous physical contexts. The eigenvalues E_n(x_c) for a
given quantum number n are solutions of the equation S(E,x_c)=\pi [n+
\gamma(E,x_c)] where S is the WKB action and 0<\gamma<1 encodes all the
information on the connection procedure at the turning points.
  A careful implication of the WKB connection formulae results in an excellent
approximation to the exact energy eigenvalues. The dependence of \gamma
[E_n(x_c),x_c] \equiv \gamma_c (x_c) on x_c is analyzed between its two extreme
values 1/2 as x_c goes to -infinity far inside the sample and 3/4 as x_c goes
to infinity far outside the sample. The edge-state energies E_n(x_c) obey an
almost exact scaling law of the form E_n(x_c)=4 [n+\gamma_n(x_c)] f(x_c/4 n +3)
and the scaling function f(y) is explicitly elucidated
