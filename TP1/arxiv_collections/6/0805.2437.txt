Efficient ion-photon coupling is an important component for large-scale
ion-trap quantum computing. We propose that arrays of phase Fresnel lenses
(PFLs) are a favorable optical coupling technology to match with multi-zone ion
traps. Both are scalable technologies based on conventional micro-fabrication
techniques. The large numerical apertures (NAs) possible with PFLs can reduce
the readout time for ion qubits. PFLs also provide good coherent ion-photon
coupling by matching a large fraction of an ion's emission pattern to a single
optical propagation mode (TEM00). To this end we have optically characterized a
large numerical aperture phase Fresnel lens (NA=0.64) designed for use at 369.5
nm, the principal fluorescence detection transition for Yb+ ions. A
diffraction-limited spot w0=350+/-15 nm (1/e^2 waist) with mode quality M^2=
1.08+/-0.05 was measured with this PFL. From this we estimate the minimum
expected free space coherent ion-photon coupling to be 0.64%, which is twice
the best previous experimental measurement using a conventional multi-element
lens. We also evaluate two techniques for improving the entanglement fidelity
between the ion state and photon polarization with large numerical aperture
lenses.
