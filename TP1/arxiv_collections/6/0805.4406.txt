The CMS/TOTEM and ATLAS collaborations carry out a program of forward physics
with several near-beam detectors extending their coverage to high
pseudorapidities. This instrumentation includes calorimeters (CASTOR and ZDC),
tracking devices (TOTEM T1 and T2), proton taggers (Roman Pots and FP420), and
instrumentation dedicated to luminosity monitoring and normalisation. A rich
physics program is accessible, including soft QCD interactions, Diffraction,
photon-induced physics and luminosity measurements.
