We discuss charged topological spin textures in quantum Hall ferromagnets in
which the electrons carry a pseudospin as well as the usual spin degree of
freedom, as is the case in bilayer GaAs or monolayer graphene samples. We
develop a theory which treats spin and pseudospin on a manifestly equal
footing, which may also be of help in visualizing the relevant spin textures.
We in particular consider the entanglement of spin and pseudospin in the
presence of realistic anisotropies. An entanglement operator is introduced
which generates families of degenerate Skyrmions with differing entanglement
properties. We propose a local characterization of the latter, and touch on the
role entangled Skyrmions play in the nuclear relaxation time of quantum Hall
ferromagnets.
