We report on the status and history of the CMS commissioning, together with
selected results from cosmic-ray muon data. The second part focuses on
strategies for optimizing the reconstruction of jets, missing transverse energy
and photons for early standard model measurements at ATLAS and CMS with the
first collision data from the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.
