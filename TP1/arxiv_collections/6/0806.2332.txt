A completely well-centered tetrahedral mesh is a triangulation of a three
dimensional domain in which every tetrahedron and every triangle contains its
circumcenter in its interior. Such meshes have applications in scientific
computing and other fields. We show how to triangulate simple domains using
completely well-centered tetrahedra. The domains we consider here are space,
infinite slab, infinite rectangular prism, cube and regular tetrahedron. We
also demonstrate single tetrahedra with various combinations of the properties
of dihedral acuteness, 2-well-centeredness and 3-well-centeredness.
