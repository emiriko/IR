We present a fast and efficient tight-binding (TB) method for simulating
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) imaging of adsorbate molecules on ultrathin
insulating films. Due to the electronic decoupling of the molecule from the
metal surface caused by the presence of the insulating overlayer, the STM
images of the frontier molecular orbitals can be simulated using a very
efficient scheme, which also enables the analysis of phase shifts in the STM
current. Au-pentacene complex adsorbed on a NaCl bilayer on Cu substrate
provides an intricate model system, which has been previously studied both
experimentally and theoretically. Our calculations indicate that the
complicated shape of the molecular orbitals may cause multivalued constant
current surfaces -- leading to ambiguity of the STM image. The results obtained
using the TB method are found to be consistent with both DFT calculations and
experimental data.
