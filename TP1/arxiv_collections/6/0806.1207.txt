We summarize the existing experimental data on electromagnons in multiferroic
RMn2O5 compounds, where R denotes a rare earth ion, Y or Bi, and discuss a
realistic microscopic model of these materials based on assumption that the
microscopic mechanism of magnetically-induced ferroelectricity and
electromagnon absorption relies entirely on the isotropic Heisenberg exchange
and magnetostrictive coupling of spins to a polar lattice mode and does not
involve relativistic effects. This model explains many magnetic and optical
properties of RMn2O5 manganites, such as the spin re-orientation transition,
magnetically-induced polarisation, appearance of the electromagnon peak in the
non-collinear spin state and the polarisation of light for which this peak is
observed. We compare experimental and theoretical results on electromagnons in
RMn2O5 and RMnO3 compounds.
