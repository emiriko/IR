Discoveries of ratios whose values are constant within broad classes of
materials have led to many deep physical insights. The Kadowaki-Woods ratio
(KWR) compares the temperature dependence of a metal's resistivity to that of
its heat capacity; thereby probing the relationship between the
electron-electron scattering rate and the renormalisation of the electron mass.
However, the KWR takes very different values in different materials. Here we
introduce a ratio, closely related to the KWR, that includes the effects of
carrier density and spatial dimensionality and takes the same (predicted) value
in organic charge transfer salts, transition metal oxides, heavy fermions and
transition metals - despite the numerator and denominator varying by ten orders
of magnitude. Hence, in these materials, the same emergent physics is
responsible for the mass enhancement and the quadratic temperature dependence
of the resistivity and no exotic explanations of their KWRs are required.
