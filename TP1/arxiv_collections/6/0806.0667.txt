We study quark mass matrices in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model with bulk
symmetry $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$. The Yukawa couplings are
assumed to be within an order of magnitude of each other, and perturbative. We
find that quark mass matrices of the symmetrical form proposed by Koide
\textit{et. al.} [Y. Koide, H. Nishiura, K. Matsuda, T. Kikuchi and T.
Fukuyama, Phys. Rev. D {\bf 66}, 093006 (2002)] can be accommodated in the RS
framework with the assumption of hierarchyless Yukawa couplings, but not the
hermitian Fritzsch-type mass matrices. General asymmetrical mass matrices are
also found which fit well simultaneously with the quark masses and the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix. Both left-handed (LH) and right-handed (RH)
quark rotation matrices are obtained that allow analysis of flavour changing
decay of both LH and RH top quarks. At a warped down scale of 1.65 TeV, the
total branching ratio of $t \ra Z$ + jets can be as high as $\sim 5 \times
10^{-6}$ for symmetrical mass matrices and $\sim 2 \times 10^{-5}$ for
asymmetrical ones. This level of signal is within reach of the LHC.
