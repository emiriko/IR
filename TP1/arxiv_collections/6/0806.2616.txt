Graphene exhibits unconventional two-dimensional electronic properties
resulting from the symmetry of its quasiparticles, which leads to the concepts
of pseudospin and electronic chirality. Here we report that scanning tunneling
microscopy can be used to probe these unique symmetry properties at the
nanometer scale. They are reflected in the quantum interference pattern
resulting from elastic scattering off impurities, and they can be directly read
from its fast Fourier transform. Our data, complemented by theoretical
calculations, demonstrate that the pseudospin and the electronic chirality in
epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) correspond to the ones predicted for ideal
graphene.
