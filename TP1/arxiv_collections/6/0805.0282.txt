Squeezed correlations of particle-antiparticle pairs, also called
Back-to-Back Correlations, are predicted to appear if the hadron masses are
modified in the hot and dense hadronic medium formed in high energy
nucleus-nucleus collisions. Although well-established theoretically, the
squeezed-particle correlations have not yet been searched for experimentally in
high energy hadronic or heavy ion collisions, clearly requiring optimized forms
to experimentally search for this effect. Within a non-relativistic treatment
developed earlier we show that one promising way to search for the BBC signal
is to look into the squeezed correlation function of pairs of phi-mesons at
RHIC energies, plotted in terms of the average momentum of the pair,
K12=(k1+k2)/2. This variable's modulus, 2|K12|, is the non-relativistic limit
of the variable Q_bbc, introduced herewith. The squeezing effects on the HBT
correlation function are also discussed.
