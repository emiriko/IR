The quantum theory of the cold atom micromaser including the effects of
gravity is established in the general case where the cavity mode and the atomic
transition frequencies are detuned. We show that atoms which classically would
not reach the interaction region are able to emit a photon inside the cavity.
The system turns out to be extremely sensitive to the detuning and in
particular to its sign. A method to solve the equations of motion for non
resonant atom-field interaction and arbitrary cavity modes is presented.
