The power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells based on
donor--acceptor blends is governed by an interplay of polaron pair dissociation
and bimolecular polaron recombination. Both processes are strongly dependent on
the charge carrier mobility, the dissociation increasing with faster charge
transport, with raised recombination losses at the same time. Using a
macroscopic effective medium simulation, we calculate the optimum charge
carrier mobility for the highest power conversion efficiency, for the first
time accounting for injection barriers and a reduced Langevin-type
recombination. An enhancement of the charge carrier mobility from
$10^{-8}$m$^2$/Vs for state of the art polymer:fullerene solar cells to about
$10^{-6}$m$^2$/Vs, which yields the maximum efficiency, corresponds to an
improvement of only about 20% for the given parameter set.
