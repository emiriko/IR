The periods, introduced by Kontsevich and Zagier, form a class of complex
numbers which contains all algebraic numbers and several transcendental
quantities. Little has been known about qualitative properties of periods. In
this paper, we compare the periods with hierarchy of real numbers induced from
computational complexities. In particular we prove that periods can be
effectively approximated by elementary rational Cauchy sequences. As an
application, we exhibit a computable real number which is not a period.
