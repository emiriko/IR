We develop a projection imaging technique to study ultracold plasma dynamics.
We image the charged particle spatial distributions by extraction with a
high-voltage pulse onto a position-sensitive detector. Measuring the 2D width
of the ion image at later times (the ion image size in the first 20 $\mu$s is
dominated by the Coulomb explosion of the dense ion cloud), we extract the
plasma expansion velocity. These velocities at different initial electron
temperatures match earlier results obtained by measuring the plasma oscillation
frequency. The electron image size slowly decreases during the plasma lifetime
because of the strong Coulomb force of the ion cloud on the electrons, electron
loss and Coulomb explosion effects.
