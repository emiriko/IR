We present several strategies for searching for supersymmetry in dijet
channels that do not explicitly invoke missing energy. Preliminary
investigations suggest that signal-to-background ratios of at least 4--5 should
be achievable at the LHC, with discovery possible for squarks as heavy as ~ 1.7
TeV.
