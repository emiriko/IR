Leading idea of this manuscript is to discuss the structure and the deep
correlations among different quantum physical systems, and to explore how such
correlations bear on the capacity of the systems to encode and manipulate
information. In particular, the role of logical operators constructed out of
multi-boson (and possibly fractionary-boson) operators is analyzed in its
relation on the one hand with the algebra of diffeomorphisms of the circle, on
the other with the physical properties of the fractional quantum Hall effect
(described in terms of Laughlin states) and of its many electron representation
in terms of the Chern-Simons topological quantum field theory.
