Photon propagation in a gas of N atoms is studied using an effective
Hamiltonian describing photon mediated atomic dipolar interactions. The density
P(\Gamma) of photon escape rates is determined from the spectrum of the N x N
random matrix \Gamma_{ij} = \sin (x_{ij}) / x_{ij}, where x_{ij} is the
dimensionless random distance between any two atoms. Varying disorder and
system size, a scaling behavior is observed for the escape rates. It is
explained using microscopic calculations and a stochastic model which
emphasizes the role of cooperative effects in photon localization and provides
an interesting relation with statistical properties of "small world networks".
