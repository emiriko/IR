We study the effects of realistic dephasing environments on a pair of
solid-state single-photon sources in the context of the Hong-Ou-Mandel dip. By
means of solutions for the Markovian or exact non-Markovian dephasing dynamics
of the sources, we show that the resulting loss of visibility depends crucially
on the timing of photon detection events. Our results demonstrate that the
effective visibility can be improved via temporal post-selection, and also that
time-resolved interference can be a useful probe of the interaction between the
emitter and its host environment.
