A function on a discrete group is weakly combable if its discrete derivative
with respect to a combing can be calculated by a finite state automaton. A
weakly combable function is bicombable if it is Lipschitz in both the left and
right invariant word metrics.
  Examples of bicombable functions on word-hyperbolic groups include (i)
homomorphisms to Z (ii) word length with respect to a finite generating set
(iii) most known explicit constructions of quasimorphisms (e.g. the
Epstein-Fujiwara counting quasimorphisms)
  We show that bicombable functions on word-hyperbolic groups satisfy a central
limit theorem: if \bar{\phi}_n is the value of \phi on a random element of word
length n (in a certain sense), there are E and \sigma for which there is
convergence in the sense of distribution n^{-1/2}(\bar{\phi}_n - nE) \to
N(0,\sigma), where N(0,\sigma) denotes the normal distribution with standard
deviation \sigma. As a corollary, we show that if S_1 and S_2 are any two
finite generating sets for G, there is an algebraic number lambda_{1,2}
depending on S_1 and S_2 such that almost every word of length n in the S_1
metric has word length n\lambda_{1,2} in the S_2 metric, with error of size
O(\sqrt{n}).
