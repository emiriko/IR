The axino dark matter hypothesis in RSII brane model is studied. Within the
framework of CMSSM we assume that the lightest neutralino or stau is the NLSP,
and that the axino production has a single contribution from the NLSP decay. It
is found that the axino can play the role of dark matter in the universe and we
determine what the axino mass should be for different values of the
five-dimensional Planck mass. An upper bound is obtained for the latter
