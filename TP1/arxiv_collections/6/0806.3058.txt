Random quantum circuits take an input quantum state and randomize it. This is
a task with a growing number of identified uses in quantum information
processing. We suggest a scheme to implement random circuits in a weighted
graph state. The input state is entangled with the weighted graph state and a
random circuit is implemented when the experimenter performs local measurements
in one fixed basis only. The scheme uses no classical random numbers and is a
new and natural application of weighted graph states
