The theory of the free Maxwell field in two moving frames on the de Sitter
spacetime is investigated pointing out that the conserved momentum and energy
operators do not commute to each other. This leads us to consider new plane
waves solutions of the Maxwell equation which are eigenfunctions of the energy
operator. Such particular solutions complete the theory in which only the
solutions of given momentum were considered so far. The energy eigenfunctions
can be obtained thanks to our new time-evolution picture proposed previously
for the scalar and Dirac fields. Considering both these types of modes, it is
shown that the second quantization of the free electromagnetic potential in the
Coulomb gauge can be done in a canonical manner as in special relativity. The
principal conserved one-particle operators associated to Killing vectors are
derived, concentrating on the energy, momentum and total angular momentum
operators.
