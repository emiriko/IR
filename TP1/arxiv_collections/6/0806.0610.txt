We model the hot and dense strongly interacting mater produced in high energy
heavy ion collisions using relativistic hydrodynamics. Several different
sources of real photons produced during these collisions are considered and
their relative importance is assessed. We include contributions from QCD jets,
which are allowed to loose and gain energy as they proceed through the hot
matter. This is treated within the AMY formalism. We obtain photon spectra,
R_{AA}, and v_2 in agreement with measurements performed by the PHENIX
collaboration.
