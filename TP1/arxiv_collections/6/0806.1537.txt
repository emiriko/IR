We investigate the radiation emitted from a scalar source in circular orbit
around a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. Particle and energy emission rates are
analytically calculated in the low- and high-frequency regimes and shown to be
in full agreement with a numerical calculation. Our investigation is connected
with the recent discussion on the validity of the cosmic censorship conjecture
in the quantum realm.
