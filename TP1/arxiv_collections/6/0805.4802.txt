We present a next-to-leading-order calculation of W/Z production interfaced
to shower Monte Carlo, implemented according to the POWHEG method. Finite width
effects, Z/gamma interference and angular correlations of decay products are
included. A detailed comparison with MC@NLO and PYTHIA is carried out.
