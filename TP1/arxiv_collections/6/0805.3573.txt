We study the averages of ratios of characteristic polynomials over circular
$\beta$-ensembles, where $\beta$ is a positive real number. Using Jack
polynomial theory, we obtain three expressions for ratio averages. Two of them
are given as sums of super-Jack polynomials and another one is given by a
hyperdeterminant. As applications, we give dual relations for ratio averages
between $\beta$ and $4/\beta$.
