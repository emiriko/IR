We present a method for performing atomistic spin dynamic simulations. A
comprehensive summary of all pertinent details for performing the simulations
such as equations of motions, models for including temperature, methods of
extracting data and numerical schemes for performing the simulations is given.
The method can be applied in a first principles mode, where all interatomic
exchange is calculated self-consistently, or it can be applied with frozen
parameters estimated from experiments or calculated for a fixed
spin-configuration. Areas of potential applications to different magnetic
questions are also discussed. The method is finally applied to one situation
where the macrospin model breaks down; magnetic switching in ultra strong
fields.
