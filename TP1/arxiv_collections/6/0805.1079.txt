The electromagnetic analog of an elastic spring-mass network is constructed.
These electromagnetic circuits offer the promise of manipulating
electromagnetic fields in new ways, and linear electrical circuits correspond
to a subclass of them. They consist of thin triangular magnetic components
joined at the edges by cylindrical dielectric components. (There are also dual
electromagnetic circuits consisting of thin triangular dielectric components
joined at the edges by cylindrical magnetic components.) Some of the edges can
be terminal edges to which electric fields are applied. The response is
measured in terms of the real or virtual free currents that are associated with
the terminal edges. The relation between the terminal electric fields and the
terminal free currents is governed by a symmetric complex matrix $\BW$. In the
case where all the terminal edges are disjoint, and the frequency is fixed, a
complete characterization is obtained of all possible response matrices $\BW$
both in the lossless and lossy cases. This is done by introducing a subclass of
electromagnetic circuits, called electromagnetic ladder networks. It is shown
that an electromagnetic ladder network, structured as a cubic network, can have
a macroscopic electromagnetic continuum response which is non-Maxwellian, and
novel.
