We describe several general methods for calculating weights of mixed tilting
sheaves. We introduce a notion called "non-cancellation property" which implies
a strong uniqueness of mixed tilting sheaves and enables one to calculate their
weights effectively. When we have a certain Radon transform, we prove a
geometric analogue of Ringel duality which sends tilting objects to projective
objects. We apply these methods to (partial) flag varieties and affine
(partial) flag varieties and show that the weight polynomials of mixed tilting
sheaves on flag and affine flag varieties are essentially given by
Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials. This verifies a mixed geometric analogue of a
conjecture by W.Soergel in \cite{Sg1}.
