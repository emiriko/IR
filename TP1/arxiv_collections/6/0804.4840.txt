We explore the fundamental time limit of ultra fast spin torque induced
magnetization reversal of a magnetic memory cell. Spin torque precession during
a spin torque current pulse and free precessional magnetization ringing after
spin torque pulse excitation is detected by time resolved magneto transport.
Adapting the duration of the spin torque excitation pulse to the spin torque
precession period allows suppression of the magnetization ringing and thus
coherent control of the final orientation of the magnetization. In the presence
of a hard axis bias field such coherent control enables an optimum ultra fast,
quasi ballistic spin torque magnetization reversal by a single precessional
turn directly from the initial to the reversed equilibrium state.
