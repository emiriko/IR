We consider a solvable model of a laser-interferometer measuring a weak
classical force. The model takes into account dissipation of the energy by
transfer to the environment at zero temperature. The sensitivity (the
signal-to-noise ratio) of the device is defined as the corresponding ratio
between the mean value and the variance of a certain observable. We analyze the
dependence of the sensitivity upon the duration of the measurement and the
photon number. For parameters typical for the LIGO project, we discuss
numerical estimates.
