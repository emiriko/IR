Quantum Accelerator Modes have been experimentally observed, and
theoretically explained, in the dynamics of kicked cold atoms in the presence
of gravity, when the kicking period is close to a half-integer multiple of the
Talbot time. We generalize the theory to the case when the kicking period is
sufficiently close to any rational multiple of the Talbot time, and thus
predict new rich families of experimentally observable Quantum Accelerator
Modes.
