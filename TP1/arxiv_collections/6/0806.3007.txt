The radiative decays $V\to S\gamma$ and $S\to V\gamma$ with $V=\rho, \omega,
\phi$ and $S=a_0, \sigma, f_0$ are calculated within the framework of the
Linear Sigma Model. Current experimental data on the $\phi\to f_0\gamma$ and
$\rho\to\sigma\gamma$ branching ratios and the ratio $\Gamma(\phi\to
f_0\gamma)/\Gamma(\phi\to a_0\gamma)$ are satisfactorily accommodated in our
approach. We also estimate the decay widths of the
$f_0,a_0\to\rho\gamma,\omega\gamma$ transitions. All the processes considered
are of interest for ongoing experimental programs in Frascati, J\"ulich and
Novosibirsk.
