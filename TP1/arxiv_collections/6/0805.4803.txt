The low-energy S-wave component of the decay $D^+ \to K^- \pi^+ \pi^+$ is
studied by means of a chiral SU(3)XSU(3) effective theory. As far as the
primary vertex is concerned, we allow for the possibility of either direct
production of three pseudoscalar mesons or a meson and a scalar resonance.
Special attention is paid to final state interactions associated with elastic
meson-meson scattering. The corresponding two-body amplitude is unitarized by
ressumming s-channel diagrams and can be expressed in terms of the usal phase
shifts $\delta$. This procedure preserves the chiral properties of the
amplitude at low-energies. Final state interactions also involve another phase
$\omega$, which describes intermediate two-meson propagation and is
theoretically unambiguous. This phase is absent in the K-matrix approximation.
Partial contributions to the decay amplitude involve a real term, another one
with phase $\delta$ and several others with phases $\delta+\omega$. Our main
result is a simple and almost model independent chiral generalization of the
usual Breit-Wigner expression, suited to be used in analyses of production data
involving scalar resonances.
