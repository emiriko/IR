In this paper we outline the computation of the partition function for the
generalized Kodama states (GKod) of quantum gravity using the background field
method. We show that the coupling constant for GKod is the same dimensionless
coupling constant that appears in the partition function of the pure Kodama
state (Chern--Simons functional) and argue that the GKod partition function is
renormalizable as a loop expansion in direct analogy to Chern--Simons
perturbation theory. The GKod partition function contains an infinite set of
1PI vertices uniquely fixed, as a result of the semiclassical-quantum
correspondence, by the first-order vertex. This implies the existence of a
well-defined effective action for the partition function since the `phase' of
the GKod, provided a finite state exists, is equivalent to this effective
action. Additionally, the separation of the matter from the gravitational
contributions bears a resemblance to the infinite dimensional analogue to
Kaluza--Klein theory. Future directions of research include extension of the
computations of this paper to the norm of the GKod as well as to examine the
analogue of the Chern--Simons Jone's polynomials and link invariants using the
GKod as a measure.
