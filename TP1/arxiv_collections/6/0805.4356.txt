The conceptual idea of degree of rate control (DRC) approaches is to identify
the "rate limiting step" in a complex reaction network by evaluating how the
overall rate of product formation changes when a small change is made in one of
the kinetic parameters. We examine two definitions of this concept by applying
it to first-principles kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of the CO oxidation at
RuO2(110). Instead of studying experimental data we examine simulations,
because in them we know the surface structure, reaction mechanism, the rate
constants, the coverage of the surface and the turn-over frequency at steady
state. We can test whether the insights provided by the DRC are in agreement
with the results of the simulations thus avoiding the uncertainties inherent in
a comparison with experiment. We find that the information provided by using
the DRC is non-trivial: It could not have been obtained from the knowledge of
the reaction mechanism and of the magnitude of the rate constants alone. For
the simulations the DRC provides furthermore guidance as to which aspects of
the reaction mechanism should be treated accurately and which can be studied by
less accurate and more efficient methods. We therefore conclude that a
sensitivity analysis based on the DRC is a useful tool for understanding the
propagation of errors from the electronic structure calculations to the
statistical simulations in first-principles kinetic Monte Carlo simulations.
