We present Tethered Monte Carlo, a simple, general purpose method of
computing the effective potential of the order parameter (Helmholtz free
energy). This formalism is based on a new statistical ensemble, closely related
to the micromagnetic one, but with an extended configuration space (through
Creutz-like demons). Canonical averages for arbitrary values of the external
magnetic field are computed without additional simulations. The method is put
to work in the two dimensional Ising model, where the existence of exact
results enables us to perform high precision checks. A rather peculiar feature
of our implementation, which employs a local Metropolis algorithm, is the total
absence, within errors, of critical slowing down for magnetic observables.
Indeed, high accuracy results are presented for lattices as large as L=1024.
