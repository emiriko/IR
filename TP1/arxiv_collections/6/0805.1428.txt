We present a detailed descriptive analysis of the gravitational radiation
from black-hole binary mergers of nonspinning black holes, based on numerical
simulations of systems varying from equal-mass to a 6:1 mass ratio. Our primary
goal is to present relatively complete information about the waveforms,
including all the leading multipolar components, to interested researchers. In
our analysis, we pursue the simplest physical description of the dominant
features in the radiation, providing an interpretation of the waveforms in
terms of an {\em implicit rotating source}. This interpretation applies
uniformly to the full wave train, from inspiral through ringdown. We emphasize
strong relationships among the $\ell=m$ modes that persist through the full
wave train. Exploring the structure of the waveforms in more detail, we conduct
detailed analytic fitting of the late-time frequency evolution, identifying a
key quantitative feature shared by the $\ell=m$ modes among all mass ratios. We
identify relationships, with a simple interpretation in terms of the implicit
rotating source, among the evolution of frequency and amplitude, which hold for
the late-time radiation. These detailed relationships provide sufficient
information about the late-time radiation to yield a predictive model for the
late-time waveforms, an alternative to the common practice of modeling by a sum
of quasinormal mode overtones. We demonstrate an application of this in a new
effective-one-body-based analytic waveform model.
