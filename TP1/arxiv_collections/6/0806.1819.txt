This paper presents a low-ML-decoding-complexity, full-rate, full-diversity
space-time block code (STBC) for a 2 transmit antenna, 2 receive antenna
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, with coding gain equal to that of
the best and well known Golden code for any QAM constellation. Recently, two
codes have been proposed (by Paredes, Gershman and Alkhansari and by Sezginer
and Sari), which enjoy a lower decoding complexity relative to the Golden code,
but have lesser coding gain. The $2\times 2$ STBC presented in this paper has
lesser decoding complexity for non-square QAM constellations, compared with
that of the Golden code, while having the same decoding complexity for square
QAM constellations. Compared with the Paredes-Gershman-Alkhansari and
Sezginer-Sari codes, the proposed code has the same decoding complexity for
non-rectangular QAM constellations. Simulation results, which compare the
codeword error rate (CER) performance, are presented.
