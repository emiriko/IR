By building on the field energy minimization underpinnings of DIDACKS theory
and by making certain natural assumptions about the general nature of the
energy/density configuration of the Earth's interior it is shown that the
problem of estimating the Earth's interior density, either globally or locally,
can be naturally reframed as a energy minimization one. The basic idea is that
a static stable density configuration is a minimum energy configuration, which
tends to be unique (when all other things are equal); hence, a field energy
minimization approach can be counted on to generally lead to a physically
motivated unique solution. Techniques touched on should provide practical
implementation tools, or at least some helpful hints, for handling many of the
well-known ill-posedness issues associated with mass density estimation and
other related inverse-source Laplacian problems.
