We study the ground states of one-dimensional Bose-Bose mixtures under
harmonic confinement. As we vary the inter-species coupling strength up to the
limit of infinite repulsion, we observe a generalized, composite-fermionization
crossover. The initially coexisting phases demix as a whole (for weak
intra-species interactions) and separate on an atomic level (for strong
intra-species repulsion). By symmetry, the two components end up with strongly
overlapping profiles, albeit sensitive to symmetry-breaking perturbations.
Different pathways emerge in case the two components have different atom
numbers, different intra-species interactions, or different masses and/or trap
frequencies.
