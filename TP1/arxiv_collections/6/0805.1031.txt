This is a brief review, in relatively non-technical terms, of recent advances
in the theory of random field geometry. These advances have provided a
collection of explicit new formulae describing mean values of a variety of
geometric characteristics of excursion sets of random fields. As well as a
review of the theory, we provide brief descriptions of some of the more
interesting applications.
