A Cu-Cr composite was processed by severe plastic deformation to investigate
the role of interphase boundaries on the grain size reduction mechanisms. The
as-deformed material exhibits a grain size of only 20nm. This gives rise to a
dramatic increase of the hardness. Some deformation induced Cu super saturated
solid solutions were clearly exhibited and it is shown that they decrease the
hardness. The formation of such supersaturated solid solution and their
influence on the mechanical properties are discussed.
