The charge transport in the copper-oxygen chain/ladder layers of
(La,Y)y(Sr,Ca)14-yCu24O41 is investigated along two crystallographic directions
in the temperature range from 50 K to 700 K and for doping levels from y ~= 6
(number of holes nh < 1) to y = 0 (number of holes nh = 6). A crossover from a
one-dimensional hopping transport along the chains for y >= 3 to a
quasi-two-dimensional charge conduction in the ladder planes for y <~ 2 is
observed. This is attributed to a partial hole transfer from chains to ladders
when the hole doping exceeds nh ~= 4 and approaches fully doped value n_h = 6.
For y <~ 2 a weak dielectric relaxation at radio-frequencies and a microwave
mode are detected, which might be recognized as signatures of a charge-density
wave phase developed at short length scales in the ladders planes.
