Monte Carlo simulations of the SU(2)-symmetric deconfined critical point
action reveal strong violations of scale invariance for the deconfinement
transition. We find compelling evidence that the generic runaway
renormalization flow of the gauge coupling is to a weak first order transition,
similar to the case of U(1)$\times$U(1) symmetry. Our results imply that recent
numeric studies of the N\`{e}el antiferromagnet to valence bond solid quantum
phase transition in SU(2)-symmetric models were not accurate enough in
determining the nature of the transition.
