We investigate the Fano interference in the presence of a "which way"
detector, i.e., a local electron-phonon coupler, in the context of mesoscopic
transport. Special attention is paid to study whether the phonon sidebands in
the differential conductance spectra exhibit the typical lineshape of the Fano
interference. When using a double-dot model we obtain two seemly contradictory
results by slightly different approaches: The Markovian approach leads to {\it
absolutely no} Fano interference at the phonon sidebands, while the
Non-Markovian approach results in {\it finite} Fano interference at the phonon
sidebands. On the other hand, by using the usual Aharonov-Bohm (AB)-ring model,
i.e., only one dot is embedded into one arm of an AB-ring, only the
Non-Markovian results are recovered. We explain these contradictory results and
make a comparison between the double-dot model and the usual AB-ring model at
length. Moreover, we also point out the essential difference between the
manifestation of the "which way" effect in mesoscopic double-slit experiments
and its optical counterpart.
