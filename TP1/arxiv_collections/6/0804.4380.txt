We show that Schnabl's tachyon vacuum solution is an exact solution of the
equation of motion of Witten's open bosonic string field theory in the
background of constant antisymmetric two-form field. The action computed at the
vacuum solution is given by the Dirac-Born-Infeld factor multiplied to that
without the antisymmetric tensor field.
