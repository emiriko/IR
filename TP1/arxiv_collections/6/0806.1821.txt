The quantization of resistances in the quantum Hall effect and ballistic
transport through quantum point contacts is compared with the quantization of
the charge relaxation resistance of a coherent mesoscopic capacitor. While the
former two require the existence of a perfectly transmitting channel, the
charge relaxation resistance remains quantized for arbitrary backscattering.
The quantum Hall effect and the quantum point contact require only local phase
coherence. In contrast quantization of the charge relaxation resistance
requires global phase coherence.
