The genuine physical reasons explaining the delocalization effect of the
Hubbard repulsion U are analyzed. First it is shown that always when this
effect is observed, U acts on the background of a macroscopic degeneracy
present in a multiband type of system. After this step I demonstrate that
acting in such conditions, by strongly diminishing the double occupancy, U
spreads out the contributions in the ground state wave function, hence strongly
increases the one-particle localization length, consequently extends the
one-particle behavior producing conditions for a delocalization effect. To be
valuable, the reported results are presented in exact terms, being based on the
first exact ground states deduced at half filling in two dimensions for a
prototype two band system, the generic periodic Anderson model at finite value
of the interaction.
