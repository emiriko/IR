Migration policies in distributed evolutionary algorithms has not been an
active research area until recently. However, in the same way as operators have
an impact on performance, the choice of migrants is due to have an impact too.
In this paper we propose a new policy (named multikulti) for choosing the
individuals that are going to be sent to other nodes, based on
multiculturality: the individual sent should be as different as possible to the
receiving population. We have checked this policy on different discrete
optimization problems, and found that, in average or in median, this policy
outperforms classical ones like sending the best or a random individual.
