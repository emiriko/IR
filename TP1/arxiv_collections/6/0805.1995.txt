We investigate the conditional evolution of a charge state coupled to a
mesoscopic detector under continuous weak measurement. The state suffers
relaxation into a particular state with a definite charge when electrons in a
particular output lead are monitored in the detector. The process of the
conditional relaxation is not restricted by the shot noise of the detector,
unlike the case of the back-action dephasing. As a result, the relaxation of
conditional evolution is much faster than the current-sensitive part of
dephasing. Furthermore, the direction of the relaxation depends on the choice
of the output lead. We propose that these properties can be verified in a
two-path interferometer containing a quantum dot capacitively coupled to a
detector. In this setup, the current-current correlation between the
interferometer and the detector reveals characteristic features of conditional
relaxation.
