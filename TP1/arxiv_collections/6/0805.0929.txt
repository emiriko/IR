This paper presents an implementation of the Cosserat theory into haptic
sensing technologies for real-time simulation of microstructures. Cosserat
theory is chosen instead of the classical theory of elasticity for a better
representation of stress, especially in the nonlinear regime. The use of
Cosserat theory leads to a reduction of the complexity of the modelling and
thus increases its capability for real time simulation which is indispensable
for haptic technologies. The incorporation of Cosserat theory into haptic
sensing technology enables the designer to simulate in real-time the components
in a virtual reality environment (VRE) which can enable virtual manufacturing
and prototyping. The software tool created as a result of this methodology
demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed model. As test demonstrators, a
cantilever microbeam and microbridge undergoing bending in VRE are presented.
