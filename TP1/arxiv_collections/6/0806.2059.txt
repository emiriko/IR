The accurate prediction and characterization of DNA melting domains by
computational tools could facilitate a broad range of biological applications.
However, no algorithm for melting domain prediction has been available until
now. The main challenges include the difficulty of mathematically mapping a
qualitative description of DNA melting domains to quantitative statistical
mechanics models, as well as the absence of 'gold standards' and a need for
generality. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to identify the twostate
regions and melting fork regions along a given DNA sequence. Compared with an
ad hoc segmentation used in one of our previous studies, the new algorithm is
based on boundary probability profiles, rather than standard melting maps. We
demonstrate that a more detailed characterization of the DNA melting domain map
can be obtained using our new method, and this approach is independent of the
choice of DNA melting model. We expect this work to drive our understanding of
DNA melting domains one step further.
