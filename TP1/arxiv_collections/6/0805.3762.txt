After a prologue which clarifies some issues left open in my last paper, the
main features of the tetron model of elementary particles are discussed in the
light of recent developments, in particular the formation of strong and
electroweak vector bosons and a microscopic understanding of how the observed
tetrahedral symmetry of the fermion spectrum may arise.
