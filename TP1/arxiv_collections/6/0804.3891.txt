This paper presents our experience in developing and implementing Internet
telerobotics system. Internet telerobotics system refers to a robot system
controlled and monitored remotely through the Internet. A robot manipulator
with five degrees of freedom, called Mentor, is employed. Client-server
architecture is chosen as a platform for our Internet telerobotics system.
Three generations of telerobotics systems have evolved in this research. The
first generation was based on CGI and two tiered architecture, where a client
presents a Graphical User Interface to the user, and utilizes the user's data
entry and actions to perform requests to robot server running on a different
machine. The second generation was developed using Java. We also employ Java 3D
for creating and manipulating 3D geometry of manipulator links and for
constructing the structures used in rendering that geometry, resulting in 3D
robot movement simulation presented to the users(clients) through their web
browser. Recent development in our Internet telerobotics includes object
recognition through image captured by a camera, which poses challenging
problem, given the undeterministic latency of the Internet. The third
generation is centered around the use of CORBA for development platform of
distributed internet telerobotics system, aimed at distributing task of
telerobotics system.
