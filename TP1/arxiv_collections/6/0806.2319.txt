Transport through potential barriers in graphene is investigated using a set
of metallic gates capacitively coupled to graphene to modulate the potential
landscape. When a gate-induced potential step is steep enough, disorder becomes
less important and the resistance across the step is in quantitative agreement
with predictions of Klein tunneling of Dirac fermions up to a small correction.
We also perform magnetoresistance measurements at low magnetic fields and
compare them to recent predictions.
