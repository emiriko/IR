We introduce a one-dimensional (1D) XZ model with alternating
$\sigma_i^z\sigma_{i+1}^z$ and $\sigma_i^x\sigma_{i+1}^x$ interactions on
even/odd bonds, interpolating between the Ising model and the quantum compass
model. We present two ways of its exact solution by: ($i$) mapping to the
quantum Ising models, and ($ii$) using fermions with spin 1/2. In certain cases
the nearest neighbor pseudospin correlations change discontinuously at the
quantum phase transition, where one finds highly degenerate ground state of the
1D compass model.
