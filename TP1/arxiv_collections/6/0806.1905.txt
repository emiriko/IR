A characteristic feature of thermalized non-equilibrated matter is that, in
spite of energy relaxation (thermalization), a phase memory of the way the
strongly interacting many-body system was excited remains. In this contribution
we analyze a low energy evaporating proton data in nucleon induced reactions at
$\simeq$62 MeV incident energy with $^{197}$Au, $^{208}$Pb, $^{209}$Bi and
$^{nat}$U. Our analysis demonstrates that the thermalized non-equilibrated
matter survives a cascade of several evaporating particles. Thus the
experiments show that the effect of the anomalously slow phase relaxation, with
upper limits of the phase relaxation widths in the range 1-10$^{-4}$ eV, is
stable with respect to the multi-step evaporating cascade from the thermalized
compound nuclei. We also briefly mention manifestations and implications of the
thermalized non-equilibrated matter for some other fields.
