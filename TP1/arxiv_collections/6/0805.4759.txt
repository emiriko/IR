The JEWEL 1.0 Monte Carlo simulates jet evolution in a medium with a
microscopic description of splitting and scattering processes. In the framework
of this model we investigate the transverse momentum broadening due to medium
effects in different scenarios. Depending on assumptions about hadronisation,
we observe either a small increase or even a slight decrease of the mean
transverse momentum, but no sizeable broadening. This appears to be a natural
consequence of a model formulation which conserves energy and momentum
microscopically at each splitting and at each scattering.
