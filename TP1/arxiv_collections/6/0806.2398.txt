Analysing borehole temperature data in terms of ground surface history can
add useful information to reconstructions of past climates. Therefore, a
rigorous assessment of uncertainties and error sources is a necessary
prerequisite for the meaningful interpretation of such ground surface
temperature histories. This study analyses the most prominent sources of
uncertainty. The diffusive nature of the process makes the inversion relatively
robust against incomplete knowledge of the thermal diffusivity. Similarly the
influence of heat production is small. It turns out that for investigations of
the last 1000 to 100000 years the maximum depth of the temperature log is
crucial. More than 3000 m are required for an optimal inversion.
Reconstructions of the last one or two millennia require only modestly deep
logs (>300 m) but suffer severely from noisy data.
