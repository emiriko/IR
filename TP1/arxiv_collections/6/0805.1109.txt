In this article mixed CuInP$_2$(S$_x$Se$_{1-x}$)$_6$ crystals were
investigated by broadband dielectric spectroscopy (20 Hz - 3 GHz). The complete
phase diagram has been obtained from these results. The phase diagram of
investigated crystals is strongly asymmetric - the decreasing of ferroelectric
phase transition temperatures in CuInP$_2$(S$_x$Se$_{1-x}$)$_6$ is much more
flat with small admixture of sulphur then with small admixture of selenium. In
the middle part of the phase diagram (x=0.4-0.9) the dipolar glass phase has
been observed. In boundary region between ferroelectric order and dipolar glass
disorder with small amount of sulphur (x=0.2-0.25) at low temperatures the
nonergodic relaxor phase appears. The phase diagram was discussed in terms of
random bonds and random fields.
