Gravitoectromagnetic Inflation (GI) was introduced to describe in an unified
manner, electromagnetic, gravitatory and inflaton fields from a 5D vacuum
state. On the other hand, the primordial origin and evolution of dark energy is
today unknown. In this letter we show using GI that the zero modes of some
redefined vector fields $B_i=A_i/a$ produced during inflation, could be the
source of dark energy in the universe.
