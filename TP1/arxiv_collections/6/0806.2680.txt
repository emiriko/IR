We are concerned with demonstrating productivity of specifications of
infinite streams of data, based on orthogonal rewrite rules. In general, this
property is undecidable, but for restricted formats computable sufficient
conditions can be obtained. The usual analysis disregards the identity of data,
thus leading to approaches that we call data-oblivious. We present a method
that is provably optimal among all such data-oblivious approaches. This means
that in order to improve on the algorithm in this paper one has to proceed in a
data-aware fashion.
