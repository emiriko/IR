The high energy cosmic ray flux impinging on the sun and earth for 4 Gyr is
compared to the operation of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at design
energy and luminosity. It is shown by two different calculations that both the
integrated luminosity and the total hadronic interaction rate from the cosmic
ray flux of comparable energy are many orders of magnitude larger than that of
the LHC operated for 10 years. This study indicates that it is extremely
unlikely that pernicious exotic particles, such as mini-black holes, would be
produced by the LHC that would destroy the earth.
