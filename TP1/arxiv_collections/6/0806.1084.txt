The magnetic flux dependence of order parameter and supercurrent is studied
in a hollow d-wave superconducting cylinder. It is shown that the existence of
line nodal quasiparticles in a pure $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing state gives rise to
an $hc/e$ periodicity in the order parameter and a first-order quantum phase
transition for a large system size. We demonstrate that the flux periodicity in
the supercurrent is sensitive to the detailed electronic band structure and
electron filling factor. In particular, we find that, in cooperation with the
increase of the cylinder circumference, the $hc/2e$ periodicity can be restored
significantly in the supercurrent by avoiding the particle-hole symmetry point.
A similar study of a $d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$ pairing state verifies the
peculiarity of unconventional superconductors with nodal structure.
