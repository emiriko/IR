In this report I will present the recent results on K mesons from the KLOE
experiment at the DAFNE e+e- collider working at the center of mass energy
~1GeV ~m_{phi}. They include V_{us} determinations, the test on the unitarity
of the first row of the CKM matrix and the related experimental measurements.
Tests of lepton universality from leptonic and semileptonic decays will be also
discussed. Then I will present tests of quantum coherence, CPT and Lorentz
symmetry performed by studying the time evolution of the neutral kaon system.
