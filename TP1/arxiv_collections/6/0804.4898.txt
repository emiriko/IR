Using a support vector machine requires to set two types of hyperparameters:
the soft margin parameter C and the parameters of the kernel. To perform this
model selection task, the method of choice is cross-validation. Its
leave-one-out variant is known to produce an estimator of the generalization
error which is almost unbiased. Its major drawback rests in its time
requirement. To overcome this difficulty, several upper bounds on the
leave-one-out error of the pattern recognition SVM have been derived. Among
those bounds, the most popular one is probably the radius-margin bound. It
applies to the hard margin pattern recognition SVM, and by extension to the
2-norm SVM. In this report, we introduce a quadratic loss M-SVM, the M-SVM^2,
as a direct extension of the 2-norm SVM to the multi-class case. For this
machine, a generalized radius-margin bound is then established.
