Potential core materials to supersede ferrite in the 0.5-10 MHz frequency
range are investigated. The performance of electrodeposited nickel-iron,
cobalt-iron-copper alloys and the commercial alloy Vitrovac 6025 have been
assessed through their inclusion within a custom-made solenoid microinductor.
Although the present inductor, at 500 KHz, achieves 77% power efficiency for
24.7W/cm3 power density, an optimized process predicts a power efficiency of
97% for 30.83W/cm3 power density. The principle issues regarding microinductor
design and performance are discussed.
