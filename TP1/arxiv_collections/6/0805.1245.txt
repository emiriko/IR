We present ADHM-Nahm data for instantons on the Taub-NUT space and encode
these data in terms of Bow Diagrams. We study the moduli spaces of the
instantons and present these spaces as finite hyperkahler quotients. As an
example, we find an explicit expression for the metric on the moduli space of
one SU(2) instanton. We motivate our construction by identifying a
corresponding string theory brane configuration. By following string theory
dualities we are led to supersymmetric gauge theories with impurities.
