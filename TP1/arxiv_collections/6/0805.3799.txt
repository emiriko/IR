We analyze the style and structure of story narrative using the case of film
scripts. The practical importance of this is noted, especially the need to have
support tools for television movie writing. We use the Casablanca film script,
and scripts from six episodes of CSI (Crime Scene Investigation). For analysis
of style and structure, we quantify various central perspectives discussed in
McKee's book, "Story: Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of
Screenwriting". Film scripts offer a useful point of departure for exploration
of the analysis of more general narratives. Our methodology, using
Correspondence Analysis, and hierarchical clustering, is innovative in a range
of areas that we discuss. In particular this work is groundbreaking in taking
the qualitative analysis of McKee and grounding this analysis in a quantitative
and algorithmic framework.
