In order to develop a new structure microwave probe, the fabrication of AFM
probe on the GaAs wafer was studied. A waveguide was introduced by evaporating
Au film on the top and bottom surfaces of the GaAs AFM probe. A tip having 8
micrometers high, and curvature radius about 50 nm was formed. The dimensions
of the cantilever are 250x30x15 micrometers. The open structure of the
waveguide at the tip of the probe was introduced by using FIB fabrication. AFM
topography of a grating sample was measured by using the fabricated GaAs
microwave probe. The fabricated probe was found having nanometer scale
resolution, and microwave emission was detected successfully at the tip of the
probe by approaching Cr-V steel and Au wire samples.
