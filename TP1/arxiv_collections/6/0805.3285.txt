The HyperCP collaboration observed three events for the decay Sigma to p mu+
mu-. They suggested that new physics may be required to understand the implied
decay rate and the observed dimuon invariant mass distribution. Motivated by
this result, we re-examine this mode. First within the standard model, and then
assuming there is a new particle. Within the SM we find that this mode is
long-distance dominated and its rate falls within the range suggested by the
HyperCP measurement. We then examine the conditions under which the observation
is consistent with a light Higgs boson and find an explicit example that
satisfies all the constraints: the light pseudoscalar Higgs boson in the
next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model (NMSSM).
