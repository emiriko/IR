Supersymmetry predicts the identity of Yukawa and gauge couplings in the QCD
sector: quark-squark-gluino = squark-squark-gluon = quark-quark-gluon. We
examine whether the quark-squark-gluino Yukawa coupling can be determined, by
methods complementary to LHC, by analyzing squark-gluino final states at a TeV
e+e- collider.
