An emission band in the infrared is shown to be associated with a transition
within the negative nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. The band has a
zero-phonon line at 1046 nm, and uniaxial stress and magnetic field
measurements indicate that the emission is associated with a transition between
1E and 1A1 singlet levels. Inter-system crossing to these singlets causes the
spin polarisation that makes the NV- centre attractive for quantum information
processing, and the infrared emission band provides a new avenue for using the
centre in such applications.
