We determine the topological susceptibility $ \chi_t $ in the trivial
topological sector generated by lattice simulations of two-flavor QCD with
overlap Dirac fermion, on a $16^3 \times 32$ lattice with lattice spacing
$\sim$ 0.12 fm, at six sea quark masses $m_q$ ranging from $m_s/6$ to $m_s$
(where $m_s$ is the physical strange quark mass). The $ \chi_t $ is extracted
from the plateau (at large time separation) of the time-correlation function of
the flavor-singlet pseudoscalar meson ($\eta'$), which arises from the finite
size effect due to fixed topology. In the small $m_q$ regime, our result of
$\chi_t$ is proportional to $m_q$ as expected from chiral effective theory.
Using the formula $\chi_t=m_q\Sigma/N_f$ by Leutwyler-Smilga, we obtain the
chiral condensate in $N_f=2$ QCD as $\Sigma^{\bar{\mathrm{MS}}}(\mathrm{2
GeV})=[252(5)(10) \mathrm{MeV}]^3 $, in good agreement with our previous result
obtained in the $\epsilon$-regime.
