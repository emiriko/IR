We use recent nuclear parton distributions, among them the
Hirai--Kumano--Nagai (HKN) and Eskola--Paukkunen--Salgado (EPS08)
parameterizations, in our pQCD-improved parton model to calculate the nuclear
modification factor, R_{AA'}(p_T), at RHIC and at the LHC. At RHIC, the
deuteron-gold nuclear modification factor for pions, measured at p_T > 10 GeV/c
in central collisions, appears to deviate more from unity than the model
results. The slopes of the calculated R_{dAu}(p_T) are similar to the slopes of
the PHENIX pion and photon data. At LHC, without final-state effects we see a
small enhancement of R_{dPb}(p_T) in the transverse momentum range 10 GeV/c <
p_T < 100 GeV/c for most parameterizations. The inclusion of final-state energy
loss will reduce the R_{dPb}(p_T) values.
