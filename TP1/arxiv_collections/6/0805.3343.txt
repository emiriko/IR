We apply the fermion renormalization group method, implemented numerically by
Honerkamp et.al., to a two-band model of FeAs-based materials. At half filling
we find the $(\pi,0)$ or $(0,\pi)$ spin density wave order and a sub-dominant
superconducting pairing tendency. Due to a topological reason, the spin density
wave gap has nodes on the fermi surfaces. Away from half filling we find an
unconventional s-wave and a sub-dominant $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing instability. The
former has $s$ symmetry around the hole fermi surface but exhibits
$s+d_{x^2-y^2}$ symmetry around the electron pockets where the 90 degree
rotation is broken. The pairing mechanism is inter-pocket pair hopping.
Interestingly, the same interaction also drives the antiferromagnetism.
