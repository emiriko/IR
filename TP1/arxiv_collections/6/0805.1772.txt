We have analyzed theoretically the Zeeman splitting of hole-quantum-wire
subband edges. As is typical for any bound state, their g factor depends on
both an intrinsic g factor of the material and an additional contribution
arising from a finite bound-state orbital angular momentum. We discuss the
quantum-confinement-induced interplay between bulk-material and orbital
effects, which is nontrivial due to the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling.
A compact analytical formula is provided that elucidates this interplay and can
be useful for predicting Zeeman splitting in generic hole-wire geometries.
