We compute the integral torus-equivariant cohomology ring for weighted
projective space for two different torus actions by embedding the cohomology in
a sum of polynomial rings $\oplus_{i=0}^n \Z[t_1, t_2,..., t_n]$. One torus
action gives a result complementing that of Bahri, Franz, and Ray. For the
other torus action, each basis class for weighted projective space is a
multiple of the basis class for ordinary projective space; we identify each
multiple explicitly. We also give a simple formula for the structure constants
of the equivariant cohomology ring of ordinary projective space in terms of the
basis of Schubert classes, as a sequence of divided difference operators
applied to a specific polynomial.
