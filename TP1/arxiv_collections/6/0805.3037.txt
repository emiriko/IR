We present a method for the inclusion of finite width effects in the
simulation of Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics. In order to test the
validity of the method we compare our results with matrix elements for a range
of production and decay processes in the Standard Model, Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model (MSSM) and Minimal Universal Extra Dimensions model (MUED). This
procedure has been implemented in the Herwig++ event generator and will be
available in a forthcoming release.
