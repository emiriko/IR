The results of dc and ac magnetization, electrical resistance and heat
capacity studies in an admixed rare earth alloy Nd0.75Gd0.25Rh3B2, which is
close to the zero magnetization limit, are reported. Novel observations include
the two antiferromagnetic like transitions, concomitant repeated/multiple
magnetic compensation behaviour and a characteristic oscillatory magnetic
response, with temperature dependence of magnetization at low fields crossing
the M = 0 axis thrice. The effective coercive field relating to the residual
remanence also has an oscillatory response, with two minima located close to
two zero-crossover temperatures. The unusual behavior in Nd0.75Gd0.25Rh3B2 is
conjectured to arise from its anisotropic hexagonal structure, with planar
anisotropy, resulting in a quasi one dimensional electronic structure and the
accentuated role of conduction electron polarization near the zero
magnetization limit.
