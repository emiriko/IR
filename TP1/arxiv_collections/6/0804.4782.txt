The conditions for the cancellation of one loop contributions to vacuum
energy (both U.V. divergent and finite) coming from the Standard Model (SM)
fields are examined. It is proven that this is not possible unless one
introduces besides several bosons, at least one massive fermion having mass
within specific ranges. On examining one of the simplest SM extensions
satisfying the constraints one finds that the mass range of the lightest
massive boson is compatible with the present Higgs mass bounds. We do not
consider effects associated with condensates or renormalization group running.
