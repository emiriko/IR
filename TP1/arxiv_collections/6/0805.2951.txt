It is shown that the main features of the phase diagram for high Tc
superconductivity can be calculated as a function of doping in a simple,
essentially unique non-Landau/Fermi liquid with quartic interactions. The phase
diagram depends on a single parameter 0<gamma<1 determined by the strength of
the interaction at short distances. A new d-wave gap equation has solutions
that fall under a superconducting dome, which terminates at the renormalization
group fixed point. Optimal doping is estimated to occur just below 3/2 \pi^2.
The overall scale for Tc is set by the recently measured universal nodal Fermi
velocity and lattice spacing, and is estimated to be 120K < Tc < 160K for
LaSrCuO.
