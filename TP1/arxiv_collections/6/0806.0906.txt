In any Coxeter group, the set of elements whose principal order ideals are
boolean forms a simplicial poset under the Bruhat order. This simplicial poset
defines a cell complex, called the boolean complex. In this paper it is shown
that, for any Coxeter system of rank n, the boolean complex is homotopy
equivalent to a wedge of (n-1)-dimensional spheres. The number of such spheres
can be computed recursively from the unlabeled Coxeter graph, and defines a new
graph invariant called the boolean number. Specific calculations of the boolean
number are given for all finite and affine irreducible Coxeter systems, as well
as for systems with graphs that are disconnected, complete, or stars. One
implication of these results is that the boolean complex is contractible if and
only if a generator of the Coxeter system is in the center of the group. of
these results is that the boolean complex is contractible if and only if a
generator of the Coxeter system is in the center of the group.
