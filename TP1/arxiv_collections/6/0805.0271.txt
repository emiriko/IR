The inclusive semileptonic branching ratio is often employed to normalize
other inclusive B decays. Using recent determinations of the non-perturbative
parameters of the Operator Product Expansion we compute the normalization
factor for the branching ratio of B->X_s gamma and find a few percent
enhancement with respect to previous determinations.
