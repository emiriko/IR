Thoracocardiography approach pretends to non-invasively monitor stroke volume
by inductive plethysmographic recording of ventricular volume curves by a
transducer placed on the chest. The purpose of this study was to investigate
the potential of thoracocardiography to estimate stroke volumes while apnea
with open glottis. We hypothesized that, when glottis is open, stroke volumes
would be better estimated if airways flow curves were taken into account.
