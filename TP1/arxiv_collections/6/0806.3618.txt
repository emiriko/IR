We study the statistical mechanics of a closed random manifold of fixed area
and fluctuating volume, encapsulating a fixed number of noninteracting
particles. Scaling analysis yields a unified description of such swollen
manifolds, according to which the mean volume gradually increases with particle
number, following a single scaling law. This is markedly different from the
swelling under fixed pressure difference, where certain models exhibit
criticality. We thereby indicate when the swelling due to encapsulated
particles is thermodynamically inequivalent to that caused by fixed pressure.
The general predictions are supported by Monte Carlo simulations of two
particle-encapsulating model systems -- a two-dimensional self-avoiding ring
and a three-dimensional self-avoiding fluid vesicle. In the former the
particle-induced swelling is thermodynamically equivalent to the
pressure-induced one whereas in the latter it is not.
