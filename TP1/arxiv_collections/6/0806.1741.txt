We study the static potential between external quark-antiquark pairs in a
strongly coupled gauge theory with a large number of colors and massive
dynamical flavors, using a dual string description. When the constituent mass
of the dynamical quarks is set below a certain critical value, we find a first
order phase transition between a linear and a Coulomb-like regime. Above the
critical mass the two phases are smoothly connected. We also study the
dependence on the theory parameters of the quark-antiquark separation at which
the static configuration decays into specific static-dynamical mesons.
