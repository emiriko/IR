Let $(M,g)$ be a spacetime which admits a complete timelike conformal Killing
vector field $K$. We prove that $(M,g)$ splits globally as a standard
conformastationary spacetime with respect to $K$ if and only if $(M,g)$ is
distinguishing (and, thus causally continuous). Causal but non-distinguishing
spacetimes with complete stationary vector fields are also exhibited. For the
proof, the recently solved "folk problems" on smoothability of time functions
(moreover, the existence of a {\em temporal} function) are used.
