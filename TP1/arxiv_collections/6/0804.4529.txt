The Coulomb problem for charged massive vector bosons is known to be
unstable, the boson falls on the Coulomb center. It is shown that when the
charge of the Coulomb center is smeared over a small but finite volume, then
instead of the fall there appears a large series of bound states localized
inside the volume containing the Coulomb charge. It is shown also that the fall
on the Coulomb center is completely suppressed, when the conventional QED
vacuum polarization is taken into account.In gauge theories (SU(2), Standard
Model) the renormalizability of a theory may be insufficient to guarantee an
absence of the wave function collapse. Another interesting feature: the density
of charge of vector bosons can have a ``wrong'' sign.
