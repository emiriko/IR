We investigate the scenario of competing order (CO) induced Fermi arcs and
pseudogap in cuprate superconductors. For hole-type cuprates, both phenomena as
a function of temperature and doping level can be accounted for if the CO
vanishes at $T^{\ast}$ above the superconducting transition $T_c$ and the CO
wave-vector Q is parallel to the antinodal direction. In contrast, the absence
of these phenomena and the non-monotonic d-wave gap in electron-type cuprates
may be attributed to $T^{\ast} < T_c$ and a CO wave-vector Q parallel to the
nodal direction.
