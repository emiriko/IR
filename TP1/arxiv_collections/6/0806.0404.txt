Electronic transport through a 2D deca-nanometer length channel with
correlated and anti-correlated surfaces morphologies is studied using the
Keldysh non-equilibrium Green function technique. Due to the pseudo-periodicity
of these structures, the energy-resolved transmission possesses pseudo-bands
and pseudo-gaps. Channels with correlated surfaces exhibit wider pseudo-bands
than their anti-correlated counterparts. By surveying channels with various
combinations of material parameters, we found that a smaller transport mass
increases the channel transmittivity and energy bandwidth of the pseudo-bands.
A larger quantization mass yields a larger transmittivity in channels with
anti-correlated surfaces. For channels with correlated surfaces, the dependence
of transmittivity on quantization mass is complicated by odd-to-even mode
transitions. An enhanced threshold energy in the energy-resolved transmission
can also be observed in the presence of surface roughness. The computed
enhanced threshold energy was able to achieve agreement with the experimental
data for Si[110] and Si[100] devices.
