This paper is placed at the intersection-point between the study of
theoretical computational models aimed at capturing the essence of genetic
regulatory networks and the field of Artificial Embryology (or Computational
Development). A model is proposed, with the objective of providing an effective
way to generate arbitrary forms by using evolutionary-developmental techniques.
Preliminary experiments have been performed.
