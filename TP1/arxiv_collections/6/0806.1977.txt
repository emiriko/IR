We apply the pseudoparticle approach to SU(2) Yang-Mills theory and perform a
detailed study of the potential between two static charges for various
representations. Whereas for charges in the fundamental representation we find
a linearly rising confining potential, we clearly observe string breaking, when
considering charges in the adjoint representation. We also demonstrate Casimir
scaling and compute gluelump masses for different spin and parity. Numerical
results are in qualitative agreement with lattice results.
