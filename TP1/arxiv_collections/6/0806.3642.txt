The kinetics of the long-range spherical model evolving from various initial
states is studied. In particular, the large-time auto-correlation and -response
functions are obtained, for classes of long-range correlated initial states,
and for magnetized initial states. The ageing exponents can depend on certain
qualitative features of initial states. We explicitly find the conditions for
the system to cross over from ageing classes that depend on initial conditions
to those that do not.
