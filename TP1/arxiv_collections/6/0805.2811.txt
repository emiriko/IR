We perform a canonical quantization of gravity in a second-order formulation,
taking as configuration variables those describing a 4-bein, not adapted to the
space-time splitting. We outline how, neither if we fix the Lorentz frame
before quantizing, nor if we perform no gauge fixing at all, is invariance
under boost transformations affected by the quantization.
