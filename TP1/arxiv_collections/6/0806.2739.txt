Numerical quantum transport calculations are commonly based on a
tight-binding formulation. A wide class of quantum transport algorithms
requires the tight-binding Hamiltonian to be in the form of a block-tridiagonal
matrix. Here, we develop a matrix reordering algorithm based on graph
partitioning techniques that yields the optimal block-tridiagonal form for
quantum transport. The reordered Hamiltonian can lead to significant
performance gains in transport calculations, and allows to apply conventional
two-terminal algorithms to arbitrary complex geometries, including
multi-terminal structures. The block-tridiagonalization algorithm can thus be
the foundation for a generic quantum transport code, applicable to arbitrary
tight-binding systems. We demonstrate the power of this approach by applying
the block-tridiagonalization algorithm together with the recursive Green's
function algorithm to various examples of mesoscopic transport in
two-dimensional electron gases in semiconductors and graphene.
