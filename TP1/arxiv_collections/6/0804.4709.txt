It is widely known that the paradigmatic Chirikov-Taylor model presents
enhanced diffusion for specific intervals of its stochasticity parameter due to
islands of stability, which are elliptic orbits surrounding accelerator mode
fixed points. In contrast with normal diffusion, its effect has never been
analytically calculated. Here, we introduce a differential form for the
Perron-Frobenius evolution operator in which normal diffusion and
superdiffusion are treated separately through phases formed by angular wave
numbers. The superdiffusion coefficient is then calculated analytically
resulting in a Schloemilch series with an exponent $\beta=3/2$ for the
divergences. Numerical simulations support our results.
