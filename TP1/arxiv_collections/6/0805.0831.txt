We study systems with local vibrating potentials, one-dimensional single and
double wells and the tight-binding 1D model with single vibrating site. In
general, these systems transmit, or reflect particles inelastically, with
absorption or emission of several frequency quanta. Nevertheless, we have found
that at some conditions these systems can perfectly and elastically reflect
electrons. This high-frequency "blockade" give rise to unique possibility of
near-ideal localization of electron with the energy lying on the background of
continuous energy spectrum. We discuss different consequences of this
statement.
