The sequence of amino acids in a protein is believed to determine its native
state structure, which in turn is related to the functionality of the protein.
In addition, information pertaining to evolutionary relationships is contained
in homologous sequences. One powerful method for inferring these sequence
attributes is through comparison of a query sequence with reference sequences
that contain significant homology and whose structure, function, and/or
evolutionary relationships are already known. In spite of decades of concerted
work, there is no simple framework for deducing structure, function, and
evolutionary (SF&E) relationships directly from sequence information alone,
especially when the pair-wise identity is less than a threshold figure ~25%
[1,2]. However, recent research has shown that sequence identity as low as 8%
is sufficient to yield common structure/function relationships and sequence
identities as large as 88% may yet result in distinct structure and function
[3,4]. Starting with a basic premise that protein sequence encodes information
about SF&E, one might ask how one could tease out these measures in an unbiased
manner. Here we present a unified framework for inferring SF&E from sequence
information using a knowledge-based approach which generates phylogenetic
profiles in an unbiased manner. We illustrate the power of phylogenetic
profiles generated using the Gestalt Domain Detection Algorithm Basic Local
Alignment Tool (GDDA-BLAST) to derive structural domains, functional
annotation, and evolutionary relationships for a host of ion-channels and human
proteins of unknown function. These data are in excellent accord with published
data and new experiments. Our results suggest that there is a wealth of
previously unexplored information in protein sequence.
