Upper limits on direct photon production were determined as a function of the
transverse momentum for 0.7 < pT <= 3.2 GeV/c with the WA98 experiment in p+C
and p+Pb collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 17.4 GeV. The results are compared to direct
photon measurements in Pb+Pb collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 17.3 GeV by WA98.
Implications for a possible thermal direct photon contribution are discussed.
