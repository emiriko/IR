The general scale parameter, having the dimensions of mass squared, is
dynamically generated in the QCD gluon sector. It is introduced through the
difference between the regularized full gluon self-energy and its value at some
finite point. It violates transversality of the full gluon self-energy. The
Slavnov-Taylor identity for the full gluon propagator, when it is given by the
corresponding equation of motion, is also violated by it. So in order to
maintain both transversality and the identity it should be disregarded from the
very beginning, i.e., put formally zero everywhere. However, we have shown how
to preserve the above-mentioned identity at non-zero mass squared parameter.
This allows one to establish the structure of the full gluon propagator when it
is explicitly present. Its contribution does not survive in the perturbation
theory regime when the gluon momentum goes to infinity. At the same time, its
contribution dominates the structure of the full gluon propagator when the
gluon momentum goes to zero. We have also proposed a method how to restore
transversality of the relevant gluon propagator in a gauge invariant way, while
keeping the mass squared parameter "alive".
