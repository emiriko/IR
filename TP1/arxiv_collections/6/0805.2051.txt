The manner in which signals propagate through dense granular systems in both
space and time is not well understood. In order to learn more about this
process, we carry out discrete element simulations of the system response to
excitations where we control the driving frequency and wavelength
independently. Fourier analysis shows that properties of the signal depend
strongly on the spatial and temporal scales introduced by the perturbation. The
features of the response provide a test-bed for any continuum theory attempting
to predict signal properties. We illustrate this connection between micro-scale
physics and macro-scale behavior by comparing the system response to a simple
elastic model with damping.
