The existing experimental data on the d(n,p)nn and d(p,n)pp cross sections in
the forward direction are reviewed in terms of the Dean sum rule. It is shown
that the measurement of the ratio of the charge exchange on the deuteron to
that on the proton might, if taken together with other experimental data, allow
a direct construction of the np -> np scattering amplitude in the backward
direction with few ambiguities.
