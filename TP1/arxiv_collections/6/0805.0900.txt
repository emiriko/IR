A simple and effective method to fabricate a high fill-factor triangular
microlens array using the proximity printing in lithography process is
reported. The technology utilizes the UV proximity printing by controlling a
printing gap between the mask and substrate. The designed approximate triangle
microlens array pattern can be fabricated the high fill-factor triangular
microlens array in photoresist. It is due to the UV light diffraction to
deflect away from the aperture edges and produce a certain exposure in
photoresist material outside the aperture edges. This method can precisely
control the geometric profile of high fill factor triangular microlens array.
The experimental results showed that the triangular micro-lens array in
photoresist could be formed automatically when the printing gap ranged from 240
micrometers to 840 micrometers. The gapless triangular microlens array will be
used to increases of luminance for backlight module of liquid crystal displays.
