We control the current of a single particle quantum ratchet by designing
ramping schemes for experimentally accessible control parameters. We harvest on
Landau-Zener transitions between Floquet states. Adiabatic and diabatic ramping
allow to control the resulting directed transport. We find strong changes of
the current in the adiabatic regime. Simple loops in control parameter space
with alternating adiabatic and diabatic ramping are proposed. We obtain also
current reversal. Full desymmetrization of the quantum ratchet increases the
critical ramping speed which separates the adiabatic from the diabatic regime.
