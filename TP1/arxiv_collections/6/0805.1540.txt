The Froissart bound limmits the asymptotic s->infinity behavior of
crossections by (\pi/t_0) ln ^2 (s/{(s_0)} where t_0 is the lightest exchanged
particle, or more generally the nearest ssingularity, in the t channel. We
suggest that in comparing this bound with data at energies less than those of
LHC, gluebaall masses raather than the small pion mass should be used for
(t_0)^{1/2}.
