Fermions play a special role in homogeneous models of quantum cosmology
because the exclusion principle prevents them from forming sizable matter
contributions. They can thus describe the matter ingredients only truly
microscopically and it is not possible to avoid strong quantum regimes by
positing a large matter content. Moreover, possible parity violating effects
are important especially in loop quantum cosmology whose basic object is a
difference equation for the wave function of the universe defined on a discrete
space of triads. The two orientations of a triad are interchanged by a parity
transformation, which leaves the difference equation invariant for ordinary
matter. Here, we revisit and extend loop quantum cosmology by introducing
fermions and the gravitational torsion they imply, which renders the parity
issue non-trivial. A treatable locally rotationally symmetric Bianchi model is
introduced which clearly shows the role of parity. General wave functions
cannot be parity-even or odd, and parity violating effects in matter influence
the microscopic big bang transition which replaces the classical singularity in
loop quantum cosmology.
