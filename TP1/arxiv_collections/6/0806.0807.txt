Inclusive K0SK0S production in ep collisions at HERA was studied with the
ZEUS detector using an integrated luminosity of 0.5 fb-1. Enhancements in the
mass spectrum were observed and are attributed to the production of
f2(1270)/a02(1320), f'2(1525) and f0(1710). Masses and widths were obtained
using a fit which takes into account theoretical predictions based on SU(3)
symmetry arguments, and are consistent with the PDG values. The f0(1710) state,
which has a mass consistent with a glueball candidate, was observed with a
statistical significance of 5 standard deviations. However, if this state is
the same as that seen in gamma gamma -> K0SK0S, it is unlikely to be a pure
glueball state.
