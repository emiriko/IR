We present a simple method to create an in-plane lateral potential in a
semiconductor microcavity using a metal thin-film. Two types of potential are
produced: a circular aperture and a one-dimensional (1D) periodic grating
pattern. The amplitude of the potential induced by a 24 nm-6 nm Au/Ti film is
on the order of a few hundreds of ueV measured at 6 ~ 8 K. Since the metal
layer makes the electromagnetic fields to be close to zero at the
metal-semiconductor interface, the photon mode is confined more inside of the
cavity. As a consequence, the effective cavity length is reduced under the
metal film, and the corresponding cavity resonance is blue-shifted. Our
experimental results are in a good agreement with theoretical estimates. In
addition, by applying a DC electric voltage to the metal film, we are able to
modify the quantum well exciton mode due to the quantum confined Stark effect,
inducing a ~ 1 meV potential at ~ 20 kV/cm. Our method produces a controllable
in-plane spatial trap potential for lower exciton-polaritons (LPs), which can
be a building block towards 1D arrays and 2D lattices of LP condensates.
