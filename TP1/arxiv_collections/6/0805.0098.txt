Global strangeness production in relativistic heavy ion collisions at SPS and
RHIC is reviewed. Special emphasis is put on the comparison with the
statistical model and the canonical suppression mechanism. It is shown that
recent RHIC data on strange particle production as a function of centrality can
be explained by a superposition of a fully equilibrated hadron gas and particle
emission from single independent nucleon-nucleon collisions in the outer
corona.
