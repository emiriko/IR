We present experimental results relative to superluminal propagation based on
a single photon traversing an optical system, called 4f-system, which acts
singularly on the photon's spectral component phases. A single photon is
created by a CW laser light down{conversion process. The introduction of a
linear spectral phase function will lead to the shift of the photon peak far
beyond the coherence length of the photon itself (an apparent superluminal
propagation of the photon). Superluminal group velocity detection is done by
interferometric measurement of the temporal shifted photon with its correlated
untouched reference. The observed superluminal photon propagation complies with
causality. The operation of the optical system allows to enlighten the origin
of the apparent superluminal photon velocity. The experiment foresees a
superluminal effect with single photon wavepackets.
