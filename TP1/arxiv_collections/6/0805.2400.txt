Starting from a uniform d-wave superconducting phase we study the energy cost
due to imposed unidirectional defects with a vanishing pairing amplitude. Both
renormalized mean-field theory and variational Monte Carlo calculations within
the t-J model yield that the energies of inhomogeneous and uniform phases are
very close to each other. This suggests that small perturbations in the
microscopic Hamiltonian, might lead to inhomogeneous superconducting phases in
real materials as observed in recent scanning tunneling microscopy on
Ca_{2-x}Na_xCuO_2Cl_2.
