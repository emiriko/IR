Discrete models of dislocations in cubic crystal lattices having one or two
atoms per unit cell are proposed. These models have the standard linear
anisotropic elasticity as their continuum limit and their main ingredients are
the elastic stiffness constants of the material and a dimensionless periodic
function that restores the translation invariance of the crystal and influences
the dislocation size. For these models, conservative and damped equations of
motion are proposed. In the latter case, the entropy production and
thermodynamic forces are calculated and fluctuation terms obeying the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem are added. Numerical simulations illustrate
static perfect screw and 60$^\circ$ dislocations for GaAs and Si.
