In order to later find explicit analytic solutions, we investigate the
singularity structure of a fundamental model of nonlinear optics, the four-wave
mixing model in one space variable z. This structure is quite similar, and this
is not a surprise, to that of the cubic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. The
main result is that, in order to be single valued, time-dependent solutions
should depend on the space-time coordinates through the reduced variable
xi=\sqrt{z} exp(-t / tau), in which tau is the relaxation time.
