A phase transition for bosonic atoms in a two-dimensional anisotropic optical
lattice is considered. If the tunnelling rates in two directions are different,
the system can undergo a transition between a two-dimensional superfluid and a
one-dimensional Mott insulating array of strongly coupled tubes. The connection
to other lattice models is exploited in order to better understand the phase
transition. Critical properties are obtained using quantum Monte Carlo
calculations. These critical properties are related to correlation properties
of the bosons and a criterion for commensurate filling is established.
