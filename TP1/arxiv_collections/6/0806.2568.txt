The spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg model on the triangulated Kagome
(triangles-in-triangles) lattice is exactly solved by establishing a precise
mapping correspondence to the simple spin-1/2 Ising model on Kagome lattice. It
is shown that the disordered spin liquid state, which otherwise occurs in the
ground state of this frustrated spin system on assumption that there is a
sufficiently strong antiferromagnetic intra-trimer interaction, is eliminated
from the ground state by arbitrary but non-zero Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
anisotropy.
