We study localized modes on the surface of a three-dimensional dynamical
lattice. The stability of these structures on the surface is investigated and
compared to that in the bulk of the lattice. Typically, the surface makes the
stability region larger, an extreme example of that being the three-site
"horseshoe"-shaped structure, which is always unstable in the bulk, while at
the surface it is stable near the anti-continuum limit. We also examine effects
of the surface on lattice vortices. For the vortex placed parallel to the
surface this increased stability region feature is also observed, while the
vortex cannot exist in a state normal to the surface. More sophisticated
localized dynamical structures, such as five-site horseshoes and pyramids, are
also considered.
