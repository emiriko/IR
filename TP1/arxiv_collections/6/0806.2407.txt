A particle rotor model with a quasi-neutron coupled with a triaxially
deformed rotor is applied to study signature splitting for bands with intruder
orbital $\nu7/2^{+} [633]$ and non-intruder orbital $\nu5/2^{-}[512]$ in
$^{173}$W. Excellent agreement with the observed energy spectra has been
achieved for both bands. Signature splitting for band $\nu7/2^{+} [633]$, and
band $\nu5/2^{-}[512]$ before the onset of signature inversion, is
satisfactorily reproduced by introducing the $\gamma$ degree of freedom. The
phase and amplitude of signature splitting in band $\nu5/2^{-}[512]$ is
attributed to strong competition between $2f_{7/2}$ and $1h_{9/2}$ components.
However, the explanation of signature inversion in band $\nu5/2^{-}[512]$
self-consistently is beyond the present one quasi-neutron coupled with a
triaxially deformed rotor.
