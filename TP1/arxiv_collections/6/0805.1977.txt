Motivated by recent quantum oscillation observations in the underdoped
high-temperature superconductors, the effect of the short-range
antiferromagnetic correlations on the electronic properties of the short-ranged
d-density wave state is investigated. At intermediate d-density wave
correlations, the cross section of the energy dispersion at the Fermi energy
consists of hole pockets and an electron pocket. It is argued that the electron
pocket feature is smeared out by the effect of the short-range
antiferromagnetic correlation, which could be the reason why any electron
pockets have never been observed in the angle resolved photoemission
experiments. The Hall resistance is calculated for the system with the electron
band and the hole band using a finite temperature formula assuming Dirac
fermion spectrum for the latter. It is argued that the scattering effect in the
hole band should be anomalously large or much suppressed by superconductivity
correlations and/or vortex contributions to explain the recent quantum
oscillation observations.
