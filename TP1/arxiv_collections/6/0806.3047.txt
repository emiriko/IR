Standard parton distribution functions contain neither information on the
correlations between partons nor on their transverse motion, then a vital
knowledge about the three dimensional structure of the nucleon is lost. Hard
exclusive processes, in particular DVCS, are essential reactions to go beyond
this standard picture. In the following, we examine the most recent data in
view of the dipole model predictions and their implication on the quarks/gluons
imaging (tomography) of the nucleon.
