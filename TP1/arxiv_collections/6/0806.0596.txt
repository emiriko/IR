In this paper we prove local-global principles for embedding of fields with
involution into central simple algebras with involution over a global field.
These should be of interest in study of classical groups over global fields. We
deduce from our results that in a group of type D_n, n>4 even, two weakly
commensurable Zariski-dense S-arithmetic subgroups are actually commensurable.
A consequence of this result is that given an absolutely simple algebraic
K-group G of type D_n, n>4 even, K a number field, any K-form G' of G having
the same set of isomorphism classes of maximal K-tori as G, is necessarily
K-isomorphic to G. These results lead to results about isolength and
isospectral compact hyperbolic spaces of dimension 2n-1 with n even.
