We report on the high resolution photoassociation spectroscopy of a $^{87}$Rb
spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate to the $1_\mathrm{g} (P_{3/2}) v = 152$ excited
molecular states. We demonstrate the use of spin dependent photoassociation to
experimentally identify the molecular states and their corresponding initial
scattering channel. These identifications are in excellent agreement with the
eigenvalues of a hyperfine-rotational Hamiltonian. Using the observed spectra
we estimate the change in scattering length and identify photoassociation laser
light frequency ranges that maximize the change in the spin-dependent
mean-field interaction energy.
