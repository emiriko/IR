We address truncated states of continuous variable systems and analyze their
statistical properties numerically by generating random states in
finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In particular, we focus to the distribution
of purity and non-Gaussianity for dimension up to d=21. We found that both
quantities are distributed around typical values with variances that decrease
for increasing dimension. Approximate formulas for typical purity and
non-Gaussianity as a function of the dimension are derived.
