Maurice Jacob played a key role in bringing together different groups from
the experimental and theoretical nuclear and particle physics communities to
initiate an ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collision program at the CERN SPS, in
order to search for the quark-gluon plasma. I review the history of this
program from its beginnings to the time when the Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) started operation. I
close by providing a glimpse of the important discoveries made at RHIC and
giving an outlook towards heavy-ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC). During Maurice's life and not least through his perpetually strong
influence, relativistic heavy-ion physics has matured and led to discoveries
that radiate into many other fields of physics. Heavy-ion physicists owe a
great deal to Maurice Jacob.
