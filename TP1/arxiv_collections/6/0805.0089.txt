We present derived I-E curves that match Zenier curves used to fit data
experimentally with wavefunctionals congruent with the false vacuum hypothesis.
The open question is whether the coefficients picked in both the
wavefunctionals and the magnitude of the coefficients of the driven sine Gordon
physical system should be picked by topological charge arguments that in
principle appear to assign values that have a tie in with the false vacuum
hypothesis first presented by Sidney Coleman. Our supposition is that indeed
this is useful and that the topological arguments give evidence as to a first
order phase transition which gives credence to the observed and calculated I-E
curve as evidence of a quantum switching phenomena in density wave physics, one
which we think with further development would have applications to quantum
computing, via quantum coherent phase evolution, as outlined in this paper .
This analysis is enhanced by a new phi to the fourth power field theory
treatment of how to model field theory in real time evolution as given to the
