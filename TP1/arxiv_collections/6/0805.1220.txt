The cores of edge dislocations, edge dislocation dipoles and edge dislocation
loops in planar graphene have been studied by means of periodized discrete
elasticity models. To build these models, we have found a way to discretize
linear elasticity on a planar hexagonal lattice using combinations of
difference operators that do not involve symmetrically all the neighbors of an
atom. At zero temperature, dynamically stable cores of edge dislocations may be
heptagon-pentagon pairs (glide dislocations) or octagons (shuffle dislocations)
depending on the choice of initial configuration. Possible cores of edge
dislocation dipoles are vacancies, pentagon-octagon-pentagon divacancies,
Stone-Wales defects and 7-5-5-7 defects. While symmetric vacancies, divacancies
and 7-5-5-7 defects are dynamically stable, asymmetric vacancies and 5-7-7-5
Stone-Wales defects seem to be unstable.
