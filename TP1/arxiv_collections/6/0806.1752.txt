We study the focusing 3d cubic NLS equation with H^1 data at the mass-energy
threshold, namely, when M[u_0]E[u_0] = M[Q]E[Q]. In earlier works of
Holmer-Roudenko and Duyckaerts-Holmer-Roudenko, the behavior of solutions
(i.e., scattering and blow up in finite time) is classified when M[u_0]E[u_0] <
M[Q]E[Q]. In this paper, we first exhibit 3 special solutions: e^{it}Q and Q^+,
Q^-; here Q is the ground state, and Q^+, Q^- exponentially approach the ground
state solution in the positive time direction, meanwhile Q^+ having finite time
blow up and Q^- scattering in the negative time direction. Secondly, we
classify solutions at this threshold and obtain that up to \dot{H}^{1/2}
symmetries, they behave exactly as the above three special solutions, or
scatter and blow up in both time directions as the solutions below the
mass-energy threshold. These results are obtained by studying the spectral
properties of the linearized Schroedinger operator in this mass-supercritical
case, establishing relevant modulational stability and careful analysis of the
exponentially decaying solutions to the linearized equation.
