Current polarization induced rectification of the quantized Hall plateaus
(QHPs) is studied within a Hartree type mean field approximation for
asymmetrically depleted samples. We first investigate the existence of the
current carrying incompressible strips (ISs), by solving the self-consistent
equations, and their influence on magneto-transport (MT) properties. Next, the
widths of the ISs are examined in terms of the steepness of the confining
potential profile considering gate defined Hall bars. The corresponding MT
coefficients are calculated using a local Ohm's law for a large fixed current
and are compared for symmetric and asymmetric depleted samples. We predict
that, the extend of the QHPs strongly depend on the current polarization, in
the out of linear response regime, when considering asymmetrically depleted
samples. Our results, concerning the extend of the QHPs depending on the
current polarization are in contrast to the ones of the conventional theories
of the integer quantized Hall effect (IQHE). We propose certain experimental
conditions to test our theoretical predictions at high mobility, narrow
samples.
