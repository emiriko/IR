In this paper, we show that, for scalar reaction-diffusion equations on the
circle S1, the property of hyperbolicity of all equilibria and periodic orbits
is generic with respect to the non-linearity . In other words, we prove that in
an appropriate functional space of nonlinear terms in the equation, the set of
functions, for which all equilibria and periodic orbits are hyperbolic, is a
countable intersection of open dense sets. The main tools in the proof are the
property of the lap number and the Sard-Smale theorem.
