We report measurements of charmed hadron production from hadronic
($D^{0}\rightarrow K\pi$) and semileptonic ($\mu$ and $e$) decays in 200 GeV
Au+Au collisions at RHIC. Analysis of the spectra indicates that charmed
hadrons have a different radial flow pattern from light or multi-strange
hadrons. Charm cross sections at mid-rapidity are extracted by combining the
three independent measurements, covering the transverse momentum range that
contributes to $\sim$90% of the integrated cross section. The cross sections
scale with number of binary collisions of the initial nucleons, a signature of
charm production exclusively at the initial impact of colliding heavy ions. The
implications for charm quark interaction and thermalization in the strongly
interacting matter are discussed.
