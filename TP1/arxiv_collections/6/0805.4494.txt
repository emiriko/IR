In this paper we find a connection between the macroscopic classical laws of
gases and the quantum mechanical description of molecules, composing an ideal
gas. In such a gas, the motion of each individual molecule can be considered
independently on all other molecules, and thus the macroscopic parameters of
ideal gas, like pressure P and temperature T, can be introduced as a result of
simple averaging over all individual motions of molecules. It is shown that for
an ideal gas enclosed in a macroscopic cubic box of volume V, the constant, in
the classical law of adiabatic expansion, i.e.PV^5/3=const, can be derived,
based on quantum mechanics. Physical implications of the result we disclose are
discussed. In any case, our finding proves, seemingly for the first time, a
macroscopic manifestation of a quantum mechanical behavior, and this in
relation to classical thermodynamics.
