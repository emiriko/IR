This paper describes the development of metallic bipolar plate fabrication
using micro-electroforming process for mini-DMFC (direct methanol fuel cell)
stacks. Ultraviolet (UV) lithography was used to define micro-fluidic channels
using a photomask and exposure process. Micro-fluidic channels mold with 300
micrometers thick and 500 micrometers wide were firstly fabricated in a
negative photoresist onto a stainless steel plate. Copper micro-electroforming
was used to replicate the micro-fluidic channels mold. Following by sputtering
silver (Ag) with 1.2 micrometers thick, the metallic bipolar plates were
completed. The silver layer is used for corrosive resistance. The completed
mini-DMFC stack is a 2x2 cm2 fuel cell stack including a 1.5x1.5 cm2 MEA
(membrane electrode assembly). Several MEAs were assembly into mini-DMFC stacks
using the completed metallic bipolar plates. All test results showed the
metallic bipolar plates suitable for mini-DMFC stacks. The maximum output power
density is 9.3mW/cm2 and current density is 100 mA/cm2 when using 8 vol. %
methanol as fuel and operated at temperature 30 degrees C. The output power
result is similar to other reports by using conventional graphite bipolar
plates. However, conventional graphite bipolar plates have certain difficulty
to be machined to such micro-fluidic channels. The proposed
micro-electroforming metallic bipolar plates are feasible to miniaturize DMFC
stacks for further portable 3C applications.
