The transformation media concept based on the form-invariant Maxwell's
equations under coordinate transformations has opened up new possibilities to
manipulate the electromagnetic fields. In this paper we report on applying the
finite-embedded coordinate transformation method to design electromagnetic beam
modulating devices both in the Cartesian coordinates and in the cylindrical
coordinates. By designing the material constitutive tensors of the
transformation optical structures through different kinds of coordinate
transformations, either the beam width of an incident Gaussian plane wave could
be modulated by a slab, or the wave propagating direction of an
omni-directional source could be modulated through a cylindrical shell. We
present the design procedures and the full wave electromagnetic simulations
that clearly confirm the performance of the proposed beam modulating devices.
