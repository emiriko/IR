We present a first-principles study of heat conduction in a class of models
which exhibit a new multi-step local thermalization mechanism which gives rise
to Fourier's law. Local thermalization in our models occurs as the result of
binary collisions among locally confined gas particles. We explore the
conditions under which relaxation to local equilibrium, which involves no
energy exchange, takes place on time scales shorter than that of the binary
collisions which induce local thermalization. The role of this mechanism in
multi-phase material systems such as aerogels is discussed.
