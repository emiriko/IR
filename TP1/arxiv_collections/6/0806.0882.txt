We propose a comprehensive dynamical model for cooperative motion of
self-propelled particles, e.g., flocking, by combining well-known elements such
as velocity-alignment interactions, spatial interactions, and angular noise
into a unified Lagrangian treatment. Noise enters into our model in an
especially realistic way: it incorporates correlations, is highly nonlinear,
and it leads to a unique collective behavior. Our results show distinct
stability regions and an apparent change in the nature of one class of
noise-induced phase transitions, with respect to the mean velocity of the
group, as the range of the velocity-alignment interaction increases. This
phase-transition change comes accompanied with drastic modifications of the
microscopic dynamics, from nonintermittent to intermittent. Our results
facilitate the understanding of the origin of the phase transitions present in
other treatments.
