We provide a general scheme to predict and derive the contribution to the
noise spectrum of a stochastic sequence of pulses from the distribution of
pulse parameters. An example is the magnetization noise spectra of a 2D Ising
system near its phase transition. At $T\le T_c$, the low frequency spectra is
dominated by magnetization flips of nearly the entire system. We find that both
the predicted and the analytically derived spectra fit those produced from
simulations. Subtracting this contribution leaves the high frequency spectra
which follow a power law set by the critical exponents.
