Lepton-flavour symmetry in the Standard Model is broken by small masses for
charged leptons and neutrinos. Introducing neutrino masses via dimension-5
operators associated to lepton-number violation at a very high scale, the
corresponding coupling matrix may still have entries of order 1, resembling the
situation in the quark sector with large top Yukawa coupling. As we have shown
recently, in such a situation one may introduce the coupling matrices between
lepton and Higgs fields as non-linear representations of lepton-flavour
symmetry within an effective-theory framework. This allows us to separate the
effects related to the large mass difference observed in atmospheric neutrino
oscillations from those related to the solar mass difference. We discuss the
cases of normal or inverted hierarchical and almost degenerate neutrino
spectrum, give some examples to illustrate minimal lepton-flavour violation in
radiative and leptonic decays, and also provide a systematic definition of
next-to-minimal lepton-flavour violation within the non-linear framework.
