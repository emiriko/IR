In many cases, the computation of a neural system can be reduced to a
receptive field, or a set of linear filters, and a thresholding function, or
gain curve, which determines the firing probability; this is known as a
linear/nonlinear model. In some forms of sensory adaptation, these linear
filters and gain curve adjust very rapidly to changes in the variance of a
randomly varying driving input. An apparently similar but previously unrelated
issue is the observation of gain control by background noise in cortical
neurons: the slope of the firing rate vs current (f-I) curve changes with the
variance of background random input. Here, we show a direct correspondence
between these two observations by relating variance-dependent changes in the
gain of f-I curves to characteristics of the changing empirical
linear/nonlinear model obtained by sampling. In the case that the underlying
system is fixed, we derive relationships relating the change of the gain with
respect to both mean and variance with the receptive fields derived from
reverse correlation on a white noise stimulus. Using two conductance-based
model neurons that display distinct gain modulation properties through a simple
change in parameters, we show that coding properties of both these models
quantitatively satisfy the predicted relationships. Our results describe how
both variance-dependent gain modulation and adaptive neural computation result
from intrinsic nonlinearity.
