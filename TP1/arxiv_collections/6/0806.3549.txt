We construct the fundamental solution of $\partial_t-\Delta_y- q(t,y)$, for
functions $q$ with a certain integral space-time relative smallness, in
particular for those satisfying a relative Kato condition. The resulting
transition density is comparable to the Gaussian kernel in finite time, and it
is even asymptotically equal to the Gaussian kernel (in small time) under the
relative Kato condition.
  The result is generalized to arbitrary strictly positive and finite
time-nonhomogeneous transition densities on measure spaces.
  We also discuss specific applications to Schr\"odinger perturbations of the
fractional Laplacian in view of the fact that the 3P Theorem holds for the
fundamental solution corresponding to the operator.
