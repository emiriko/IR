Recent developments in the many-body perturbative QCD theory of inelastic
parton interactions in dense nuclear matter and the phenomenology of
strongly-interacting hard probes in heavy ion collisions are reviewed. We
highlight the progress that has been made toward consistent comparison between
radiative and collisional energy loss, the exploration of novel heavy flavor
suppression mechanisms in the quark-gluon plasma, and the determination of the
stopping power of cold nuclear matter. Future directions and opportunities for
jet physics in nuclear collisions, enabled by the unprecedentedly high center
of mass energies at the LHC, are also discussed. We propose that the physics of
jet shapes and a generalizations of the well-understood inclusive particle
suppression in the QGP will provide a new differential, and accurate test of
the underlying QCD theory and a new precision tool for jet tomography at the
LHC.
