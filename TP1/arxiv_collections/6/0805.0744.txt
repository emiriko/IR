This paper describes an original experimental procedure to measure mechanical
interactions between tongue and teeth during speech production. Using
edentulous people as subjects, pressure transducers are inserted in their
complete denture duplicate. Physiology is respected during sound and pressure
recording as with standard complete denture. Original calibration device is
also described in order to know what kind of information can be extracted from
the data. The measurements are realized in different experimental conditions in
order to remove the auditory and the orosensory feedbacks. Then the first
results of the pilot study are presented
