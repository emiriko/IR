The antiferromagnetic transition is investigated in the rare-earth (R)
tritelluride RTe3 family of charge density wave (CDW) compounds via specific
heat, magnetization and resistivity measurements. Observation of the opening of
a superzone gap in the resistivity of DyTe3 indicates that additional nesting
of the reconstructed Fermi surface in the CDW state plays an important role in
determining the magnetic structure.
