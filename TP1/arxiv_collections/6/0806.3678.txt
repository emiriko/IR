Stringent physical constraints relate the $J/\psi$ produced at a given
transverse momentum $p_T$ to the Bjorken-$x$ of the initial gluons. We present
a new approach which takes them into account in order to explicitely
investigate the $p_T$-dependence of the shadowing effect on the $J/\psi$
production. Using the $J/\psi$ rapidity and $p_T$ spectra extracted from
$\sqrt{s}=200\mathrm{GeV}$ p + p data from PHENIX, we build a Glauber
Monte-Carlo code which includes shadowing in two alternative ways: multiple
scattering corrections or $Q^2$ evolution of parton densities. We present our
results in d + Au collisions at the same energy, notably providing the first
prediction of the $J/\psi$ nuclear modification factor as a function of $p_T$,
and compare them to the available data by adding some nuclear absorption
effect.
