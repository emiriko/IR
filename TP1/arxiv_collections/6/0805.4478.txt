We study the thermodynamics of massless phi-fourth theory using screened
perturbation theory. In this method, the perturbative expansion is reorganized
by adding and subtracting a thermal mass term in the Lagrangian. We calculate
the free energy through four loops expanding in a double power expansion in m/T
and g^2, where m is the thermal mass and g is the coupling constant. The
expansion is truncated at order g^7 and the loop expansion is shown to have
better convergence properties than the weak-coupling expansion. The free energy
at order g^6 involves the four-loop triangle sum-integral evaluated by Gynther,
Laine, Schroeder, Torrero, and Vuorinen using methods developed by Arnold and
Zhai. The evaluation of the free energy at order g^7 requires the evaluation of
a nontrivial three-loop sum-integral, which we calculate by the same methods.
