Micro-indentation test with a micro flat-end cone indenter was employed to
simulate micro embossing process and investigate the thermo-mechanical response
of ceramic green substrates. The laminated low temperature co-fired ceramic
green tapes were used as the testing material ; the correlations of indentation
depth versus applied force and applied stress at the temperatures of 25 degrees
C and 75degrees C were studied. The results showed that permanent indentation
cavities could be formed at temperatures ranging from 25 degrees C to 75
degrees C, and the depth of cavities created was applied force, temperature and
dwell time dependent. Creep occurred and made a larger contribution to the
plastic deformation at elevated temperatures and high peak loads. There was
instantaneous recovery during the unloading and retarded recovery in the first
day after indentation. There was no significant pile-up due to material flow
observed under compression at the temperature up to 75 degrees C. The plastic
deformation was the main cause for formation of cavity on the ceramic green
substrate under compression. The results can be used as a guideline for
embossing ceramic green substrates.
