Raman and calorimetric studies on Ge_xSe_{1-x} glasses have provided evidence
for the existence of the intermediate phase (IP) in chalcogenide and other
glasses. Here, we present X-Ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES)
measurements on germanium selenide glasses in the IP composition range, and
detect an electronic signature of the IP. Ab initio molecular dynamics (MD)
based models of these glasses are discussed, and an atomistic picture of the
IP, based upon the models and available experiments is presented. We show that
these models reproduce detailed composition-dependent structure in the XANES
measurements, and otherwise appear to properly represent the structure of the
GeSe glasses near the IP.
