A single linear optical set-up is used to observe an entire family of
four-photon entangled states. This approach breaks with the inflexibility of
present linear-optical set-ups usually designed for the observation of a
particular multi-partite entangled state only. The family includes several
prominent entangled states that are known to be highly relevant for quantum
information applications.
