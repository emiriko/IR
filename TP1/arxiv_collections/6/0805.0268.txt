A new approach on cryptanalysis is proposed where the goal is to explore the
fundamental limits of a specific class of attacks against a particular
cryptosystem. As a first step, the approach is applied on ABSG, which is an
LFSR-based stream cipher where irregular decimation techniques are utilized.
Consequently, under some mild assumptions, which are common in cryptanalysis,
the tight lower bounds on the algorithmic complexity of successful Query-Based
Key-Recovery attacks are derived for two different setups of practical
interest. The proofs rely on the concept of ``typicality'' of information
theory.
