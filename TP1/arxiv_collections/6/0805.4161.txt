The text contains introduction and preliminary definitions and results to my
talk on category theory description of supersymmetries and integrability in
string theory. In the talk I plan to present homological and homotopical
algebra framework for Calabi-Yau supermanifolds and stacks in open and closed
string theory. In the framework we investigate supersymmetries and
integrability.
