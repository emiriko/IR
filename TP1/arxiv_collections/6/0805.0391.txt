The technique of density matrix equation (DME) for a small system interacting
with a bath is explained in detail. Special attention is given to the
nonsecular DME that is needed in the vicinity of overdamped tunnelling
resonances in molecular magnets (MM). The relaxation terms of the DME for MM
are represented in the universal form that does not employ any unknown
spin-lattice coupling constants and absorbs the information about the spin
Hamiltonian in the exact basis states and transition frequencies. This makes
adding new types of anisotropy easy and error-free. The Mathematica code is
available from the author.
