An event-based integration scheme for an integrate-and-fire neuron model with
exponentially decaying excitatory synaptic currents and double exponential
inhibitory synaptic currents has recently been introduced by Carnevale and
Hines. This integration scheme imposes non-physiological constraints on the
time constants of the synaptic currents it attempts to model which hamper the
general applicability. This paper addresses this problem in two ways. First, we
provide physical arguments to show why these constraints on the time constants
can be relaxed. Second, we give a formal proof showing which constraints can be
abolished. This proof rests on a generalization of the Carnevale-Hines lemma,
which is a new tool for comparing double exponentials as they naturally occur
in many cascaded decay systems including receptor-neurotransmitter dissociation
followed by channel closing. We show that this lemma can be generalized and
subsequently used for lifting most of the original constraints on the time
constants. Thus we show that the Carnevale-Hines integration scheme for the
integrate-and-fire model can be employed for simulating a much wider range of
neuron and synapse type combinations than is apparent from the original
treatment.
