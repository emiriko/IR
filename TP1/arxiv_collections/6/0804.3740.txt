We study top-antitop pair production and top spin correlations in a model
with an electrically neutral massive gauge boson, Z', at the Large Hadron
Collider. In addition to the Standard Model processes, the Z' contributes to
the top-antitop pair production process in the s-channel. Choosing a
kinematical region of top invariant mass around the Z' resonance pole, we find
sizable deviations of the top-antitop pair production cross section and the top
spin correlations from those of the Standard Model.
