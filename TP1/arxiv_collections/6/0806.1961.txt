We report the observation of beatings of the coincidence event rate in a
Hong-Ou-Mandel interference (HOMI) between signal and idler photons from a
parametric downconversion (PDC) process inside a multi-mode KTP waveguide. As
explanation we introduce bi-photonic states entangled in their broadband
frequency modes generated by waveguide mode triples and propose a suitable
entanglement detection scheme.
