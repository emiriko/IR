The Collins effect connects transverse quark spin with a measurable azimuthal
asymmetry in the yield of hadronic fragments around the quark's momentum
vector. Using two different reconstruction methods we measure statistically
significant azimuthal asymmetries for charged pion pairs in e+e- annihilation
at center-of-mass energies of 10.52 GeV and 10.58 GeV, which can be attributed
to the fragmentation of primordial quarks with transverse spin components. The
measurement was performed using a dataset of 547 fb^{-1} collected by the Belle
detector at KEKB improving the statistics of the previously published results
by nearly a factor of 20.
