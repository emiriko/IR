Let N be a complete, simply-connected surface of constant curvature \kappa
\leq 0. Moreover, suppose that \Omega and \tilde{\Omega} are strictly convex
domains in N with the same area. We show that there exists an area-preserving
diffeomorphism from \Omega to \tilde{\Omega} whose graph is a minimal
submanifold of N \times N.
