We propose a measurement on the elastic $\pi\pi$ scattering phase shift
difference $\delta^0_0-\delta^2_0$ through $\Psi'\to J/\Psi \pi^+ \pi^-$
process in future high statistics BES-III experiment. The decay amplitude is
constructed with seven Lorentz invariant form-factors and is compared with
their theoretical estimation. It is found that the phase shift difference can
be obtained, based on a Monte Carlo study and it is expected the phase shift in
the energy region between 350 MeV to 550 MeV can be measured at future BES-III.
