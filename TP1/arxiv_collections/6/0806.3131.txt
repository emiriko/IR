The affine Dynkin diagram of type $A_n^{(1)}$ has a cyclic symmetry. The
analogue of this Dynkin diagram automorphism on the level of crystals is called
a promotion operator. In this paper we show that the only irreducible type
$A_n$ crystals which admit a promotion operator are the highest weight crystals
indexed by rectangles. In addition we prove that on the tensor product of two
type $A_n$ crystals labeled by rectangles, there is a single connected
promotion operator. We conjecture this to be true for an arbitrary number of
tensor factors. Our results are in agreement with Kashiwara's conjecture that
all `good' affine crystals are tensor products of Kirillov-Reshetikhin
crystals.
