The prime number decomposition of a finite dimensional Hilbert space reflects
itself in the representations that the space accommodates. The representations
appear in conjugate pairs for factorization to two relative prime factors which
can be viewed as two distinct degrees freedom. These, Schwinger's quantum
degrees of freedom, are uniquely related to a von Neumann lattices in the phase
space that characterizes the Hilbert space and specifies the simultaneous
definitions of both (modular) positions and (modular) momenta. The area in
phase space for each quantum state in each of these quantum degrees of freedom,
is shown to be exactly $h$, Planck's constant.
