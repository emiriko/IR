Electroweak Sudakov logarithms at high energy, of the form alpha/sin^2
theta_W^n log^m s/M_{Z,W}^2, are summed using effective theory (EFT) methods.
The exponentiation of Sudakov logarithms and factorization is discussed in the
EFT formalism. Radiative corrections are computed to scattering processes in
the standard model involving an arbitrary number of external particles. The
computations include non-zero particle masses such as the t-quark mass,
electroweak mixing effects which lead to unequal W and Z masses and a massless
photon, and Higgs corrections proportional to the top quark Yukawa coupling.
The structure of the radiative corrections, and which terms are summed by the
EFT renormalization group is discussed in detail. The omitted terms are smaller
than 1%. We give numerical results for the corrections to dijet production,
dilepton production, t-\bar t production, and squark pair production. The
purely electroweak corrections are significant -- about 15% at 1 TeV,
increasing to 30% at 5 TeV, and they change both the scattering rate and
angular distribution. The QCD corrections (which are well-known) are also
computed with the EFT. They are much larger -- about a factor of four at 1 TeV,
increasing to a factor of thirty at 5 TeV. Mass effects are also significant;
the q \bar q -> t \bar t rate is enchanced relative to the light-quark
production rate by 40%.
