Complex networks are characterized by heterogeneous distributions of the
degree of nodes, which produce a large diversification of the roles of the
nodes within the network. Several centrality measures have been introduced to
rank nodes based on their topological importance within a graph. Here we review
and compare centrality measures based on spectral properties of graph matrices.
We shall focus on PageRank, eigenvector centrality and the hub/authority scores
of HITS. We derive simple relations between the measures and the (in)degree of
the nodes, in some limits. We also compare the rankings obtained with different
centrality measures.
