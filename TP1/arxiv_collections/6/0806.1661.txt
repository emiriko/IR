We report on the synthesis and microstructural studies of fluorine based iron
doped superconductors. We have successfully synthesized the fluorine based new
superconducting material LaO1-xFxFeAs by choosing comparatively lower
temperature and longer synthesis duration. The superconducting transition
temperature that we have achieved is 27.5 K which is observed at doping level
of x=0.2. The structural microstructural characterizations have been done by
employing XRD, SEM and TEM techniques. The SEM and TEM micrographs reveal the
layered structure.
