The electronic structure of the anomalous $\delta$-phase of Pu is analyzed by
a general and exact reformulation of the exchange energy of the $f$-shell. It
is found that the dominating contribution to the exchange energy is a
polarization of orbital spin-currents that preserves the time reversal
symmetry, hence a non-magnetic solution in accordance with experiments. The
analysis brings a unifying picture of the role of exchange in the $5f$-shell
with its relatively strong spin-orbit coupling. The results are in good
accordance with recent measurements of the branching ratio for the $d$ to $f$
transition in the actinides.
