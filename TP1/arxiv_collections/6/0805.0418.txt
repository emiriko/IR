We present and discuss our recent study of an eikonal two channel model, in
which we reproduce the soft total, integrated elastic and diffractive cross
sections, and the corresponding forward differential slopes in the ISR-Tevatron
energy range. Our study is extended to provide predictions at the LHC and
Cosmic Rays ene$ These are utilized to assess the role of unitarity at ultra
high energies, as well as predict the implied survival probability of exclusive
diffractiv$ central production of a light Higgs. Our approach is critically
examined so as to estimate the margins of error of the calculated survival
probability for diffractive Higgs production
