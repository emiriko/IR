We consider an array of N Josephson junctions connected in parallel and
explore the condition for chaotic synchronization. It is found that the outer
junctions can be synchronized while they remain uncorrelated to the inner ones
when an external biasing is applied. The stability of the solution is found out
for the outer junctions in the synchronization manifold. Symmetry
considerations lead to a situation wherein the inner junctions can synchronize
for certain values of parameter. In the presence of a phase difference between
the applied fields, all the junctions exhibit phase synchronization. It is also
found that chaotic motion changes to periodic in the presence of phase
differences.
