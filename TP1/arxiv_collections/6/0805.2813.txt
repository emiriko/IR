Gravitational radiation in plane-symmetric space-times can be encoded in a
complex potential, satisfying a non-linear wave equation. An effective energy
tensor for the radiation is given, taking a scalar-field form in terms of the
potential, entering the field equations in the same way as the matter energy
tensor. It reduces to the Isaacson energy tensor in the linearized,
high-frequency approximation. An energy conservation equation is derived for a
quasi-local energy, essentially the Hawking energy. A transverse pressure
exerted by interacting low-frequency gravitational radiation is predicted.
