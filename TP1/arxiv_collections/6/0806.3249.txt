The chromatic polynomial P_G(q) of a loopless graph G is known to be nonzero
(with explicitly known sign) on the intervals (-\infty,0), (0,1) and (1,32/27].
Analogous theorems hold for the flow polynomial of bridgeless graphs and for
the characteristic polynomial of loopless matroids. Here we exhibit all these
results as special cases of more general theorems on real zero-free regions of
the multivariate Tutte polynomial Z_G(q,v). The proofs are quite simple, and
employ deletion-contraction together with parallel and series reduction. In
particular, they shed light on the origin of the curious number 32/27.
