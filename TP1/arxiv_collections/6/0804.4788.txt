Our knowledge on ultracold quantum gases is strongly influenced by our
ability to probe these objects. In situ imaging combined with single atom
sensitivity is an especially appealing scenario as it can provide direct
information on the structure and the correlations of such systems. For a
precise characterization a high spatial resolution is mandatory. In particular,
the perspective to study quantum gases in optical lattices makes a resolution
well below one micrometer highly desirable. Here, we report on a novel
microscopy technique which is based on scanning electron microscopy and allows
for the detection of single atoms inside a quantum gas with a spatial
resolution of better than 150 nm. Imaging a Bose-Einstein condensate in a
one-dimensional optical lattice with 600 nm period we demonstrate single site
addressability in a sub-um optical lattice. The technique offers exciting
possibilities for the preparation, manipulation and analysis of quantum gases.
