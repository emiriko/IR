We discuss a realization of the nonrelativistic conformal group (the
Schroedinger group) as the symmetry of a spacetime. We write down a toy model
in which this geometry is a solution to field equations. We discuss various
issues related to nonrelativistic holography. In particular, we argue that free
fermions and fermions at unitarity correspond to the same bulk theory with
different choices for the near-boundary asymptotics corresponding to the source
and the expectation value of one operator. We describe an extended version of
nonrelativistic general coordinate invariance which is realized
holographically.
