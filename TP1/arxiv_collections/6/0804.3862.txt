Because of the communication delay between earth and moon, the GNC technology
of lunar probe is becoming more important than ever. Current navigation
technology is not able to provide precise motion estimation for probe landing
control system Computer vision offers a new approach to solve this problem. In
this paper, author introduces an image process algorithm of computer vision
navigation for autonomous landing of lunar probe. The purpose of the algorithm
is to detect and track feature points which are factors of navigation. Firstly,
fixation areas are detected as sub-images and matched. Secondly, feature points
are extracted from sub-images and tracked. Computer simulation demonstrates the
result of algorithm takes less computation and fulfils requests of navigation
algorithm.
