It is shown that all vacuum solutions of Einstein field equation with a
positive cosmological constant are the solutions of a model of dS gauge theory
of gravity. Therefore, the model is expected to pass the observational tests on
the scale of solar system and explain the indirect evidence of gravitational
wave from the binary pulsars PSR1913+16.
