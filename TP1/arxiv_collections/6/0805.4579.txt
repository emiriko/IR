The dimension two gluon condensate has been used previously within a simple
phenomenological model to describe power corrections from available lattice
data for the renormalized Polyakov loop and the heavy quark-antiquark free
energy in the deconfined phase of QCD (hep-ph/0505215,hep-ph/0702055). The QCD
trace anomaly of gluodynamics also shows unequivocal inverse temperature power
corrections which may be encoded as dimension two gluon condensate. We analyze
lattice data of the trace anomaly and compare with other determinations of the
condensate from previous references, yielding roughly similar numerical values.
