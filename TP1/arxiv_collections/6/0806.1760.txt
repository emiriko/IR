It is shown that in reaction \gamma\gamma\to\ell^+\ell^-+\nu's at
\sqrt{s}>200 GeV with polarized photons, large and well observable differences
arise in the distribution of positive and negative charged leptons
(\ell=\mu^\pm, e^\pm), (charge asymmetry). The modification due to the
contribution of the cascade processes with intermediate \tau-lepton in \gamma
\gamma \to W^\pm\ell^\mp + \nu's reaction is taken into account. This charge
asymmetry is potentially sensitive to effects of physics beyond the standard
model at the anticipated luminosity of the Photon Collider mode of the future
international linear collider.
