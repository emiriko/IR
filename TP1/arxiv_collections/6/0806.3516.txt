We study a nonlinear ground state of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a
parabolic potential in the hydrodynamics limit often referred to as the
Thomas--Fermi approximation. Existence of the energy minimizer has been known
in literature for some time but it was only recently when the Thomas-Fermi
approximation was rigorously justified. The spectrum of linearization of the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation at the ground state consists of an unbounded sequence
of positive eigenvalues. We analyze convergence of eigenvalues in the
hydrodynamics limit. Convergence in norm of the resolvent operator is proved
and the convergence rate is estimated. We also study asymptotic and numerical
approximations of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues using Airy functions.
