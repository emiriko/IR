We consider the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov system of linear differential
equations. The coefficients of this system are rational functions. We prove
that under some conditions the solution of KZ system is rational too. We give
the method of constructing the corresponding rational solution. We deduce the
asymptotic formulas for the solution of KZ system when $\rho$ is integer.
