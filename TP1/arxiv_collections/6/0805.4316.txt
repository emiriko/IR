I compare two quantum-theoretical approaches to the phenomenon of adaptive
mutations, termed here Q-cell and Q-genome. I use 'fluctuation trapping' model
as a general framework. I introduce notions of R-error and D-error and argue
that the 'fluctuation trapping' model has to employ a correlation between the
R- and D- errors. Further, I compare how the two approaches can justify the
R-D-error correlation, focusing on the advantages of the Q-cell approach. The
positive role of environmentally induced decoherence (EID) on both steps of the
adaptation process is emphasized. A starving bacterial cell is proposed to be
in an einselected state. The intracellular dynamics in this state has a unitary
character and I propose to interpret it as 'exponential growth in imaginary
time', analogously to the commonly considered 'diffusion' interpretation of the
Schroedinger equation. Addition of a substrate leads to Wick rotation and a
switch from 'imaginary time' reproduction to a 'real time' reproduction regime.
Due to the variations at the genomic level (such as base tautomery), the
starving cell has to be represented as a superposition of different components,
all 'reproducing in imaginary time'. Adidtion of a selective substrate,
allowing only one of these components to amplify, will cause Wick rotation and
amplification of this component, thus justifying the occurence of the R-D-error
correlation. Further ramifications of the proposed ideas for evolutionary
theory are discussed.
