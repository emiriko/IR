In certain class of flux compactification, moduli mediated supersymmetry
(SUSY) breaking preserves flavor and CP at leading order in the perturbative
expansion controlled by the vacuum expectation value of the messenger modulus.
Nevertheless there still might be dangerous flavor or CP violation induced by
higher order K\"ahler potential. We examine the constraints on such SUSY
breaking scheme imposed by low energy flavor and/or CP violating observables.
It is found that all phenomenological constraints can be satisfied even for
generic form of higher order K\"ahler potential and sparticle spectra in the
sub-TeV range, under plausible assumptions on the size of higher order
correction and flavor mixing angles. This implies for instance that mirage
mediation scheme of SUSY breaking, which involves such modulus mediation
together with an anomaly mediation of comparable size, and also the
modulus-dominated mediation realized in flux compactification can be free from
the SUSY flavor and CP problems, while giving gaugino and sfermion masses in
the sub-TeV range.
