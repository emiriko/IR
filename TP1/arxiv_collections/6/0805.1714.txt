The quantum optical response of high density ultracold atomic systems is
critical to a wide range of fundamentally and technically important physical
processes. These include quantum image storage, optically based quantum
repeaters and ultracold molecule formation. We present here a microscopic
analysis of the light scattering on such a system, and we compare it with a
corresponding description based on macroscopic Maxwell theory. Results are
discussed in the context of the spectral resonance structure, time-dependent
response, and the light localization problem.
