Long-range interactions slow down the excitation trapping in quantum
transport processes on a one-dimensional chain with traps at both ends. This is
counter intuitive and in contrast to the corresponding classical processes with
long-range interactions, which lead to faster excitation trapping. We give a
pertubation theoretical explanation of this effect.
