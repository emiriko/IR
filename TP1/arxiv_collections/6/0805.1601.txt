The QCD sum rule approach is employed in order to study chiral properties of
positive- and negative-parity nucleon resonances. It is pointed out that
nucleons with an ``exotic'' chiral property, which can be represented by local
five-quark operators, can be paired with a standard nucleon forming a single
chiral multiplet. The sum rules of the five-quark operators, however, are shown
not to couple strongly to chirally-``exotic'' nucleon resonances at the mass
region of less than 2 GeV.
