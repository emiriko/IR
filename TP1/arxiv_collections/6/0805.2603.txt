We present a precise determination of the polarizability and other proton
structure dependent contributions to the hydrogen hyperfine splitting, based
heavily on the most recent published data on proton spin dependent structure
functions from the EG1 experiment at the Jefferson Laboratory. As a result, the
total calculated hyperfine splitting now has a standard deviation slightly
under 1 part-per-million, and is about 1 standard deviation away from the
measured value. We also present results for muonic hydrogen hyperfine
splitting, taking care to ensure the compatibility of the recoil and
polarizability terms.
