We present a single inequality as the necessary and sufficient condition for
two unsharp observables of a two-level system to be jointly measurable in a
single apparatus and construct explicitly the joint observables. A
complementarity inequality arising from the condition of joint measurement,
which generalizes Englert's duality inequality, is derived as the trade-off
between the unsharpnesses of two jointly measurable observables.
