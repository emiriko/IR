We discuss quite surprising properties of the one-parameter family of modular
(Auberson and Sabatier (1994)) nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations. We develop
a unified theoretical framework for this family. Special attention is paid to
the emergent \it dual \rm time evolution scenarios which, albeit running in the
\it real time \rm parameter of the pertinent nonlinear equation, in each
considered case, may be mapped among each other by means of an "imaginary time"
transformation (more seriously, an analytic continuation in time procedure).
