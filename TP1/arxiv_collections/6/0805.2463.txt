We consider the influence of interparticle interaction on the magnetization
reversal in the oriented Stoner-Wohlfarth nanoparticles ensemble. To do so, we
solve a kinetic equation for the relaxation of the overall ensemble
magnetization to its equilibrium value in some effective mean field. Latter
field consists of external magnetic field and interaction mean field
proportional to the instantaneous value of above magnetization. We show that
the interparticle interaction influences the temperature dependence of a
coercive field. This influence manifests itself in the noticeable coercivity at
$T>T_{b}$ ($T_{b}$ is so-called blocking temperature). The above interaction
can also lead to a formation of the "superferromagnetic" state with correlated
directions of particle magnetic moments at $T>T_{b}$. This state possesses
coercivity if the overall magnetization has a component directed along the easy
axis of each particle. We have shown that the coercive field in the
"superferromagnetic" state does not depend on measuring time. This time
influences both $T_{b}$ and the temperature dependence of coercive field at
$T<T_{b}$. We corroborate our theoretical results by measurements on
nanogranular films (CoFeB)$_{x}$-(SiO$_{2}$)$_{1-x}$ with concentration of
ferromagnetic particles close, but below percolation threshold.
