We study the correspondence between two theoretical frameworks for describing
dark energy, $f(R)$ gravity and higher-dimensional Space-Time-Matter (STM) or
induced-matter theory. We show that the Hubble expansion parameter in $f(R)$
gravity can be associated with a combination of metric functions in STM theory,
and consider a specific example whose properties are consistent with late-time
acceleration.
