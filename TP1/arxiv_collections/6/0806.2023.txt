We give a short new proof of a version of the Kruskal-Katona theorem due to
Lov\'asz. Our method can be extended to a stability result, describing the
approximate structure of configurations that are close to being extremal, which
answers a question of Mubayi. This in turn leads to another combinatorial proof
of a stability theorem for intersecting families, which was originally obtained
by Friedgut using spectral techniques and then sharpened by Keevash and Mubayi
by means of a purely combinatorial result of Frankl. We also give an algebraic
perspective on these problems, giving yet another proof of intersection
stability that relies on expansion of a certain Cayley graph of the symmetric
group, and an algebraic generalisation of Lov\'asz's theorem that answers a
question of Frankl and Tokushige.
