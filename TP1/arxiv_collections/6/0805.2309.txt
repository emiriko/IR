The authors of the paper ''On Anisotropic Dark Energy Stars'',
arXiv:0803.2508 [gr-qc], consider the equations of state $p_r=\omega \rho$ and
$p_t=\omega \rho$, ignoring the fact that this implies an isotropic pressure,
which places strict restrictions on the values of $\omega$. The authors then
argue for an anisotropic pressure fluid throughout their work, and apply these
equations of state to the energy conditions, consequently obtaining incorrect
intervals for the parameter $\omega$. This procedure invalidates their
criticisms on the following paper: Class.Quant.Grav. 23, 1525 (2006).
