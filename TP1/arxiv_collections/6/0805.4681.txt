We study the stability of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in
the parameter regime in which its classical counterpart has regular motion. The
stability is characterized by the fidelity for both the same and different
initial states. We study as initial states the Fock states with definite
numbers of atoms in each component of the BEC. It is found that for some
initial times the two Fock states with all the atoms in the same component of
the BEC are stabler than Fock states with atoms distributed in the two
components. An experimental scheme is discussed, in which the fidelity can be
measured in a direct way.
