We study the stability of the 2+1 dimensional U(1) spin liquid state against
proliferation of instantons in the presence of spinon Fermi surface. By mapping
the spinon Fermi surface into an infinite set of 1+1 dimensional chiral
fermions, it is argued that an instanton has an infinite scaling dimension for
any nonzero number of spinon flavors. Therefore, the spin liquid phase is
stable against instantons and the non-compact U(1) gauge theory is a good low
energy description.
