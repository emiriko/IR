In solving the differential equation for a non damped harmonic oscillator one
meets, after subjecting the equation to a Fourier transformation, an
integration in the complex $\omega$ plane. In most cases such an integral is
evaluated by calculating residues together with some physical input such as the
principle of causality to define which pole residues are relevant to the
physical problem. For this kind of application, Cauchy's theorem or residue
theorem can be applied to evaluate certain real integrals. Here we present an
alternative approach based on the concept of negative dimensional integration
to treat such integrals and give an specific example on how this is
accomplished.
