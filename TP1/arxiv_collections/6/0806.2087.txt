We argue that hadron production in coherent diffraction of proton on a heavy
nucleus provides a very sensitive probe of the low-x QCD dynamics. This process
probes the BFKL dynamics in proton and the non-linear gluon evolution in
nucleus. We calculate the diffractive hadron production cross sections in the
RHIC and LHC kinematic regions. To study the nuclear effects we introduce the
diffractive nuclear modification factor. We show that unlike the nuclear
modification factor for inclusive hadron production that has a very interesting
dynamics at RHIC but is expected to be almost completely saturated at the LHC,
the nuclear modification factor for diffractive production exhibits a
non-trivial behavior both at RHIC and LHC.
