In this paper, we show that an atom interferometer inertial sensor, when
associated to the auxiliary measurement of external vibrations, can be operated
beyond its linear range and still keep a high acceleration sensitivity. We
propose and compare two measurement procedures (fringe fitting and nonlinear
lock) that can be used to extract the mean phase of the interferometer when the
interferometer phase fluctuations exceed $2\pi$. Despite operating in the urban
environment of inner Paris without any vibration isolation, the use of a low
noise seismometer for the measurement of ground vibrations allows our atom
gravimeter to reach at night a sensitivity as good as $5.5\times10^{-8}$g at 1
s. Robustness of the measurement to large vibration noise is also demonstrated
by the ability of our gravimeter to operate during an earthquake with excellent
sensitivity. Our high repetition rate allows for recovering the true low
frequency seismic vibrations, ensuring proper averaging. Such techniques open
new perspectives for applications in other fields, such as navigation and
geophysics.
