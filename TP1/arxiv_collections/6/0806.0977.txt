The non-equilibrium dynamics of an amorphous solid is studied with a
soft-spin type model. We show that the aging behavior in the glassy state
follows a modified Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) form similar to that
obtained in Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 95}, 055702 (2005) from analysis of the
dielectric loss data. The nature of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT)
violation is also studied in the time as well as correlation windows.
