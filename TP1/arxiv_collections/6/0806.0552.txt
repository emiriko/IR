The influence of nuclear isospin mixing on parity-violating elastic electron
scattering is studied for the even-even, N=Z nuclei 12C, 24Mg, 28Si, and 32S.
Their ground-state wave functions have been obtained using a self-consistent
axially-symmetric mean-field approximation with density-dependent effective
two-body Skyrme interactions. Some differences from previous shell-model
calculations appear for the isovector Coulomb form factors which play a role in
determining the parity-violating asymmetry. To gain an understanding of how
these differences arise, the results have been expanded in a spherical harmonic
oscillator basis. Results are obtained not only within the plane-wave Born
approximation, but also using the distorted-wave Born approximation for
comparison with potential future experimental studies of parity-violating
electron scattering. To this end, for each nucleus the focus is placed on
kinematic ranges where the signal (isospin-mixing effects on the
parity-violating asymmetry) and the experimental figure-of-merit are maximized.
Strangeness contributions to the asymmetry are also briefly discussed, since
they and the isospin mixing contributions may play comparable roles for the
nuclei being studied at the low momentum transfers of interest in the present
work.
