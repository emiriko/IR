In this paper we show that two skew diagrams lambda/mu and alpha/beta can
represent the same multiplicity free skew character [lambda/mu]=[alpha/beta]
only in the the trivial cases when lambda/mu and alpha/beta are the same up to
translation or rotation or if lambda=alpha is a staircase partition
lambda=(l,l-1,...,2,1) and lambda/mu and alpha/beta are conjugate of each
other.
