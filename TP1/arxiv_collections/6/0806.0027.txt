The local density of states (LDOS) in finite quantum wires is calculated as a
function of discrete energies and position along the wire. By using a
combination of numerical density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)
calculations and analytical bosonization techniques it is possible to obtain a
good understanding of the local spectral weights along the wire in terms of the
underlying many-body excitations.
