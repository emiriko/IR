The previously described methodology for hierarchical grouping of objects
through iterative averaging has been used for simulation of cooperative
interactions between objects of a system with the purpose of investigation of
the conformational organization of the system. Interactions between objects
were analyzed within the space of an isotropic field of one of the objects
(drifter). Such an isotropic field of an individual object can be viewed as a
prototype of computer ego. It allows visualization of a holistic space of
multi-object relations (HSMOR) which has a complex structure depending on the
number of objects, their mutual arrangement in space, and the type of metric
used for assessment of (dis)similarities between the objects. In the course of
computer simulation of cooperative interactions between the objects, only those
points of the space were registered which corresponded to transitions in
hierarchical grouping. Such points appeared to aggregate into complex spatial
structures determining a unique internal organization of a respective HSMOR. We
describe some of the peculiarities of such structures, referred to by us as
attractor membranes, and discuss their properties. We also demonstrate the
peculiarities of the changing of intergroup similarities which occurs when a
drifter infinitely moves away from the fixed objects.
