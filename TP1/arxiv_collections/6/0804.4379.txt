From an analysis of projective measurements, it is shown that the Wigner rule
is the unique operational quasi-probability for the post-measurement state. A
unique pre-measurement quasi-probability is derived from a principle of
invariance of measurement disturbance under orthogonal projector
complementation. Physical arguments for this principle are given. The
informationally complete complex extension of the quasi-probability is also
derived. Nonclassicality of this quasi-probability is due to measurement
disturbance. The same quasi-probability follows from weak measurements.
