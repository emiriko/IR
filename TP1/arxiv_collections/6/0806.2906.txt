We critically revisit the various attempts to prove one eighth law in 2D
turbulence and reconcile them. Herein, the one-eight law has been proved for
unforced 2D incompressible high Reynolds number turbulence. An exact expression
of the time derivative of two-point second order velocity correlation function
is also derived for the enstrophy cascade dominated regime.
