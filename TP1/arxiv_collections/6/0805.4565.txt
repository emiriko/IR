The search for supersymmetry (SUSY) and other classes of new physics will be
tackled on two fronts, with high energy, direct detection machines, and in high
precision experiments searching for indirect signatures. While each of these
methods has its own strengths, even more can be gained by finding ways to
combine their results. In this paper, we examine one way of bridging these two
types of experiments by calculating sum rules which link physical squark masses
to the flavor-violating squark mixings. These sum rules are calculated for
minimally flavor-violating SUSY theories at both high and low tan(beta). We
also explore how the sum rules could help to disentangle the relative strengths
of different SUSY contributions to b -> s gamma, a favored channel for indirect
searches of new physics. Along the way, we show that the gluino contributions
to b -> s gamma can be very sizable at large tan(beta).
