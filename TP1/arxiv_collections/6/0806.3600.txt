The study of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state has been of
considerable recent interest. Below the temperature $T^*$ which is believed to
be the transition temperature ($T$) to the FFLO phase in CeCoIn$_5$, K.
Kakuyanagi et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 047602 (2005)) reported a composite NMR
spectrum with a tiny component observed at frequencies corresponding to the
normal state signal. The results were interpreted as evidence for the emergence
of an FFLO state. This result is inconsistent with two other NMR studies of V.
F. Mitrovi{\'c} et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 117002 (2006)) and B.-L. Young et
al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 036402 (2007)). In this comment we show that the
findings of K. Kakuyanagi et al. do not reflect the true nature of the FFLO
state but result from excess RF excitation power used in that experiment.
