VSI (`vanishing scalar invariant') spacetimes have zero values for all total
scalar contractions of all polynomials in the Riemann tensor and its covariant
derivatives. However, there are other ways of concocting local scalar
invariants (nonpolynomial) from the Riemann tensor that need not vanish even in
VSI spacetimes, such as Cartan invariants. Simple examples are given that
reduce to the squared amplitude for a linearized monochromatic plane
gravitational wave. These nonpolynomial local scalar invariants are also
evaluated for non-VSI spacetimes such as Schwarzschild and Kerr and are
estimated near the surface of the earth. Similar invariants are defined for
null fluids and for electromagnetic fields.
