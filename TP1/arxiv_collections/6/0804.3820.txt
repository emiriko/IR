The GR wave self-heating of geodesic massive bodies with constant
thermo-gravimechanical energies increases the brightness-to-charge ratio along
spiral radial transitions in the energy-to-energy gravitation. Paired confined
gravitons locally warm accelerated matter that suggests the thermodynamical
origin of electromagnetic outbursts with oscillating Wien's displacements.
Damping of orbital periods by chiral GR waves is more efficient for neutron
stars around giant companions than for binary pulsars.
