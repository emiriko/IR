Field theory in the presence of extra dimensions has offered interesting
solutions to the gauge hierarchy problem, and inspired many attempts to
understand the fermion mass generation mechanism. We study the behaviour of a
bulk fermion field subject to non-standard boundary conditions under Z2
symmetry in a slice of (5D) AdS. These pseudo-Majorana boundary conditions
relate the 5d spinor fields to their 5d charge conjugate and generate Majorana
spinors in four-dimensions. There is a zero mode localized on the visible brane
and the masses of Kaluza-Klein excitations are naturally of order the
weak-scale. We make connection to neutrino phenomenology. We also demonstrate
that, contrary to previous claims, a bulk singlet scalar field cannot provide a
successful mechanism to generate a suppressed Majorana mass for Standard Model
neutrinos localized on the visible brane.
