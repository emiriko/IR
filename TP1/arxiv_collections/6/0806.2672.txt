A consistent theory of supersymmetry breaking must have a hidden sector, an
observable sector, and must be embedded in a locally supersymmetric theory
which arises from string theory. For phenomenological reasons it must also
transmit supersymmetry from the hidden to the visible sector in a dominantly
flavor neutral manner. Also any such theory of supersymmetry breaking has to
take into account the problem of quadratic divergences which arise once the
theory is embedded in supergravity. A class of possible models that arise from
GKP-KKLT type IIB string compactifications, incorporating all this while being
consistent with gauge unification, with just the bare minimum of necessary
supergravity/string theory moduli fields coupled to the minimally
supersymmetric standard model, is presented. Such models give reasonable values
for the soft masses, the $\mu$ and $B\mu$ terms and the gaugino masses.
Assuming that an actual detailed realization exists, it is very likely that
they are the simplest such possibility .
