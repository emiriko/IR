The Generalized Uncertainty Principle arises from the Heisenberg Uncertainty
Principle when gravity is taken into account, so the leading order correction
to the standard formula is expected to be proportional to the gravitational
constant $G_N = L_{Pl}^2$. On the other hand, the emerging picture suggests a
set of departures from the standard theory which demand a revision of all the
arguments used to deduce heuristically the new rule. In particular, one can now
argue that the leading order correction to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
is proportional to the first power of the Planck length $L_{Pl}$. If so, the
departures from ordinary quantum mechanics would be much less suppressed than
what is commonly thought.
