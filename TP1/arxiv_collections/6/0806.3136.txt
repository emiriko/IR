The relationship between the behavior of an ancient geomagnetic field
characteristics (paleointensity and frequency of inversions) and cyclic
recurrence of endogenic and cosmogeneous processes which are conceivably
connected with radial mantle heat transmission and the Earth rotation speed has
been studied. It is shown that endogenic processes affect the behavior of the
paleointensity and frequency of inversions. Large basalt effusions identified
with plumes are accompanied by the changes in paleointensity (by 30-40)% and
the frequency of inversions. Characteristic time intervals of paleointensity
variations caused by the formation of plumes makes up 10-20 Ma. The
paleointensity varies (by 15-30)% according to phases of the riftogenesis
activization and tension - compression cycles. The dependence of geomagnetic
field behavior on changes of the Earth rotation speed which occurred as a
result of the Earth - Moon - Sun system evolution has been analyzed. Thus, in
accordance with phases of the Earth - Moon distance changes (periodicity about
200 Ma) average values of the paleointensity varied by a factor of two.
Besides, the frequency of inversions, asymmetry of polarity and features of
paleointensity variations changed too.
