The infinite tower of vector mesons encoded in holographic dual QCD bring
drastic changes to the soliton structure of the nucleon. The nucleon is given
by a point-like instanton in 5D surrounded by a vector meson cloud with the
vector dominance restored by the infinite tower. I discuss the possible
relevance of this structure in hot and dense hadronic matter.
