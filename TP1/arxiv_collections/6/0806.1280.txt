Crisis response poses many of the most difficult information technology in
crisis management. It requires information and communication-intensive efforts,
utilized for reducing uncertainty, calculating and comparing costs and
benefits, and managing resources in a fashion beyond those regularly available
to handle routine problems. In this paper, we explore the benefits of
artificial intelligence technologies in crisis response. This paper discusses
the role of artificial intelligence technologies; namely, robotics, ontology
and semantic web, and multi-agent systems in crisis response.
