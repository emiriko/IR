In this paper, we have considered new modified Chaplygin gas (NMCG) model
which interpolates between radiation at early stage and $\Lambda$CDM at late
stage. This model is regarded as a unification of dark energy and dark matter
(with general form of matter). We have derived the density parameters from the
equation of motion for the interaction between dark energy and dark matter.
Also we have studied the evolution of the various components of density
parameters.
