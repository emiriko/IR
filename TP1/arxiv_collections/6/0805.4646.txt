We demonstrate a direct correlation between the domain structure of
multiferroic BiFeO3 thin films and exchange bias of Co0.9Fe0.1/BiFeO3
heterostructures. Two distinct types of interactions, an enhancement of the
coercive field (exchange enhancement) and an enhancement of the coercive field
combined with large shifts of the hysteresis loop (exchange bias), have been
observed in these heterostructures, which depend directly on the type and
crystallography of the nanoscale (2 nm) domain walls in the BiFeO3 film. We
show that the magnitude of the exchange bias interaction scales with the length
of 109 degree ferroelectric domain walls in the BiFeO3 thin films which have
been probed via piezoresponse force microscopy and x-ray magnetic circular
dichroism.
