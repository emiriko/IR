We present a new collocated numerical scheme for the approximation of the
Navier-Stokes and energy equations under the Boussinesq assumption for general
grids, using the velocity-pressure unknowns. This scheme is based on a recent
scheme for the diffusion terms. Stability properties are drawn from particular
choices for the pressure gradient and the non-linear terms. Numerical results
show the accuracy of the scheme on irregular grids.
