Developing a theoretical framework to access quantum phases of itinerant
bosons or fermions in two dimensions (2D) that exhibit singular structure along
surfaces in momentum space but have no quasi-particle description remains as a
central challenge in the field of strongly correlated physics. In this paper we
propose that distinctive signatures of such 2D strongly correlated phases will
be manifest in quasi-one-dimensional "N-leg ladder" systems. Characteristic of
each parent 2D quantum liquid would be a precise pattern of 1D gapless modes on
the N-leg ladder. These signatures could be potentially exploited to approach
the 2D phases from controlled numerical and analytical studies in quasi-1D. As
a first step we explore itinerant boson models with a frustrating ring exchange
interaction on the 2-leg ladder, searching for signatures of the recently
proposed two-dimensional d-wave correlated Bose liquid (DBL) phase. A
combination of exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group,
variational Monte Carlo, and bosonization analysis of a quasi-1D gauge theory,
all provide compelling evidence for the existence of a new strong-coupling
phase of bosons on the 2-leg ladder which can be understood as a descendant of
the two-dimensional DBL. We suggest several generalizations to quantum spin and
electron Hamiltonians on ladders which could likewise reveal fingerprints of
such 2D non-Fermi liquid phases.
