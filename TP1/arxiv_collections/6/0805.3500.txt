The concept of a noncommutative field is formulated based on the interplay
between twisted Poincar\'e symmetry and residual symmetry of the Lorentz group.
Various general dynamical results supporting this construction, such as the
light-wedge causality condition and the integrability condition for
Tomonaga-Schwinger equation, are presented. Based on this analysis, the claim
of the identity between commutative QFT and noncommutative QFT with twisted
Poincar\'e symmetry is refuted.
