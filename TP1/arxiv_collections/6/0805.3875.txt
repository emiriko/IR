Magneto-optical imaging and magnetization measurements were applied to
investigate local formation of superconducting phase effected by a random neck
synthesis in Y-Ba-Cu-O system. Polished pellets of strongly inhomogeneous
ceramic samples show clearly the appearance of superconducting material in the
intergrain zones of binary primary particles reacted under different
conditions. Susceptibility measurements allows evaluation of superconducting
critical temperature, which turned out to be close to that of optimally doped
YBCO.
