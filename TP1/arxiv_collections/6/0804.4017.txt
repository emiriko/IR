In a central nucleus-nucleus collision at high-energies, medium partons
kicked by a near-side jet acquire a momentum along the jet direction and
subsequently materialize as the observed ridge particles. They carry direct
information on the early parton momentum distribution which can be extracted by
using the ridge data for central AuAu collisions at \sqrt{s_{NN}}=200 GeV. The
extracted parton momentum distribution has a thermal-like transverse momentum
distribution but a non-Gaussian, relatively flat rapidity distribution at
mid-rapidity with sharp kinematic boundaries at large rapidities that depend on
the transverse momentum.
