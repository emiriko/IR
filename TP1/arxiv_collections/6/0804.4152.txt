Multi-agent models have been used in many contexts to study generic
collective behavior. Similarly, complex networks have become very popular
because of the diversity of growth rules giving rise to scale-free behavior.
Here we study adaptive networks where the agents trade ``wealth'' when they are
linked together while links can appear and disappear according to the wealth of
the corresponding agents; thus the agents influence the network dynamics and
vice-versa. Our framework generalizes a multi-agent model of Bouchand and
Mezard, and leads to a steady state with fluctuating connectivities. The system
spontaneously self-organizes into a critical state where the wealth
distribution has a fat tail and the network is scale-free; in addition, network
heterogeneities lead to enhanced wealth condensation.
