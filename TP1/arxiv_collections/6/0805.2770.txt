In this paper, we show how information geometry, the natural geometry of
discrete probability distributions, can be used to derive the quantum
formalism. The derivation rests upon three elementary features of quantum
phenomena, namely complementarity, measurement simulability, and global gauge
invariance. When these features are appropriately formalized within an
information geometric framework, and combined with a novel
information-theoretic principle, the central features of the finite-dimensional
quantum formalism can be reconstructed.
