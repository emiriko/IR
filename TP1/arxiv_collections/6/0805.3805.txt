We show that any magnetostatic axially symmetric solution of the
Einstein-Maxwell equations can be endowed with a specific charged fluid source
of the Polanco et al type via a simple procedure requiring the knowledge of
exclusively the magnetostatic seed spacetime. Using this procedure we construct
yet another exact solution for a massive magnetic dipole surrounded by a static
charged fluid which is different from the Polanco et al metric.
