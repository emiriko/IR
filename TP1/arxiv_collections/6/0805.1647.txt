We discuss a possible interpretation of the f0(980) and a0(980) mesons as
hadronic molecules - bound states of K and Kbar mesons. Using a
phenomenological Lagrangian approach we calculate the strong f0(980) to pi pi
and a0(980) to pi eta as well as the electromagnetic f0(980) to gamma gamma and
a0(980) to gamma gamma decays. The covariant and gauge invariant model, which
also allows for finite size effects of the hadronic molecule, delivers results
in good agreement with available data and results of other theoretical
approaches.
