CLIO (Cryogenic Laser Interferometer Observatory) is a Japanese gravitational
wave detector project. One of the main purposes of CLIO is to demonstrate
thermal-noise suppression by cooling mirrors for a future Japanese project,
LCGT (Large-scale Cryogenic Gravitational Telescope). The CLIO site is in
Kamioka mine, as is LCGT. The progress of CLIO between 2005 and 2007 (room- and
cryogenic-temperature experiments) is introduced in this article. In a
room-temperature experiment, we made efforts to improve the sensitivity. The
current best sensitivity at 300 K is about $6 \times 10^{-21} /\sqrt{\rm Hz}$
around 400 Hz. Below 20 Hz, the strain (not displacement) sensitivity is
comparable to that of LIGO, although the baselines of CLIO are 40-times shorter
(CLIO: 100m, LIGO: 4km). This is because seismic noise is extremely small in
Kamioka mine. We operated the interferometer at room temperature for
gravitational wave observations. We obtained 86 hours of data. In the cryogenic
experiment, it was confirmed that the mirrors were sufficiently cooled (14 K).
However, we found that the radiation shield ducts transferred 300K radiation
into the cryostat more effectively than we had expected. We observed that noise
caused by pure aluminum wires to suspend a mirror was suppressed by cooling the
mirror.
