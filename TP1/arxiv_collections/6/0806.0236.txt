This paper is devoted to the development of a theoretical and computational
framework to efficiently sample the statistically significant thermally
activated reaction pathways, in multi-dimensional systems obeying Langevin
dynamics. We show how to obtain the set of most probable reaction pathways and
compute the corrections due to quadratic thermal fluctuations around such
trajectories. We discuss how to obtain predictions for the evolution of
arbitrary observables and how to generate conformations which are
representative of the transition state ensemble. We present an illustrative
implementation of our method by studying the diffusion of a point particle in a
2-dimensional funneled external potential.
