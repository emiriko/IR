We present a simple variation of warped flavor models where the hierarchies
of fermion masses and mixings are still explained but dangerous flavor
violating effects in the Kaon sector are greatly reduced. The key new
ingredients are two horizontal U(1) symmetries. These symmetries forbid flavor
violation in the down quark sector (with the exception of small IR brane
localized kinetic mixing terms for the left-handed quarks) while allowing for
flavor violation in the up quark sector. The leading flavor constraints come
from D - anti-D mixing, and are safely satisfied for the KK mass scale of order
3 TeV. Our analysis of the flavor constraints also includes the constraints due
to the (usually ignored) localized kinetic mixing terms. We also comment on the
effects of the additional U(1) gauge bosons.
