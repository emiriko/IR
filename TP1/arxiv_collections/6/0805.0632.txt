We report the theoretical study of the flux-lattice melting in the novel
iron-based superconductor $LaO_{0.9}F_{0.1}FeAs$ and
$LaO_{0.925}F_{0.075}FeAs$. Using the Hypernetted-Chain closure and an
efficient algorithm, we calculate the two-dimensional one-component plasma pair
distribution functions, static structure factors and direct correlation
functions at various temperatures. The Hansen-Verlet freezing criterion is
shown to be valid for vortex-liquid freezing in type-II superconductors.
Flux-lattice meting lines for $LaO_{0.9}F_{0.1}FeAs$ and
$LaO_{0.925}F_{0.075}FeAs$ are predicted through the combination of the density
functional theory and the mean-field substrate approach.
