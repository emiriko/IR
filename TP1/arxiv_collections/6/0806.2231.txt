We have performed a detailed angel-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study
of in-situ prepared SrVO3 thin films. Naturally capped by a ``transparent''
protective layer, contributions from surface states centered at ~ -1.5 eV are
dramatically reduced, enabling us to study the bulk V 3d states. We have
observed a clear band dispersion not only in the coherent quasiparticle part
but also in the incoherent part, which are reproduced by dynamical mean-field
theory calculations and the spectral weight of the incoherent part is stronger
within the Fermi surface.
