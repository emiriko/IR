By numerical modeling we investigate fluid transport in low-Reynolds-number
flow achieved with a special elastic filament or artifical cilium attached to a
planar surface. The filament is made of superparamagnetic particles linked
together by DNA double strands. An external magnetic field induces dipolar
interactions between the beads of the filament which provides a convenient way
of actuating the cilium in a well-controlled manner. The filament has recently
been used to successfully construct the first artificial micro-swimmer [R.
Dreyfus at al., Nature 437, 862 (2005)]. In our numerical study we introduce a
measure, which we call pumping performance, to quantify the fluid transport
induced by the magnetically actuated cilium and identify an optimum stroke
pattern of the filament. It consists of a slow transport stroke and a fast
recovery stroke. Our detailed parameter study also reveals that for
sufficiently large magnetic fields the artificial cilium is mainly governed by
the Mason number that compares frictional to magnetic forces. Initial studies
on multi-cilia systems show that the pumping performance is very sensitive to
the imposed phase lag between neighboring cilia, i.e., to the details of the
initiated metachronal wave.
