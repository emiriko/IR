This paper analyzes the asymptotic behavior of a multiple-access network
comprising a large number of selfish transmitters competing for access to a
common wireless communication channel, and having different utility functions
for determining their strategies. A necessary and sufficient condition is given
for the total number of packet arrivals from selfish transmitters to converge
in distribution. The asymptotic packet arrival distribution at Nash equilibrium
is shown to be a mixture of a Poisson distribution and finitely many Bernoulli
distributions.
