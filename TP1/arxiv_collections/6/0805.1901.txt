We discuss properties of particles and fields in a multi-dimensional
space-time, where the geometrization of gauge interactions can be performed. As
far as spinors are concerned, we outline how the gauge coupling can be
recognized by a proper dependence on extra-coordinates and by the dimensional
reduction procedure. Finally applications to the Electro-Weak model are
presented.
