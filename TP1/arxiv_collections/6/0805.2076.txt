We report a combined study by optical absorption (OA) and electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy on the E'-alpha point defect in
amorphous silicon dioxide (a-SiO2). This defect has been studied in beta-ray
irradiated and thermally treated oxygen-deficient a-SiO2 materials. Our results
have pointed out that the E'-alpha center is responsible for an OA Gaussian
band peaked at 5.8 eV and having a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.6 eV.
The estimated oscillator strength of the related electronic transition is 0.14.
Furthermore, we have found that this OA band is quite similar to that of the
E'-gamma center induced in the same materials, indicating that the related
electronic transitions involve states highly localized on a structure common to
both defects.
