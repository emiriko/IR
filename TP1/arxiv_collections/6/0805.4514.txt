The linear dispersion properties of transverse shear waves in a strongly
coupled dusty plasma are experimentally studied by exciting them in a
controlled manner with a variable frequency external source. The dusty plasma
is maintained in the strongly coupled fluid regime with (1 < Gamma << Gamma_c)
where Gamma is the Coulomb coupling parameter and Gamma_c is the
crystallization limit. A dispersion relation for the transverse waves is
experimentally obtained over a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 2 Hz and found to
show good agreement with viscoelastic theoretical results.
