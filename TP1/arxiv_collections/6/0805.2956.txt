The qft++ package is a library of C++ classes that facilitate numerical (not
algebraic) quantum field theory calculations. Mathematical objects such as
matrices, tensors, Dirac spinors, polarization and orbital angular momentum
tensors, etc. are represented as C++ objects in qft++. The package permits
construction of code which closely resembles quantum field theory expressions,
allowing for quick and reliable calculations.
