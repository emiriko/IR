The stress-induced lattice changes in a p(1x2) ordered oxygen layer on W(110)
are measured by low-energy electron diffraction. We have observed that small
oxygen islands show a mismatch with the underlying lattice. Our results
indicate that along [1-10] the average mismatch scales inversely with the
island size as 1/L for all oxygen coverages up to 0.5 ML, while along [001] it
is significant only for the smallest oxygen islands and scales as a higher
power of the inverse island size. The behaviour along [1-10] is described by a
one-dimensional finite-size Frenkel-Kontorova model. Using this model, together
with calculated force constants, we make a quantitative estimate for the change
of surface-stress upon oxygen adsorption. The result is consistent with our
ab-initio calculations, which give a relative compressive stress of -4.72 N/m
along [1-10] and a minute relative tensile stress of 0.15 N/m along [001]. The
scaling along [001] is qualitatively explained as an effect induced by the
lattice relaxation in the [1-10] direction.
