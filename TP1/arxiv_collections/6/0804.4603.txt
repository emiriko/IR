Linear transport through a single-walled carbon nanotube ring (CNR), pierced
by a magnetic field and capacitively coupled to a gate voltage source, is
investigated starting from a model of interacting $p_z$-electrons. The
dc-conductance, calculated in the limit of weak tunneling between the ring and
the leads, displays a periodic resonance pattern determined by the interplay
between Coulomb interactions and quantum interference phenomena. Coulomb
blockade effects are manifested in the absence of resonances for any applied
flux in some gate voltage regions; the periodicity as a function of the applied
flux can be smaller or larger than a flux quantum depending on the nanotube
band mismatch.
