We announce results on the structure of CAT(0) groups, CAT(0) lattices and of
the underlying spaces. Our statements rely notably on a general study of the
full isometry groups of proper CAT(0) spaces. Classical statements about
Hadamard manifolds are established for singular spaces; new arithmeticity and
rigidity statements are obtained.
