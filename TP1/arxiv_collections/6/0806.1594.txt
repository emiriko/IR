We report on normal stress field measurements at the multicontact interface
between a rough elastomeric film and a smooth glass sphere under normal load,
using an original MEMS-based stress sensing device. These measurements are
compared to Finite Elements Method calculations with boundary conditions
obeying locally Amontons' rigid-plastic-like friction law with a uniform
friction coefficient. In dry contact conditions, significant deviations are
observed which decrease with increasing load. In lubricated conditions, the
measured profile recovers almost perfectly the predicted profile. These results
are interpreted as a consequence of the finite compliance of the multicontact
interface, a mechanism which is not taken into account in Amontons' law.
