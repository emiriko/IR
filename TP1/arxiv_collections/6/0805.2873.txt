We present a method to determine the decay of multiparticle quantum
correlations as quantified by the geometric measure of entanglement under the
influence of decoherence. With this, we compare the robustness of entanglement
in GHZ-, cluster-, W- and Dicke states of four qubits and show that the Dicke
state is most robust. Finally, we determine the geometric measure analytically
for decaying GHZ and cluster states of an arbitrary number of qubits.
