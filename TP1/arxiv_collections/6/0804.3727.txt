Here we report the fabrication and superconductivity of the iron-based
arsenic-oxide GdFeAsO1-delta compound with oxygen-deficiency, which has an
onset resistivity transition temperature at 53.5 K. This material has a same
crystal structure as the newly discovered high-Tc ReFeAsO1-delta family (Re =
rare earth metal) and a further reduced crystal lattice, while the Tc starts to
decrease compared with the SmFeAsO1-delta system.
