This paper tries to tell the story of the general linear model, which saw the
light of day 200 years ago, and the assumptions underlying it. We distinguish
three principal stages (ignoring earlier more isolated instances). The model
was first proposed in the context of astronomical and geodesic observations,
where the main source of variation was observational error. This was the main
use of the model during the 19th century. In the 1920's it was developed in a
new direction by R.A. Fisher whose principal applications were in agriculture
and biology. Finally, beginning in the 1930's and 40's it became an important
tool for the social sciences. As new areas of applications were added, the
assumptions underlying the model tended to become more questionable, and the
resulting statistical techniques more prone to misuse.
