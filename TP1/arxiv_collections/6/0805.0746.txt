We solve the dynamics of large spherical Minority Games (MG) in the presence
of non-negligible time dependent external contributions to the overall market
bid. The latter represent the actions of market regulators, or other major
natural or political events that impact on the market. In contrast to
non-spherical MGs, the spherical formulation allows one to derive closed
dynamical order parameter equations in explicit form and work out the market's
response to such events fully analytically. We focus on a comparison between
the response to stationary versus oscillating market interventions, and reveal
profound and partially unexpected differences in terms of transition lines and
the volatility.
