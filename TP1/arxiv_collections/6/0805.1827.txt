In this paper we present two parallel Monte Carlo based algorithms for
pricing multi--dimensional Bermudan/American options. First approach relies on
computation of the optimal exercise boundary while the second relies on
classification of continuation and exercise values. We also evaluate the
performance of both the algorithms in a desktop grid environment. We show the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches in a heterogeneous computing
environment, and identify scalability constraints due to the algorithmic
structure.
