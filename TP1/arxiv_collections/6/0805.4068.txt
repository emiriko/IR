The dynamic interplay of transport, electrostatic, and magnetic effects in
the resonant tunneling through ferromagnetic quantum wells is theoretically
investigated. It is shown that the carrier-mediated magnetic order in the
ferromagnetic region not only induces, but also takes part in intrinsic,
robust, and sustainable high-frequency current oscillations over a large window
of nominally steady bias voltages. This phenomenon could spawn a new class of
quantum electronic devices based on ferromagnetic semiconductors.
