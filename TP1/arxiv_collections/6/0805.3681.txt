We study a modified version of the Naming Game, a recently introduced model
which describes how shared vocabulary can emerge spontaneously in a population
without any central control. In particular, we introduce a new mechanism that
allows a continuous interchange with the external inventory of words. A novel
playing strategy, influenced by the hierarchical structure that individuals'
reputation defines in the community, is implemented. We analyze how these
features influence the convergence times, the cognitive efforts of the agents
and the scaling behavior in memory and time.
