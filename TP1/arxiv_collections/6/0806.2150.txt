The lightest neutralino in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the
Standard Model can be, in principle, massless. If super-light neutralinos are
the dark matter, structure formation constrains their mass to be above a few
keV. We show that relaxing the assumption of radiation domination and entropy
conservation prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the relic abundance of very
light neutralinos can be consistent with the inferred cold dark matter density.
We study how we can hunt for light neutralino dark matter, with a mass at or
below a GeV, focusing on both direct and indirect searches. We argue that the
two most promising channels are spin-dependent direct detection and the search
for monochromatic gamma rays from the prompt pair-annihilation of neutralinos
into photons with GLAST. Our study indicates that the lightest lightest
neutralinos can be detected as long as their mass is above a few tenth of a
GeV, a mass range where a future linear collider could provide important
information on the details of the particle dark matter model.
