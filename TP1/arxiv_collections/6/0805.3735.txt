We investigate the coupling of a nanomechanical oscillator in the quantum
regime with molecular (electric) dipoles. We find theoretically that the
cantilever can produce single-mode squeezing of the center-of-mass motion of an
isolated trapped molecule and two-mode squeezing of the phonons of an array of
molecules. This work opens up the possibility of manipulating dipolar crystals,
which have been recently proposed as quantum memory, and more generally, is
indicative of the promise of nanoscale cantilevers for the quantum detection
and control of atomic and molecular systems.
