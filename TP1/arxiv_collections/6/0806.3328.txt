In this paper, we propose a decomposition method called Generalized
Multi-Unitary Decomposition (GMUD) which is useful in multi-user MIMO
precoding. This decomposition transforms a complex matrix H into PRQ, where R
is a special matrix whose first row contains only a non-zero user defined value
at the left-most position, P and Q are a pair of unitary matrices. The major
attraction of our proposed GMUD is we can obtain multiple solutions of P and Q
>. With GMUD, we propose a precoding method for a MIMO multi-user system that
does not require full channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. The
proposed precoding method uses the multiple unitary matrices property to
compensate the inaccurate feedback information as the transmitter can steer the
transmission beams of individual users such that the inter-user interference is
kept minimum.
