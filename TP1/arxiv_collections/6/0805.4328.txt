The complete non-linear three-dimensional Einstein gravity with gravitational
Chern-Simons term and cosmological constant are studied in dreibein
formulation. The constraints and their algebras are computed in an explicit
form. From counting the number of first and second class constraints, the
number of dynamical degrees of freedom, which equals to the number of
propagating graviton modes, is found to be 1, "regardless of" the value of
cosmological constant. I note also that the usual equivalence with Chern-Simons
gauge theory does "not" work for general circumstances.
