A discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical results was reported
for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. In leptogenesis scenarios which
are due to a decay of right-handed neutrinos, this anomaly leads to large
violations of lepton flavour within the framework of supersymmetric see-saw
models. It is shown that for a hierarchical right-handed neutrino mass
spectrum, we generically expect to observe \mu \to e \gamma in the near future
experiment.
