The permeation, rejection, and transport of electrolytes in water-filled
nanopores are critical to ion current gating and desalinalion processes in
synthetic porous membranes and the functions of biological ion channels. Mile
the effects of confinement pore polarizability, and discrete channel charge
sites have been much studied, the potentially dramatic impact of dipole-lined
synthetic pores on electrolytes has seldom been addressed. Dipole layers
naturally occur on the interior surfaces of certain nanopores, leading to
intrinsic preference for cations or anions. This preference can be exploited
when the membrane surface is functionalized differently from the pore interior
or when there are alternating dipolar/nondipolar stretches inside a long pore.
The dipole-ion interaction is asymptotically unscreened by water, leading to
ionic, charge segregated, insulating behavior that can block ion transport, and
potentially novel current-voltage (I-V) characteristics.
