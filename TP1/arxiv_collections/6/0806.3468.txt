Our paper deals about identities involving Bell polynomials. Some identities
on Bell polynomials derived using generating function and successive
derivatives of binomial type sequences. We give some relations between Bell
polynomials and binomial type sequences in first part, and, we generalize the
results obtained in [4] in second part.
