The correspondence limit of the atomic elliptic state in three dimensions is
discussed in terms of Nelson's stochastic mechanics. In previous work we have
shown that this approach leads to a limiting Nelson diffusion and here we
discuss in detail the invariant measure for this process and show that it is
concentrated on the Kepler ellipse in the plane z=0. We then show that the
limiting Nelson diffusion generator has a spectral gap; thereby proving that in
the infinite time limit the density for the limiting Nelson diffusion will
converge to its invariant measure. We also include a summary of the Cheeger and
Poincare inequalities both of which are used in our proof of the existence of
the spectral gap.
