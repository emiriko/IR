We study the holographic dual of the Higgs branch of N=4 SYM in four
dimensions coupled to quenched fundamental matter. The fundamentals are added
via flavor D7-branes and the Higgs phase is obtained when the color D3-branes
and the flavor D7-branes recombine with each other. The holographic dual
consists of D7-brane probes in the background generated by the color D3-branes.
In this supergravity dual the Higgs phase is realized by switching on a
selfdual field strength on the worldvolume of the D7-branes. A complementary
microscopic description in terms of dielectric D3-branes is also possible. This
microscopic approach permits a better matching with the dual field theory
analysis. Finally, the meson mass spectrum is computed by studying the
fluctuations of the flavor D7-branes.
