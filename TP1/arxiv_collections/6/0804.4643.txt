We investigate the modification of discrete scale invariance in the bound
state spectrum by long-range interactions. This problem is relevant for
effective field theory descriptions of nuclear cluster states and
manifestations of the Efimov effect in nuclei. As a model system, we choose a
one dimensional inverse square potential supplemented with a long-range Coulomb
interaction. We study the renormalization and bound-state spectrum of the
system as a function of the Coulomb interaction strength. Our results indicate,
that the counterterm required to renormalize the inverse square potential alone
is sufficient to renormalize the full problem. However, the breaking of the
discrete scale invariance through the Coulomb interaction leads to a modified
bound state spectrum. The shallow bound states are strongly influenced by the
Coulomb interaction while the deep bound states are dominated by the inverse
square potential.
