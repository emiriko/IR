In order to enable high quality lens designs using calcium fluoride (CaF2)
and Heraeus Infrasil 301 (Infrasil) for cryogenic operating temperatures, we
have measured the absolute refractive index of these two materials as a
function of both wavelength and temperature using the Cryogenic, High-Accuracy
Refraction Measuring System (CHARMS) at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. For
CaF2, we report absolute refractive index and thermo-optic coefficient (dn/dT)
at temperatures ranging from 25 to 300 K at wavelengths from 0.4 to 5.6
microns, while for Infrasil, we cover temperatures ranging from 35 to 300 K and
wavelengths from 0.4 to 3.6 microns. For CaF2, we compare our index
measurements to measurements of other investigators. For Infrasil, we compare
our measurements to the material manufacturer's data at room temperature and to
cryogenic measurements for fused silica from previous investigations including
one of our own. Finally, we provide temperature-dependent Sellmeier
coefficients based on our measured data to allow accurate interpolation of
index to other wavelengths and temperatures.
