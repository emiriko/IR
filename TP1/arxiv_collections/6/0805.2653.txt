he quasi-classical method of deriving Hawking radiation is investigated. In
order to recover the original Hawking temperature one must take into account a
previously ignored contribution coming from the temporal part of the action.
This contribution plus a contribution coming from the spatial part of the
action gives the correct temperature.
