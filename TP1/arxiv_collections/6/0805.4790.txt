Recently, a sufficient condition on the structure of the Kossakowski-Lindblad
master equation has been given such that the generated reduced dynamics of two
qubits results entangling for at least one among their initial separable pure
states. In this paper we study to which extent this condition is also
necessary. Further, we find sufficient conditions for bath-mediated
entanglement generation in higher dimensional bipartite open quantum systems.
