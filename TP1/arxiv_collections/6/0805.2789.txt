derived a geometric phase shift in dissipative limit cycle evolution. This
effect was considered as an extension of the geometric phase in classical
mechanics. We show that the converse is also true, namely, this geometric phase
can be identified with the classical mechanical Hannay angle in an extended
phase space. Our results suggest that this phase can be generalized to a
stochastic evolution with an additional noise term in evolution equations.
