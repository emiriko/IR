Recently, there is growing evidence that a new state of matter is formed in
sqrt(s_NN)= 200 GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC: a strongly coupled Quark Gluon
Plasma of partonic degrees of freedom which develops a collective motion.
Dilepton spectra are not affected by strong interaction and can therefore probe
the whole time evolution of the collision. Thus they may be sensitive to onset
of deconfinement, chiral symmetry restoration, as well as the production of
thermal photons. The PHENIX experiment measured the production of e+e- pairs in
p+p and Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN)= 200 GeV. An enhanced dilepton yield in
the mass range 150<m_ee<750 MeV/c^2 is measured. The excess increases faster
with centrality than the number of participating nucleons and is concentrated
at p_T<1GeV/c. At higher p_T the excess below 300 MeV/c^2 has been related to
an enhanced production of direct photons possibly of thermal origin.
