We study the neutrino mass matrix derived from the seesaw mechanism in which
the neutrino Yukawa couplings and the heavy Majorana neutrino mass matrix are
controlled by the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism. In order to obtain the large
neutrino mixings, two Froggatt-Nielsen fields are introduced with a complex
vacuum expectation values. As a by-product, CP violation is systematically
induced even if the order one couplings of FN fields are real. We show several
predictions of this model, such as theta_{13}, the Dirac CP phase, two Majorana
CP phases, the effective mass of the neutrinoless double beta decay and the
leptogenesis. The prediction of the branching ratio of mu to e+gamma is also
given in SUSY model.
