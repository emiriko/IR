This study is focused on the mechanical characterization of materials used in
microelectronic and micro- electromechanical systems (MEMS) devices. In order
to determine their mechanical parameters, a new deformation bench test with
suitable micromachined specimens have been developed. Uniaxial tensile tests
were performed on "low cost" specimens, consisting in electroplated thin copper
films and structures, deposited on a polimide type substrate. Moreover, a
cyclic mechanical actuation via piezoelectric actuators was tested on the same
deformation bench. These experiments validate the device for performing dynamic
characterization of materials, and reliability studies of different
microstructures.
