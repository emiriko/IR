This paper presents an extensive experimental study of the state-of-the-art
of XML compression tools. The study reports the behavior of nine XML
compressors using a large corpus of XML documents which covers the different
natures and scales of XML documents. In addition to assessing and comparing the
performance characteristics of the evaluated XML compression tools, the study
tries to assess the effectiveness and practicality of using these tools in the
real world. Finally, we provide some guidelines and recommen- dations which are
useful for helping developers and users for making an effective decision for
selecting the most suitable XML compression tool for their needs.
