We use symmetric Poisson-Schwarz formulas for analytic functions $f$ in the
half-plane ${Re}(s)>\frac12$ with $\bar{f(\bar{s})}=f(s)$ in order to derive
factorisation theorems for the Riemann zeta function. We prove a variant of the
Balazard-Saias-Yor theorem and obtain explicit formulas for functions which are
important for the distribution of prime numbers. In contrast to Riemann's
classical explicit formula, these representations use integrals along the
critical line ${Re}(s)=\frac12$ and Blaschke zeta zeroes.
