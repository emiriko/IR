Existing Genetic Algorithms for crystal structure and polymorph prediction
can suffer from stagnation during evolution, with a consequent loss of
efficiency and accuracy. An improved Genetic Algorithm (GA) is introduced
herein which penalizes similar structures and so enhances structural diversity
in the population at each generation. This is shown to improve the quality of
results found for the theoretical prediction of simple model crystal
structures. In particular, this method is demonstrated to find three new
zero--temperature phases of the Dzugutov potential that have not been
previously reported.
