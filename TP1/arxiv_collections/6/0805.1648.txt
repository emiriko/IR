Electrode polarization error is the biggest problem when measuring the low
frequency dielectric properties of electrolytes or suspensions of particles,
including cells, in electrolytes. We present a simple and robust method to
remove the polarization error, which we demonstrate to work on weak and strong
ionic electrolytes as well as on cell suspensions. The method assumes no
particular behavior of the electrode polarization impedance; it makes use of
the fact that the effect dies out with frequency. The method allows for direct
measurement of the polarization impedance, whose behavior with the applied
voltages, electrode distance and ionic concentration is investigated.
