It is argued that topological disorder in amorphous solids can be described
by local strains related to local reference crystals and local rotations. An
intuitive localization criterion is formulated from this point of view. The
Inverse Participation Ratio and the location of mobility edges in band tails is
directly related to the character of the disorder potential in amorphous solid,
the coordination number, the transition integral and the nodes of wave
functions of the corresponding reference crystal. The dependence of the decay
rate of band tails on temperature and static disorder are derived. \textit{Ab
initio} simulations on a-Si and experiments on a-Si:H are compared to these
predictions.
