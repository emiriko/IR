In this paper we investigate expanding Bianchi type I models with two tilted
fluids with linear equations of state. Individually the fluids have non-zero
energy fluxes w.r.t. the symmetry surfaces, but these cancel each other because
of the Codazzi constraint. Asymptotically toward the past the solutions
approach Kasner states if the speeds of sound are less than that of light. If
one of the fluids has a speed of sound that is less or equal to 1/3 of the
speed of light (radiation) then the models isotropize toward the future, but if
both fluids are stiffer than radiation then the final state is anisotropic with
non-zero Hubble-normalized shear. The significance of these results is
discussed in a broader context.
