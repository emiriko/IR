High-precision calculations of the energy levels of the superheavy elements
E119 and E120+ are presented. Dominating correlation corrections beyond
relativistic Hartree-Fock are included to all orders in the Coulomb interaction
using the Feynman diagram technique and the correlation potential method. The
Breit interaction and quantum electrodynamics radiative corrections are
considered. Also, the volume isotope shift is determined. A similar treatment
for Cs, Fr, Ba+ and Ra+ is used to gauge the accuracy of the calculations and
to refine the ab initio results.
