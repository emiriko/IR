A precise relation is established between the Stelle-West formulation of the
Mac Dowell-Mansouri approach to a gauge theory of gravity and the approach
based on a gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten term. In particular, it is shown that a
consistent truncation of the latter correspond to the former. A brief review of
the Lovelock-Chern-Simons motivation behind the gauged WZW ones is also done.
