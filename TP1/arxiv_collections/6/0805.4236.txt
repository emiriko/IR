Errors in spreadsheet applications and models are alarmingly common (some
authorities, with justification cite spreadsheets containing errors as the norm
rather than the exception). Faced with this body of evidence, the auditor can
be faced with a huge task - the temptation may be to launch code inspections
for every spreadsheet in an organisation. This can be very expensive and
time-consuming. This paper describes risk assessment based on the "SpACE" audit
methodology used by H M Customs & Excise's tax inspectors. This allows the
auditor to target resources on the spreadsheets posing the highest risk of
error, and justify the deployment of those resources to managers and clients.
Since the opposite of audit risk is audit assurance the paper also offers an
overview of some elements of good practice in the use of spreadsheets in
business.
