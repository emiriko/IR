We construct an infinite particle/infinite volume Langevin dynamics on the
space of configurations in $\R^d$ having velocities as marks. The construction
is done via a limiting procedure using $N$-particle dynamics in cubes
$(-\lambda,\lambda]^d$ with periodic boundary conditions. A main step to this
result is to derive an (improved) Ruelle bound for the canonical correlation
functions of $N$-particle systems in $(-\lambda,\lambda]^d$ with periodic
boundary conditions. After proving tightness of the laws of finite particle
dynamics, the identification of accumulation points as martingale solutions of
the Langevin equation is based on a general study of properties of measures on
configuration space (and their weak limit) fulfilling a uniform Ruelle bound.
Additionally, we prove that the initial/invariant distribution of the
constructed dynamics is a tempered grand canonical Gibbs measure. All proofs
work for general repulsive interaction potentials $\phi$ of Ruelle type (e.g.
the Lennard-Jones potential) and all temperatures, densities and dimensions
$d\geq 1$.
