New TbFeAs(O,F) and DyFeAs(O,F) superconductors with critical temperatures
Tc= 46 and 45 K and very high critical fields over 100 T have been prepared at
1100- 1150C and 10-12 GPa, demonstrating that high pressure may be used to
synthesise late rare earth derivatives of the recently reported RFeAs(O,F) (R =
La - Nd, Sm, Gd) high temperature superconductors.
