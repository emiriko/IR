The activities carried out by Italian physicists in the field of
semiconductor physics during the period spanning from 1945 to the foundation of
the National Group of Structure of the Matter (GNSM, 1965) are reviewed within
their historical context. Until the fifties, the Italian research was only
marginally involved, if at all, in the main streams of advancement in solid
state physics. Starting from the early fifties, an interest for technical
applications of the newly introduced semiconductor devices began to grow in the
electronic engineering community. In the following years, the birth of a few
experimental and theoretical groups lead by highly motivated scientists (some
of them with international experience) allowed to deal with the main topics
related to condensed matter and semiconductor phenomena. The work developed by
these "pioneers", discussed in this paper, represented an invaluable
contribution for the new generations of physicists in this research field.
