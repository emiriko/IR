Transverse-field muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR) experiments in the
heavy-fermion superconductor PrOs$_{4}$Sb$_{12}$ ($T_{c}=1.85$ K) suggest that
the superconducting penetration depth $\lambda(T)$ is temperature-independent
at low temperatures, consistent with a gapped quasiparticle excitation
spectrum. In contrast, radiofrequency (rf) inductive measurements yield a
stronger temperature dependence of $\lambda(T)$, indicative of point nodes in
the gap. This discrepancy appears to be related to the multiband structure of
PrOs$_{4}$Sb$_{12}$. Muon Knight shift measurements in PrOs$_{4}$Sb$_{12}$
suggest that the perturbing effect of the muon charge on the neighboring
Pr$^{3+}$ crystalline electric field is negligibly small, and therefore is
unlikely to cause the difference between the $\mu$SR and rf results.
