We review the properties of time intervals between the crossings at a level M
of a smooth stationary Gaussian temporal signal. The distribution of these
intervals and the persistence are derived within the Independent Interval
Approximation (IIA). These results grant access to the distribution of extrema
of a general Gaussian process. Exact results are obtained for the persistence
exponents and the crossing interval distributions, in the limit of large |M|.
In addition, the small time behavior of the interval distributions and the
persistence is calculated analytically, for any M. The IIA is found to
reproduce most of these exact results and its accuracy is also illustrated by
extensive numerical simulations applied to non-Markovian Gaussian processes
appearing in various physical contexts.
