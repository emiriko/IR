Brownian Dynamics algorithms are widely used for simulating soft-matter and
biochemical systems. In recent times, their application has been extended to
the simulation of coarse-grained models of cellular networks in simple
organisms. In these models, components move by diffusion, and can react with
one another upon contact. However, when reactions are incorporated into a
Brownian Dynamics algorithm, attention must be paid to avoid violations of the
detailed-balance rule, and therefore introducing systematic errors in the
simulation. We present a Brownian Dynamics algorithm for reaction-diffusion
systems that rigorously obeys detailed balance for equilibrium reactions. By
comparing the simulation results to exact analytical results for a bimolecular
reaction, we show that the algorithm correctly reproduces both equilibrium and
dynamical quantities. We apply our scheme to a ``push-pull'' network in which
two antagonistic enzymes covalently modify a substrate. Our results highlight
that the diffusive behaviour of the reacting species can reduce the gain of the
response curve of this network.
