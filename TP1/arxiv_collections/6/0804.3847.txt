In order to reduce the difficulties in the experimental realizations of the
cloak but still keep good performance of invisibility, we proposed a perfect
cylindrical invisibility cloak with spatially invariant axial material
parameters. The advantage of this kind of TE (or TM) cloak is that only rho and
phi components of mu (or epsilon) are spatially variant, which makes it
possible to realize perfect invisibility with two-dimensional (2D) magnetic (or
electric) metamaterials. The effects of perturbations of the parameters on the
performance of this cloak are quantitatively analyzed by scattering theory. Our
work provides a simple and feasible solution to the experimental realization of
cloaks with ideal parameters.
