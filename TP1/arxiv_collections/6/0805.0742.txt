Data collected in Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron are searched for
indications of new electroweak-scale physics. Rather than focusing on
particular new physics scenarios, CDF data are analyzed for discrepancies with
the Standard Model prediction. A model-independent approach (Vista) considers
gross features of the data, and is sensitive to new large cross-section
physics. Further sensitivity to new physics is provided by two additional
algorithms: a ``Bump-Hunter'' searches invariant mass distributions for
``bumps'' that could indicate resonant production of new particles; and the
Sleuth procedure scans for data excesses in the high-pT tails. This combined
global search for new physics in 2.0/fb of p-pbar collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96
TeV reveals no indication of physics beyond the Standard Model.
