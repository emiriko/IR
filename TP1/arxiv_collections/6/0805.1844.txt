This article presents numerical recipes for simulating high-temperature and
non-equilibrium quantum spin systems that are continuously measured and
controlled. The notion of a spin system is broadly conceived, in order to
encompass macroscopic test masses as the limiting case of large-j spins. The
simulation technique has three stages: first the deliberate introduction of
noise into the simulation, then the conversion of that noise into an equivalent
continuous measurement and control process, and finally, projection of the
trajectory onto a state-space manifold having reduced dimensionality and
possessing a Kahler potential of multi-linear form. The resulting simulation
formalism is used to construct a positive P-representation for the thermal
density matrix. Single-spin detection by magnetic resonance force microscopy
(MRFM) is simulated, and the data statistics are shown to be those of a random
telegraph signal with additive white noise. Larger-scale spin-dust models are
simulated, having no spatial symmetry and no spatial ordering; the
high-fidelity projection of numerically computed quantum trajectories onto
low-dimensionality Kahler state-space manifolds is demonstrated. The
reconstruction of quantum trajectories from sparse random projections is
demonstrated, the onset of Donoho-Stodden breakdown at the Candes-Tao sparsity
limit is observed, a deterministic construction for sampling matrices is given,
and methods for quantum state optimization by Dantzig selection are given.
