The magnetization dynamics of the triangular lattice of Ising spin chains is
investigated in the framework of a two-dimensional model. The rigid chains are
assumed to interact with the nearest neighboring chains, an external magnetic
field, and a heat reservoir that causes the chains to change their states
randomly with time. A probability of a single spin-flip process is assumed in a
Glauber-like form. This technique allows describing properly the steps in the
magnetization curves observed in Ca$_3$Co$_2$O$_6$ and their dependence on a
magnetic field sweep rate and temperature. A transition from a low-temperature
to high-temperature phase is also observed.
