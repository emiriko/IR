In this paper, robustness of planar trivalent random graphs to targeted
attacks of highest connected nodes is investigated using numerical simulations.
It is shown that these graphs are relatively robust. The nonrandom node removal
process of targeted attacks is also investigated as a special case of
non-uniform site percolation. Critical exponents are calculated by measuring
various properties of the distribution of percolation clusters. They are found
to be roughly compatible with critical exponents of uniform percolation on
these graphs.
