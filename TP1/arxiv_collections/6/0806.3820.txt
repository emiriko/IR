We investigate whether there are attractor equations for N=1 flux vacua in
generalized compactifications. We fill a gap in the existing literature by
verifying analytically that the recently proposed susy attractors, for type IIB
CY(3) orientifold compactifications with flux, do give supersymmetric minima of
the relevant scalar potential. Furthermore, our considerations clarify various
confusions about existing proposals for generalization of the flux vacua
attractors to non-K\"{a}hler compactifications. We explore different
possibilities for generalization and find attractor equations for N=1 Minkowski
vacua only both for the heterotic string on SU(3) structure manifolds and for
type IIA/B on SU(3)xSU(3) structure spaces.
