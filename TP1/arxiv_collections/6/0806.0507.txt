Using the variational method, it is shown that the set of all strong peak
functions in a closed algebra $A$ of $C_b(K)$ is dense if and only if the set
of all strong peak points is a norming subset of $A$. As a corollary we can
induce the denseness of strong peak functions on other certain spaces. In case
that a set of uniformly strongly exposed points of a Banach space $X$ is a
norming subset of $\mathcal{P}({}^n X)$, then the set of all strongly norm
attaining elements in $\mathcal{P}({}^n X)$ is dense. In particular, the set of
all points at which the norm of $\mathcal{P}({}^n X)$ is Fr\'echet
differentiable is a dense $G_\delta$ subset.
  In the last part, using Reisner's graph theoretic-approach, we construct some
strongly norm attaining polynomials on a CL-space with an absolute norm. Then
we show that for a finite dimensional complex Banach space $X$ with an absolute
norm, its polynomial numerical indices are one if and only if $X$ is isometric
to $\ell_\infty^n$. Moreover, we give a characterization of the set of all
complex extreme points of the unit ball of a CL-space with an absolute norm.
