We present the computation of two-photon transition spectra between
ro-vibrational states of the H2+ molecular ion, including the effects of
hyperfine structure and excitation polarization. The reduced two-photon matrix
elements are obtained by means of a variational method. We discuss the
implications of our results for high-resolution spectroscopy of H2+.
