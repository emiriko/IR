A simple jet absorption model is used to study the influence of hadron pairs
produced by quenched jets, on di-hadron angular correlations at intermediate
transverse momentum ($p_T$). We demonstrate that such pairs can dominate both
the yield and the shape of angular correlations, and may account for the
similar properties between the near-side "ridge" and the away-side
"double-humped" structure seen in recent data. These hadron pairs also show
azimuthal anisotropy which is sensitive to the emission angle of hadrons
relative to that of the jet. Measurement of this anisotropy may provide a
constraint for elucidating the production mechanism for near- and away-side
hadron pairs at intermediate $p_T$.
