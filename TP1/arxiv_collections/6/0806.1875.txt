We discuss fluctuation relations in simple cases of non-equilibrium Langevin
dynamics. In particular, we show that close to non-equilibrium steady states
with non-vanishing probability currents some of these relations reduce to a
modified version of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The latter may be
interpreted as the equilibrium-like relation in the reference frame moving with
the mean local velocity determined by the probability current.
