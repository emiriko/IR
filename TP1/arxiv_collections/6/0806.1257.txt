Grover's quantum search algorithm drives a quantum computer from a prepared
initial state to a desired final state by using selective transformations of
these states. Here, we analyze a framework when one of the selective
trasformations is replaced by a more general unitary transformation. Our
framework encapsulates several previous generalizations of the Grover's
algorithm. We show that the general quantum search algorithm can be improved by
controlling the transformations through an ancilla qubit. As a special case of
this improvement, we get a faster quantum algorithm for the two-dimensional
spatial search.
