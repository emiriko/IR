The manganocuprate compound Gd3Ba2Mn2Cu2O12 (Gd-3222) has been synthesized by
conventional solid state reaction method and its magnetic behavior has been
studied by dc and ac magnetization (M) and heat capacity (C) measurements as a
function of temperature (T). This compound crystallizes in a tetragonal
structure (space group I4/mmm). We find that this compound exhibits three
magnetic transitions, around 2.5, 4.8 and 9 K, as inferred from dc and ac
magnetic susceptibility (chi) data. However, no evidence for a well-defined
lambda-anomaly is found in C(T) above 1.8 K, though there is a gradual upturn
below about 10 K. An application of a magnetic field results in a peak around
5K, while ac chi appears to show a very weak frequency dependence below 9 K.
Isothermal M curve at 1.8 K exhibits a weak hysteresis without any evidence for
saturation even at fields as high as 120 kOe. These results imply that this
compound undergoes a spin-glass-like freezing at low temperatures, though the
exact nature of the magnetic transition at 10 K is not clear. The magnitude of
the magnetocaloric effect, as inferred from M and C data, is quite large over a
wide temperature range below 50 K peaking around 4 K.
