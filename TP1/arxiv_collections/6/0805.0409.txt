We argue that the way to get the general solution of a Schrodinger equation
in the presence of a time-dependent linear potential based on the
Lewis-Riesenfeld framework is to use a Hermitian linear invariant operator. We
demonstrate that the linear invariant proposed in p and q is an Hermitian
operator which has the Gaussian wave packet as its eigenfunction.
