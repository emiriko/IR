We studied lattice expansion coefficient due to As using density functional
theory with particular attention to separating the impact of electrons and
ions. Based on As deactivation mechanism under equilibrium conditions, the
effect of stress on As activation is predicted. We find that biaxial stress
results in minimal impact on As activation, which is consistent with
experimental observations by Sugii et al. [J. Appl. Phys. 96, 261 (2004)] and
Bennett et al.[J. Vac. Sci. Tech. B 26, 391 (2008)].
