Laser spectroscopy of the low lying $^1$P and $^3$D states in atomic barium
has been performed. This work contributes substantially to the development of
an effective laser cooling and trapping for heavy alkaline earth elements and
aims in particular for a better understanding of the atomic wave function of
these systems. Isotope shifts and hyperfine structures are ideal probes for the
wave functions at the position of the nucleus. This is essential input for a
theoretical evaluation of the sensitivity to fundamental symmetry breaking
properties like permanent electric dipole moments. We report the first isotope
shift measurements of the $^3$D$_{1,2}$-$^1$P$_1$ transitions. A deviation of
the King plot from its expected behavior has been observed. Further we have
optically resolved the hyperfine structure of the $^3$D$_{1,2}$ states.
