Measured damping coefficients of six different perforated micromechanical
test structures are compared with damping coefficients given by published
compact models. The motion of the perforated plates is almost translational,
the surface shape is rectangular, and the perforation is uniform validating the
assumptions made for compact models. In the structures, the perforation ratio
varies from 24% - 59%. The study of the structure shows that the
compressibility and inertia do not contribute to the damping at the frequencies
used (130kHz - 220kHz). The damping coefficients given by all four compact
models underestimate the measured damping coefficient by approximately 20%. The
reasons for this underestimation are discussed by studying the various flow
components in the models.
