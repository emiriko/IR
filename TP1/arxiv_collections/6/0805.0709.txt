A novel model of the data selection, acquisition and analysis for a
multi-purpose and multi-component high-energy-physics experiment is presented.
Its departure point is the freedom and the responsibility given to the
different physics groups of the experiment to impose, on the {\it
event-by-event basis}, their physics-goal-optimal configurations of (i) the
sub-detectors, (ii) the trigger and data acquisition system, and (iii) the
reconstruction and analysis framework. Its target is to develop, in a close
analogy to the construction of the gauge models in particle physics, the
overall data handling scheme, in which a multi-purpose experiment becomes an
association of coexistent, yet largely independent, physics-group-based
sub-experiments sharing common hardware maintenance, data-acquisition, and data
reconstruction resources.
