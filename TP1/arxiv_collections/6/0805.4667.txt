We investigate the collider signals associated with scalar quirks ("squirks")
in folded supersymmetric models. As opposed to regular superpartners in
supersymmetric models these particles are uncolored, but are instead charged
under a new confining group, leading to radically different collider signals.
Due to the new strong dynamics, squirks that are pair produced do not hadronize
separately, but rather form a highly excited bound state. The excited
``squirkonium'' loses energy to radiation before annihilating back into
Standard Model particles. We calculate the branching fractions into various
channels for this process, which is prompt on collider time-scales. The most
promising annihilation channel for discovery is W+photon which dominates for
squirkonium near its ground state. We demonstrate the feasibility of the LHC
search, showing that the mass peak is visible above the SM continuum background
and estimate the discovery reach.
