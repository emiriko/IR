The relationship between quantum phase transition and complex geometric phase
for open quantum system governed by the non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian
with the accidental crossing of the eigenvalues is established. In particular,
the geometric phase associated with the ground state of the one-dimensional
dissipative Ising model in a transverse magnetic field is evaluated, and it is
demonstrated that related quantum phase transition is of the first order.
