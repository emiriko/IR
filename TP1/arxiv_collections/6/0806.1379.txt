Many important QCD tests with jets and prompt photons have been performed
with the experiments H1 and ZEUS at the HERA ep collider. This contribution
focuses on results from jet and prompt photon photoproduction. In particular,
the concept of resolved photon interactions and various jet cross sections and
their sensitivity to the photon (and proton) PDFs will be discussed. In
addition, recent results from prompt photon production will be shown. Finally
results on multi-parton interactions and the underlying event will be
presented.
