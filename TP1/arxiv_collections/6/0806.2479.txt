Tunnel-diode resonator technique was used to study crystals of ferromagnetic
re-entrant superconductor, ErRh$_{4}$B$_{4}$. At the boundary between
ferromagnetism (FM) and superconductivity (SC), dynamic magnetic
susceptibility, $\chi(T,H)$, exhibits highly asymmetric behavior upon warming
and cooling as well as enhanced diamagnetism on the SC side. SC phase nucleates
upon warming in a cascade of discontinuous jumps in magnetic susceptibility
$\chi(T,H)$, whereas FM phase develops gradually as reported in detail in
\cite{prozorov2008}. Here we further investigate enhanced diamagnetism. We find
that when a magnetic field is applied along the magnetic easy axes, a region of
enhanced diamagnetic screening is smaller than in the perpendicular
orientation. A discussion of possible causes of this effect is provided.
