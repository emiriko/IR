We identify the precise relationship between the five-parameter
$\tau^{(2)}$-family in the $N$-state chiral Potts model and XXZ chains with
$U_q (sl_2)$-cyclic representation. By studying the Yang-Baxter relation of the
six-vertex model, we discover an one-parameter family of $L$-operators in terms
of the quantum group $U_q (sl_2)$. When $N$ is odd, the $N$-state
$\tau^{(2)}$-model can be regarded as the XXZ chain of $U_{\sf q} (sl_2)$
cyclic representations with ${\sf q}^N=1$. The symmetry algebra of the
$\tau^{(2)}$-model is described by the quantum affine algebra $U_{\sf q}
(\hat{sl}_2)$ via the canonical representation. In general for an arbitrary
$N$, we show that the XXZ chain with a $U_q (sl_2)$-cyclic representation for
$q^{2N}=1$ is equivalent to two copies of the same $N$-state
$\tau^{(2)}$-model.
