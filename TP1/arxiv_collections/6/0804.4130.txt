High accuracy frequency metrology on the 4s 2S1/2 - 4p 2P1/2 transition in
calcium ions is performed using laser cooled and crystallized ions in a linear
Paul trap. Calibration is performed with a frequency comb laser, resulting in a
transition frequency of f=755222766.2(1.7) MHz. The accuracy presents an
improvement of more than one order of magnitude, and will facilitate a
comparison with quasar data in a search for a possible change of the fine
structure constant on a cosmological time scale.
