In view of the start up of the 14 TeV pp Large Hadron Collider the quark
anti-quark reactions leading to the final states W^+W^-, W^+-Z^0 and Z^0Z^0 are
studied, in the frame workn of the Standard Model (SM), using helicity
amplitudes. The differential and total cross sections are first evaluated in
the parton-parton center of mass system. They are then transformed to their
expected behavior in pp collisions through the parton-parton Energy Density
Functions which are here derived from the known Parton Density Functions of the
proton. In particular the single and joint longitudinal polarizations of the
final state di-bosons are calculated. The effect on these reactions from the
presence of s-channel heavy vector bosons, like the W' and Z', are evaluated to
explore the possibility to utilize the gauge boson pair production as a probe
for these 'Beyond the SM' phenomena.
