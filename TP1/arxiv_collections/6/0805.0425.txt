We have analyzed the generalization performance of a student which slowly
switches ensemble teachers. By calculating the generalization error
analytically using statistical mechanics in the framework of on-line learning,
we show that the dynamical behaviors of generalization error have the
periodicity that is synchronized with the switching period and the behaviors
differ with the number of ensemble teachers. Furthermore, we show that the
smaller the switching period is, the larger the difference is.
