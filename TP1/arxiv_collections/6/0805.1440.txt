These are notes on the construction of the GIT-fans for quivers without
oriented cycles. We follow closely the steps outlined by N. Ressayre in "The
GIT-Equivalence for G-Line Bundles" (Geometriae Dedicata, Volume 81, Numbers
1-3, 2000). A simple construction of the GIT-fan for normal, affine G-varities
has been recently given by Ivan V. Arzhantsev and Juergen Hausen in "Geometric
Invariant Theory via Cox Rings"
