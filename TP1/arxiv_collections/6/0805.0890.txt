In RF (Radio Frequency) domain, one of the limitations of using MEMS (Micro
Electromechanical Systems) switching devices for medium power applications is
RF power. Failure phenomena appear even for 500 mW. A design of MEMS switched
capacitors with an enhanced topology is presented in this paper to prevent it.
This kind of device and its promising performances will serve to fabricate a
MEMS based phase shifter able to work under several watts.
