We describe a new cascade mass reconstruction approach to allow
reconstruction of SUSY particle masses in long cascades (five or more
particles) at the LHC with integrated luminosity as low as a few fb^(-1). This
approach is based on a consecutive use of the endpoint method, an event filter
and a combinatorial mass reconstruction method. The endpoint method gives a
preliminary estimate of light sparticle masses. An event filter combining the
maximum likelihood distributions for all events in the data sample allows
suppression of backgrounds and gives a preliminary estimate of heavy sparticle
masses. Finally, SUSY particle masses are reconstructed by a search for a
maximum of a combined likelihood function constructed for each possible
combination of five events in the data sample.
  SUSY data sample sets for the SU3 model point containing 80k events each were
generated, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.2 fb^(-1). These
events were passed through the AcerDET detector simulator, which parametrized
the response of a detector. To demonstrate the stability and precision of the
approach five different 80k event data sets were considered. Masses were
reconstructed with a precision of about 10% for heavy sparticles and 10-20% for
light sparticles.
