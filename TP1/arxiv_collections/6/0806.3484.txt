We study the connections between link invariants, the chromatic polynomial,
geometric representations of models of statistical mechanics, and their common
underlying algebraic structure. We establish a relation between several
algebras and their associated combinatorial and topological quantities. In
particular, we define the chromatic algebra, whose Markov trace is the
chromatic polynomial \chi_Q of an associated graph, and we give applications of
this new algebraic approach to the combinatorial properties of the chromatic
polynomial. In statistical mechanics, this algebra occurs in the low
temperature expansion of the Q-state Potts model. We establish a relationship
between the chromatic algebra and the SO(3) Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebra,
which is an algebra-level analogue of the correspondence between the SO(3)
Kauffman polynomial and the chromatic polynomial.
