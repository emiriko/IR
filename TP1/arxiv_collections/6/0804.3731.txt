A general formalism was introduced for reorganization of QCD evolution
equations and derivation of hierarchical solution to DGLAP equation. The
hierarchical solution separates two types of parton emissions: the flavour
changing emissions and the diagonal ones (bremsstrahlung). It has been shown
that both of the achieved processes are of the Markovian type, what gives a
nice possibility of Monte Carlo implementation. Hierarchical algorithm has been
implemented and crosschecked with standard Markovian algorithm implemented in
program EvolFMC.
