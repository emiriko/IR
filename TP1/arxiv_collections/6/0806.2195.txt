The transition temperature Tc~26 K of the recently discovered superconductor
LaFeAs(O,F) has been demonstrated to be extremely sensitive to the lanthanide
ion, reaching 55 K for the Sm containing oxypnictides. Therefore, it is
important to determine how the moment on the lanthanide affects the overall
magnetism in these systems. Here we report a neutron diffraction study of the
Nd oxypnictides. Long ranged antiferromagnetic order is apparent in NdFeAsO
below 1.96 K. Rietveld refinement shows that both Fe and Nd magnetic ordering
are required to describe the observed data with the staggered moment 1.55(4)
Bohr magneton per Nd and 0.9(1) Bohr magneton per Fe at 0.3 K. The other
structural properties such as the tetragonal-orthorhombic distortion are found
to be very similar to those in LaFeAsO. Neither the magnetic ordering nor the
structural distortion occur in the superconducting sample NdFeAsO0.80F0.20 at
any temperatures down to 1.5 K.
