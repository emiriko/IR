Vectorial analysis relating to derivation of deflection of light is
presented. Curvilinear acceleration is distinguished from the Newtonian polar
conic acceleration. The difference between the two is due to the curvature
term. Lorentz invariant expression for acceleration is derived. A physical
theory of rotation curves of galaxies based on second solution to Einstein's
field equation is presented. Theory is applied to Milky Way, M31, NGC3198 and
Solar system. Modified Kepler's third law yields correct orbital periods of
stars in a galaxy. Deviation factor in the line element of the theory happens
to be the ratio of the Newtonian gravitational acceleration to the measured
acceleration of the star in the galaxy. Therefore this deviation factor can
replace the MOND function.
