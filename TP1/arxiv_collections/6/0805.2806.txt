Taking into account the gluon correction contributions to the correlation
function, the form factors relevant to the rare $B_c \rar X \nu\bar{\nu}$
decays are calculated in the framework of the three point QCD sum rules, where
$X$ stands for axial vector particle, $AV(D_{s1})$, and vector particles,
$V(D^*,D^*_s)$. The total decay width as well as the branching ratio of these
decays are evaluated using the $q^2$ dependent expressions of the form factors.
A comparison of our results with the predictions of the relativistic
constituent quark model is presented.
