We report high-resolution photoemission spectroscopy of newly-discovered
iron-based layered superconductor La(O$_{0.93}$F$_{0.07}$)FeAs (Tc = 24 K). We
found that the superconducting gap shows a marked deviation from the isotropic
s-wave symmetry. The estimated gap size at 5 K is 3.6 meV in the s- or axial
p-wave case, while it is 4.1 meV in the polar p- or d-wave case. We also found
a pseudogap of 15-20 meV above Tc, which is gradually filled-in with increasing
temperature and closes at temperature far above Tc similarly to copper-oxide
high-temperature superconductors.
