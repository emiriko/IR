Developing an expression of resonant x-ray scattering (RXS) amplitude which
is convenient for investigating the contributions from the higher rank tensor
on the basis of a localized electron picture, we analyze the RXS spectra from
the magnetic phases of Ho near the $M_{4,5}$ absorption edges. At the $M_5$
edge in the uniform helical phase, the calculated spectra of the absorption
coefficient, the RXS intensities at the first and second satellite spots
capture the properties the experimental data possess, such as the spectral
shapes and the peak positions. This demonstrates the plausibility of the
adoption of the localized picture in this material and the effectiveness of the
spectral shape analysis. The latter point is markedly valuable since the
azimuthal angle dependence, which is one of the most useful informations RXS
can provides, is lacking in the experimental conditions. Then, by focusing on
the temperature dependence of the spectral shape at the second satellite spot,
we expect that the spectrum is the contribution of the pure rank two profile in
the uniform helical and the conical phases while that is dominated by the rank
one profile in the intermediate temperature phase, so-called spin slip phase.
The change of the spectral shape as a function of temperature indicates a
direct evidence of the change of magnetic structures undergoing. Furthermore,
we predict that the intensity, which is the same order observed at the second
satellite spot, is expected at the fourth satellite spot from the conical phase
in the electric dipolar transition.
