We present global fits to the Large Volume Scenario (LVS) of string models
using current indirect data. We use WMAP5 constraints on dark matter relic
density, b-physics and electroweak observables as well as direct search
constraints. Such data can be adequately fit by LVS, with the best-fit point
for mu>0 having chi^2=13.6 for 8 degrees of freedom. The resulting constraints
on parameter space are robust in that they do not depend much upon the prior,
or upon whether one uses Bayesian or frequentist interpretations of the data.
Sparticle masses are constrained to be well below the 1 TeV level, predicting
early SUSY discovery at the LHC. We devise a method of quantifying which are
the most important constraints. We find that the LEP2 Higgs mass constraint,
the relic density of dark matter and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon
affect the fits to the strongest degree.
