A fundamental limit to the sensitivity of optical interferometry is thermal
noise that drives fluctuations in the positions of the surfaces of the
interferometer's mirrors, and thereby in the phase of the intracavity field.
Schemes for reducing this thermally driven phase noise are presented in which
phase shifts from concomitant strains at the surface and in the bulk of the
substrate compensate the phase shift due to the displacement of the surface.
Although the position of the physical surface fluctuates, the optical phase
upon reflection can have reduced sensitivity to this motion.
