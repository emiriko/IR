We demonstrate that substantial power gain can be obtained with
superconducting transition detectors. We describe the properties of the
detector as a power amplifier theoretically. In our first experiments power
gain of 23 was reached in a good agreement with the theory. The gain
facilitates noise matching of the readout circuit to the detectors in the case
of time division multiplexing.
