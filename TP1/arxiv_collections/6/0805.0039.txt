We study superradiant Raman scattering from an ultra-cold, but finite
temperature Bose gas in a harmonic trap. Numerical simulations indicate the
existence of distinct timescales associated with the decoherence of the
condensed versus thermal fractions, and the concomitant preferred scattering
from atoms in low lying trap states in the regime where superradiance takes
place on a timescale comparable to an inverse trap frequency. As a consequence
the scattered atoms experience a modest reduction in temperature as compared to
the unscattered atoms.
