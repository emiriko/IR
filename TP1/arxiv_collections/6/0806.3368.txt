The stoichiometric binding constants of Nickel(II), Cobalt(II),
Manganese(II), Silver(I), Zinc(II) ions with DNA, from Spirulina platensis were
determined from their binding isotherms by equilibrium dialysis and atomic
absorption spectroscopy. It was shown, that the nature of these ions
interaction with DNA, from S .platensis is different. For Cobalt(II), Zinc(II)
ions were observed cooperative effects and existence of two different types of
the binding sites. Nickel(II)_, Silver(I) -DNA complexes shows independent and
identical binding sites and Manganese(II)_ negative cooperative interaction.
The logarithm of binding constants for Cobalt (II)_, Nickel (II)_, Manganese
(II)_, Zinc (II)_, Silver (I) - DNA, from S. platensis in 3 mM Na(I) are 5.11;
5.18; 4.77; 5.05; 5.42; respectively. The linear correlation of logarithm of
binding constants (for complexes of metal-DNA from S. platensis) and the
covalent index of Pauling are observed.
