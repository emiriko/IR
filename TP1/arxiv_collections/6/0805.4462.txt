We present recent results from the BES experiment on the observation of the
Y(2175) in J/\psi\to \phi f_0(980) \eta, study of \eta(2225) in J/\psi\to
\gamma \phi \phi, and the production of X(1440) recoiling against an \omega or
a \phi in J/\psi hadronic decays. The observation of \psi(2S) radiative decays
is also presented.
