We prove that the results of a finite set of general quantum measurements on
an arbitrary dimensional quantum system can be simulated using a polynomial (in
measurements) number of hidden-variable states. In the limit of infinitely many
measurements, our method gives models with the minimal number of
hidden-variable states, which scales linearly with the number of measurements.
These results can find applications in foundations of quantum theory,
complexity studies and classical simulations of quantum systems.
