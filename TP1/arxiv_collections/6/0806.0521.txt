Outline: 1. Introduction, 2. Confinement, chiral dynamics and light scalar
mesons, 3. Chiral shielding of the \sigma(600), chiral constraints (the CGL
band), the \sigma(600) and the f0(980) in \pi\pi->\pi\pi, \pi\pi->KKbar,
\phi->\gamma\pi0\pi0, 4. The \phi meson radiative decays on light scalar
resonances, 5. Light scalars in \gamma\gamma collisions.
  Evidence for four-quark components of light scalars is given. The priority of
Quantum Field Theory in revealing the light scalar mystery is emphasized.
