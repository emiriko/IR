Let $Z$ be a germ of a reduced analytic space of pure dimension. We provide
an analytic proof of the uniform Briancon-Skoda theorem for the local ring
$\mathcal{O}_Z$; a result which was previously proved by Huneke by algebraic
methods. For ideals with few generators we also get much sharper results.
