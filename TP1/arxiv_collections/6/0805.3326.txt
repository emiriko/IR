We consider one-dimensional Brownian motion conditioned (in a suitable sense)
to have a local time at every point and at every moment bounded by some fixed
constant. Our main result shows that a phenomenon of entropic repulsion occurs:
that is, this process is ballistic and has an asymptotic velocity approximately
4.58... as high as required by the conditioning (the exact value of this
constant involves the first zero of a Bessel function). We also study the
random walk case and show that the process is asymptotically ballistic but with
an unknown speed.
