A theoretical and experimental study of the Intermediate Phase (IP) in
GexSe1-x is presented. Based on ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) models of
these glasses, a generic atomic picture of the IP is discussed thoroughly.
X-Ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) measurements on Ge-Se glasses over
a wide range including the IP window are presented to show the electronic
signature of the IP in the form of the shift in the absorption edge with the Ge
content. It is shown that MD based models clearly reproduce that shift.
