We present in a unified and self-contained manner the coordinate-free
approach to spherical harmonics initiated in the mid 19th century by James
Clerk Maxwell, William Thomson and Peter Guthrie Tait. We stress the
pedagogical advantages of this approach which leads in a natural way to many
physically relevant results that students find often difficult to work out
using spherical coordinates and associated Legendre functions. It is shown how
most physically relevant results of the theory of spherical harmonics - such as
recursion relations, Legendre's addition theorem,surface harmonics expansions,
the method of images, multipolar charge distributions, partial wave expansions,
Hobson's integral theorem, rotation matrix and Gaunt's integrals - can be
efficiently derived in a coordinate free fashion from a few basic elements of
the theory of solid and surface harmonics discussed in the paper.
