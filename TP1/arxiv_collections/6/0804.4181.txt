Anomalous Hall effect and spin Hall effect originate due to spin-orbit
coupling that in the Kohn-Luttinger ${\bf k}\cdot{\bf p}$ formalism is
represented by anomalous terms in the coordinate and velocity operators.
Relation of these operators to the Berry curvature in the momentum space is
presented for electrons in GaAs type semiconductors. For centrosymmetric
semiconductors, transformational properties of Berry curvature are discussed.
