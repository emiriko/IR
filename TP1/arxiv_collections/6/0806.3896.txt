A poly(styrene-block-methylmethacrylate) diblock copolymer in the hexagonal
cylindrical phase has been used as a mask for preparing a periodic gate on top
of a Ga[Al]As-heterostructure. A superlattice period of 43 nm could be imposed
onto the two-dimensional electron gas. Transport measurements show a
characteristic positive magnetoresistance around zero magnetic field which we
interpret as a signature of electron motion guided by the superlattice
potential.
