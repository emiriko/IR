We introduce in this paper the concept of tropical mirror hypersurfaces and
we prove a complex tropical localization Theorem which is a version of
Kapranov's Theorem \cite{K-00} in tropical geometry. We give a geometric and a
topological equivalence between coamoebas of complex algebraic hypersurfaces
defined by a maximally sparse polynomial and coamoebas of maximally sparse
complex tropical hypersurfaces.
