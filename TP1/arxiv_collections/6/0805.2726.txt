We explore the zero temperature phase behavior of a two-dimensional
two-component atomic Fermi gas with population and mass imbalance in the regime
of the BEC-BCS crossover. Working in the mean-field approximation, we show that
the normal and homogeneous balanced superfluid phases are separated by an
inhomogeneous superfluid phase of Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) type.
We obtain an analytical expression for the line of continuous transitions
separating the normal and inhomogeneous FFLO phases. We further show that the
transition from the FFLO phase to the homogeneous balanced superfluid is
discontinuous leading to phase separation. If the species have different
masses, the superfluid phase is favored when the lighter species is in excess.
We explore the implications of these findings for the properties of the
two-component Fermi gas in the atomic trap geometry. Finally, we compare and
contrast our findings with the predicted phase behavior of the electron-hole
bilayer system.
