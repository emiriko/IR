We prove a regularized formula for the secret key-assisted capacity region of
a quantum channel for transmitting private classical information. This result
parallels the work of Devetak on entanglement assisted quantum communication
capacity \cite{DHW05RI}. This formula provides a new family protocol, the
private father protocol, under the resource inequality framework that includes
private classical communication \it{without} secret key assistance as a child
protocol.
