We study the spectral properties of a class of many channel Hamiltonians
which contains those of systems of particles interacting through k-body and
field type forces which do not preserve the number of particles. Our results
concern the essential spectrum, the Mourre estimate, and the absence of
singular continuous spectrum. The appropriate formalism involves graded
C*-algebras and Hilbert C*-modules as basic tools.
