We present the calculation of the Wt single-top production channel to
next-to-leading order in QCD, interfaced with parton showers within the MC@NLO
formalism. This channel provides a complementary way of investigating the
properties of the Wtb vertex, with respect to the s- and t-channels. We pay
special attention to the separation of this process from top quark pair
production.
