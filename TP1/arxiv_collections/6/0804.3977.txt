We study bosons in the first excited Bloch band of a double-well optical
lattice, recently realized at NIST. By calculating the relevant parameters from
a realistic nonseparable lattice potential, we find that in the most favorable
cases the boson lifetime in the first excited band can be several orders of
magnitude longer than the typical nearest-neighbor tunnelling timescales, in
contrast to that of a simple single-well lattice. In addition, for sufficiently
small lattice depths the excited band has minima at nonzero momenta
incommensurate with the lattice period, which opens a possibility to realize an
exotic superfluid state that spontaneously breaks the time-reversal,
rotational, and translational symmetries. We discuss possible experimental
signatures of this novel state.
