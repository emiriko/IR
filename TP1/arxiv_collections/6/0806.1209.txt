A series of layered (Sr$_{1-x}$K$_x$)Fe$_2$As$_2$ compounds with nominal x=0
to 0.40 are synthesized by solid state reaction method. Similar to other parent
compounds of iron-based pnictide superconductors, the pure SrFe$_2$As$_2$ shows
a strong resistivity anomaly near 210 K, which was ascribed to the
spin-density-wave instability. The anomaly temperature is much higher than
those observed in LaOFeAs and BaFe$_2$As$_2$, the two prototype parent
compounds with ZrCuSiAs- and ThCr$_2$Si$_2$-type structures. K-doping strongly
suppresses this anomaly and induces superconductivity. Like in the case of
K-doped BaFe$_2$As$_2$, sharp superconducting transitions at T$_c\sim$38 K was
observed. We performed the Hall coefficient measurement, and confirmed that the
dominant carriers are hole-type. The carrier density is enhanced by a factor of
3 in comparison to F-doped LaOFeAs superconductor.
