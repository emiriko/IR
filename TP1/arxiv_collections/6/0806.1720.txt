The paper completes the study of symmetries of parabolic function
singularities with relation to complex crystallographic groups that was started
in \cite{GM,X9}. We classify smoothable automorphisms of $P_8$ singularities
which split the kernel of the intersection form on the second homology. For
such automorphisms, the monodromy groups acting on the duals to the eigenspaces
with degenerate intersection form are then identified as some of complex affine
reflection groups tabled in \cite{P}.
