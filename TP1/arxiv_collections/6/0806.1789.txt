We evaluate the realization of a novel geometry of a guided atom
interferometer based on a high temperature superconducting microstructure. The
interferometer type structure is obtained with a guiding potential realized by
two current carrying superconducting wires in combination with a closed
superconducting loop sustaining a persistent current. We present the layout and
realization of our superconducting atom chip. By employing simulations we
discuss the critical parameters of the interferometer guide in particular near
the splitting regions of the matter waves. Based on measurements of the
relevant chip properties we discuss the application of a compact and reliable
on-chip atom interferometer.
