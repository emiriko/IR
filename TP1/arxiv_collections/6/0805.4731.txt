We formulate holomorphic theory of gravity and study how the holomorphy
symmetry alters the two most important singular solutions of general
relativity: black holes and cosmology. We show that typical observers (freely)
falling into a holomorphic black hole do not encounter a curvature singularity.
Likewise, typical observers do not experience Big Bang singularity. Unlike
Hermitian gravity \cite{MantzHermitianGravity}, Holomorphic gravity does not
respect the reciprocity symmetry and thus it is mainly a toy model for a
gravity theory formulated on complex space-times. Yet it is a model that
deserves a closer investigation since in many aspects it resembles Hermitian
gravity and yet calculations are simpler. We have indications that holomorphic
gravity reduces to the laws of general relativity correctly at large distance
scales.
