Considering the evolution of a perfect fluid with self-similarity of the
second kind, we have found that an initial naked singularity can be trapped by
an event horizon due to collapsing matter. The fluid moves along time-like
geodesics with a self-similar parameter $\alpha = -3$. Since the metric
obtained is not asymptotically flat, we match the spacetime of the fluid with a
Schwarzschild spacetime. All the energy conditions are fulfilled until the
naked singularity.
