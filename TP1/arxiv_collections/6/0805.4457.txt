Variational wave functions used in the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method
are extensively improved to overcome the biases coming from the assumed
variational form of the wave functions. We construct a highly generalized
variational form by introducing a large number of variational parameters to the
Gutzwiller-Jastrow factor as well as to the one-body part. Moreover, the
projection operator to restore the symmetry of the wave function is introduced.
These improvements enable to treat fluctuations with long-ranged as well as
short-ranged correlations. A highly generalized wave function is implemented by
the Pfaffians introduced by Bouchaud et al., together with the stochastic
reconfiguration method introduced by Sorella for the parameter optimization.
Our framework offers much higher accuracy for strongly correlated electron
systems than the conventional variational Monte Carlo methods.
