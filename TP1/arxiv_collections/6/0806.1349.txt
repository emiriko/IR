It is explained how the time evolution of the operadic variables may be
introduced by using the operadic Lax equation. The operadic Lax representations
for the harmonic oscillator are constructed in 3-dimensional binary
anti-commutative algebras. As an example, an operadic Lax representation for
the harmonic oscillator in the Lie algebra sl(2) is constructed.
