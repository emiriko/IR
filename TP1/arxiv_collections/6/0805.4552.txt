We calculate leading-order dilepton yields from a quark-gluon plasma which
has a time-dependent anisotropy in momentum space. Such anisotropies can arise
during the earliest stages of quark-gluon plasma evolution due to the rapid
longitudinal expansion of the created matter. Two phenomenological models for
the proper time dependence of the parton hard momentum scale, p_hard, and the
plasma anisotropy parameter, xi, are constructed which describe the transition
of the plasma from its initial non-equilibrium state to an isotropic
thermalized state. The first model constructed interpolates between 1+1
dimensional free streaming at early times and 1+1 dimensional ideal
hydrodynamical expansion at late times. In the second model we include the
effect of collisional broadening of the parton distribution functions in the
early-time pre-equilibrium stage of plasma evolution. We find for both cases
that for fixed initial conditions high-energy dilepton production is enhanced
by pre-equilibrium emission. When the models are constrained to fixed final
pion multiplicity the dependence of the resulting spectra on the assumed plasma
isotropization time is reduced. Using our most realistic
collisionally-broadened model we find that high-transverse momentum dilepton
production would be enhanced by at most 40% at the Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider and 50% at CERN Large Hadron Collider if one assumes an
isotropization/thermalization time of 2 fm/c. Given sufficiently precise
experimental data this enhancement could be used to determine the plasma
isotropization time experimentally.
