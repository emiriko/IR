We give an overview of the main features of the CMS trigger and data
acquisition (DAQ) system. Then, we illustrate the strategies and trigger
configurations (trigger tables) developed for the detector calibration and
physics program of the CMS experiment, at start-up of LHC operations, as well
as their possible evolution with increasing luminosity. Finally, we discuss the
expected CPU time performance of the trigger algorithms and the CPU
requirements for the event filter farm at start-up.
