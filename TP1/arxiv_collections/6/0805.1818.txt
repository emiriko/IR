We report on the growth of ZnSe nanowires and nano-needles using molecular
beam epitaxy (MBE). Different growth regimes were found, depending on growth
temperature and the Zn--Se flux ratio. By employing a combined MBE growth of
nanowires and nano-needles without any post-processing of the sample, we
achieved an efficient suppression of stacking fault defects. This is confirmed
by transmission electron microscopy and by photoluminescence studies.
