We report exact calculations of magnetic and superconducting pair-pair
correlations for the half-filled band Hubbard model on an anisotropic
triangular lattice. Our results for the magnetic phases are similar to those
obtained with other techniques. The superconducting pair-pair correlations at
distances beyond nearest neighbor decrease monotonically with increasing
Hubbard interaction U for all anisotropy, indicating the absence of
frustration-driven superconductivity within the model.
