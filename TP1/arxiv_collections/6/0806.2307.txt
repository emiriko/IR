The direct comparison of two different continuum discretization methods
towards the solution of a composite particle scattering off a nucleus is
presented. The first approach -- the Continumm-Discretized Coupled Channel
method -- is based on the differential equation formalism, while the second one
-- the Wave-Packet Continuum Discretization method -- uses the integral
equation formulation for the composite-particle scattering problem. As
benchmark calculations we have chosen the deuteron off \nuc{58}{Ni} target
scattering (as a realistic illustrative example) at three different incident
energies: high, middle and low. Clear non-vanishing effects of closed inelastic
channels at small and intermediate energies are established. The elastic cross
sections found in both approaches are very close to each other for all three
considered energies.
