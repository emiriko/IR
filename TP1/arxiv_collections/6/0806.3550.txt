We calculate the thermodynamic properties of a collection of $N$ small
Josephson junctions coupled to a single-mode resonant electromagnetic cavity,
at finite temperature $T$, using several approaches. In the first approach, we
include all the quantum-mechanical levels of the junction, but treat the
junction-cavity interaction using a mean-field approximation developed
previously for $T = 0$. In the other approaches, the junctions are treated
including only the two lowest energy levels per junction, but with two
different Hamiltonians. The first of these maps onto the Dicke model of quantum
optics. The second is a modified Dicke model which contains an additional
XY-like coupling between the junctions. The modified Dicke model can be treated
using a mean-field theory, which in the limit of zero XY coupling gives the
solution of the Dicke model in the thermodynamic limit using Glauber coherent
states to represent the cavity. In all cases, for an $N$-independent
junction-cavity coupling, there is a critical junction number $N$ above which
there is a continuous transition from incoherence to coherence with decreasing
$T$. If the coupling scales with $N$ so as to give a well-behaved thermodynamic
limit, there is a critical minimum coupling strength for the onset of
coherence. In all three models, the cavity photon occupation numbers have a
non-Bose distribution when the system is coherent.
