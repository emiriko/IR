We establish some linear and nonlinear integral inequalities of
Gronwall-Bellman-Bihari type for functions with two independent variables on
general time scales. The results are illustrated with examples, obtained by
fixing the time scales to concrete ones. An estimation result for the solution
of a partial delta dynamic equation is given as an application.
