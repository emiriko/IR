We investigate effects of pseudo-spin population imbalance on Mott phases in
1D trapped two-component atomic Fermi gases loaded on optical lattices based on
the repulsive Hubbard model in harmonic traps. By using the density matrix
renormalization group method, we numerically calculate density profiles of each
component and clarify the pseudo-spin magnetism. Consequently, we find that all
the features from weakly imbalance to fully polarized cases are well described
by S=1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain under magnetic field. These results
indicate that the Mott phases offer experimental stages for studying various
interacting spin systems.
