Since the discovery of superconductivity in the cuprates two decades ago, it
has been firmly established that the CuO_2 plane is consequential for high T_C
superconductivity and a host of other very unusual properties. A new family of
superconductors with the general composition of LaFeAsO_(1-x)F_x has recently
been discovered but with the conspicuous lacking of the CuO_2 planes, thus
raising the tantalizing questions of the different pairing mechanisms in these
oxypnictide superconductors. Intimately related to pairing in a superconductor
are the superconducting gap, its value, structure, and temperature dependence.
Here we report the observation of a single gap in the superconductor
SmFeAsO_0.85F_0.15 with T_C = 42 K as measured by Andreev spectroscopy. The gap
value of 2Delta = 13.34+/-0.3 meV gives 2Delta/k_BT_C = 3.68, close to the BCS
prediction of 3.53. The gap decreases with temperature and vanishes at T_C in a
manner consistent with the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) prediction but
dramatically different from that of the pseudogap behavior in the cuprate
superconductors. Our results clearly indicate a nodeless gap order parameter,
which is nearly isotropic in size across different sections of the Fermi
surface, and are not compatible with models involving antiferromagnetic
fluctuations, strong correlations, t-J model, and the like, originally designed
for cuprates.
