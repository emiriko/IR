We study the potential of the h_1 -> a_1 a_1 -> 4 tau signal from the
lightest scalar (h_1) and pseudoscalar (a_1) Higgs bosons to cover the
parameter space of the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) at
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We exploit a 2 mu + 2 jets signature from four
taus decays (accompanied by missing transverse energy), resorting to both
Higgs-strahlung (HS), by triggering on leptonic W^\pm decays, and Vector Boson
Fusion (VBF), by triggering on two same sign non-isolated muons.
