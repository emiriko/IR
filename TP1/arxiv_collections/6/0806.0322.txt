A NJL Lagrangian extended to six and eight quark interactions is applied to
study temperature effects (SU(3) flavor limit, massless case), and (realistic
massive case). The transition temperature can be considerably reduced as
compared to the standard approach, in accordance with recent lattice
calculations. The mesonic spectra built on the spontaneously broken vacuum
induced by the 't Hooft interaction strength, as opposed to the commonly
considered case driven by the four-quark coupling, undergoes a rapid crossover
to the unbroken phase, with a slope and at a temperature which is regulated by
the strength of the OZI violating eight-quark interactions. This strength can
be adjusted in consonance with the four-quark coupling and leaves the spectra
unchanged, except for the sigma meson mass, which decreases. A first order
transition behavior is also a possible solution within the present approach.
