We introduce an algebra of data linkages. Data linkages are intended for
modelling the states of computations in which dynamic data structures are
involved. We present a simple model of computation in which states of
computations are modelled as data linkages and state changes take place by
means of certain actions. We describe the state changes and replies that result
from performing those actions by means of a term rewriting system with rule
priorities. The model in question is an upgrade of molecular dynamics. The
upgrading is mainly concerned with the features to deal with values and the
features to reclaim garbage.
