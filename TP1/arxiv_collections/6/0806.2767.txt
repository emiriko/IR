We consider interacting holographic dark energy model in Friedmann Robertson
Walker space time with positive spatial curvature and investigate the behavior
of curvature parameter and dark energy density in accelerated expanding epoch.
We also derive some conditions needed to cross the phantom divide line in this
model.
