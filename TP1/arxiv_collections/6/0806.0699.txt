We argue that statistical mechanics of systems with relaxation implies
breaking the energy function of systems into two having different
transformation rules. With this duality the energy approach incorporates the
generalized vortex forces. We show general theorems and their implications and
apply the approach to the particle confinement in fields of rotational
symmetry. Misconceptions of extensive use of the quasienergy and generalized
thermodynamic potential theories are exposed.
