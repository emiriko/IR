We show that in theory it is possible to obtain a Casimir interaction
potential that varies with distance as 1/r. We achieve this by invoking
hypothetical particles having a harmonic oscillator interaction potential. The
derivation parallels the derivation of the Casimir-Polder interaction between
atoms in electromagnetism.
