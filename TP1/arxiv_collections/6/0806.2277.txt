A set of universal relations between various properties of any few-body or
many-body system consisting of fermions with two spin states and a large but
finite scattering length have been derived by Shina Tan. We derive
generalizations of the Tan relations for a two-channel model for fermions near
a Feshbach resonance that includes a molecular state whose detuning energy
controls the scattering length. We use quantum field theory methods, including
renormalization and the operator product expansion, to derive these relations.
They reduce to the Tan relations as the scattering length is made increasingly
large.
