We describe a classification of pairs $M, N$ of lattices isometric to
$EE_8:=\sqrt 2 E_8$ such that the lattice $M + N$ is integral and rootless and
such that the dihedral group associated to them has order at most 12. It turns
out that most of these pairs may be embedded in the Leech lattice. Complete
proofs will appear in another article. This theory of integral lattices has
connections to vertex operator algebra theory and moonshine.
