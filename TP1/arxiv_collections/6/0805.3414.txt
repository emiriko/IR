We report a demonstration of quantum key distribution (QKD) at GHz clock
rates with InGaAs avalanche photodiodes (APDs) operating in a self-differencing
mode. Such a mode of operation allows detection of extremely weak avalanches so
that the detector afterpulse noise is sufficiently suppressed. The system is
characterized by a secure bit rate of 2.37 Mbps at 5.6 km and 27.9 kbps at 65.5
km when the fiber dispersion is not compensated. After compensating the fiber
dispersion, the QKD distance is extended to 101 km, resulting in a secure key
rate of 2.88 kbps. Our results suggest that InGaAs APDs are very well suited to
GHz QKD applications.
