This study, fundamentals of fuzzy block theory, and its application in
assessment of stability in underground openings, has surveyed. Using fuzzy
topics and inserting them in to key block theory, in two ways, fundamentals of
fuzzy block theory has been presented. In indirect combining, by coupling of
adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (NFIS) and classic block theory, we could
extract possible damage parts around a tunnel. In direct solution, some
principles of block theory, by means of different fuzzy facets theory, were
rewritten.
