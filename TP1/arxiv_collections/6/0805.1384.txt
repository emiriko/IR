Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) predicts that topological charge changing
transitions will take place in hot quark matter. Such transitions induce P- and
CP-violating effects. We will show that in the presence of a magnetic field
these transitions can separate quarks according to their electric charge along
the direction of the magnetic field. This is the so-called Chiral Magnetic
Effect. We will argue that it might be possible to observe the Chiral Magnetic
Effect in heavy ion collisions.
