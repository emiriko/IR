By means of high-resolution angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES)
we have studied the fermiology of 2H transition metal dichalcogenide polytypes
TaSe2, NbSe2, and Cu0.2NbS2. The tight-binding model of the electronic
structure, extracted from ARPES spectra for all three compounds, was used to
calculate the Lindhard function (bare spin susceptibility), which reflects the
propensity to charge density wave (CDW) instabilities observed in TaSe2 and
NbSe2. We show that though the Fermi surfaces of all three compounds possess an
incommensurate nesting vector in the close vicinity of the CDW wave vector, the
nesting and ordering wave vectors do not exactly coincide, and there is no
direct relationship between the magnitude of the susceptibility at the nesting
vector and the CDW transition temperature. The nesting vector persists across
the incommensurate CDW transition in TaSe2 as a function of temperature despite
the observable variations of the Fermi surface geometry in this temperature
range. In Cu0.2NbS2 the nesting vector is present despite different doping
level, which lets us expect a possible enhancement of the CDW instability with
Cu-intercalation in the CuxNbS2 family of materials.
