In the quest for physically realizable quantum information science (QIS)
primitives, self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) serve a dual role as sources of
photonic (flying) qubits and traps for electron spin; the prototypical
stationary qubit. Here we demonstrate the first observation of spin-selective,
near background-free and transform-limited photon emission from a resonantly
driven QD transition. The hallmark of resonance fluorescence, i.e. the Mollow
triplet in the scattered photon spectrum when an optical transition is driven
resonantly, is presented as a natural way to spectrally isolate the photons of
interest from the original driving field. We go on to demonstrate that the
relative frequencies of the two spin-tagged photon states are tuned independent
of an applied magnetic field via the spin-selective dynamic Stark effect
induced by the very same driving laser. This demonstration enables the
realization of challenging QIS proposals such as heralded single photon
generation for linear optics quantum computing, spin-photon entanglement, and
dipolar interaction mediated quantum logic gates. From a spectroscopy
perspective, the spin-selective dynamic Stark effect tunes the QD spin-state
splitting in the ground and excited states independently, thus enabling
previously inaccessible regimes for controlled probing of mesoscopic spin
systems.
