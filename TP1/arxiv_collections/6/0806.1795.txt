An approach is proposed to nuclear pairing at finite temperature and angular
momentum, which includes the effects of the quasiparticle-number fluctuation
and dynamic coupling to pair vibrations within the self-consistent
quasiparticle random-phase approximation. The numerical calculations of pairing
gaps, total energies, and heat capacities are carried out within a doubly
folded multilevel model as well as several realistic nuclei. The results
obtained show that, in the region of moderate and strong couplings, the sharp
transition between the superconducting and normal phases is smoothed out,
causing a thermal pairing gap, which does not collapse at a critical
temperature predicted by the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer's (BCS)
theory, but has a tail extended to high temperatures. The theory also predicts
the appearance of a thermally assisted pairing in hot rotating nuclei.
