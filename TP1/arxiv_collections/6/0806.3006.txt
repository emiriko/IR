We have used first-principles methods to investigate how metal atoms
dispersed in the interlayer space of graphitic materials affect their
hydrogen-binding properties. We have considered ideal stage-one
metal-intercalated graphites of various compositions as representative model
systems. Our calculations suggest that alkaline earth metals can significantly
enhance the hydrogen storage properties: for example, Be and Mg atoms would act
as binding sites of three or four hydrogen molecules, with binding energies per
H$_2$ in the 0.2--0.7 eV range, as required for applications. We also find that
alkali and transition metals are not as effective in enhancing the storage
capacity.
