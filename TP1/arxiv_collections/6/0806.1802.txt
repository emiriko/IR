These last years, there were many studies on the problem of the conflict
coming from information combination, especially in evidence theory. We can
summarise the solutions for manage the conflict into three different
approaches: first, we can try to suppress or reduce the conflict before the
combination step, secondly, we can manage the conflict in order to give no
influence of the conflict in the combination step, and then take into account
the conflict in the decision step, thirdly, we can take into account the
conflict in the combination step. The first approach is certainly the better,
but not always feasible. It is difficult to say which approach is the best
between the second and the third. However, the most important is the produced
results in applications. We propose here a new combination rule that
distributes the conflict proportionally on the element given this conflict. We
compare these different combination rules on real data in Sonar imagery and
Radar target classification.
