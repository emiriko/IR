Multi-party local quantum operations with shared quantum entanglement or
shared classical randomness are studied. The following facts are established:
  (i) There is a ball of local operations with shared randomness lying within
the space spanned by the no-signaling operations and centred at the completely
noisy channel.
  (ii) The existence of the ball of local operations with shared randomness is
employed to prove that the weak membership problem for local operations with
shared entanglement is strongly NP-hard.
  (iii) Local operations with shared entanglement are characterized in terms of
linear functionals that are ``completely'' positive on a certain cone K of
separable Hermitian operators, under a natural notion of complete positivity
appropriate to that cone. Local operations with shared randomness (but not
entanglement) are also characterized in terms of linear functionals that are
merely positive on that same cone K.
  (iv) Existing characterizations of no-signaling operations are generalized to
the multi-party setting and recast in terms of the Choi-Jamiolkowski
representation for quantum super-operators. It is noted that the standard
nonlocal box is an example of a no-signaling operation that is separable, yet
cannot be implemented by local operations with shared entanglement.
