For the tracking stage path planning, we design a two-axis cross-coupling
control system which uses the PI controller to compensate the contour error
between axes. In this paper, the stage adoptive is designed by our laboratory
(Precision Machine Center of National Formosa University). The cross-coupling
controller calculates the actuating signal of each axis by combining multi-axes
position error. Hence, the cross-coupling controller improves the stage
tracking ability and decreases the contour error. The experiments show
excellent stage motion. This finding confirms that the proposed method is a
powerful and efficient tool for improving stage tracking ability. Also found
were the stages tracking to minimize contour error of two types circular to
approximately 25nm.
