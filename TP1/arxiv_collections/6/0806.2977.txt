Forward physics with CMS at the LHC covers a wide range of physics subjects,
including very low-x QCD, underlying event and multiple interactions
characteristics, gamma-mediated processes, shower development at the energy
scale of primary cosmic ray interactions with the atmosphere, diffraction in
the presence of a hard scale and even MSSM Higgs discovery in central exclusive
production. We describe the forward detector instrumentation around the CMS
interaction point and present selected feasibility studies to illustrate their
physics potential.
