A new class of artificially structured materials called metamaterials makes
it possible to achieve electromagnetic properties that do not exist in nature.
In this paper we review the recent progress made in the area of optical
metamaterials. It was predicted that nanostructured metamaterials could provide
us with artificial magnetic response and negative refractive index at optical
frequencies. To date, optical metamagnetics have been already fabricated to
demonstrate artificial magnetic response in the infrared and across the entire
visible spectrum, while metamaterials showing negative refractive index, also
called negative index materials (NIM), have been demonstrated in the infrared
and at the border with the visible spectral range. Here we report the results
of a sample that displays NIM behavior for red light at a wavelength of 710 nm.
This is the shortest wavelength so far at which NIM behavior has been observed
for light (excluding a device built on surface plasmon polaritons). We also
discuss the fabrication challenges and the impact of fabrication limitations,
specifically surface roughness of the fabricated structures on the optical
properties of the metamaterials.
