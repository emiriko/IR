Quantum systems in Fock states do not have a phase. When two or more
Bose-Einstein condensates are sent into interferometers, they nevertheless
acquire a relative phase under the effect of quantum measurements. The usual
explanation relies on spontaneous symmetry breaking, where phases are ascribed
to all condensates and treated as unknown classical quantities. However, this
image is not always sufficient: when all particles are measured, quantum
mechanics predicts probabilities that are sometimes in contradiction with it,
as illustrated by quantum violations of local realism. In this letter, we show
that interferometers can be used to demonstrate a large variety of violations
with an arbitrarily large number of particles. With two independent
condensates, we find violations of the BCHSH inequalities, as well as new
N-body Hardy impossibilities. With three condensates, we obtain new GHZ
(Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger) type contradictions.
