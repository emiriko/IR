The classical procedures which define the relativistic notion of space-time
can be implemented in the framework of Quantum Field Theory. Only relying on
the conformal symmetries of field propagation, time-frequency transfer and
localization lead to the definition of time-frequency references and positions
in space-time as quantum observables. Quantum positions have a non vanishing
commutator identifying with spin, both observables characterizing quantum
localization in space-time. Frame transformations to accelerated frames differ
from their classical counterparts. Conformal symmetry nevertheless allows to
extend the covariance rules underlying the formalism of general relativity
under an algebraic form suiting the quantum framework.
