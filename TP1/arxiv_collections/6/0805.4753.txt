We present the results of theoretical studies on operations with charge
qubits in the system composed of two tunnel-coupled semiconductor quantum dots
whose two lowest states (localized in different dots) define the logical qubit
states while two excited states (delocalized between the dots) serve for the
electron transfer from one dot to another under the influence of the laser
pulse. It is shown that in the case of small energy separation between the
excited levels, the optimal (from the viewpoint of minimal single-qubit
operation time and maximum operation fidelity) strategy is to tune the laser
frequency between the excited levels. The pulse parameters for implementation
of the quantum NOT operation are determined. Analytical results obtained in the
rotating-wave approximation are confirmed by rigorous numerical calculations.
