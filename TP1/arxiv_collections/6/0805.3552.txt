Suppose M is a noncompact connected oriented C^infty n-manifold and omega is
a positive volume form on M. Let D^+(M) denote the group of orientation
preserving diffeomorphisms of M endowed with the compact-open C^infty topology
and D(M; omega) denote the subgroup of omega-preserving diffeomorphisms of M.
In this paper we propose a unified approach for realization of mass transfer
toward ends by diffeomorphisms of M. This argument together with Moser's
theorem enables us to deduce two selection theorems for the groups D^+(M) and
D(M; omega). The first one is the extension of Moser's theorem to noncompact
manifolds, that is, the existence of sections for the orbit maps under the
action of D^+(M) on the space of volume forms. This implies that D(M; omega) is
a strong deformation retract of the group D^+(M; E^omega_M) consisting of h in
D^+(M) which preserves the set E^omega_M of omega-finite ends of M. The second
one is related to the mass flow toward ends under volume-preserving
diffeomorphisms of M. Let D_{E_M}(M; omega) denote the subgroup consisting of
all h in D(M; omega) which fix the ends E_M of M. S.R.Alpern and V.S.Prasad
introduced the topological vector space S(M; omega) of end charges of M and the
end charge homomorphism c^omega : D_{E_M}(M; omega) to S(M; omega), which
measures the mass flow toward ends induced by each h in D_{E_M}(M; omega). We
show that the homomorphism c^omega has a continuous section. This induces the
factorization D_{E_M}(M; omega) cong ker c^omega times S(M; omega) and it
implies that ker c^omega is a strong deformation retract of D_{E_M}(M; omega).
