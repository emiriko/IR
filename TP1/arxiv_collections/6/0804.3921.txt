We revisit here the recent proposal for overspinning a nearly extreme black
hole by means of a quantum tunneling process. We show that electrically neutral
massless fermions evade possible back reactions effects related to
superradiance, confirming the view that it would be indeed possible to form a
naked singularity due to quantum effects.
