Parametrization of the quark and lepton mixing matrices is the first attempt
to understand the mixing of fermions. In this work, we parameterize the quark
and lepton matrices with the help of quark-lepton complementarity (QLC) in a
tri-bimaximal pattern of lepton mixing matrix. In this way, we combine the
parametrization of the two matrices with each other. We apply this new
parametrization to several physical quantities, and show its simplicity in the
expression of, e.g., the Jarlskog parameter of CP violation.
