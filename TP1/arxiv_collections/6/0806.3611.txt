We study the Josephson effect in graphene-based ballistic
superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor (SFS) junctions. We find an
oscillatory Josephson coupling $I_c R_N$ of F graphene whose amplitude is
nonvanishing for a half-metallic graphene, increases for the exchange fields
$h$ above the Fermi energy $E_{F}$ and shows only a slow damping at strong
exchange fields $h\gg E_{F}$. We interpret this long range Josephson coupling
as the result of the exchange mediated Andreev-Klein process at FS interfaces
which enhances the induced antiparallel-spin superconducting correlations in F
graphene by increasing $h$ above $E_{F}$. We further demonstrate the existence
of regular temperature induced transitions between 0 and $\pi$ couplings in the
plane of $T$ and $h$ where the phase boundaries have distinct shapes at the two
regimes of $h$ below and above $E_{F}$.
