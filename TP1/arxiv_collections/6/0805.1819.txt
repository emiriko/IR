We demonstrate storage of excitons in a single nanostructure, a
self-assembled Quantum Post. After generation electron and holes forming the
exciton are separated by an electric field towards opposite ends of the Quantum
Post inhibiting their radiative recombination. After a defined time such
spatially indirect excitons are reconverted to optically active direct excitons
by switching the electric field. The emitted light of the stored exciton is
detected in the limit of a single nanostructure and storage times exceeding 30
msec are demonstrated. We identify a slow tunneling of the electron out of the
Quantum Post as the dominant loss mechanism by comparing the field dependent
temporal decay of the storage signal to models for this process and radiative
losses.
