Magnetic properties of stechiometric Cs2AgF4 have been calculated within a
very strong correlation limit taking into account a low-symmetry crystal field
and the intra-atomic spin-orbit coupling of the Ag2+ ion. We consistently
explain the insulating ground state and the magnetic state revealing the spin
gap of 2.6 meV below Tc of 14.9 K. A d-d excitation of 2.0-2.3 eV related to
the t2g-eg promotion energy (=10Dq) is a reason for the lilac colour of
Cs2AgF4. Our approach can be experimentally verified by the measurement of the
g factor (gz =2.12 and gy =2.52) and the absorption energy at 2.0-2.3 eV.
