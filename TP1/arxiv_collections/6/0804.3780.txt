We calculate self-consistent single-nucleon and single-Lambda potentials in
hyperonic matter for different Lambda concentrations. The predictions include
relativistic Dirac effects as reported previously in a calculation of the
Lambda binding energy in symmetric nuclear matter. We discuss the dependence on
momentum, density, and Lambda fraction.
