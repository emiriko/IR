We study FZZT-branes and open string amplitudes in (p,q) minimal string
theory. We focus on the simplest boundary changing operators in two-matrix
models, and identify the corresponding operators in worldsheet theory through
the comparison of amplitudes. Along the way, we find a novel linear relation
among FZZT boundary states in minimal string theory. We also show that the
boundary ground ring is realized on physical open string operators in a very
simple manner, and discuss its use for perturbative computation of higher open
string amplitudes.
