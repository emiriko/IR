We construct some AdS/QCD models by the systematic procedure of GKN. These
models reflect three rather different asymptotics the gauge theory beta
functions approach at the infrared region, $\beta\propto-\lambda^2, -\lambda^3$
and $\beta\propto-\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the 't Hooft coupling constant.
We then calculate the heavy quark potentials in these models by holographic
methods and find that they can more consistently fit the lattice data relative
to the usual models which do not include the renormalization group improving
effects. But only use the lattice QCD heavy quark potentials as constrains, we
cannot distinguish which kind of infrared asymptotics is the better one.
