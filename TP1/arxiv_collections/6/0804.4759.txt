We present here a novel, cost-effective method for increasing and controlling
the ortho para H2 (o p H2) conversion yield. First, we invoke two processes
derived from fundamental, surface science insights, based on the effect of
molecular orientation on the hydrogen solid surface reaction, i.e., dynamical
quantum filtering and steering, and apply them to enhance the o p H2 conversion
yield. Second, we find an important factor that can significantly influence the
yield i.e., inhomogeneity of spin density distribution. This factor gives us a
promising possibility to increase the yield and to find the best catalyst e.g.,
design of materials that can function as catalysts for the o p H2 conversion.
