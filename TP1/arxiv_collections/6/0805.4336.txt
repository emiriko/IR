The stability of thin liquid coatings is of fundamental interest in every-
day life. Homogeneous and non-volatile liquid coatings may dewet either by
heterogeneous nucleation, thermal nucleation, or spinodal dewetting. Wetting
and dewetting is explained on a fundamental level, including a discussion of
relevant interactions. The article will also address the various dewetting
scenarios and explain how the effective interface potential governs the
behavior obtained for various stratified substrates and film thicknesses.
