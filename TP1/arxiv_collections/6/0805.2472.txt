Recently, several schemes for the experimental creation of Dicke states were
described. In this paper, we show that all the $n$-qubit symmetric Dicke states
with $l$ ($2\leq l\leq (n-2)$) excitations are inequivalent to the $% |GHZ>$
state or the $|W>$ state under SLOCC, that the even $n$% -qubit symmetric Dicke
state with $n/2$ excitations is inequivalent to any even $n$-qubit symmetric
Dicke state with $l\neq n/2$ excitations under SLOCC, and that all the
$n$-qubit symmetric Dicke states with $l$ ($2\leq l\leq (n-2)$) excitations
satisfy Coffman, Kundu and Wootters' generalized monogamy inequality
$C_{12}^{2}+...+C_{1n}^{2}<C_{1(2...n)}^{2}<1$.
