Due to the sensitivity of the piezoelectric layer in surface acoustic wave
(SAW) resonators to temperature, a method of achieving device stability as a
function of temperature is required. This work presents the design, modeling
and characterization of integrated dual-serpentine polysilicon resistors as a
method for temperature control of CMOS SAW resonators. The design employs the
oven control temperature stabilization scheme where the device's temperature is
elevated to higher than Tmax to maintain constant device temperature. The
efficiency of the polysilicon resistor as a heating element was verified
through a 1-D partial differential equation model, 3-D CoventorWare finite
element simulations and measurements using Compix thermal camera. To verify
that the on-chip hotplate is effective as a temperature control method, both DC
and RF measurements of the heater together with the resonator were conducted.
Experimental results have indicated that the TCF of the CMOS SAW resonator of
-97.2 ppm/deg C has been reduced to -23.19 ppm/deg C when heated to 56 deg C.
