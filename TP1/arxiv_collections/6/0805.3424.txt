The correction to the wave function of the ground state in a hydrogen-like
atom due to an external homogenous magnetic field is found exactly in the
parameter $Z\alpha$. The $j=1/2$ projection of the correction to the wave
function of the $ns_{1/2}$ state due to the external homogeneous magnetic field
is found for arbitrary $n$. The $j=3/2$ projection of the correction to the
wave function of the $ns_{1/2}$ state due to the nuclear magnetic moment is
also found for arbitrary $n$. Using these results, we have calculated the
shielding of the nuclear magnetic moment by the $ns_{1/2}$ electron.
