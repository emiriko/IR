We study the renormalization of the properties of low lying charm and hidden
charm scalar mesons in a nuclear medium, concretely of the D_{s0}(2317) and the
theoretical hidden charm state X(3700). We find that for the D_{s0}(2317), with
negligible width at zero density, the width becomes about 100 MeV at normal
nuclear matter density, while in the case of the X(3700) the width becomes as
large as 200 MeV. We discuss the origin of this new width and trace it to
reactions occurring in the nucleus, while offering a guideline for future
experiments testing these changes. We also show how those medium modifications
will bring valuable information on the nature of the scalar resonances and the
mechanisms of the interaction of D mesons with nucleons and nuclei.
