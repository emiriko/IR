We analyze the sensitivity of the capacity of a multi-antenna multi-user
system to the number of users being served. We show analytically that, for a
given desired sum-rate, the extra power needed to serve a subset of the users
at low SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) can be very small, and is generally much
smaller than the extra power needed to serve the same subset at high SNR. The
advantages of serving only subsets of the users are many: multi-user algorithms
have lower complexity, reduced channel-state information requirements, and,
often, better performance. We provide guidelines on how many users to serve to
get near-capacity performance with low complexity. For example, we show how in
an eight-antenna eight-user system we can serve only four users and still be
approximately 2 dB from capacity at very low SNR.
