We analyze the extension of the well known relation between Brownian motion
and Schroedinger equation to the family of Levy processes. We consider a
Levy-Schroedinger equation where the usual kinetic energy operator - the
Laplacian - is generalized by means of a selfadjoint, pseudodifferential
operator whose symbol is the logarithmic characteristic of an infinitely
divisible law. The Levy-Khintchin formula shows then how to write down this
operator in an integro--differential form. When the underlying Levy process is
stable we recover as a particular case the fractional Schroedinger equation. A
few examples are finally given and we find that there are physically relevant
models (such as a form of the relativistic Schroedinger equation) that are in
the domain of the non-stable, Levy-Schroedinger equations.
