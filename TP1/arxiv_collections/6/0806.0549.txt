We introduce a modified version of the Hirshfeld charge analysis method and
demonstrate its accurateness by calculating the charge transfer between the
paramagnetic molecule NO2 and graphene. The charge transfer between
paramagnetic molecules and a graphene layer as calculated with ab initio
methods can crucially depend on the size of the supercell used in the
calculation. This has important consequences for adsorption studies involving
paramagnetic molecules such as NO2 physisorbed on graphene or on carbon
nanotubes.
