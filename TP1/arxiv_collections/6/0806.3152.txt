In this paper we propose a new practical P2P system based on a full
transposition network topology named TRANS-Net. Full transposition networks
achieve higher fault-tolerance and lower congestion among the class of
transposition networks. TRANS-Net provides an efficient lookup service i.e. k
hops with high probability, where k satisfies Theta(log_n m) less than k less
than Theta(log_2 m), where m denotes the number of system nodes and n is a
system parameter related to the maximum number that m can take (up to n!).
Experiments show that the look-up performance achieves the lower limit of the
complexity relation. TRANS-Net also preserves data locality and provides
efficient look-up performance for complex queries such as multi-dimensional
queries.
