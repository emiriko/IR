In this paper the Sudoku problem is solved using stochastic search techniques
and these are: Cultural Genetic Algorithm (CGA), Repulsive Particle Swarm
Optimization (RPSO), Quantum Simulated Annealing (QSA) and the Hybrid method
that combines Genetic Algorithm with Simulated Annealing (HGASA). The results
obtained show that the CGA, QSA and HGASA are able to solve the Sudoku puzzle
with CGA finding a solution in 28 seconds, while QSA finding a solution in 65
seconds and HGASA in 1.447 seconds. This is mainly because HGASA combines the
parallel searching of GA with the flexibility of SA. The RPSO was found to be
unable to solve the puzzle.
