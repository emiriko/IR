A short range force constant model (SRFCM) has been applied for the first
time to investigate the phonons in RMnO3 (R = Pr, Eu, Tb, Dy, Ho) perovskites
in their orthorhombic phase. The calculations with 17 stretching and bending
force constants provide good agreement for the observed Raman frequencies. The
infrared frequencies have been assigned for the first time.
