We show that it is possible to modify the stationary state by a feedback
control in a two-level dissipative quantum system. Based on the geometric
control theory, we also analyze the effect of the feedback on the time-optimal
control in the dissipative system governed by the Lindblad master equation.
These effects are reflected in the function $\Delta_A(\vec{x})$ and
$\Delta_B(\vec{x})$ that characterize the optimal trajectories, as well as the
switching function $\Phi(t)$ and $\theta(t),$ which characterize the switching
point in time for the time-optimal trajectory.
