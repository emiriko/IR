We define the excedence set and the excedance word on $G_{r,n}$, generalizing
a work of Ehrenborg and Steingrimsson and use the inclusion-exclusion principle
to calculate the number of colored permutations having a prescribed excedance
word. We show some symmetric properties as Log concavity and unimodality of a
specific sequence of excedance words.
