Motivated by the well know Chamblin-Reall solutions of $n$-dimensional
background spacetime in a dilaton gravity and the dynamics of a domain wall in
the same backgrounds, we have tried to generalize those solutions by including
electromagnetic field in the bulk. The electromagnetic field is assumed to be
coupled with the scalar field in an exponential way. Under the specific
relations among the various parameters in our model, we have found five
different types of solutions. For every case, the solution has singularity. In
these backgrounds, we have also studied the dynamics of domain wall. The energy
densities which play the role of these interesting dynamics, are know to be
induced from the bulk fields through Israel junction condition. In this more
general background field configuration, we have again found many occasions to
exist static bulk spactime consistent with the dynamic domain wall. In several
cases, depending upon the values of the parameters, in the early stage of
evolution, the domain wall is found to have an inflationary phase for finite
period of it's proper time followed by usual decelerated expansion.
