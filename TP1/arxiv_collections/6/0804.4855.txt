Spin Transfer Nano-Oscillators (STNOs) are good candidates for applications
to telecommunications, but their output power is very low, under the nW. A
possible solution to overcome this problem is to synchronize an assembly of
STNOs. For manufacturing purposes, large number of STNOs will have to be
electrically connected. In this letter, we study analytically the impact of
electrical connection on the synchronization of STNOs. Our analysis shows that
the phase dynamics of the coupled STNOs can be described in the framework of
the Kuramoto model. The conditions for successful synchronization of an
assembly of STNOs are derived.
