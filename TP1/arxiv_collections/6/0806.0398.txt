Continuous first-order logic is used to apply model-theoretic analysis to
analytic structures (e.g. Hilbert spaces, Banach spaces, probability spaces,
etc.). Classical computable model theory is used to examine the algorithmic
structure of mathematical objects that can be described in classical
first-order logic. The present paper shows that probabilistic computation
(sometimes called randomized computation) can play an analogous role for
structures described in continuous first-order logic. The main result of this
paper is an effective completeness theorem, showing that every decidable
continuous first-order theory has a probabilistically decidable model. Later
sections give examples of the application of this framework to various classes
of structures, and to some problems of computational complexity theory.
