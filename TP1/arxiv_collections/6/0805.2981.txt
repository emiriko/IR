Many relevant applications of group theoretical methods to physical problems
are related, in some manner, to classification schemes by means of symmetry
groups. In these schemes, irreducible representations of a Lie group have to be
decomposed according to some subgroup, thus providing a labeling of states in
terms of the subgroup. This is the typical situation in nuclear physics, where
Hamiltonians are described as functions of the Casimir operators of the groups
involved in some reduction chain. This further gives an effective method to
deduce the corresponding energy formulae. It is not however infrequent that the
embedding of a Lie group as subgroup of a larger symmetry group is not
canonical, hence leading to different branching rules of representations and to
an insufficient number of labeling operators.
  The objective of this work is to review the actual developments of the
contraction method, including also reduction chains with respect to abelian
(Cartan) subalgebras. The decomposition of the invariants of the coadjoint
representation provide natural classes of labeling operators for the
corresponding embeddings, which are of interest for various specific problems
ranging from nuclear physics to the group theoretical foundations of the
periodic table of chemical elements.
