It is well known that solutions of general relativity which allow for
traversable wormholes require the existence of exotic matter (matter that
violates weak or null energy conditions [WEC or NEC]). In this article, we
provide a class of exact solution for Einstein-Maxwell field equations
describing wormholes assuming the erstwhile cosmological term $\Lambda$ to be
space variable, viz., $\Lambda = \Lambda (r)$.
  The source considered here not only a matter entirely but a sum of matters
i.e. anisotropic matter distribution, electromagnetic field and cosmological
constant whose effective parts obey all energy conditions out side the wormhole
throat. Here violation of energy conditions can be compensated by varying
cosmological constant. The important feature of this article is that one can
get wormhole structure, at least theoretically, comprising with physically
acceptable matters.
