Supersymmetric cascades, involving charginos and neutralinos at various
stages, contribute in a significant way to Higgs production at the LHC. We
explore the nature of such cascades, completely relaxing the universality of
the gaugino masses. It is found that the deviation from the scenario with
universal gaugino masses would be reflected in the relative production rates
for the lightest Higgs and the charged Higgses, two characteristic particles of
an extended Higgs sector.
