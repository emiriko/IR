In this paper, we study the logarithmic stability for the hyperbolic
equations by arbitrary boundary observation. Based on Carleman estimate, we
first prove an estimate of the resolvent operator of such equation. Then we
prove the logarithmic stability estimate for the hyperbolic equations without
any assumption on an observation subboundary.
