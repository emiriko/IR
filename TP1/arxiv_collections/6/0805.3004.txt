We report STAR's preliminary measurement of the inclusive jet longitudinal
spin asymmetry $A_{LL}$ using data from the RHIC 2006 run. The 2006 data set
was taken with 200 GeV polarized proton-proton collisions and represents 4.7
$pb^{-1}$ of data. Typical beam polarizations were $\sim 55-60%$. The data are
compared with theoretical calculations of $A_{LL}$ based on various GRSV models
of the polarized parton distribution functions in the nucleon. Previous STAR
inclusive jet $A_{LL}$ and cross section measurements are also presented, as is
a discussion of constraints these data place on the allowed theoretical models.
