We propose to detect the Mott insulator-superfluid quantum phase transition
in an array of coupled cavities by studying the polariton and photon
fluctuations in a block of linear dimension M (in units of the lattice constant
of the array). We explicitly show this for a one-dimensional array; the
analysis can be however extended to higher dimensions. In the Mott phase
polariton fluctuations are independent of the block size. In the superfluid
phase they grow logarithmically with M, the prefactor being related to the
compressibility of the system. In the case of photon fluctuations, the critical
behaviour is encoded in the subleading scaling with the block dimension, while
the leading behaviour is linear in M and non-critical. Our results have been
obtained by means of the density matrix renormalization group numerical
algorithm.
