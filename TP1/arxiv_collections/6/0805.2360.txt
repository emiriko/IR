In unified field theory the cosmological model of the universe has
supersymmetric fields. Supersymmetric particles as dark and normal matter in
galaxy clusters have a phase separation. Dark matter in halos have a
statistical physics equation of state. Neutralino particle gas with gravitation
can have a collapse of dark matter lumps. A condensate phase due to boson
creation by annhillation and exchange can occur at high densities. The collapse
of the boson condensate, including neutralinos, into the Schwarzschild radius
creates dark matter black holes. Microscopic dark matter black holes can
evaporate with Hawking effect giving gamma ray bursts and create a spectrum of
normal particles. The phase separation of normal and dark matter in galaxy
clusters and inside galaxies is given by statistical physics.
