We consider a random walk X_n in Z_+, starting at X_0=x>= 0, with transition
probabilities P(X_{n+1}=X_n+1|X_n=y>=1)=1/2-\delta/(4y+2\delta)
P(X_{n+1}=X_n+1|X_n=y>=1)=1/2+\delta/(4y+2\delta) and X_{n+1}=1 whenever X_n=0.
We prove that the expectation value of X_n behaves like n^{1-(\delta/2)} as n
goes to infinity when \delta is in the range (1,2). The proof is based upon the
Karlin-McGregor spectral representation, which is made explicit for this random
walk.
