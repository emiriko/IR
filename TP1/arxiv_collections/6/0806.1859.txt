Quantum annealing is a generic name of quantum algorithms to use
quantum-mechanical fluctuations to search for the solution of optimization
problem. It shares the basic idea with quantum adiabatic evolution studied
actively in quantum computation. The present paper reviews the mathematical and
theoretical foundation of quantum annealing. In particular, theorems are
presented for convergence conditions of quantum annealing to the target optimal
state after an infinite-time evolution following the Schroedinger or stochastic
(Monte Carlo) dynamics. It is proved that the same asymptotic behavior of the
control parameter guarantees convergence both for the Schroedinger dynamics and
the stochastic dynamics in spite of the essential difference of these two types
of dynamics. Also described are the prescriptions to reduce errors in the final
approximate solution obtained after a long but finite dynamical evolution of
quantum annealing. It is shown there that we can reduce errors significantly by
an ingenious choice of annealing schedule (time dependence of the control
parameter) without compromising computational complexity qualitatively. A
review is given on the derivation of the convergence condition for classical
simulated annealing from the view point of quantum adiabaticity using a
classical-quantum mapping.
