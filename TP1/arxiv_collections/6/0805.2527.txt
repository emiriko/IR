We derive semiclassical quantization equations for graphene mono- and bilayer
systems where the excitations are confined by the applied inhomogeneous
magnetic field. The importance of a semiclassical phase, a consequence of the
spinor nature of the excitations, is pointed out. The semiclassical
eigenenergies show good agreement with the results of quantum mechanical
calculations based on the Dirac equation of graphene and with numerical tight
binding calculations.
