In this paper we use a variant of the Watts-Strogatz small-world model to
predict wildfire behavior near the critical propagation/nonpropagation
threshold. We find that forest fire patterns are fractal and that critical
exponents are universal, which suggests that the propagation/nonpropagation
transition is a second-order transition. Universality tells us that the
characteristic critical behaviour of propagation in real (amorphous) forest
landscapes can be extracted from the simplest network model.
