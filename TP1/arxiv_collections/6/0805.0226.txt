The contributions of heat and work in generating a new surface area are
considered. Unlike the classical theory of vapor/droplet equilibrium, which
associates changing surface areas with work done against the surface tension,
an alternative approach assumes that the droplets grow due to a controllable
condensation of vapor and the internal energy of droplets changes due to the
heat of the phase transition, and not due to the mechanical work. The effect of
radii on the internal energy is discussed. The theory of the vapor/droplet
equilibrium is constructed on the basis of the fundamental Clapeyron equation.
When droplet radii exceed about 50 Lennard-Jones' molecular diameters, the
classical and new models yield similar values of thermodynamic parameters, but
differ essentially in the range of the finest clusters and nanocapillaries. In
contrast to the Kelvin equation, which is not applicable for adsorption in
micropores with radii less than 1 nm and fails in its description of hysteresis
loops in mesopores, the present approach is in reasonably good agreement with
observations; the model gives rational explanations to the mechanism of a
droplet growth and critical parameters of nucleation.
