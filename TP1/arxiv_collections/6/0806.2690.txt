These lecture notes provide an introduction to quantum cluster methods for
strongly correlated systems. Cluster Perturbation Theory (CPT), the Variational
Cluster Approximation (VCA) and Cellular Dynamical Mean Field Theory (CDMFT)
are described, as well as the exact diagonalization solver for the cluster.
Potthoff's self-energy functional formalism is reviewed. Some numerical
procedures, in particular regarding the exact diagonalization method and the
frequency-momentum integrals needed in VCA, are discussed in detail.
