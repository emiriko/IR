The factorization of the amplitude of the process gamma* gamma -> gamma gamma
in the low energy and high photon virtuality region is demonstrated at the Born
order and in the leading logarithmic approximation. The leading order two
photon (generalized) distribution amplitudes exhibit a characteristic ln Q2
behaviour and obey new inhomogeneous evolution equations.
