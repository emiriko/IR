In this paper, we use the Weisskopf-Wigner theory to study the entanglement
in the state of the free-space radiation field produced from vacuum due to
atomic decay. We show how bipartite entanglement is shared between different
partitions of the radiation modes. We investigate the role played by the size
of the partitions and their detuning with the decaying atom. The dynamics of
the atom-field entanglement during the atomic decay is also briefly discussed.
  From this dynamics, we assert that such entanglement is the physical quantity
that fix the statistical atomic decay time.
