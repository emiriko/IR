Quarkonia (J/psi, psi', chi_C, Upsilon) production provides a sensitive probe
of gluon distributions and their modification in nuclei; and is a leading probe
of the hot-dense (deconfined) matter created in high-energy collisions of heavy
ions. We will discuss the physics of quarkonia production in the context of
recent p+p measurements at PHENIX. We next discuss Cold-Nuclear Matter (CNM)
effects as seen in our measurements in $d+Au$ collisions - both for intrinsic
physics such as gluon saturation and final-state dissociation, and as a
baseline for studies in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Then we review the latest
nucleus-nucleus results in the light of the expected CNM effects, and discuss
two leading scenarios for the observed suppression patterns. Finally we show
the latest data from PHENIX, including new d+Au data from the 2007-2008 run;
and then look into the future.
