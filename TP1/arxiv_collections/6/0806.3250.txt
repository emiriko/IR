We start by describing two of the main proposals for duality in Abelian gauge
theories, namely $F$(ield strength)-duality approach and the $S$% -duality
formalism. We then discuss how $F$-duality and $S$-duality can be applied to
the case of linearized gravity. By emphasizing the similarities and differences
between these two type of dualities we explore the possibility of combining
them in just one duality formalism.
