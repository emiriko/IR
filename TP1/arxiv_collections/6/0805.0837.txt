Using an optical vortex coronagraph and simple adaptive optics techniques we
have made the first convincing demonstration of an optical vortex coronagraph
that is coupled to a star gazing telescope. In particular we suppressed by 97%
the primary star of a barely resolvable binary system, Cor Caroli, having an
effective angular separation of only 1.4 lambda/D. The secondary star suffered
no suppression.
