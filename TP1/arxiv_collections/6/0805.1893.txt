We continue the line of research from previous works in assessing the
suitability of the pure Kodama state both as a ground state for the generalized
Kodama states, as well as characteristic of a good semiclassical limit of
general relativity. We briefly introduce the quantum theory of fluctuations
about DeSitter spacetime, which enables one to examine some perturbative
aspects of the state. Additionally, we also motivate the concept of the cubic
tree network, which enables one to view the generalized Kodama states in
compact form as a nonlinear transformation of the pure Kodama states
parametrized by the matter content of the proper classical limit. It is hoped
that this work constitutes a first step in addressing the nonperturbative
renormalizability of general relativity in Ashtekar variables. Remaining issues
to address, including the analysis of specific matter models, include
finiteness and normalizability of the generalized Kodama state as well as
reality conditions on the Ashtekar variables, which we relegate to separate
works.
