The study and characterization of the diversity of spatiotemporal patterns
generated when a rectangular layer of fluid is locally heated beneath its free
surface is presented. We focus on the instability of a stationary cellular
pattern of wave number $k_s$ which undergoes a globally subcritical transition
to traveling waves by parity-breaking symmetry. The experimental results show
how the emerging traveling mode ($2/3k_{s}$) switches on a resonant triad
($k_s$, $k_s/2$, $2k_{s}/3$) within the cellular pattern yielding a ``mixed''
pattern. The nature of this transition is described quantitatively in terms of
the evolution of the fundamental modes by complex demodulation techniques. The
B\' enard-Marangoni convection accounts for the different dynamics depending on
the depth of the fluid layer and on the vertical temperature difference. The
existence of a hysteresis cycle has been evaluated quantitatively. When the
bifurcation to traveling waves is measured in the vicinity of the codimension-2
bifurcation point, we measure a decrease of the subcritical interval in which
the traveling mode becomes unstable. From the traveling wave state the system
under goes a {\it new} global secondary bifurcation to an alternating pattern
which doubles the wavelength ($k_{s}/2$) of the primary cellular pattern, this
result compares well with theoretical predictions [P. Coullet and G. Ioss, {\em
Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\bf 64}, 8 66 (1990)]. In this cascade of bifurcations
towards a defect dynamics, bistability due to the subcritical behavior of our
system is the reason for the coexistence of two different modulated patterns
connected by a front. These fronts are stationary for a finite interval of the
control parameters.
