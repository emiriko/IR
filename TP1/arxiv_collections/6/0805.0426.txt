Within a MHD approach we find magnetic reconnection to progress in two
entirely different ways. The first is well-known: the laminar Sweet-Parker
process. But a second, completely different and chaotic reconnection process is
possible. This regime has properties of immediate practical relevance: i) it is
much faster, developing on scales of the order of the Alfv\'en time, and ii)
the areas of reconnection become distributed chaotically over a macroscopic
region. The onset of the faster process is the formation of closed circulation
patterns where the jets going out of the reconnection regions turn around and
forces their way back in, carrying along copious amounts of magnetic flux.
