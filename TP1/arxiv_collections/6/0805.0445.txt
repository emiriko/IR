Results of direct numerical simulation of isotropic turbulence of surface
gravity waves in the framework of Hamiltonian equations are presented. For the
first time simultaneous formation of both direct and inverse cascades was
observed in the framework of primordial dynamical equations. At the same time,
strong long waves background was developed. It was shown, that obtained
Kolmogorov spectra are very sensitive to the presence of this condensate. Such
situation has to be typical for experimental wave tanks, flumes, and small
lakes.
