We compare the main feature of the measured Raman scattering spectra from
single layer graphene with a bilayer in which the two layers are arbitrarily
misoriented. The profiles of the 2D bands are very similar having only one
component, contrary to the four found for commensurate Bernal bilayers. These
results agree with recent theoretical calculations and point to the similarity
of the electronic structures of single layer graphene and misoriented bilayer
graphene. Another new aspect is that the dependance of the 2D frequency on the
laser excitation energy is different in these two latter systems.
