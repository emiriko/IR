In the preceding paper (arXiv : 0710.2724 [quant-ph]) we have constructed the
general solution for the master equation of quantum damped harmonic oscillator,
which is given by the complicated infinite series in the operator algebra
level. In this paper we give the explicit and compact forms to solutions
(density operators) for some initial values. In particular, the compact one for
the initial value based on a coherent state is given, which has not been given
as far as we know. Moreover, some related problems are presented.
