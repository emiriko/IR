We argue that there is correspondence between the perfect nonextensive
hydrodynamics and the usual dissipative hydrodynamics, which we call
nonextensive/dissipative correspondence (NexDC). It leads to simple expression
for dissipative entropy current and allows for predictions for the ratio of
bulk and shear viscosities to entropy density, $\zeta/s$ and $\eta/s$.
