We study experimentally the influence of confinement on the penetration depth
of impacting spheres into a granular medium contained in a finite cylindrical
vessel. The presence of close lateral walls reduces the penetration depth, and
the characteristic distance for these lateral wall effects is found to be of
the order of one sphere diameter. The influence of the bottom wall is found to
have a much shorter range.
