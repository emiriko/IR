We introduce a model motivated by studies of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs)
trapped in double-well potentials. We assume that a mixture of two hyperfine
states of the same atomic species is loaded in such a trap.The analysis is
focused on symmetry-breaking bifurcations in the system, starting at the linear
limit and gradually increasing the nonlinearity. Depending on values of the
chemical potentials of the two species, we find numerous states, as well as
symmetry-breaking bifurcations, in addition to those known in the
single-component setting. These branches, which include all relevant stationary
solutions of the problem, are predicted analytically by means of a two-mode
approximation, and confirmed numerically. For unstable branches, outcomes of
the instability development are explored in direct simulations.
