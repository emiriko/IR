From 1992 to 2007, HERA, the first electron-proton collider, operated at cms
energies of about 320 GeV and allowed the investigation of deep-inelastic and
photoproduction processes at the highest energy scales accessed thus far. This
review is an introduction to, and a summary of, the main results obtained at
HERA during its operation.
