The edge-cubic spin model on square lattice is studied via Monte Carlo
simulation with cluster algorithm. By cooling the system, we found two
successive symmetry breakings, i.e., the breakdown of $O_h$ into the group of
$C_{3h}$ which then freezes into ground state configuration. To characterize
the existing phase transitions, we consider the magnetization and the
population number as order parameters. We observe that the magnetization is
good at probing the high temperature transition but fails in the analysis of
the low temperature transition. In contrast the population number performs well
in probing the low- and the high-$T$ transitions. We plot the temperature
dependence of the moment and correlation ratios of the order parameters and
obtain the high- and low-$T$ transitions at $T_h = 0.602(1)$ and
$T_l=0.5422(2)$ respectively, with the corresponding exponents of correlation
length $\nu_h=1.50(1)$ and $\nu_l=0.833(1)$. By using correlation ratio and
size dependence of correlation function we estimate the decay exponent for the
high-$T$ transition as $\eta_h=0.260(1)$. For the low-$T$ transition, $\eta_l =
0.267(1)$ is extracted from the finite size scaling of susceptibility. The
universality class of the low-$T$ critical point is the same as the 3-state
Potts model.
