The investigation of the terrorist attack is a time-critical task. The
investigators have a limited time window to diagnose the organizational
background of the terrorists, to run down and arrest the wire-pullers, and to
take an action to prevent or eradicate the terrorist attack. The intuitive
interface to visualize the intelligence data set stimulates the investigators'
experience and knowledge, and aids them in decision-making for an immediately
effective action. This paper presents a computational method to analyze the
intelligence data set on the collective actions of the perpetrators of the
attack, and to visualize it into the form of a social network diagram which
predicts the positions where the wire-pullers conceals themselves.
