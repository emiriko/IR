Numerical methods based on interval arithmetic are efficient means to
reliably solve nonlinear systems of equations. Algorithm bc3revise is an
interval method that tightens variables' domains by enforcing a property called
box consistency. It has been successfully used on difficult problems whose
solving eluded traditional numerical methods. We present a new algorithm to
enforce box consistency that is simpler than bc3revise, faster, and easily data
parallelizable. A parallel implementation with Intel SSE2 SIMD instructions
shows that an increase in performance of up to an order of magnitude and more
is achievable.
