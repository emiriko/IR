The Tevatron experiments D0 and CDF have found evidence for single top quark
production, based on datasets between 0.9fb-1 and 2.2fb^-1. Several different
multivariate techniques are used to extract the single top quark signal out of
the large backgrounds. The cross section measurements are also used to provide
the first direct measurement of the CKM matrix element |Vtb|.
