The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will provide a huge amount of top-antitop
events, making the LHC a top quark factory, producing 1 tt pair per second at a
luminosity of 10^33cm-2s-1. A large top quark sample will be available from the
start of LHC and will play an important role in commissioning the CMS and ATLAS
detectors. An overview of the top quark measurements during the first
data-taking period is given.
