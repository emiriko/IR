The steady states of the master equation are investigated. We give two
expressions for the steady state distribution of the master equation a la the
Zubarev-McLennan steady state distribution, i.e., the exact expression and an
expression near equilibrium. The latter expression obtained is consistent with
recent attempt of constructing steady state theormodynamics.
