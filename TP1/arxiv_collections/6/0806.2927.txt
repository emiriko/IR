In a recent paper [C. Raabe and D.-G. Welsch, Phys. Rev. A 71, 013814 (2005)]
an electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor is suggested as an alternative to the
Abraham-Minkowski tensor and is applied to calculations of Casimir forces in
planar geometries. We argue that the universality of the suggested tensor is
doubtful; application of the Raabe-Welsch theory to a simple example in
classical electrodynamics shows that their proposed tensor is unable to
describe the situation in a simple way. We also show that modified Casimir
forces acting on the cavity medium as prescribed by these authors suffer from
problems of definiteness and peculiar properties which call for experimental
support before this theory can be regarded as acceptable.
