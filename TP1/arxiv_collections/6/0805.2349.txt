This article presents a phenomenological dynamic phase transition theory --
modeling and analysis -- for liquid helium-3. We derived two new models, for
liquid helium-3 with or without applied field, by introducing three wave
functions and using a unified dynamical Ginzburg-Landau model. The analysis of
these new models leads to predictions of existence of 1) a unstable region, 2)
a new phase C in a narrow region, and 3) switch points of transition types on
the coexistence curves near two triple points. It is hoped that these
predictions will be useful for designing better physical experiments and lead
to better understanding of the physical mechanism of superfluidity.
