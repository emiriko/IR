The ultrafast relaxation and recombination dynamics of photogenerated
electrons and holes in epitaxial graphene are studied using optical-pump
Terahertz-probe spectroscopy. The conductivity in graphene at Terahertz
frequencies depends on the carrier concentration as well as the carrier
distribution in energy. Time-resolved studies of the conductivity can therefore
be used to probe the dynamics associated with carrier intraband relaxation and
interband recombination. We report the electron-hole recombination times in
epitaxial graphene for the first time. Our results show that carrier cooling
occurs on sub-picosecond time scales and that interband recombination times are
carrier density dependent.
