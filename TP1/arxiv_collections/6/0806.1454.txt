We present a new classification scheme of baryon ground states and resonances
into SU(3) flavor multiplets. The scheme is worked out along a covariant
formalism with relativistic constituent quark models and it relies on detailed
investigations of the baryon spectra, the spin-flavor structure of the baryon
eigenstates, the behaviour of their probability density distributions as well
as covariant predictions for mesonic decay widths. The results are found to be
quite independent of the specific types of relativistic constituent quark
models employed. It turns out that a consistent classification requires to
include also resonances that are presently reported from experiment with only
two-star status.
