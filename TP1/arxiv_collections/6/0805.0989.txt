We investigate the dynamical superlattice correlation in the two-dimensional
three-band Hubbard model on the basis of the unrestricted fluctuation exchange
approximation. We calculate the one-particle spectral function, the spin
correlation function and the charge correlation function at finite temperature.
We find that some experimental results can be reproduced consistenly by taking
inhomogenous distribution of Cu 3d electrons into account. The correlation
functions suggest that several kinds of instabilities with spatial
inhomogenieties exist in some regions, where these instabilities significantly
affect the one-particle spectral fuctions.
