A Ginzburg-Landau theory is presented on surfactants in polar binary
mixtures, which aggregate at an interface due to the amphiphilic interaction.
They can be ionic surfactants coexisting with counterions. Including the
solvation and image interactions and accounting for a finite volume fraction of
the surfactant, we obtain their distributions and the electric potential around
an interface in equilibrium. The surface tension is also calculated. The
distribution of the adsorbed ionic surfactant is narrower than that of the
counterions. The adsorption is marked for hydrophilic and hydrophobic pairs of
ionic surfactant and counterions.
