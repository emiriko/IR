We present a new algorithm for vibrational control in deuterium molecules
that is feasible with current experimental technology. A pump mechanism is used
to create a coherent superposition of the D2+ vibrations. A short, intense
infrared control pulse is applied after a chosen delay time to create selective
interferences. A `chessboard' pattern of states can be realized in which a set
of even- or odd-numbered vibrational states can be selectively annihilated or
enhanced. A technique is proposed for experimental realization and observation
of this effect using 5 fs pulses of 790 nm radiation, with intermediate
intensity (5e13 W/cm2)
