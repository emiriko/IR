The Jeans instability is analyzed for dense magnetohydrodynamic plasmas with
intrinsic magnetization, the latter due to collective electron spin effects.
Furthermore, effects of electron tunneling as well as the Fermi pressure are
included. It is found that the intrinsic magnetization of the plasma will
enhance the Jeans instability, and can significantly modify the structure of
the instability spectra. Implications and limitations of our results are
discussed, as well as possible generalizations.
