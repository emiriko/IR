Self-consistent axially symmetric Skyrme Hartree-Fock plus BCS calculations
are performed to study the evolution of shapes with the number of nucleons in
various chains of Yb, Hf, W, Os, and Pt isotopes from neutron number N=110 up
to N=122. Potential energy curves are analyzed in a search for signatures of
oblate-prolate phase shape transitions and results from various Skyrme and
pairing forces are considered. Comparisons with results obtained with the Gogny
interaction as well as with relativistic mean field calculations are presented.
The role of the $\gamma$ degree of freedom is also discussed.
