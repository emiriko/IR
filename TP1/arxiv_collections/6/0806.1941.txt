In previous papers an asymptotic expansion for the dimer lambda_d of the form
lambda_d ~ (1/2)ln(2d) - 1/2 + c_1/d + c_2/d^2 ... was developed. Kernels J_n
were a key ingredient in the theory. Herein we prove J_n are of the form J_n =
C_r/d^r + C_(r+1)/d^(r+1) + ... + C_(n-1)/d^(n-1) with r > (n/2)-1.
