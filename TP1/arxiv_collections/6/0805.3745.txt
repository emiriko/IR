Phase-separation fronts leave in their wakes morphologies that are
substantially different from the morphologies formed in homogeneous
phase-separation. In this paper we focus on fronts in binary mixtures that are
enslaved phase-separation fronts, i.e. fronts that follow in the wake of a
control-parameter front. In the one-dimensional case, which is the focus of
this paper, the formed morphology is deceptively simple: alternating domains of
a regular size. However, determining the size of these domains as a function of
the front speed and other system parameters is a non-trivial problem. We
present an analytical solution for the case where no material is deposited
ahead of the front and numerical solutions and scaling arguments for more
general cases. Through these enslaved phase-separation fronts large domains can
be formed that are practically unattainable in homogeneous one-dimensional
phase-separation.
