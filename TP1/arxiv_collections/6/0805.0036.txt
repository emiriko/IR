We reexamine the N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories with product gauge groups
by adding the mass terms and the quartic terms for the flavors: two gauge group
theory with fundamentals, bifundamentals and adjoints, three gauge group theory
with fundamentals and bifundamentals, and their orientifold 4-plane
generalizations. By moving the branes appropriately, we obtain the
corresponding dual gauge theories. By analyzing the dual superpotentials, we
present the type IIA nonsupersymmetric meta-stable brane configurations.
