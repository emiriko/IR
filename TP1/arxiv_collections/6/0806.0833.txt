We have investigated the electronic structure of LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_{x}$ (x =
0; 0.1; 0.2) by angle-integrated photoemission spectroscopy and local density
approximation (LDA) based band structure calculations. The valence band
consists of a low energy peak at E = -0.25 eV and a broad structure around E =
-5 eV in qualitative agreement with LDA. From the photon energy dependence of
these peaks we conclude that the former derives almost exclusively from Fe 3d
states. This constitutes experimental evidence for the strong iron character of
the relevant states in a broad window around EF and confirms theoretical
predictions.
