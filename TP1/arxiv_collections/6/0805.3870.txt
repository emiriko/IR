We study a dipolar boson-fermion mixture in a pancake geometry at absolute
zero temperature, generalizing our previous work on the stability of polar
condensates and the formation of a density-wave state in cylindrical traps.
After examining the dependence of the polar condensate stability on the
strength of the fermion-induced interaction, we determine the transition point
from a ground-state Gaussian to a hexagonal density-wave state. We use a
variational principle to analyze the stability properties of those density-wave
state.
