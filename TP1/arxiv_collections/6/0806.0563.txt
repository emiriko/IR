The in situ combination of Scanning Probe Microscopies (SPM) with X-ray
microbeams adds a variety of new possibilities to the panoply of synchrotron
radiation techniques. In this paper we describe an optics-free AFM/STM that can
be directly installed on synchrotron radiation end stations for such combined
experiments. The instrument can be used just for AFM imaging of the
investigated sample or can be used for detection of photoemitted electrons with
a sharp STM-like tip, thus leading to the local measure of the X-ray absorption
signal. Alternatively one can can measure the flux of photon impinging on the
sharpest part of the tip to locally map the pattern of beams diffracted from
the sample. In this paper we eventually provide some examples of local
detection of XAS and diffraction.
