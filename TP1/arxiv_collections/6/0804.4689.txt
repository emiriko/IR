We introduce the basic concepts related to subharmonic functions and
potentials, mainly for the case of the complex plane and prove the Riesz
decomposition theorem. Beyond the elementary facts of the theory we deviate
slightly from the usual path of exposition and introduce further concepts
alongside with applications. We cover the Dirichlet problem in detail and
illustrate the relations between potential theory and probability by
considering harmonic measure and its relation to Brownian motion. Furthermore
Green's function is introduced and an application to growth of polynomials is
given. Equilibrium measures are motivated by their original development in
physics and we end with a brief discussion of capacity and its relation to
Hausdorff measure.
  We hope that the reader, who is familiar with the main elements of real
analysis, complex analysis, measure theory and some probability theory benefits
from these notes. No new results are presented but we hope that the style of
presentation enables the reader to understand quickly the basic ideas of
potential theory and how it can be used in different contexts.
  The notes can also be used for a short course on potential theory. Therefore
the required prerequisites are described in the Appendix. References are given
where expositions and details can be found; roughly speaking, familiarity with
the basic foundations of real and complex analysis should suffice to proceed
without any background reading.
