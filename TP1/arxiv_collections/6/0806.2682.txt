We introduce a new family of codes, termed weighted superimposed codes
(WSCs). This family generalizes the class of Euclidean superimposed codes
(ESCs), used in multiuser identification systems. WSCs allow for discriminating
all bounded, integer-valued linear combinations of real-valued codewords that
satisfy prescribed norm and non-negativity constraints. By design, WSCs are
inherently noise tolerant. Therefore, these codes can be seen as special
instances of robust compressed sensing schemes. The main results of the paper
are lower and upper bounds on the largest achievable code rates of several
classes of WSCs. These bounds suggest that with the codeword and weighting
vector constraints at hand, one can improve the code rates achievable by
standard compressive sensing.
