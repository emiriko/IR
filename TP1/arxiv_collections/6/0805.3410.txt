The type-theoretic modelling of DRT that [degroote06] proposed features
continuations for the management of the context in which a clause has to be
interpreted. This approach, while keeping the standard definitions of
quantifier scope, translates the rules of the accessibility constraints of
discourse referents inside the semantic recipes. In this paper, we deal with
additional rules for these accessibility constraints. In particular in the case
of discourse referents introduced by proper nouns, that negation does not
block, and in the case of rhetorical relations that structure discourses. We
show how this continuation-based approach applies to those accessibility
constraints and how we can consider the parallel management of various
principles.
