We study the zero-temperature phase diagram of the 2D quantum
$J_{1}^{XXZ}$--$J_{2}^{XXZ}$ spin-1/2 anisotropic Heisenberg model on the
square lattice. In particular, the effects of the anisotropy $\Delta$ on the
$z$-aligned N\'{e}el and (collinear) stripe states, as well as on the
$xy$-planar-aligned N\'{e}el and collinear stripe states, are examined. All
four of these quasiclassical states are chosen in turn as model states on top
of which we systematically include the quantum correlations using a coupled
cluster method analysis carried out to very high orders. We find strong
evidence for two {\it quantum triple points} (QTP's) at ($\Delta ^{c} = -0.10
\pm 0.15, J_{2}^{c}/J_{1} = 0.505 \pm 0.015$) and ($\Delta ^{c} = 2.05 \pm
0.15, J_{2}^{c}/J_{1} = 0.530 \pm 0.015$), between which an intermediate
magnetically-disordered phase emerges to separate the quasiclassical N\'{e}el
and stripe collinear phases. Above the upper QTP ($\Delta \gtrsim 2.0$) we find
a direct first-order phase transition between the N\'{e}el and stripe phases,
exactly as for the classical case. The $z$-aligned and $xy$-planar-aligned
phases meet precisely at $\Delta = 1$, also as for the classical case. For all
values of the anisotropy parameter between those of the two QTP's there exists
a narrow range of values of $J_{2}/J_{1}$, $\alpha^{c_1}(\Delta)<J_{2}/J_{1}
<\alpha^{c_2}(\Delta)$, centered near the point of maximum classical
frustration, $J_{2}/J_{1} = {1/2}$, for which the intermediate phase exists.
This range is widest precisely at the isotropic point, $\Delta = 1$, where
$\alpha^{c_1}(1) = 0.44 \pm 0.01$ and $\alpha^{c_2}(1) = 0.59 \pm 0.01$. The
two QTP's are characterized by values $\Delta = \Delta^{c}$ at which
$\alpha^{c_1}(\Delta^{c})=\alpha^{c_2}(\Delta^{c})$.
