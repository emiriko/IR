We have studied the effects of ionizing irradiation from a 60Co source and
the effects of neutron irradiation on a Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor
Chip(MIMOSA8). A previous report was devoted solely to the neutron-induced
effects. We show that extended defects due to the neutron damage changes the
distribution of the pixels pedestals. This is mainly due to the increase of the
dark generation current due to the presence of deep traps in the depleted zones
of the sensors. Alternatively, the exposure to ionizing irradiation increases
the pedestals in a more homogeneous way, this coming from the generation of
interface states at the Si/SiO2 interface supplemented by the presence of
positively charged traps in the oxides. the sensors' leakage current is then
increased. We discuss the results in view of increasing the radiation-hardness
of the MAPS, bearing in mind that these chips were not designed with any
rad-tol layout technique.
