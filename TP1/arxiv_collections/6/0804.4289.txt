We generalize the Lewis-Riesenfeld technique of solving the time-dependent
Schrodinger equation to cases where the invariant has continuous eigenvalues.
An explicit formula for a generalized Lewis-Riesenfeld phase is derived in
terms of the eigenstates of the invariant. As an illustration the generalized
phase is calculated for a particle in a time-dependent linear potential.
