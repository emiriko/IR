When assets are correlated, benefits of investment diversification are
reduced. To measure the influence of correlations on investment performance, a
new quantity - the effective portfolio size - is proposed and investigated in
both artificial and real situations. We show that in most cases, the effective
portfolio size is much smaller than the actual number of assets in the
portfolio and that it lowers even further during financial crises.
