A search for the Higgs boson in H->WW->ee and H->WW->mu+tau decays in ppbar
collisions at a center-of-mass energy of sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV is presented. The
data have been collected by the Run II DO detector. In order to maximize the
sensitivity multivariate techniques such as artificial neural networks (NN),
matrix element methods and likelihoods are used. No excess above the Standard
Model background is observed and limits on the production cross section times
branching ratio for Higgs masses between 115 and 200 GeV are set.
