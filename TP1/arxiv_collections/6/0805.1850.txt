The short and medium range structure of a NaFeSi2O6 (NFS) glass has been
investigated by high-resolution neutron diffraction with Fe isotopic
substitution, combined with Empirical Potential Structure Refinement (EPSR)
simulations. The majority (~60%) of Fe is 4-coordinated ([4]Fe) and corresponds
only to ferric iron, Fe3+, with a distance d[4]Fe3+-O=1.87$\pm$0.01{\AA} . This
is at variance with the 3D-structure predicted by glass stoichiometry. The
existence of a majority of [4]Fe3+ sites illustrates a glass structure that
differs from the structure of crystalline NaFeSi2O6, which contains only
octahedral Fe3+. The EPSR modeling of glass structure shows that [4]Fe3+ is
randomly distributed in the silicate network and shares corner with silicate
tetrahedra. The existence of a majority of [4]Fe3+ sites differs from the
structure of the corresponding crystalline phase, which contains only
octahedral Fe3+. The network-forming behavior of [4]Fe3+, coupled with the
presence of Na+ ions acting as charge-compensators, is at the origin of
peculiar physical properties of Fe-bearing glasses, such as the increase of the
elastic modulus of sodium silicate glasses with increasing Fe-concentration.
Our data provide also direct evidence for 5-coordinated Fe, with an average
distance d[5]Fe-O=2.01$\pm$0.01{\AA}. This second Fe population concerns both
Fe2+ and Fe3+. 5-coordinated Fe atoms tend to segregate by sharing mainly
edges. The direct structural evidence of the dual role of ferric iron in NFS
glass provides support for understanding the peculiar properties of NFS glass,
such as magnetic, optical, electronic or thermodynamic properties.
