We propose a scheme to engineer an effective spin Hamiltonian starting from a
system of electrons confined in micro-Penning traps. By means of appropriate
sequences of electromagnetic pulses, alternated to periods of free evolution,
we control the shape and strength of the spin-spin interaction. Moreover, we
can modify the effective magnetic field experienced by the particle spin. This
procedure enables us to reproduce notable quantum spin systems, such as Ising
and XY models. Thanks to its scalability, our scheme can be applied to a fairly
large number of trapped particles within the reach of near future technology.
