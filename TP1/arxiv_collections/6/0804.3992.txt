Different methods for treating the results of higher-order perturbative QCD
calculations of the decay width of the Standard Model Higgs boson into bottom
quarks are discusssed. Special attention is paid to the analysis of the $M_H$
dependence of the decay width $\Gamma(H\to \bar{b}b})$ in the cases when the
mass of b-quark is defined as the running parameter in the $\bar{MS}$-scheme
and as the quark pole mass. The relation between running and pole masses is
taken into account in the order $\alpha_s^4$-approximation. Some special
features of applications of Analytical Perturbation Theory (APT) are commented.
