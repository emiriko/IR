Knowledge could be gained from experts, specialists in the area of interest,
or it can be gained by induction from sets of data. Automatic induction of
knowledge from data sets, usually stored in large databases, is called data
mining. Data mining methods are important in the management of complex systems.
There are many technologies available to data mining practitioners, including
Artificial Neural Networks, Regression, and Decision Trees. Neural networks
have been successfully applied in wide range of supervised and unsupervised
learning applications. Neural network methods are not commonly used for data
mining tasks, because they often produce incomprehensible models, and require
long training times. One way in which the collective properties of a neural
network may be used to implement a computational task is by way of the concept
of energy minimization. The Hopfield network is well-known example of such an
approach. The Hopfield network is useful as content addressable memory or an
analog computer for solving combinatorial-type optimization problems. Wan
Abdullah [1] proposed a method of doing logic programming on a Hopfield neural
network. Optimization of logical inconsistency is carried out by the network
after the connection strengths are defined from the logic program; the network
relaxes to neural states corresponding to a valid interpretation. In this
article, we describe how Hopfield network is able to induce logical rules from
large database by using reverse analysis method: given the values of the
connections of a network, we can hope to know what logical rules are entrenched
in the database.
