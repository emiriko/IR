We study the XY spin glass by large-scale Monte Carlo simulations for sizes
up to 24^3, down to temperatures below the transition temperature found in
earlier work. The data for the larger sizes show more marginal behavior than
that for the smaller sizes indicating that the lower critical dimension is
close to, and possibly equal to three. We find that the spins and chiralities
behave in a very similar manner. We also address the optimal ratio of
"over-relaxation" to "Metropolis" sweeps in the simulation.
