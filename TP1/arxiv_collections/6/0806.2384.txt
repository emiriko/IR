TeV scale lepton-hadron and photon-hadron colliders are necessary both to
clarify fundamental aspects of strong interactions and for adequate
interpretation of the LHC data. Today, there are two realistic proposals for
the post-HERA era, namely, QCD Explorer (QCD-E) and Large Hadron electron
Collider (LHeC). Both QCD-E and LHeC can operate as eA colliders, whereas
gamma-p and gamma-A options are unique for QCD-E. Another advantage of QCD-E is
the possibility to increase the center of mass energy by lengthening of
electron linac. In this presentation main parameters of the QCD-E nucleus
options are discussed.
