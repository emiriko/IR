NbSe2 is a prototypical charge-density-wave (CDW) material, whose mechanism
remains mysterious so far. With angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we
mapped out the CDW gap and recovered the long-lost nesting condition over a
large broken-honeycomb region in the Brillouin zone, which consists of six
saddle band point regions with high density of states (DOS), and large regions
away from Fermi surface with negligible DOS at the Fermi energy. We show that
the major contributions to the CDW come from these barely occupied states
rather than the saddle band points. Our findings not only resolve a long
standing puzzle, but also overthrow the conventional wisdom that CDW is
dominated by regions with high DOS.
