We study finite set-theoretic solutions $(X,r)$ of the Yang-Baxter equation
of square-free multipermutation type. We show that each such solution over $\C$
with multipermutation level two can be put in diagonal form with the associated
Yang-Baxter algebra $\Acal(\C,X,r)$ having a $q$-commutation form of relations
determined by complex phase factors. These complex factors are roots of unity
and all roots of a prescribed form appear as determined by the representation
theory of finite abelian group $\Gcal$ of left actions on $X$. We study the
structure of $\Acal(\C,X,r)$ and show that they have a $\bullet$-product form
`quantizing' the commutative algebra of polynomials in $|X|$ variables. We
obtain the $\bullet$-product both as a Drinfeld cotwist for a certain canonical
2-cocycle and as a braided-opposite product for a certain crossed
$\Gcal$-module (over any field $k$). We provide first steps in the
noncommutative differential geometry of $\Acal(k,X,r)$ arising from these
results. As a byproduct of our work we find that every such level 2 solution
$(X,r)$ factorises as $r=f\circ\tau\circ f^{-1}$ where $\tau$ is the flip map
and $(X,f)$ is another solution coming from $X$ as a crossed $\Gcal$-set.
