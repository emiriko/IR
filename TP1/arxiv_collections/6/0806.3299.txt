In this work we propose a new analytical method for determining the scalar
field potential $V(\phi)$ in FRW type cosmologies containing a mixture of
perfect fluid plus a quintessence scalar field. By assuming that the equation
of state parameters of the perfect fluid, $\gamma -1 \equiv
p_{\gamma}/\rho_{\gamma}$ and the quintessence, $\omega \equiv p/\rho$ are
constants, it is shown that the potential for the flat case is $V(\phi) =
A\rho_{\phi_{0}}\sinh^{B}(\lambda \phi)$, where $A$, $B$ and $\lambda$ are
functions of $\gamma$ and $\omega$. This general result is a pure consequence
of the Einstein field equations and the constancy of the parameters. Applying
the same method for closed and open universes, the corresponding scalar field
potentials are also explicitly obtained for a large set of values of the free
parameters $\gamma$ and $\omega$. A formula yielding the transition redshift
from a decelerating to an accelerating regime is also determined and compared
to the $\Lambda$CDM case.
