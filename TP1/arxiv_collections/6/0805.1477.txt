An analytical model previously developed to study the structure of the
magnetic field for the TEXTOR-DED [S.S. Abdullaev et al. Phys. Plasmas, 6, 153
(1999)] is applied to the similar study of the Ergodic Divertor of Tore Supra
tokamak [Ph. Ghendrih, Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion, 38, 1653 (1996)]. The coil
configuration of ED Tore Supra consists of six modules equidistantly located
along the toroidal direction on the low-field-side of the torus with given
toroidal and poloidal extensions. The Hamiltonian formulation of field line
equations in straight-field-line coordinates (Boozer coordinates) and the
computationally efficient mapping method for integration of the Hamiltonian
field line equations are used to study the magnetic field structure in the ED.
Asymptotical formulas for the perturbation magnetic field created by the ED
coils are obtained and the spectrum of magnetic perturbations is analyzed and
compared with the one of the TEXTOR-DED. The structure of ergodic and laminar
zones are studied by plotting Poincare sections, so-called laminar plots
(contour plots of wall to wall connection lengths) and magnetic footprints. The
radial profiles of field line diffusion coefficients are calculated for
different perturbation currents and it is found that for the Tore Supra case in
the ergodic zone the numerical field line diffusion coefficients perfectly
follow the quasilinear formula for smaller perturbation currents although the
situation is different for the maximum perturbation current.
