We report dynamical shear-modulus measurements for five glass-forming liquids
(pentaphenyl trimethyl trisiloxane, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate,
1,2-propanediol, and m-touluidine). The shear-mechanical spectra are obtained
by the piezoelectric shear-modulus gauge (PSG) method. This technique allows
one to measure the shear modulus ($10^{5} -10^{10}$ Pa) of the liquid within a
frequency range from 1 mHz to 10 kHz. We analyze the frequency-dependent
response functions to investigate whether time-temperature superposition (TTS)
is obeyed. We also study the shear-modulus loss-peak position and its
high-frequency part. It has been suggested that when TTS applies, the
high-frequency side of the imaginary part of the dielectric response decreases
like a power law of the frequency with an exponent -1/2. This conjecture is
analyzed on the basis of the shear mechanical data. We find that TTS is obeyed
for pentaphenyl trimethyl trisiloxane and in 1,2-propanediol while in the
remaining liquids evidence of a mechanical $\beta$ process is found. Although
the the high-frequency power law behavior $\omega^{-\alpha}$ of the shear-loss
may approach a limiting value of $\alpha=0.5$ when lowering the temperature, we
find that the exponent lies systematically above this value (around 0.4). For
the two liquids without beta relaxation (pentaphenyl trimethyl trisiloxane and
1,2-propanediol) we also test the shoving model prediction, according to which
the the relaxation-time activation energy is proportional to the instantaneous
shear modulus. We find that the data are well described by this model.
