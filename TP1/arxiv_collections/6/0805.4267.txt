We study a strong suppression of the relative production rate (d-Au)/(p-p)
for inclusive high-pT hadrons of different species at large forward rapidities
(large Feynman xF). The model predictions calculated in the light-cone dipole
approach are in a good agreement with the recent measurements by the BRAHMS and
STAR Collaborations at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. We predict a
similar suppression at large pT and large xF also at lower energies, where no
effect of coherence is possible. It allows to exclude the saturation models or
the models based on Color Glass Condensate from interpretation of nuclear
effects.
