We report on the fast excitation of a single atom coupled to an optical
cavity using laser pulses that are much shorter than all other relevant
processes. The cavity frequency constitutes a control parameter that allows the
creation of single photons in a superposition of two tunable frequencies. Each
photon emitted from the cavity thus exhibits a pronounced amplitude modulation
determined by the oscillatory energy exchange between the atom and the cavity.
Our technique constitutes a versatile tool for future quantum networking
experiments.
