We consider an universal mass matrix model which has a seesaw-invariant
structure with the most general texture based on flavor 2 (\leftrightarrow) 3
symmetry common to all quarks and leptons. The CKM quark mixing matrix of the
model is analyzed. It is shown that the model is consistent with all the
experimental data of quark mixings by tuning free parameters of the model. We
also show that the values of parameters of the present model consistent with
the experimental data are not far from the ones of the mass matrix model with a
vanishing (1,1) element.
