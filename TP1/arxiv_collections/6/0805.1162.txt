Using the generalized procedure proposed by \emph{Wu et al}\cite{wu}
recently, we construct the first law of thermodynamics on apparent horizon in a
general braneworld model with curvature correction terms on the brane and in
the bulk, respectively. The explicit entropy formulary of apparent horizon in
the general braneworld is worked out. We also discuss the masslike function
which associated with a new type first law of thermodynamics of the general
braneworld in detail. We analyze the difference between the conventional
thermodynamics and the new type thermodynamics on apparent horizon. At last,
the discussions about the physical meanings of the masslike function have also
been given.
