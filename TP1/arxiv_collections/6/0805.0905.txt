The goal is the development of a novel principle for the temperature
acquisition of refrigerants in CO2 air conditioning systems. The new approach
is based on measuring the temperature inside a pressure sensor, which is also
needed in the system. On the basis of simulative investigations of different
mounting conditions functional relations between measured and medium
temperature will be derived.
