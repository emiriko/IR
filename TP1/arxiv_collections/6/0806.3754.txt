We study the appearance of correlated many-body phenomena in an ensemble of
atoms driven resonantly into a strongly interacting Rydberg state. The ground
state of the Hamiltonian describing the driven system exhibits a second order
quantum phase transition. We derive the critical theory for the quantum phase
transition and show that it describes the properties of the driven Rydberg
system in the saturated regime. We find that the suppression of Rydberg
excitations known as blockade phenomena exhibits an algebraic scaling law with
a universal exponent.
