We present a high-resolution microwave spectrometer to measure the
frequency-dependent complex conductivity of a superconducting thin film near
the critical temperature. The instrument is based on a broadband measurement of
the complex reflection coefficient, $S_{\rm 11}$, of a coaxial transmission
line, which is terminated to a thin film sample with the electrodes in a
Corbino disk shape. In the vicinity of the critical temperature, the standard
calibration technique using three known standards fails to extract the strong
frequency dependence of the complex conductivity induced by the superconducting
fluctuations. This is because a small unexpected difference between the phase
parts of $S_{\rm 11}$ for a short and load standards gives rise to a large
error in the detailed frequency dependence of the complex conductivity near the
superconducting transition. We demonstrate that a new calibration procedure
using the normal-state conductivity of a sample as a load standard resolves
this difficulty. The high quality performance of this spectrometer, which
covers the frequency range between 0.1 GHz and 10 GHz, the temperature range
down to 10 K, and the magnetic field range up to 1 T, is illustrated by the
experimental results on several thin films of both conventional and high
temperature superconductors.
