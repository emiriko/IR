The effects of flavor mixing in electroweak baryogenesis is investigated in a
generalized semiclassical WKB approach. Through calculating the nonadiabatic
corrections to the particle currents it is shown that extra CP violation
sources arise from the off-diagonal part of the equation of motion of particles
moving inside the bubble wall. This type of mixing-induced source is of the
first order in derivative expansion of the Higgs condensate, but is oscillation
suppressed. The numerical importance of the mixing-induced source is discussed
in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and compared with the source term
induced by semiclassical force. It is found that in a large parameter space
where oscillation suppression is not strong enough, the mixing-induced source
can dominate over that from the semiclassical force.
