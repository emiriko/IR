Unification of GUT-scale t-b-\tau Yukawa couplings is a significant feature
of simple SO(10) SUSY GUTs. Here we present the results of a search that used
the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique to investigate regions of Yukawa
unification and WMAP-compatible dark matter relic density in SO(10)-like MSSM
parameter spaces. We mention the possible LHC signatures of Yukawa unified
scenarios and discuss the consequences for dark matter.
