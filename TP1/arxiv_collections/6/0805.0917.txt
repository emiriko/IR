3D-Integration is a promising technology towards higher interconnect
densities and shorter wiring lengths between multiple chip stacks, thus
achieving a very high performance level combined with low power consumption.
This technology also offers the possibility to build up systems with high
complexity just by combining devices of different technologies. For ultra thin
silicon is the base of this integration technology, the fundamental processing
steps will be described, as well as appropriate handling concepts. Three main
concepts for 3D integration have been developed at IZM. The approach with the
greatest flexibility called Inter Chip Via - Solid Liquid Interdiffusion
(ICV-SLID) is introduced. This is a chip-to-wafer stacking technology which
combines the advantages of the Inter Chip Via (ICV) process and the
solid-liquid-interdiffusion technique (SLID) of copper and tin. The fully
modular ICV-SLID concept allows the formation of multiple device stacks. A test
chip was designed and the total process sequence of the ICV-SLID technology for
the realization of a three-layer chip-to-wafer stack was demonstrated. The
proposed wafer-level 3D integration concept has the potential for low cost
fabrication of multi-layer high-performance 3D-SoCs and is well suited as a
replacement for embedded technologies based on monolithic integration. To
address yield issues a wafer-level chip-scale handling is presented as well, to
select known-good dies and work on them with wafer-level process sequences
before joining them to integrated stacks.
