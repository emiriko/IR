We construct a quantum gate entangler based on selective phase rotation
transform. In particular, we established a relation between quantum integral
transform and quantum gates entangler in terms of universal controlled gates
for multi-qubit states. Our construction is also related to the geometrical
structure of multipartite quantum systems.
