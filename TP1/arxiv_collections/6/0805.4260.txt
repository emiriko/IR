Nonequilibrium Green's functions provide a powerful tool for computing the
dynamical response and particle exchange statistics of coupled quantum systems.
We formulate the theory in terms of the density matrix in Liouville space and
introduce superoperator algebra that greatly simplifies the derivation and the
physical interpretation of all quantities. Expressions for various observables
are derived directly in real time in terms of superoperator nonequilibrium
Green's functions (SNGF), rather than the artificial time-loop required in
Schwinger's Hilbert-space formulation. Applications for computing interaction
energies, charge densities, average currents, current induced fluorescence,
electroluminescence and current fluctuation (electron counting) statistics are
discussed.
