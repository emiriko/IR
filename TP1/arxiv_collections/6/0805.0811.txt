By optimizing the design we show that inhomogeneous electromagnetic
resonators with almost uniform field intensity and up to twice the energy
density of conventional structures are possible by exploiting the properties of
negative refractive index materials. materials. We demonstrate that using
negative refractive index materials it is possible to make full width at half
maximum (FWHM) of the transmission coefficient independent from cavity length
