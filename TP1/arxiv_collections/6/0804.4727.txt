Given a real-valued phase-space function, it is a nontrivial task to
determine whether it corresponds to a Wigner distribution for a physically
acceptable quantum state. This topic has been of fundamental interest for long,
and in a modern application, it can be related to the problem of entanglement
detection for multi-mode cases. In this paper, we present a hierarchy of
complete conditions for a physically realizable Wigner distribution. Our
derivation is based on the normally-ordered expansion, in terms of annihilation
andcreation operators, of the quasi-density operator corresponding to the
phase-space function in question. As a by-product, it is shown that the
phase-space distributions with elliptical symmetry can be readily diagonalized
in our representation, facilitating the test of physical realizability. We also
illustrate how the current formulation can be connected to the detection of
bipartite entanglement for continuous variables.
