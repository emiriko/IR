MEMS technology has been developed rapidly in the last few years. More and
more special micro structures were discussed in several publications. However,
all of the structures were produced by consist of the three fundamental
structures, which included bridge, cantilever and membrane structures. Even the
more complex structures were no exception. The cantilever with the property of
simple design and easy fabrication among three kinds of fundamental structure,
therefore, it was popular used in the design of MEMS device.
