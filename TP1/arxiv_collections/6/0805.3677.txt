We derive an effective low-energy theory of disordered interacting quantum
wires. Our theory describes Anderson localization in the limit of vanishing
dephasing and reduces to standard abelian bosonization in the limit of
vanishing disorder. In a system with many transport channels, it exhibits the
diffusive physics characteristic for multi-channel quantum wires.
