We consider resonant transmission through a finite-length quantum wire
connected to leads via finite transparency junctions. The coherent electron
transport is strongly modified by the Coulomb interaction. The low-temperature
current-voltage ($IV$) curves show step-like dependence on the bias voltage
determined by the distance between the quantum levels inside the conductor, the
pattern being dependent on the ratio between the charging energy and level
spacing. If the system is tuned close to the resonance condition by the gate
voltage, the low-voltage $IV$ curve is Ohmic. At large Coulomb energy and low
temperatures, the conductance is temperature-independent for any relationship
between temperature, level spacing, and coupling between the wire and the
leads.
