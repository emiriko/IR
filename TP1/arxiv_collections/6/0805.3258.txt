Modern development of quantum technologies based on quantum information
theory stimulated analysis of proposed computational, cryptographic and
teleportational schemes from the viewpoint of quantum foundations. It is
evident that not all mathematical calculations performed in complex Hilbert
space can be directly realized in physical space. Recently by analyzing the
original EPR paper we found that they argument was based on the misuse of the
von Neumann's projection postulate. Opposite to von Neumann, Einstein, Podolsky
and Rosen (EPR) applied this postulate to observables represented by operators
with degenerate spectra. It was completely forbidden by von Neumann's
axiomatics of QM. It is impossible to repeat the EPR considerations in the von
Neumann's framework. In this note we analyze quantum teleportation by taking
into account von Neumann's projection postulate. Our analysis shows that so
called quantum teleportation is impossible in von Neumann's framework. On the
other hand, our analysis implies that the main quantum algorithms are totally
consistent with von Neumann's projection postulate.
