We study the $\pi \pi N$ system by solving the Faddeev equations, for which
the input two-body $t$-matrices are obtained by solving the Bethe-Salpeter
equation in the coupled channel formalism. The potentials for the $\pi \pi$,
$\pi N$ sub-systems and their coupled channels are obtained from chiral
Lagrangians, which have been earlier used to study resonances in these systems
successfully. In this work, we find a resonance in the $\pi\pi N$ system with a
mass of $1704 - i 375/2$ MeV and with quantum numbers $I=1/2$, $J^\pi =1/2^+$.
We identify this state with the $N^*(1710)$. This peak is found where the
energies of the $\pi \pi$ sub-system fall in the region of the $\sigma$
resonance. We do not find evidence for the Roper resonance in our study
indicating a more complex structure for this resonance, nor for any state with
total isospin $I=3/2$ or $5/2$.
