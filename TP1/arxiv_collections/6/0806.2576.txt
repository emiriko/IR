Starting from an atomistic approach we have derived a hierarchy of
successively more simplified continuum elasticity descriptions for modeling the
mechanical properties of suspended graphene sheets. The descriptions are
validated by applying them to square graphene-based resonators with clamped
edges and studying numerically their mechanical responses. Both static and
dynamic responses are treated. We find that already for deflections of the
order of 0.5{\AA} a theory that correctly accounts for nonlinearities is
necessary and that for many purposes a set of coupled Duffing-type equations
may be used to accurately describe the dynamics of graphene membranes.
