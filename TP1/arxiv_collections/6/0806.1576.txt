A consistent approach in forming the 0.7 structure by using a quantum dot
rather than a quantum point contact is demonstrated. With this scheme, it was
possible to tune on and off the 0.7 structure. The 0.7 structure continuously
evolved into a normal integer conductance plateau by varying the tuning
condition. Unlike the conventional 0.7 plateau, the new 0.7 structure was
observed even at low electron temperatures down to 100 mK, with unprecedented
flatness. From our results, it is concluded that electron interference should
be taken into consideration to explain the 0.7 structure.
