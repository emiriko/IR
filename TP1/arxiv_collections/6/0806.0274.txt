We prove a motivic version of Landweber's exact functor theorem from
topology. The main result is that the assignment given by a Landweber-type
formula using the MGL-homology of a motivic spectrum defines a homology theory
on the stable motivic homotopy category and is representable by a Tate-like (or
cellular) spectrum. Using the universal coefficient spectral sequence of
Dugger-Isaksen we deduce formulas for operations of motivic Landweber spectra
of a certain type including homotopy algebraic K-theory. Finally we construct a
Chern character as a map between motivic spectra.
