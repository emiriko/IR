We investigate the consequences of long range rapidity correlations in the
Glasma. Particles produced locally in the transverse plane are correlated by
approximately boost invariant flux tubes of longitudinal color electric and
magnetic fields that are formed when two sheets of Colored Glass Condensate
pass through one another, each acquiring a modified color charge density in the
collision. We argue that such long range rapidity correlations persist during
the evolution of the Quark Gluon Plasma formed later in the collision. When
combined with transverse flow, these correlations reproduce many of the
features of the recently observed ridge events in heavy ion collisions at RHIC.
