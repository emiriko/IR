The human immune system protects the human body against various pathogens
like e.g. biological viruses and bacteria. Artificial immune systems reuse the
architecture, organization, and workflows of the human immune system for
various problems in computer science. In the network security, the artificial
immune system is used to secure a network and its nodes against intrusions like
viruses, worms, and trojans. However, these approaches are far away from
production where they are academic proof-of-concept implementations or use only
a small part to protect against a certain intrusion. This article discusses the
required steps to bring artificial immune systems into production in the
network security domain. It furthermore figures out the challenges and provides
the description and results of the prototype of an artificial immune system,
which is SANA called.
