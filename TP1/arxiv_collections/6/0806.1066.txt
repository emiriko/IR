Metamaterials are artificial periodic structures which represent effective
homogeneous medium for electromagnetic fields. Here I show that there exists an
important class of such composite systems, metaferroelectrics. They are
properly designed metamaterials with non-ferroelectric constituents which,
nevertheless, exhibit ferroelectric response. Furthermore, for relatively small
samples the effect is anisotropic and strongly depends on the sample shape.
Metaferroelectrics will help to understand deeper the physics of
ferroelectricity and show enormous potential for applications in the field of
nano-optoelectronics.
