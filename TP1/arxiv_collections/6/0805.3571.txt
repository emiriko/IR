In a recent model Choudhury proposed that a collapsing matter generates an
adiabatic pressure which can be used to explain the acceleration of the
physical universe under certain approximation. In this work we superimpose the
core pressure generated through the entropy of the blackhole. We have ignored
the blackhole internal energy change during this process. We have then
calculated both Hubble parameter and the deacceleration parameter. We have
shown that the Hubble parameter is positive and the deacceleration parameter
fluctuates with time, meaning for certain period the universe accelerates and
decelerates for other time.
