We demonstrate that the extension of the Zee-Babu model can generate not only
the small neutrino masses but also the baryon number asymmetry in the universe.
In particular, we show that the scale of the singlet scalar responsible for the
leptogenesis can be of order 1 TeV, that can be tested at the LHC and ILC. We
also considered the possible minimal extension of this model to generate the
dark matter.
