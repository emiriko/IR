Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are among the main candidates
for the relic dark matter (DM). The idea of the direct DM detection relies on
elastic spin-dependent (SD) and spin-independent (SI) interaction of WIMPs with
target nuclei. In this review paper the relevant formulae for WIMP event rate
calculations are collected. For estimations of the WIMP-proton and WIMP-neutron
SD and SI cross sections the effective low-energy minimal supersymmetric
standard model is used. The traditional one-coupling-dominance approach for
evaluation of the exclusion curves is described. Further, the mixed spin-scalar
coupling approach is discussed. It is demonstrated, taking the high-spin Ge-73
dark matter experiment HDMS as an example, how one can drastically improve the
sensitivity of the exclusion curves within the mixed spin-scalar coupling
approach, as well as due to a new procedure of background subtraction from the
measured spectrum. A general discussion on the information obtained from
exclusion curves is given. The necessity of clear WIMP direct detection
signatures for a solution of the dark matter problem, is pointed out.
