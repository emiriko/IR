It is shown that current saturation in semiconducting carbon nanotubes is
indistinguishable from metallic nanotubes if the carrier density is above a
critical value determined by the bandgap and the LO phonon energy. This feature
stems from the higher number of current-carrying states in the semiconducting
tubes due to the van-Hove singularity at the band-edge. Above this critical
carrier density, the ensemble saturation velocity at high-fields is found to be
independent of the bandgap, but strongly dependent on the carrier density,
explaining recent observations.
