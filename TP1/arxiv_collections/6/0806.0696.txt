Achar has recently introduced a family of t-structures on the derived
category of equivariant coherent sheaves on a $G$-scheme, generalizing the
perverse coherent t-structures of Bezrukavnikov and Deligne. They are called
\emph{staggered} t-structures, and their main point of interest so far is that
they are more often self-dual. In this paper we investigate these t-structures
on the $T$-equivariant derived category of a toric variety.
