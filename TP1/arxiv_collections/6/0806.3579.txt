The minisuperspace model in $3+d$ spatial dimensions with the matter,
described by the bag model, is considered with the aim to estimate the
probability of creation of the compactified extra dimensions in nuclear
collisions. The amplitude of transition from 3- to $3+d$-dimensional space has
been calculated both in the case of completely confined matter, when
contribution of radiation is ignored, and in the case of radiation domination,
when the bag constant is negligible. It turns out that the number of additional
dimensions is limited in the first regime, while this is infinite in the second
one. It is shown that the probability of creation of extra dimensions is finite
in the both regimes.
