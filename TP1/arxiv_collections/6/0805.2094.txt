In this article we review the mechanisms in several supersymmetric models for
producing gluinos at the LHC and its potential for discovering them. We focus
on the MSSM and its left-right extensions. We study in detail the strong sector
of both models. Moreover, we obtain the total cross section and differential
distributions. We also make an analysis of their uncertainties, such as the
gluino and squark masses, which are related to the soft SUSY breaking
parameters.
