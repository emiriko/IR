A multifractal random walk (MRW) is defined by a Brownian motion subordinated
by a class of continuous multifractal random measures $M[0,t], 0\le t\le1$. In
this paper we obtain an extension of this process, referred to as multifractal
fractional random walk (MFRW), by considering the limit in distribution of a
sequence of conditionally Gaussian processes. These conditional processes are
defined as integrals with respect to fractional Brownian motion and convergence
is seen to hold under certain conditions relating the self-similarity (Hurst)
exponent of the fBm to the parameters defining the multifractal random measure
$M$. As a result, a larger class of models is obtained, whose fine scale
(scaling) structure is then analyzed in terms of the empirical structure
functions. Implications for the analysis and inference of multifractal
exponents from data, namely, confidence intervals, are also provided.
