The following source coding problem was introduced by Birk and Kol: a sender
holds a word $x\in\{0,1\}^n$, and wishes to broadcast a codeword to $n$
receivers, $R_1,...,R_n$. The receiver $R_i$ is interested in $x_i$, and has
prior \emph{side information} comprising some subset of the $n$ bits. This
corresponds to a directed graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, where $i j$ is an edge iff
$R_i$ knows the bit $x_j$. An \emph{index code} for $G$ is an encoding scheme
which enables each $R_i$ to always reconstruct $x_i$, given his side
information. The minimal word length of an index code was studied by
Bar-Yossef, Birk, Jayram and Kol (FOCS 2006). They introduced a graph
parameter, $\minrk_2(G)$, which completely characterizes the length of an
optimal \emph{linear} index code for $G$. The authors of BBJK showed that in
various cases linear codes attain the optimal word length, and conjectured that
linear index coding is in fact \emph{always} optimal.
  In this work, we disprove the main conjecture of BBJK in the following strong
sense: for any $\epsilon > 0$ and sufficiently large $n$, there is an
$n$-vertex graph $G$ so that every linear index code for $G$ requires codewords
of length at least $n^{1-\epsilon}$, and yet a non-linear index code for $G$
has a word length of $n^\epsilon$. This is achieved by an explicit
construction, which extends Alon's variant of the celebrated Ramsey
construction of Frankl and Wilson.
  In addition, we study optimal index codes in various, less restricted,
natural models, and prove several related properties of the graph parameter
$\minrk(G)$.
