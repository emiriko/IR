This research will proposed a new kind of relatively low cost autonomous UAV
that will enable farmers to make just in time mosaics of aerial photo of their
crop. These mosaics of aerial photo should be able to be produced with
relatively low cost and within the 24 hours of acquisition constraint. The
autonomous UAV will be equipped with payload management system specifically
developed for rapid aerial mapping. As mentioned before turn around time is the
key factor, so accuracy is not the main focus (not orthorectified aerial
mapping). This system will also be equipped with special software to post
process the aerial photos to produce the mosaic aerial photo map
