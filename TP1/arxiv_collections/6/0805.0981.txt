We study sound transmission in perforated plates as a function of incident
angle and conclude that it holds distinctive properties that make it unique and
essentially different from optical transmission through perforated metallic
plates. More precisely, we conclude the following: (a) similar to its optical
counterpart, acoustic transmission minima respond to Wood anomalies in which
the periodicity plays a central role; (b) in contrast to both the optical case
and the acoustical case with slits, homogeneous-plate modes (Lamb and
Scholte-Stoneley modes) are strongly coupled to lattice and Fabry-P\'erot
resonances. This gives rise to unique transmission behavior, thus opening new
perspectives for exotic wave phenomena.
