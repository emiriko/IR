Spin valve systems based on the giant magnetoresistive (GMR) effect as used
for example in hard disks and automotive applications consist of several
functional metallic thin film layers. We have identified by secondary ion mass
spectrometry (SIMS) two main degradation mechanisms: One is related to oxygen
diffusion through a protective cap layer, and the other one is interdiffusion
directly at the functional layers of the GMR stack. By choosing a suitable
material as cap layer (TaN), the oxidation effect can be suppressed.
