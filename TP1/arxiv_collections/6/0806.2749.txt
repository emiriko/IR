Informational entropy is often identified as physical entropy. This is
surprising because the two quantities are differently defined and furthermore
the former is a subjective quantity while the latter is an objective one. We
describe the problems and then present a possible view that reconciles the two
entropies. Informational entropy of a system is interpreted as physical entropy
of a whole composed of both the system and "memories" containing information
about the system.
