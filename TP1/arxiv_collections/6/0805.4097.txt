It is demonstrated that SC mechanism of doped Fe-based compounds is
characteristic for itinerant electron systems with coexistence of both (e-e)-
and (e-h)-pairing arising due to electron-phonon and Coulomb interactions,
respectively. The higher Tc of the SC transition here (as compared with
conventional (LTSC) BCS-systems without (e-h)-pairing) is a natural consequence
of (e-e)-pairing at the background of high density of states which arises in
the narrow energy range near dielectric-(SDW)-gap (pseudogap) edges due to
removing of electronic states from the energy region of dielectric (SDW) gap
(pseudogap) (already formed at the part of the Fermi surface in the normal
state with onset temperature T* (near the same for corresponding structural
transition) due to (e-h)-pairing). Below Tc the system enters the coexistence
(SC+SDW) state. The SDW formed is incommensurate with lattice and dynamic in
character. The phase diagram for such system is determined: the doping
dependence of the SC gap (and Tc) has a maximum (optimal doping) while the
dielectric (SDW) gap (pseudogap) (and T*) is a decreasing function of doping.
These conclusions follow from detailed analysis of available resistivity and
another data for Fe-based superconductors on the basis of model with partial
dielectrization of electron energy spectra. The picture obtained and
manifestation of two order parameters (SC and SDW) in experiments, first of
all, in threshold phenomena are discussed. The comparison with the case of
cuprates is performed.
