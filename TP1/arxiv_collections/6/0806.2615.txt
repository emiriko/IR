The latest results of H1 and ZEUS on the electroweak cross sections using
polarised lepton beams are presented with the improvements in the parton
density functions that result from them. The asymmetry of the neutral current
cross sections between e-p and e+p was measured and shows parity violation in
agreement with the Standard Model. The dependence of the charged current cross
section on the beam polarisation has been obtained and its extrapolation to
full polarisation implies the absence of right-handed charged currents.
Constraints on the vector and axial vector couplings of the u and d quarks to
the Z boson from a combined QCD and electroweak fit are shown and the results
from the combination of H1 and ZEUS data are reviewed.
