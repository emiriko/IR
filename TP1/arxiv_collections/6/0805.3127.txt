The formulation of a rigid body in relativistic quantum mechanics is studied.
Departing from an alternate approach at the relativistic classical level, the
corresponding Klein-Gordon and Dirac operators for the rigid body are obtained
in covariant form. The resulting wave equations are shown to be consistent, by
construction, with earlier definitions of a relativistic rigid body by Aldinger
et al (1983). Wave functions and spectra for both cases are obtained
explicitly, including the Dirac gyroscope with asymmetries.
