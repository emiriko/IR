We study a network of coupled logistic maps whose interactions occur with a
certain distribution of delay times. The local dynamics is chaotic in the
absence of coupling and thus the network is a paradigm of a complex system.
There are two regimes of synchronization, depending on the distribution of
delays: when the delays are sufficiently heterogeneous the network synchronizes
on a steady-state (that is unstable for the uncoupled maps); when the delays
are homogeneous, it synchronizes in a time-dependent state (that is either
periodic or chaotic). Using two global indicators we quantify the
synchronizability on the two regimes, focusing on the roles of the network
connectivity and the topology. The connectivity is measured in terms of the
average number of links per node, and we consider various topologies
(scale-free, small-world, star, and nearest-neighbor with and without a central
hub). With weak connectivity and weak coupling strength, the network displays
an irregular oscillatory dynamics that is largely independent of the topology
and of the delay distribution. With heterogeneous delays, we find a threshold
connectivity level below which the network does not synchronize, regardless of
the network size. This minimum average number of neighbors seems to be
independent of the delay distribution. We also analyze the effect of
self-feedback loops and find that they have an impact on the synchronizability
of small networks with large coupling strengths. The influence of feedback,
enhancing or degrading synchronization, depends on the topology and on the
distribution of delays.
