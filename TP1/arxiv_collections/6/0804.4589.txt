We report on the loading of large ion Coulomb crystals into a linear Paul
trap incorporating a high-Finesse optical cavity (F~3200). We show that, even
though the 3-mm diameter dielectric cavity mirrors are placed between the trap
electrodes and separated by only 12 mm, it is possible to produce in situ ion
Coulomb crystals containing more than 100.000 calcium ions of various isotopes
and with lengths of up to several millimeters along the cavity axis. We show
that the number of ions inside the cavity mode is in principle high enough to
achieve strong collective coupling between the ion Coulomb crystal and the
cavity field. The results thus represent an important step towards ion trap
based Cavity Quantum ElectroDynamics (CQED) experiments using cold ion Coulomb
crystals.
