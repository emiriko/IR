In block-matching motion estimation (BMME), the search patterns have a
significant impact on the algorithm's performance, both the search speed and
the search quality. The search pattern should be designed to fit the motion
vector probability (MVP) distribution characteristics of the real-world
sequences. In this paper, we build a directional model of MVP distribution to
describe the directional-center-biased characteristic of the MVP distribution
and the directional characteristics of the conditional MVP distribution more
exactly based on the detailed statistical data of motion vectors of eighteen
popular sequences. Three directional search patterns are firstly designed by
utilizing the directional characteristics and they are the smallest search
patterns among the popular ones. A new algorithm is proposed using the
horizontal cross search pattern as the initial step and the horizontal/vertical
diamond search pattern as the subsequent step for the fast BMME, which is
called the directional cross diamond search (DCDS) algorithm. The DCDS
algorithm can obtain the motion vector with fewer search points than CDS, DS or
HEXBS while maintaining the similar or even better search quality. The gain on
speedup of DCDS over CDS or DS can be up to 54.9%. The simulation results show
that DCDS is efficient, effective and robust, and it can always give the faster
search speed on different sequences than other fast block-matching algorithm in
common use.
