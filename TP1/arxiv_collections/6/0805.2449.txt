We discuss here a self-consistent method to calculate the properties of the
cold asymmetric nuclear matter. In this model, the nuclear matter is dressed
with s-wave pion pairs and the nucleon-nucleon (N-N) interaction is mediated by
these pion pairs, $\omega$ and $\rho$ mesons. The parameters of these
interactions are calculated self-consistently to obtain the saturation
properties like equilibrium binding energy, pressure, compressibility and
symmetry energy. The computed equation of state is then used in the Tolman-
Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation to study the mass and radius of a neutron
star in the pure neutron matter limit.
