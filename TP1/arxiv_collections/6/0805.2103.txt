The influence of randomly distributed point impurities \emph{and} planar
defects on the order and transport in type-II superconductors and related
systems is considered theoretically. For planar defects of identical
orientation the flux line lattice exhibits a new glassy phase dominated by the
planar defects with a finite compressibility, a transverse Meissner effect,
large sample to sample fuctuations of the susceptibility and an exponential
decay of translational long range order. The flux creep resistivity for
currents $J$ parallel to the defects is $\rho(J)\sim \exp-(J_0/J)^{3/2}$ .
Strong disorder enforces an array of dislocations to relax shear strain.
