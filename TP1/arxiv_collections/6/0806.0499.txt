Cross section of the processes of neutral pion production as well as pairs of
charged fermions and bosons in peripherical interaction of leptons, photons are
calculated in main logarithmical approximation. We investigate the phase
volumes and differential cross sections. The differential cross section of few
neutral pions and a few pairs production are written down explicitly.
Considering the academic problem of summation on the number of pairs for the
case of massless particles we reproduce the known results obtained in seventies
of last century. The possibility to construct the generator for Monte-Carlo
modeling of this processes basing of this results are discussed.
