Precision measurements of diffraction have been performed by the H1 and ZEUS
experiments at the HERA collider with high statistics for a wide kinematic
range of photon virtuality $Q^2$. The diffractive parton densities are
extracted by performing the NLO DGLAP QCD fits to diffractive data and can be
used to test QCD factorisation with diffractive final states.
