Solitons and necklaces in the first band-gap of a two-dimensional optically
induced honeycomb defocusing photonic lattice are theoretically considered. It
is shown that dipoles, soliton necklaces, and vortex necklaces exist and may
possess regions of stable propagation through a photorefractive crystal. Most
of the configurations disappear in bifurcations close to the upper edge of the
first band. Solutions associated with such bifurcations are also numerically
examined, and it is found that they are often asymmetric and more exotic. The
dynamics of the relevant unstable structures are also examined through direct
numerical simulations revealing either breathing oscillations or, in some
cases, destruction of the original waveform.
