Entanglement of multipartite systems is studied based on exchange symmetry
under the permutation group S_N. With the observation that symmetric property
under the exchange of two constituent states and their separability are
intimately linked, we show that anti-symmetric (fermionic) states are
necessarily globally entangled, while symmetric (bosonic) states are either
globally entangled or fully separable and possess essentially identical states
in all the constituent systems. It is also shown that there cannot exist a
fully separable state which is orthogonal to all symmetric states, and that
full separability of states does not survive under total symmetrization unless
the states are originally symmetric. Besides, anyonic states permitted under
the braid group B_N should also be globally entangled. Our results reveal that
exchange symmetry is actually sufficient for pure states to become globally
entangled or fully separable.
