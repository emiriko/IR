We calculate the expected finite frequency neutron scattering intensity based
on the two-sublattice collinear antiferromagnet found by recent neutron
scattering experiments as well as by theoretical analysis on the iron
oxypnictide LaOFeAs. We consider two types of superexchange couplings between
Fe atoms: nearest-neighbor coupling J1 and next-nearest-neighbor coupling J2.
We show how to distinguish experimentally between ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic J1. Whereas magnetic excitations in the cuprates display a
so-called resonance peak at (pi,pi) (corresponding to a saddlepoint in the
magnetic spectrum) which is at a wavevector that is at least close to nesting
Fermi-surface-like structures, no such corresponding excitations exist in the
iron pnictides. Rather, we find saddlepoints near (pi,pi/2) and (0,pi/2)(and
symmetry related points). Unlike in the cuprates, none of these vectors are
close to nesting the Fermi surfaces.
