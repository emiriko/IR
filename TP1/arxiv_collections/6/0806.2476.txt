We study the magnetic susceptibility of 1D quantum XY model, and show that
when the temperature approaches zero, the magnetic susceptibility exhibits the
finite-temperature scaling behavior. This scaling behavior of the magnetic
susceptibility in 1D quantum XY model, due to the quantum-classical mapping,
can be easily experimentally tested. Furthermore, the universality in the
critical properties of the magnetic susceptibility in quantum XY model is
verified. Our study also reveals the close relation between the magnetic
susceptibility and the geometric phase in some spin systems, where the quantum
phase transitions are driven by an external magnetic field.
