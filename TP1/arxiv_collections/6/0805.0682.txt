We consider the unparticle physics introduced by Georgi and show that if the
standard model is extended to include a singlet scalar as a dark matter
candidate, there is a channel which leads to its decay to photon and
unparticle. We calculate the decay rate for this new channel and find a lower
bound on unparticle physics scale by demanding the stability of this candidate
of the dark matter.
