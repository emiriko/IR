This paper studies the straight skeleton of polyhedra in three dimensions. We
first address voxel-based polyhedra (polycubes), formed as the union of a
collection of cubical (axis-aligned) voxels. We analyze the ways in which the
skeleton may intersect each voxel of the polyhedron, and show that the skeleton
may be constructed by a simple voxel-sweeping algorithm taking constant time
per voxel. In addition, we describe a more complex algorithm for straight
skeletons of voxel-based polyhedra, which takes time proportional to the area
of the surfaces of the straight skeleton rather than the volume of the
polyhedron. We also consider more general polyhedra with axis-parallel edges
and faces, and show that any n-vertex polyhedron of this type has a straight
skeleton with O(n^2) features. We provide algorithms for constructing the
straight skeleton, with running time O(min(n^2 log n, k log^{O(1)} n)) where k
is the output complexity. Next, we discuss the straight skeleton of a general
nonconvex polyhedron. We show that it has an ambiguity issue, and suggest a
consistent method to resolve it. We prove that the straight skeleton of a
general polyhedron has a superquadratic complexity in the worst case. Finally,
we report on an implementation of a simple algorithm for the general case.
