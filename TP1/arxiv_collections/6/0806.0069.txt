The search for events containing isolated leptons (electrons or muons) and
missing transverse momentum produced in e^{\pm}p collisions is performed
individually and in a common phase space with the H1 and ZEUS detectors at HERA
in the period 1994--2007. The presented H1+ZEUS data sample corresponds to an
integrated luminosity of 0.97 fb^{-1}, and comprises the complete high energy
data from the HERA programme. A total of 87 events are observed in the data,
compared to a Standard Model prediction of 92.7 \pm 11.2. At large hadronic
transverse momentum P_{T}^{X} > 25 GeV in the e^{+}p data, luminosity 0.58
fb^{-1}, 23 data events are observed compared to a SM prediction of 14.6 \pm
1.9. Production cross section measurements of events containing isolated
leptons and missing transverse momentum and of single W production are
performed by H1, where the measured cross sections are found to be in agreement
with SM predictions. A complementary search by H1 for events containing an
isolated tau lepton and missing P_{T} is also presented. A measurement of the W
polarisation fractions is performed by H1, where the presented results are
found to be in agreement with the SM. Finally, the H1 isolated lepton events
are examined in the context of a search for anomalous single top production. In
the absence of a clear signal, an upper limit on the anomalous top production
cross section \sigma_{ep\to etX} < 0.16 pb is established at the 95% confidence
level, corresponding to a limit an upper bound on the anomalous magnetic
coupling \kappa_{tu\gamma} < 0.14.
