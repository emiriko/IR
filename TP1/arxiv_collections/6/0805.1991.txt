A thorough analysis of sneutrinos as dark matter candidates is performed, in
different classes of supersymmetric models, as is typically done for the
neutralino dark matter. First in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model,
sneutrinos are marginally compatible with existing experimental bounds,
including direct detection, provided they compose a subdominant component of
dark matter. Then supersymmetric models with the inclusion of right-handed
fields and lepton number violating terms are presented. These models are
perfectly viable: they predict sneutrinos which are compatible with the current
direct detection sensitivities.
