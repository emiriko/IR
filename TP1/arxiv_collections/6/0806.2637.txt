We present a way to engineer an effective anti-Jaynes-Cumming and a
Jaynes-Cumming interaction between an atomic system and a single cavity mode
and show how to employ it in reservoir engineering processes. To construct the
effective Hamiltonian, we analyse considered the interaction of an atomic
system in a \{Lambda} configuration, driven by classical fields, with a single
cavity mode. With this interaction, we firstly show how to generate a
decoherence-free displaced squeezed state for the cavity field. In our scheme,
an atomic beam works as a reservoir for the radiation field trapped inside the
cavity, as employed recently by S. Pielawa et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 240401
(2007)] to generate an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled radiation state in
high-Q resonators. In our scheme, all the atoms have to be prepared in the
ground state and, as in the cited article, neither atomic detection nor precise
interaction times between the atoms and the cavity mode are required. From this
same interaction, we can also generate an ideal squeezed reservoir for atomic
systems. For this purpose we have to assume, besides the engineered atom-field
interaction, a strong decay of the cavity field (i.e., the cavity decay must be
much stronger than the effective atom-field coupling). With this scheme, some
interesting effects in the dynamics of an atom in a squeezed reservoir could be
tested.
