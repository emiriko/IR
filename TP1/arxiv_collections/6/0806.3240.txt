Square billiards are quantum systems complying with the dynamical
quantum-classical correspondence. Hence an initially localized wavefunction
launched along a classical periodic orbit evolves along that orbit, the
spreading of the quantum amplitude being controlled by the spread of the
corresponding classical statistical distribution. We investigate wavepacket
dynamics and compute the corresponding de Broglie-Bohm trajectories in the
quantum square billiard. We also determine the trajectories and statistical
distribution dynamics for the equivalent classical billiard. Individual Bohmian
trajectories follow the streamlines of the probability flow and are generically
non-classical. This can also hold even for short times, when the wavepacket is
still localized along a classical trajectory. This generic feature of Bohmian
trajectories is expected to hold in the classical limit. We further argue that
in this context decoherence cannot constitute a viable solution in order to
recover classicality.
