Describing the phenomenon of total internal reflection in terms of a
reflection coefficient of unit magnitude, we found that, not only can
propagating plane waves be total internally reflected at the planar interface
of two dissimilar, homogeneous, isotropic dielectric-magnetic mediums, but
evanescent plane waves can also be. The refracting medium must be the optically
denser of the two mediums for total internal reflection of an evanescent plane
wave to occur.
