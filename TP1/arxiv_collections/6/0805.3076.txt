The effect of Polyakov loop on the QCD phase diagram at high density is
studied within the Nambu-Jona Lasinio model with Polyakov loop (PNJL model). We
point out that the color neutrality is missing in the standard PNJL model at
finite density. Moreover, we discuss how the color-flavor locked (CFL) phase is
to be distorted by the inclusion of Polyakov loop.
