Homogeneous shear flows (with constant strainrate du/dy) are generated with
the Doll's and Sllod algorithms and compared to corresponding inhomogeneous
boundary-driven flows. We use one-, two-, and three-dimensional smooth-particle
weight functions for computing instantaneous spatial averages. The nonlinear
stress differences are small, but significant, in both two and three space
dimensions. In homogeneous systems the sign and magnitude of the shearplane
stress difference, P(xx) - P(yy), depend on both the thermostat type and the
chosen shearflow algorithm. The Doll's and Sllod algorithms predict opposite
signs for this stress difference, with the Sllod approach definitely wrong, but
somewhat closer to the (boundary-driven) truth. Neither of the homogeneous
shear algorithms predicts the correct ordering of the kinetic temperatures,
T(xx) > T(zz) > T(yy).
