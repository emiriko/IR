We study models of correlated percolation where there are constraints on the
occupation of sites that mimic force-balance, i.e. for a site to be stable
requires occupied neighboring sites in all four compass directions in two
dimensions. We prove rigorously that $p_c<1$ for the two-dimensional models
studied. Numerical data indicate that the force-balance percolation transition
is discontinuous with a growing crossover length, with perhaps the same form as
the jamming percolation models, suggesting the same underlying mechanism
driving the transition in both cases. In other words, force-balance percolation
and jamming percolation may indeed belong to the same universality class. We
find a lower bound for the correlation length in the connected phase and that
the correlation function does not appear to be a power law at the transition.
Finally, we study the dynamics of the culling procedure invoked to obtain the
force-balance configurations and find a dynamical exponent similar to that
found in sandpile models.
