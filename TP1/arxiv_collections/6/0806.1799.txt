It is shown that highly localized solitons can be created in lower
dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC), trapped in a regular harmonic
trap, by temporally varying the trap frequency. A BEC trapped in such a trap
can be effectively used to construct a pulsed atomic laser emitting coherent
atomic wave packets. It is also shown that one has complete control over the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the solitons. The dynamics of these solitons are
compared with those constructed in a BEC where the trap frequency is constant.
