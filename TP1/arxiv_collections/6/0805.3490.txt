Motivated by the recent experiments on the new spin half Kagome compound
ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2, we study a phenomenological model of a frustrated quantum
magnet. The model has a spin liquid groundstate and is constructed so as to
mimic the macroscopically large quasi-degeneracies expected in the low-lying
energy structure of a Kagome system. We use numerical studies of finite size
systems to investigate the static as well as the dynamical response at finite
temperatures. The results obtained using our simple model are compatible with a
large number of recent experiments including neutron scattering data. Our study
suggests that many of the anomalous features observed in experiments have a
natural interpretation in terms of a spin-1/2 defects (impurities) coupled to
an underlying Kagome-type spin liquid.
