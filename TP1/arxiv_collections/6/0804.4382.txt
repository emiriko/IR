Casimir energy changes are investigated for geometries obtained by small but
arbitrary deformations of a given geometry for which the vacuum energy is
already known for the massless scalar field. As a specific case, deformation of
a spherical shell is studied. From the deformation of the sphere we show that
the Casimir energy is a decreasing function of the surface to volume ratio. The
decreasing rate is higher for less smooth deformations.
