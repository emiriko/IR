Some studies interpret quantum measurement as being explicitly non local.
Others assume the preferred frame hypothesis. Unfortunately, these two classes
of studies conflict with Minkowski space-time geometry. On the contrary, in
Aristotle space-time, Lorentz invariance, interpreted as a physical property
applying to all phenomena actually satisfying this symmetry (as opposed to a
geometrical constraint applying to an assumed pre-existing Minkowski
space-time) consistently coexists with possible Lorentz violations. Moreover,
as will be pointed out, the geometrical framework provided by Aristotle
space-time is in fact necessary to derive the Lorentz transformations from
physical hypotheses.
