We demonstrate that the N=1 rescattering contribution to the gluon radiation
from a fast massless quark in eA DIS vanishes in the collinear approximation.
It is shown that the nonzero N=1 gluon spectrum obtained in the higher-twist
approach by Guo, Wang and Zhang is a consequence of unjustified neglecting some
important terms in the collinear expansion.
