The purpose of this paper is to propose a new approach for the supply chain
management. This approach is based on the virtual enterprise paradigm and the
used of multi-agent concept. Each entity (like enterprise) is autonomous and
must perform local and global goals in relation with its environment. The base
component of our approach is a Virtual Enterprise Node (VEN). The supply chain
is viewed as a set of tiers (corresponding to the levels of production), in
which each partner of the supply chain (VEN) is in relation with several
customers and suppliers. Each VEN belongs to one tier. The main customer gives
global objectives (quantity, cost and delay) to the supply chain. The Mediator
Agent (MA) is in charge to manage the supply chain in order to respect those
objectives as global level. Those objectives are taking over to Negotiator
Agent at the tier level (NAT). These two agents are only active if a
perturbation occurs; otherwise information flows are only exchange between
VENs. This architecture allows supply chains management which is completely
transparent seen from simple enterprise of the supply chain. The used of
Multi-Agent System (MAS) allows physical distribution of the decisional system.
Moreover, the hierarchical organizational structure with a decentralized
control guaranties, in the same time, the autonomy of each entity and the whole
flexibility.
