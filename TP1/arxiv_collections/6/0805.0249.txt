Collecting the complete data set of previous experiments on periclase,
covering a pressure and temperature range of 0-141.8 GPa and 100-3031 K
respectively, the first comprehensive P-V-T description of MgO is presented
comprising all previous experiments. The P-V-T EoS of Birch-Murnaghan,
Rydberg-Vinet and Garai are determined by unrestricted fitting. The three EoSs
are consistent and a unique set of parameters is able to cover the entire
pressure and temperature range. The RMS misfits for the pressure are 0.371 GPa,
0.381 GPa and 0.396 GPa for the Garai, Birch-Murnaghan and Rydberg-Vinet EoSs.
The RMS misfits for the volume and the temperature are 0.018 cm3 and 60.3 K for
the EoS of Garai.
