We discuss the predictions of the standard model for the scalar form factors
of Kl3 decays. Our analysis is based on the results of chiral perturbation
theory, large Nc estimates of low-energy couplings and dispersive methods. It
includes a discussion of isospin violating effects of strong and
electromagnetic origin.
