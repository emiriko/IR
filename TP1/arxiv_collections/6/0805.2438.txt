Reasoning about real number expressions in a proof assistant is challenging.
Several problems in theorem proving can be solved by using exact real number
computation. I have implemented a library for reasoning and computing with
complete metric spaces in the Coq proof assistant and used this library to
build a constructive real number implementation including elementary real
number functions and proofs of correctness. Using this library, I have created
a tactic that automatically proves strict inequalities over closed elementary
real number expressions by computation.
