Recently tachyonic field has been depicted as dark energy model to represent
the present acceleration of the Universe. In this paper we have considered
mixture of tachyonic fluid with a perfect fluid. For this purpose we have
considered barotropic fluid and Generalized Chaplygin gas(G.C.G.). We have
considered a particular form of the scale factor. We have solved the equations
of motion to get the exact solutions of the density, tachyonic potential and
the tachyonic field. We have introduced a coupling term to show that the
interaction decays with time. Also we have shown that the nature of the
potentials vary so as the interaction term reduces the potential in both the
cases.
