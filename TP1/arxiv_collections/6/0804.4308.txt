Volume dependence of the spectral weight is usually used as a simple criteria
to distinguish single-particle states from multi-particle states in lattice QCD
calculations. Within a solvable model, the Lee model, we show that this
criteria is in principle only valid for a stable particle or a narrow
resonance. If the resonance being studied is broad, then the volume dependence
of the corresponding spectral weight resembles that of a multi-particle state
instead of a single-particle one. For an unstable $V$-particle in the Lee
model, the transition from single-particle to multi-particle volume dependence
is governed by the ratio of its physical width to the typical level spacing in
the finite volume. We estimate this ratio for practical lattice QCD simulations
and find that, for most cases, the resonance studied in lattice QCD simulations
still resembles the single particle behavior.
