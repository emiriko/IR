The variation of mass in induced matter theory using Ceroch-Stewart-Walter
perturbations of submanifolds [1] is redefined. It is shown that the deviation
of primordial Helium production due to a variation on the difference between
the rest mass of the nucleus is in agrement with induced matter brane gravity.
