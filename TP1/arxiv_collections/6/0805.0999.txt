Dark matter is examined within the ``golden region'' of the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model. This region satisfies experimental constraints,
including a lower bound on the Higgs mass of 114 GeV, and minimizes fine-tuning
of the Z boson mass. Here we impose additional constraints (particularly due to
experimental bounds on $b\to s \gamma$). Then we find the properties of the
Dark Matter in this region. Neutralinos with a relic density that provides the
amount of dark matter required by cosmological data are shown to consist of a
predominant gaugino (rather than higgsino) fraction. In addition, the U(1)$_Y$
gaugino mass parameter must satisfy $M_1 < 300$ GeV.
