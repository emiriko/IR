Explicit analytical expressions for Helmholtz free energy, chemical
potential, entropy and pressure of the multi-component dimerizing Yukawa
hard-sphere fluid are presented. These expressions are written in terms of the
Blum's scaling parameter $\Gamma$, which follows from the solution of the
associative mean spherical approximation (AMSA) for the model with factorized
Yukawa coefficients. In this case solution of the AMSA reduces to the solution
of only one nonlinear algebraic equation for $\Gamma$. This feature enables the
theory to be used in the description of the thermodynamical properties of
associating fluids with arbitrary number of components, including the limiting
case of polydisperse fluids.
