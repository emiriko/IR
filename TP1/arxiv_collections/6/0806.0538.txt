SARAH is a Mathematica package for building and analyzing supersymmetric
models. SARAH just needs the gauge structure, particle content and
superpotential to produce all information about the gauge eigenstates of a
model. Breaking of gauge symmetries and mixings of particles can easily be in a
second step and entire Lagrangian is derived automatically. Also the gauge
fixing terms are derived by SARAH in R_Xi gauge, and the corresponding ghost
interactions are calculated. Using this information, SARAH can calculate the
all mass matrices, tadpole equations and vertices at tree-level for the given
model. In addition, the expressions for the 1- and 2-loop renormalization group
equations of all parameters can be calculated and an automatic calculation for
the 1-loop corrections to self energies and the tadpoles are possible.
  SARAH can write all information about the model to LaTeX files, or create a
model files for FeynArts/FormCalc, WHIZARD/OMEGA and CalcHep/CompHep, which can
also be used for dark matter studies using MicrOmegas, and in the UFO format
which is supported by MadGraph 5. Beginning with version 3, SARAH is also the
first available spectrum-generator-generator: based on the derived, analytical
expression it creates source code for SPheno to calculate the mass spectrum as
well the SUSY decays with high precision. In that way, it is possible to
implement new models in SPheno without the need to write any Fortran code by
hand. Already many models beyond the MSSM are included in the public version of
SARAH and the implementation of new models is easy and straightforward.
