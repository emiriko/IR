The light-quark non-strange scalar mesons a0(980), f0(980), f0(1370),
a0(1450), f0(1500) and f0(1710) are of great interest as there is no generally
accepted view of their structure which can encompass q-q-qbar-qbar, molecular,
q-qbar and glueball states in various combinations. It has been shown
previously that the radiative decays of the scalar mesons to rho and omega are
a good probe of their structure and provide good discrimination among models.
Scalar meson photoproduction is proposed as an alternative to measuring
radiative decays and it is shown that it is a feasible proposition.
