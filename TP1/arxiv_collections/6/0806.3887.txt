In the previous paper, we have conceptualized the localization and the
organization of seeded region growing by pixels aggregation (SRGPA) but we do
not give the issue when there is a collision between two distinct regions
during the growing process. In this paper, we propose two implementations to
manage two classical growing processes: one without a boundary region region to
divide the other regions and another with. Unfortunately, as noticed by Mehnert
and Jakway (1997), this partition depends on the seeded region initialisation
order (SRIO). We propose a growing process, invariant about SRIO such as the
boundary region is the set of ambiguous pixels.
