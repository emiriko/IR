We show that the optical properties of an oblique layered system with two
kinds of isotropic materials can be described using the concept of
transformation media as long as the thickness of the layers is much smaller
than the wavelength. Once the connection with transformation media is
established, we then show that oblique layered system can serve as a universal
element to build a variety of interesting functional optical components such as
wave splitters, wave combiners, one-dimensional cloaking devices and
reflectionless field rotators.
