By using solid state reaction method we have fabricated the hole doped
$La_{1-x}Sr_xFeAsO$ superconductors with Sr content up to 0.13. It is found
that the sharp anomaly at about 150 K and the low temperature upturn of
resistivity are suppressed by doping holes into the parent phase. Interestingly
both the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ and the lattice constants
(a-axis and c-axis) increase monotonously with hole concentration, in sharp
contrast with the electron doped side where the $T_c$ increases with a
continuing shrinkage of the lattice constants either by dope more fluorine or
oxygen vacancies into the system. Our data clearly illustrate that the
superconductivity can be induced by doping holes via substituting the trivalent
La with divalent Sr in the LaFeAsO system with single FeAs layer, and the $T_c$
in the present system exhibits a symmetric behavior at the electron and hole
doped sides, as we reported previously.
