We present a numerical study of the density of states in a
ferromagnet/superconductor junction and the Josephson current in a
superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor junction in the diffusive limit by
solving the Usadel equation with Nazarov's boundary conditions. Our
calculations are valid for an arbitrary interface transparency and arbitrary
spin-dependent scattering rate, which allows us to explore the entire
proximity-effect regime. We first investigate how the proximity-induced
anomalous Green's function affects the density of states in the ferromagnet for
several values of the exchange field. In each case, we consider the effect of
the barrier transparency and allow for various concentrations of magnetic
impurities. In particular, we address how the zero-energy peak and minigap
observed in experiments may be understood in terms of the interplay between the
singlet and triplet anomalous Green's function and their dependence on the
concentration of magnetic impurities. We also investigate the role of the
barrier transparency and spin-flip scattering in a
superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor junction. We suggest that such
diffusive Josephson junctions with large residual values of the supercurrent at
the 0-$\pi$ transition, where the first harmonic term in the current vanishes,
may be used as efficient supercurrent-switching devices. It is also found that
uniaxial spin-flip scattering has very different effect on the 0-$\pi$
transition points depending on whether one regards the width- or
temperature-dependence of the current.
