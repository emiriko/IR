The use of GNSS signals as a source of opportunity for remote sensing
applications, GNSS-R, has been a research area of interest for more than a
decade. One of the possible applications of this technique is soil moisture
monitoring. The retrieval of soil moisture with GNSS-R systems is based on the
variability of the ground dielectric properties associated to soil moisture.
Higher concentrations of water in the soil yield a higher dielectric constant
and reflectivity, which incurs in signals that reflect from the Earth surface
with higher peak power. Previous investigations have demonstrated the
capability of GPS bistatic scatterometers to obtain high enough signal to noise
ratios in order to sense small changes in surface reflectivity. Furthermore,
these systems present some advantages with respect to others currently used to
retrieve soil moisture. Upcoming satellite navigation systems, such as the
European Galileo, will represent an excellent source of opportunity for soil
moisture remote sensing for various reasons. First, the existence of pilot
signals will provide the possibility to extend coherent integration times,
which will contribute to the increase of received signals SNR. In addition, the
availability of Galileo L1 and L5 signals will allow the multi-spectral
analysis of the reflected signals and the development of inversion models which
will be able to account more precisely for adverse effects, such as surface
roughness and vegetation canopy. In this paper we present some of the recent
theoretical work and experiments carried out at Starlab focusing on the
development of dedicated Soil Moisture GNSS-R systems.
