We present our results on transverse momentum fluctuations, multiplicity
fluctuations and transverse momentum distributions for baryons and mesons in
the framework of the clustering of color sources. We determine under what
conditions the initial state configurations can lead to color connection, and
more specifically, if variations of the initial state can lead to a transition
from disconnected to connected color clusters, modifying the number of
effective sources. We find that beyond a critical point, one has a condensate,
containing interacting and hence color-connected sources. This point thus
specifies the onset of color deconfinement. We show that the transverse
momentum and multiplicity distributions are related to each other in a defined
way. We obtain a non-monotonic dependence of the $p_T$ and multiplicity
fluctuations with the number of participants. We present our results for the
fluctuations and the transverse momentum distributions at RHIC energies
compared to the existing experimental data and our predictions for LHC
energies.
