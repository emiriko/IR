B. Schumacher and M. Westmoreland have established a quantum analog of a
well-known classical information theory result on a role of relative entropy as
a measure of non-optimality in (classical) data compression. In this paper, we
provide an alternative, simple and constructive proof of this result by
constructing quantum compression codes (schemes) from classical data
compression codes. Moreover, as the quantum data compression/coding task can be
effectively reduced to a (quasi-)classical one, we show that relevant results
from classical information theory and data compression become applicable and
therefore can be extended to the quantum domain.
