We address in a recent gauge model of unparticles the issues that are
important for consistency of a gauge theory, i.e., unitarity and Ward identity
of physical amplitudes. We find that non-integrable singularities arise in
physical quantities like cross section and decay rate from gauge interactions
of unparticles. We also show that Ward identity is violated due to the lack of
a dispersion relation for charged unparticles although the Ward-Takahashi
identity for general Green functions is incorporated in the model. A previous
observation that the unparticle's (with scaling dimension d) contribution to
the gauge boson self-energy is a factor (2-d) of the particle's has been
extended to the Green function of triple gauge bosons. This (2-d) rule may be
generally true for any point Green functions of gauge bosons. This implies that
the model would be trivial even as one that mimics certain dynamical effects on
gauge bosons in which unparticles serve as an interpolating field.
