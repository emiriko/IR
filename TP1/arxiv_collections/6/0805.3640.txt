A sign error in an angle while drawing the original Minkowski plot has
persisted for a century in text books and the pedagogical literature. When it
is corrected, the `length contraction' effect derived from the geometry of the
plot disappears. It is also shown how the `relativity of simultaneity' effect
that has been derived from the plot results from a lack of correspondence
between certain geometrical projections on the plot and the properties of the
physical system --two spatially separated and synchronised clocks in a common
inertial frame-- that they are purported to describe.
