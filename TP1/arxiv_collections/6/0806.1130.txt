The study on the linkage of elementary particle mass differences with
pion-muon mass difference is explored further. In the present study we show
this linkage to be equally true for the mass differences amongst the members of
SU(3) hadron multiplets and the hadrons belonging to multiplets having
different spin and parity characteristics. This reinforces our contention that
inter particle mass excitations are quantized as integral multiples of basic
mass unit of 29.318 MeV and thereby indicates the fundamental nature of
pion-muon mass difference in the elementary particle mass distribution.
