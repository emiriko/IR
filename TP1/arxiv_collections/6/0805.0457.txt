We propose and analyze a technique that allows to suppress inelastic
collisions and simultaneously enhance elastic interactions between cold polar
molecules. The main idea is to cancel the leading dipole-dipole interaction
with a suitable combination of static electric and microwave fields in such a
way that the remaining van-der-Waals-type potential forms a three-dimensional
repulsive shield. We analyze the elastic and inelastic scattering cross
sections relevant for evaporative cooling of polar molecules and discuss the
prospect for the creation of crystalline structures.
