We review the generation of random pure states using a protocol of repeated
two qubit gates. We study the dependence of the convergence to states with Haar
multipartite entanglement distribution. We investigate the optimal generation
of such states in terms of the physical (real) time needed to apply the
protocol, instead of the gate complexity point of view used in other works.
This physical time can be obtained, for a given Hamiltonian, within the
theoretical framework offered by the quantum brachistochrone formalism. Using
an anisotropic Heisenberg Hamiltonian as an example, we find that different
optimal quantum gates arise according to the optimality point of view used in
each case. We also study how the convergence to random entangled states depends
on different entanglement measures.
