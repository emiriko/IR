The thermal entanglement is investigated in a two-qubit Heisenberg XXZ system
with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. It is shown that the entanglement
can be efficiently controlled by the DM interaction parameter and coupling
coefficient $J_{z}$. $D_{x}$(the x-component parameter of the DM interaction)
has a more remarkable influence on the entanglement and the critical
temperature than $D_{z}$(the z-component parameter of the DM interaction).
Thus, by the change of DM interaction direction, we can get a more efficient
control parameter to increase the entanglement and the critical temperature.
