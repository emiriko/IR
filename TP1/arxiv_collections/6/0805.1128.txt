A plausible architecture of an ancient genetic code is derived from an
extended base triplet vector space over the Galois field of the extended base
alphabet {D, G, A, U, C}, where the letter D represents one or more
hypothetical bases with unspecific pairing. We hypothesized that the high
degeneration of a primeval genetic code with five bases and the gradual origin
and improvements of a primitive DNA repair system could make possible the
transition from the ancient to the modern genetic code. Our results suggest
that the Watson-Crick base pairing and the non-specific base pairing of the
hypothetical ancestral base D used to define the sum and product operations are
enough features to determine the coding constraints of the primeval and the
modern genetic code, as well as, the transition from the former to the later.
Geometrical and algebraic properties of this vector space reveal that the
present codon assignment of the standard genetic code could be induced from a
primeval codon assignment.Besides, the Fourier spectrum of the extended DNA
genome sequences derived from the multiple sequence alignment suggests that the
called period-3 property of the present coding DNA sequences could also exist
in the ancient coding DNA sequences.
