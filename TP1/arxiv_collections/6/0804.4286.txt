This article is devoted to the investigation of structure of wrap groups of
connected fiber bundles over the fields of real $\bf R$, complex $\bf C$
numbers, the quaternion skew field $\bf H$ and the octonion algebra $\bf O$.
Iterated wrap groups are studied as well. Their smashed products are
constructed.
