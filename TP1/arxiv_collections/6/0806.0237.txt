We investigate sub-gap transport through a single-level quantum dot tunnel
coupled to one superconducting and two normal-conducting leads. Despite the
tendency of a large charging energy to suppress the equilibrium proximity
effect, a finite Andreev current through the dot can be achieved in
non-equilibrium situations. We propose two schemes to identify non-local
Andreev transport. In one of them, the presence of strong Coulomb interaction
leads to negative values of the non-local conductance as a clear signal of
non-local Andreev transport.
