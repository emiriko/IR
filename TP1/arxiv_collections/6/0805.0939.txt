A PEM micro fuel cell system is described which is based on self-breathing
PEM micro fuel cells in the power range between 1 mW and 1W. Hydrogen is
supplied with on-demand hydrogen production with help of a galvanic cell, that
produces hydrogen when Zn reacts with water. The system can be used as a
battery replacement for low power applications and has the potential to improve
the run time of autonomous systems. The efficiency has been investigated as
function of fuel cell construction and tested for several load profiles.
