We show that singlet superconductivity in the Abrikosov vortex phase is
absolutely unstable with respect to the appearance of a chiral triplet
component of a superconducting order parameter. This chiral component, p_x + i
p_y, breaks time-reversal, parity, and spin rotational symmetries of the
internal order parameter, responsible for a relative motion of two electrons in
the Cooper pair. We demonstrate that the symmetry breaking Pauli paramagnetic
effects can be tuned by a magnetic field strength and direction and can be made
of the order of unity in organic and high-temperature layered superconductors.
