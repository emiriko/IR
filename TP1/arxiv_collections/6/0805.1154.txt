The instances of templates in Wikipedia form an interesting data set of
structured information. Here I focus on the cite journal template that is
primarily used for citation to articles in scientific journals. These citations
can be extracted and analyzed: Non-negative matrix factorization is performed
on a (article x journal) matrix resulting in a soft clustering of Wikipedia
articles and scientific journals, each cluster more or less representing a
scientific topic.
