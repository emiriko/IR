Muon-spin rotation experiments were performed on the pnictide high
temperature superconductor SmFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_{x}$ with x=0.18 and 0.3. We
observed an unusual enhancement of slow spin fluctuations in the vicinity of
the superconducting which suggests that the spin fluctuations contribute to the
formation of an unconventional superconducting state. An estimate of the
in-plane penetration depth $\lambda_{ab}(0)=190(5)$\thinspace nm was obtained,
which confirms that the pnictide superconductors obey an Uemura-style
relationship between $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ and $\lambda_{ab}(0)^{-2}$.
