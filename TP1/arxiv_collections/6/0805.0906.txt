A new symmetrical four-wire sensor configuration has resulted in a fully
integrated sound intensity sensor with significant lower noise floor and
smaller size than its predecessors. An integrated sound pressure sensor was
further miniaturized by using a folded "back chamber" at both sides of the
chip.
