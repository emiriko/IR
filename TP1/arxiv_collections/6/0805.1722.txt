Strategies that utilise the interference effects within $B^{\pm} \to
DK^{\pm}$ decays hold great potential for improving our sensitivity to the CKM
angle $\gamma$. However, in order to exploit fully this potential, detailed
knowledge of the D meson decay structure is required. This essential
information can be obtained from the quantum correlated $\psi(3770)$ datasets
at CLEO-c. Results of such analyses involving the decay mode $D \to
K\pi\pi\pi$, and their importance in the context of LHCb, will be presented.
