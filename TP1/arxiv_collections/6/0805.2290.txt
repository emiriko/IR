Contractor renormalization (CORE) is a real-space renormalization-group
method to derive effective Hamiltionians for microscopic models. The original
CORE method is based on a real-space decomposition of the lattice into small
blocks and the effective degrees of freedom on the lattice are tensor products
of those on the small blocks. We present an extension of the CORE method that
overcomes this restriction. Our generalization allows the application of CORE
to derive arbitrary effective models whose Hilbert space is not just a tensor
product of local degrees of freedom. The method is especially well suited to
search for microscopic models to emulate low-energy exotic models and can guide
the design of quantum devices.
