In this paper we introduce a generalized concept of field-transforming
metamaterials, which perform field transformations defined as linear relations
between the original and transformed fields. These artificial media change the
fields in a prescribed fashion in the volume occupied by the medium. We show
what electromagnetic properties of transforming medium are required. The
coefficients of these linear functions can be arbitrary scalar functions of
position and frequency, which makes the approach quite general and opens a
possibility to realize various unusual devices.
