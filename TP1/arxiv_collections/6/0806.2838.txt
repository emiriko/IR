We report on a plan to establish a "Dictionary of LHC Signatures", an
initiative that started at the WHEPPX workshop in January 2008. This study aims
towards the strategy on distinguishing of 3 classes of dark matter motivated
scenarios such as R-parity conserved supersymmetry, Little Higgs models with
T-parity conservation and Universal Extra Dimensions with KK-parity for generic
cases of their realization in wide range of the model space. Discriminating
signatures are tabulated and will need a further detailed analysis.
