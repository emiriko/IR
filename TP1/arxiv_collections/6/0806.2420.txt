We can solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation of the enlarged Bianchi I as
inhomogeneous type universe with static restriction which had been derived by
previous paper. We consider the commutation relation between the static
restriction and the Hamiltonian constraint. And we can simplify the usual 3+1
Hamiltonian constraint of the enlarged Biancki I type universe, and we finally
show the state's form is the exponential. And we find that the states of the
quantum gravity are entangled. Our paper based on the previous work of ours
that we call up-to-down method which was aimed to simplify the Wheeler-DeWitt
equation.
