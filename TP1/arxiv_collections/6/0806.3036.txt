We study generic diffeomorphisms with a homoclinc class with non empty
interior and in particular those admitting a codimension one dominated
splitting. We prove that if in the finest dominated splitting the extreme
subbundles are one dimensional then the diffeomorphism is partially hyperbolic
and from this we deduce that the diffeomorphism is transitive.
