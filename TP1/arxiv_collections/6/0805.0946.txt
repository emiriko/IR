Several experimental and numerical studies have shown that turbulent motions
in circular pipe flow near transitional Reynolds numbers may not persist
forever, but may decay. We study the properties of these decaying states within
direct numerical simulations for Reynolds numbers up to 2200 and in pipes with
lengths equal to 5, 9 and 15 times the diameter. We show that the choice of the
ensemble of initial conditions affects the short time parts of lifetime
distributions, but does not change the characteristic decay rate for long
times. Comparing lifetimes for pipes of different length we notice a linear
increase in the characteristic lifetime with length, which reproduces the
experimental results when extrapolated to 30 diameters, the length of an
equilibrium turbulent puff at these Reynolds numbers.
