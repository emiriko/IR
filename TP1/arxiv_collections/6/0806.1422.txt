We show that a special choice of light-cone gauge can greatly simplify the
calculation of the classical color field created in the initial stages of
nucleus-nucleus collisions. Within this gauge, we can in particular construct
explicitly the conserved color current and calculate exactly the gauge field
immediately after the collision. This field is used as a boundary condition in
an iterative solution of the Yang-Mills equations in the forward light-cone. In
leading order, which corresponds to a linearization of the Yang-Mills equation
in the forward light-cone, we obtain a simple formula for the spectrum of
gluons produced in nucleus-nucleus collisions. This formula reproduces exactly
the known formula for proton-nucleus collisions, where $k_t-$factorization is
recovered, while the latter property apparently breaks down in the case of
nucleus-nucleus collisions.
