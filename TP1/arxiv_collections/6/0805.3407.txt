Let A be a matrix whose entries are real i.i.d. centered random variables
with unit variance and suitable moment assumptions. Then the smallest singular
value of A is of order n^{-1/2} with high probability. The lower estimate of
this type was proved recently by the authors; in this note we establish the
matching upper estimate.
