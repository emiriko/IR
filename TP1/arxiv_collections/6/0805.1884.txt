The properties of suspended graphene are currently attracting enormous
interest, but the small size of available samples and the difficulties in
making them severely restrict the number of experimental techniques that can be
used to study the optical, mechanical, electronic, thermal and other
characteristics of this one-atom-thick material. Here we describe a new and
highly-reliable approach for making graphene membranes of a macroscopic size
(currently up to 100 microns in diameter) and their characterization by
transmission electron microscopy. In particular, we have found that long
graphene beams supported by one side only do not scroll or fold, in striking
contrast to the current perception of graphene as a supple thin fabric, but
demonstrate sufficient stiffness to support extremely large loads, millions of
times exceeding their own weight, in agreement with the presented theory. Our
work opens many avenues for studying suspended graphene and using it in various
micromechanical systems and electron microscopy.
