We show experimentally that parametric interaction can induce a cooperative
oscillation of non simultaneously resonant transverse modes in an optical
parametric oscillator. More generally, this effect is expected to occur in any
spatially extended system subjected to boundary conditions where nonlinear wave
mixing of two nonresonant spatial modes can generate a resonant oscillation.
