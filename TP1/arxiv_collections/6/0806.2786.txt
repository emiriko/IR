We propose a scheme for monitoring coherent quantum dynamics with good
time-resolution and low backaction, which relies on the response of the
considered quantum system to high-frequency ac driving. An approximate
analytical solution of the corresponding quantum master equation reveals that
the phase of an outgoing signal, which can directly be measured in an
experiment with lock-in technique, is proportional to the expectation value of
a particular system observable. This result is corroborated by the numerical
solution of the master equation for a charge qubit realized with a Cooper-pair
box, where we focus on monitoring coherent oscillations.
