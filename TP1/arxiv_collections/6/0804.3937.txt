First principles calculations of the O surfaces of Co-ZnO show that
substitutional Co ions develop large magnetic moments which long-range coupling
depends on their mutual distance. The local spin polarization induced at the O
atoms is three times larger at the surface than in the bulk, and the surface
stability is considerably reinforced by Co. Moreover, a robust ferromagnetic
state is predicted at the Oxygen (0001) surface even in the absence of magnetic
atoms. The occurrence of surface magnetic moments correlates with the number of
{\it p}-holes in the valence band of the oxide, and the distribution of the
magnetic charge is, even in the absence of spin-orbit interaction, highly
anisotropic.
