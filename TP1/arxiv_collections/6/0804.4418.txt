Using a nonlocal field transformation for the gauge field known as
Cho--Faddeev--Niemi--Shabanov decomposition as well as ideas taken from
generalized integrability, we derive a new family of infinitely many conserved
currents in the self-dual sector of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. These currents may
be related to the area preserving diffeomorphisms on the reduced target space.
The calculations are performed in a completely covariant manner and, therefore,
can be applied to the self-dual equations in any space-time dimension with
arbitrary signature.
