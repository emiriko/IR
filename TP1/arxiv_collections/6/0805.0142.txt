The restrictions of analyticity, relativistic (Born) rigidity, and negligible
O(a) terms involved in the evaluation of the self electromagnetic force on an
extended charged sphere of radius "a" are explicitly revealed and taken into
account in order to obtain a classical equation of motion of the extended
charge that is both causal and conserves momentum-energy. Because the
power-series expansion used in the evaluation of the self force becomes invalid
during transition time intervals immediately following the application and
termination of an otherwise analytic externally applied force, transition
forces must be included during these transition time intervals to remove the
noncausal pre-acceleration and pre-deceleration from the solutions to the
equation of motion without the transition forces. For the extended charged
sphere, the transition forces can be chosen to maintain conservation of
momentum-energy in the causal solutions to the equation of motion within the
restrictions of relativistic rigidity and negligible O(a) terms under which the
equation of motion is derived. However, it is shown that renormalization of the
electrostatic mass to a finite value as the radius of the charge approaches
zero introduces a violation of momentum-energy conservation into the causal
solutions to the equation of motion of the point charge if the magnitude of the
external force becomes too large. That is, the causal classical equation of
motion of a point charge with renormalized mass experiences a high acceleration
catastrophe.
