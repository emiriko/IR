We show that a four-dimensional equation of state for a cosmological constant
term arises from a perfect fluid in the bulk in the context of a gravity model
where the scalar curvature is non-minimally coupled to the perfect fluid
Lagrangian density. The four-dimensional theory is fully determined from the
induced equations on the brane, subject to the boundary conditions derived
across the brane.
