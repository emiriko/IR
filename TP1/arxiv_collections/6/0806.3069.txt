We consider the transverse dynamical structure factor of the anisotropic
Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain (XXZ model) in the gapped antiferromagnetic regime
($\Delta > 1$). Specializing to the case of zero field, we use two independent
approaches based on integrability (one valid for finite size, the other for the
infinite lattice) to obtain the exact two-spinon part of this correlator. We
discuss in particular its asymmetry with respect to the $\pi/2$ momentum line,
its overall anisotropy dependence, and its contribution to sum rules.
