The formula for the relativistic Doppler effect is investigated in the
context of two compelling invariance axioms. The axioms are expressed in terms
of an abstract operation generalizing the relativistic addition of velocities.
We prove the following results. (1) If the standard representation for the
operation is not assumed a priori, then each of the two axioms is consistent
with both the relativistic Doppler effect formula and the Lorentz-Fitzgerald
Contraction. (2) If the standard representation for the operation is assumed,
then the two axioms are equivalent to each other and to the relativistic
Doppler effect formula. Thus, the axioms are inconsistent with the
Lorentz-FitzGerald Contraction in this case. (3) If the Lorentz-FitzGerald
Contraction is assumed, then the two axioms are equivalent to each other and to
a different mathematical representation for the operation which applies in the
case of perpendicular motions. The relativistic Doppler effect is derived up to
one positive exponent parameter (replacing the square root). We prove these
facts under regularity and other reasonable background conditions.
