The interference response function f_LT (R_LT) of the D(e,e'p)n reaction has
been determined at squared four-momentum transfer Q^2 = 0.33 (GeV/c)^2 and for
missing momenta up to p_miss= 0.29 (GeV/c). The results have been compared to
calculations that reproduce f_LT quite well but overestimate the cross sections
by 10 - 20% for missing momenta between 0.1 (GeV/c) and 0.2 (GeV/c) .
