The objective of this paper is to develop a general algebraic theory of
supertropical matrix algebra, extending [11]. Our main results are as follows:
  * The tropical determinant (i.e., permanent) is multiplicative when all the
determinants involved are tangible.
  * There exists an adjoint matrix $\adj{A}$ such that the matrix $A \adj{A}$
behaves much like the identity matrix (times $|A|$).
  * Every matrix $A$ is a supertropical root of its Hamilton-Cayley polynomial
$f_A$. If these roots are distinct, then $A$ is conjugate (in a certain
supertropical sense) to a diagonal matrix.
  * The tropical determinant of a matrix $A$ is a ghost iff the rows of $A$ are
tropically dependent, iff the columns of $A$ are tropically dependent.
  * Every root of $f_A$ is a "supertropical" eigenvalue of $A$ (appropriately
defined), and has a tangible supertropical eigenvector.
