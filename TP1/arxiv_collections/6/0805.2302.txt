We discuss the results from the Tevatron experiments on mixing and {\sf CP}
violation in the $B_s-\bar{B}_s^0$ system, with particular emphasis to the
first measurements of the decay width-difference $\Delta\Gamma_s$ and the {\sf
CP} violating phase $\beta_s$ using flavor tagging information. We also briefly
review the charge asymmetry measurements in semileptonic $B_s$ decays and in
$B^\pm \to J/\psi K^\pm$ decays.
