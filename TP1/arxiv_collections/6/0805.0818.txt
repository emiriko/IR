We introduce some new experiments where light diffraction is demonstrated
with simple elements: white light diffraction with a coin, construction of a
diffractive lens by holography, diffraction properties in digital discs and an
interesting experiment that generates images with them. This experiments lead
to the idea of a new optics that is entirely diffractive, which is a trend in
development for its construction facilities, weight reduction and other
benefits it causes.
