We study the triangular antiferromagnet Cu$_3$ in external electric fields,
using symmetry group arguments and a Hubbard model approach. We identify a
spin-electric coupling caused by an interplay between spin exchange, spin-orbit
interaction, and the chirality of the underlying spin texture of the molecular
magnet. This coupling allows for the electric control of the spin (qubit)
states, e.g. by using an STM tip or a microwave cavity. We propose an
experimental test for identifying molecular magnets exhibiting spin-electric
effects.
