We introduce and investigate billiard systems with an adjusted ray dynamics
that accounts for modifications of the conventional reflection of rays due to
universal wave effects. We show that even small modifications of the specular
reflection law have dramatic consequences on the phase space of classical
billiards. These include the creation of regions of non-Hamiltonian dynamics,
the breakdown of symmetries, and changes in the stability and morphology of
periodic orbits. Focusing on optical microcavities, we show that our adjusted
dynamics provides the missing ray counterpart to previously observed wave
phenomena and we describe how to observe its signatures in experiments. Our
findings also apply to acoustic and ultrasound waves and are important in all
situations where wavelengths are comparable to system sizes, an increasingly
likely situation considering the systematic reduction of the size of electronic
and photonic devices.
