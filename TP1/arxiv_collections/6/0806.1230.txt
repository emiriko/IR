We propose a new flavor paradigm for models with warped extra dimensions. The
idea is to impose the minimal amount of flavor protection to make warped models
compatible with all current flavor and electroweak precision constraints. We
discuss a particular realization of this minimal flavor protection in the quark
sector, by means of a flavor symmetry acting on the right handed down sector.
Hierarchical quark masses and mixing angles are naturally reproduced through
wave function localization, and flavor violating processes are predicted, in
the absence of large brane kinetic terms for the right handed down quarks,
below but not too far from current experimental limits in several channels.
With this new flavor pattern, models with warped extra dimensions can be
accessible through direct production of new resonances at the LHC and also
through precision flavor experiments.
