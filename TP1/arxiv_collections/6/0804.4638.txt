Quantum Hall systems are a suitable theme for a case study in the general
area of nanotechnology. In particular, it is a good framework in which to
search for universal principles relevant to nanosystem modeling, and
nanosystem-specific signal processing. Recently, we have been able to construct
a PDE model of a quantum Hall system, which consists of the Schr\"odinger
equation supplemented with a special type nonlinear feedback loop. This result
stems from a novel theoretical approach, which in particular brings to the fore
the notion of quantum information. In this article we undertake to modify the
original model by substituting the dynamics based on the Dirac operator. This
leads to a model that consists of a system of three nonlinearly coupled first
order elliptic equations in the plane.
