We review results on evaluation of loss of information in quantum registers
due to their interactions with the environment. It is demonstrated that an
optimal measure of the level of quantum noise effects can be introduced via the
maximal absolute eigenvalue norm of deviation of the density matrix of a
quantum register from that of ideal, noiseless dynamics. For a semiconductor
quantum dot charge qubits interacting with acoustic phonons, explicit
expressions for this measure are derived. For a broad class of environmental
modes, this measure is shown to have the property that for small levels of
quantum noise it is additive and scales linearly with the size of the quantum
register.
