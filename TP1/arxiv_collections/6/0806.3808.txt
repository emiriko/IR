We argue that the Einstein gravity theory can be reformulated in almost
Kahler (nonsymmetric) variables with effective symplectic form and compatible
linear connection uniquely defined by a (pseudo) Riemannian metric. A class of
nonsymmetric theories of gravitation (NGT) on manifolds enabled with
nonholonomic distributions is analyzed. There are considered some conditions
when the fundamental geometric and physical objects are determined/ modified by
nonholonomic deformations in general relativity or by contributions from Ricci
flow theory and/or quantum gravity. We prove that in such NGT, for certain
classes of nonholonomic constraints, there are modelled effective Lagrangians
which do not develop instabilities. It is also elaborated a linearization
formalism for anholonomic NGT models and analyzed the stability of stationary
ellipsoidal solutions defining some nonholonomic and/or nonsymmetric
deformations of the Schwarzschild metric. We show how to construct nonholonomic
distributions which remove instabilities in NGT. Finally we conclude that
instabilities do not consist a general feature of theories of gravity with
nonsymmetric metrics but a particular property of certain models and/or classes
of unconstrained solutions.
