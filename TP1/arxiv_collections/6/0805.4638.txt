Research on a large-area, cost-effective Muon Telescope Detector has been
carried out for RHIC and for next generation detectors at future QCD Lab. We
utilize state-of-the-art multi-gap resistive plate chambers with large modules
and long readout strips in detector design \cite{MTDLDRD}. The results from
cosmic ray and beam test will be presented to address intrinsic timing and
spatial resolution for a Long-MRPC. The prototype performance of a novel muon
telescope detector at STAR will be reported, including muon identification
capability, timing and spatial resolution.
