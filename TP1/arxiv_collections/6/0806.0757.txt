In the study of ocean wave impact on structures, one often uses Froude
scaling since the dominant force is gravity. However the presence of trapped or
entrained air in the water can significantly modify wave impacts. When air is
entrained in water in the form of small bubbles, the acoustic properties in the
water change dramatically. While some work has been done to study
small-amplitude disturbances in such mixtures, little work has been done on
large disturbances in air-water mixtures. We propose a basic two-fluid model in
which both fluids share the same velocities and analyze some of its properties.
It is shown that this model can successfully mimic water wave impacts on
coastal structures. The governing equations are discretized by a second-order
finite volume method. Numerical results are presented for two examples: the dam
break problem and the drop test problem. It is shown that this basic model can
be used to study violent aerated flows, especially by providing fast
qualitative estimates.
