Thermodynamic properties of an ultracold Fermi gas in a harmonic trap are
calculated within a local density approximation, using a conserving many-body
formalism for the BCS to BEC crossover problem, which has been developed by
Haussmann et al. [Phys. Rev. A 75, 023610 (2007)]. We focus on the unitary
regime near a Feshbach resonance and determine the local density and entropy
profiles and the global entropy S(E) as a function of the total energy E. Our
results are in good agreement with both experimental data and previous
analytical and numerical results for the thermodynamics of the unitary Fermi
gas. The value of the Bertsch parameter at T=0 and the superfluid transition
temperature, however, differ appreciably. We show that, well in the superfluid
regime, removal of atoms near the cloud edge enables cooling far below
temperatures that have been reached so far.
