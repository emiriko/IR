The new version of the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics model
(UrQMD-2.3) is presented. The Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics
model (UrQMD) is a microscopic many body approach to pp, pA and AA interactions
at relativistic energies. The major updates and changes are explained and a
comparison to the previous version (UrQMD-1.3p1) in the context of the
available data is performed. The plots and numerical data tables for hadron
(i.e. $\pi$, K, p, $\bar{p}$, $\Lambda$, $\bar{\Lambda}$, $\Xi$, $\bar{\Xi}$,
$\Omega$, $\bar{\Omega}$) multiplicities, and mean transverse mass momenta,
$<m_T > -m_0$ excitation functions, transverse mass spectra and rapidity
distributions in pp and central Au+Au/Pb+Pb reactions from $E_{\rm lab}=2A $GeV
to $\sqrt{s}_{\rm NN}=200$ GeV are provided in this paper. The source code of
UrQMD-2.3 is available at http://www.th.physik.uni-frankfurt.de/~urqmd
