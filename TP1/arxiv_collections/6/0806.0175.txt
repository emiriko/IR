An assumption attributing vacuum mass energy to symmetric 'Null' fluctuation
which with equal probability either adds or subtracts, virtual planck either
particles or antiparticles leads to the following net resultant: 'Dark Energy'
virtual particle-antiparticle pairs and 'Dark Matter' real planck particles,
constantly give $\Omega_{DE}=0.7$ and $\Omega_{DM}=03$. Second assumption that
gravitational attraction propagates as particle-bridging wavelength, leads to
following estimates: Instantly, astonishingly recently and utilizing the
wavelength, the Dark Energy particles converted into nucleons(n) and the
antiparticles into radiation (ultimately CMB). Baryogenesis occurred almost
immediately in their ultra-hot clusters. Nucleonic matter declined from
$\Omega_n=0.7$ at creation, to present time $\Omega_n=0.03$. Famous
'Acceleration' is attributed to the cohesion of a supreme cluster of nucleonic
matter, giving $z/\ell=(1-\ell/\ell_H)^{2/3}$, $z,$ $\ell$ and $\ell_H$ being
respectively, redshift, luminosity and Hubble distances.
