In this paper we show how using a relativistic kinetic equation the ensuing
expression for the heat flux can be casted in the form required by Classical
Irreversible Thermodynamics. Indeed, it is linearly related to the temperature
and number density gradients and not to the acceleration as the so called
\textit{first order in the gradients} theories propose. Since the specific
expressions for the transport coefficients are irrelevant for our purposes, the
BGK form of the kinetic equation is used. Moreover, from the resulting
hydrodynamic equations it is readily seen that the equilibrium state is stable
in the presence of the spontaneous fluctuations in the transverse hydrodynamic
velocity mode of the simple relativistic fluid. The implications of this result
are thoroughly discussed.
