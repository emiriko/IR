PLGA (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)) is one of the most used biodegradable
and biocompatible materials. Nanostructured PLGA even has great application
potentials in tissue engineering. In this research, a fabrication technique for
nanostructured PLGA membrane was investigated and developed. In this novel
fabrication approach, an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) film was use as the
template ; the PLGA solution was then cast on it ; the vacuum air-extraction
process was applied to transfer the nano porous pattern from the AAO membrane
to the PLGA membrane and form nanostures on it. The cell culture experiments of
the bovine endothelial cells demonstrated that the nanostructured PLGA membrane
can double the cell growing rate. Compared to the conventional chemical-etching
process, the physical fabrication method proposed in this research not only is
simpler but also does not alter the characteristics of the PLGA. The
nanostructure of the PLGA membrane can be well controlled by the AAO temperate.
