We discuss the potential of high-energy photon collisions at the LHC for
improving our understanding of QCD and studying the physics beyond the Standard
Model. After reviewing briefly the legacy of past photoproduction experiments
at LEP and HERA, we examine the gold-plated channels proposed for a photon
collider at the ILC for their potential in a hadron collider environment. We
stress that initial-state photon interactions have indeed been observed at RHIC
and at the Tevatron. Three promising channels at the LHC are then presented in
some detail: exclusive vector-meson production, measurements of possibly
anomalous electroweak gauge-boson or top-quark couplings, and slepton
production.
