A methodology for extracting neutron direct capture rates from Coulomb
dissociation data is developed and applied to the Coulomb dissociation of 15C
on 208Pb at 68 MeV/nucleon. Full Continuum Discretized Coupled Channel
calculations are performed and an asymptotic normalization coefficient is
determined from a fit to the breakup data. Direct neutron capture calculations
using the extracted asymptotic normalization coefficient provide $(n,\gamma)$
cross sections consistent with direct measurements. Our results show that the
Coulomb Dissociation data can be reliably used for extracting the cross section
for 14C(n,g)15C if the appropriate reaction theory is used. The resulting error
bars are of comparable magnitude to those from the direct measurement. This
procedure can be used more generally to extract capture cross sections from
breakup reactions whenever the desired capture process is fully peripheral.
