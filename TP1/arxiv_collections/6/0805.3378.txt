We prove the global well-posedness and scattering for the defocusing
$H^{\frac12}$-subcritical (that is, $2<\gamma<3$) Hartree equation with low
regularity data in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\geq 3$. Precisely, we show that a unique
and global solution exists for initial data in the Sobolev space
$H^s\big(\mathbb{R}^d\big)$ with $s>4(\gamma-2)/(3\gamma-4)$, which also
scatters in both time directions. This improves the result in \cite{ChHKY},
where the global well-posedness was established for any
$s>\max\big(1/2,4(\gamma-2)/(3\gamma-4)\big)$. The new ingredients in our proof
are that we make use of an interaction Morawetz estimate for the smoothed out
solution $Iu$, instead of an interaction Morawetz estimate for the solution
$u$, and that we make careful analysis of the monotonicity property of the
multiplier $m(\xi)\cdot < \xi>^p$. As a byproduct of our proof, we obtain that
the $H^s$ norm of the solution obeys the uniform-in-time bounds.
