The Booster Neutrino Experiment (MiniBooNE) searches for numu-to-nue
oscillations using the O(1 GeV) neutrino beam produced by the Booster
synchrotron at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL). The Booster
delivers protons with 8 GeV kinetic energy (8.89 GeV/c momentum) to a beryllium
target, producing neutrinos from the decay of secondary particles in the beam
line. We describe the Monte Carlo simulation methods used to estimate the flux
of neutrinos from the beamline incident on the MiniBooNE detector for both
polarities of the focussing horn. The simulation uses the Geant4 framework for
propagating particles, accounting for electromagnetic processes and hadronic
interactions in the beamline materials, as well as the decay of particles. The
absolute double differential cross sections of pion and kaon production in the
simulation have been tuned to match external measurements, as have the hadronic
cross sections for nucleons and pions. The statistical precision of the flux
predictions is enhanced through reweighting and resampling techniques.
Systematic errors in the flux estimation have been determined by varying
parameters within their uncertainties, accounting for correlations where
appropriate.
