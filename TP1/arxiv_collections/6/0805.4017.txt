In eukaryotic genomes, nucleosomes function to compact DNA and to regulate
access to it both by simple physical occlusion and by providing the substrate
for numerous covalent epigenetic tags. While nucleosome positions in vitro are
determined by sequence alone, in vivo competition with other DNA-binding
factors and action of chromatin remodeling enzymes play a role that needs to be
quantified. We developed a biophysical model for the sequence dependence of DNA
bending energies, and validated it against a collection of in vitro free
energies of nucleosome formation and a nucleosome crystal structure; we also
successfully designed both strong and poor histone binding sequences ab initio.
For in vivo data from S.cerevisiae, the strongest positioning signal came from
the competition with other factors. Based on sequence alone, our model predicts
that functional transcription factor binding sites have a tendency to be
covered by nucleosomes, but are uncovered in vivo because functional sites
cluster within a single nucleosome footprint, making transcription factors bind
cooperatively. Similarly a weak enhancement of nucleosome binding in the TATA
region for naked DNA becomes a strong depletion when the TATA-binding protein
is included, in quantitative agreement with experiment. Predictions at specific
loci were also greatly enhanced by including competing factors. Our physically
grounded model distinguishes multiple ways in which genomic sequence can
influence nucleosome positions and thus provides an alternative explanation for
several important experimental findings.
