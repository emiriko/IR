We present hydrokinetic Lattice Boltzmann and Molecular Dynamics simulations
of capillary filling of high-wetting fluids in nano-channels, which provide
clear evidence of the formation of thin precursor films, moving ahead of the
main capillary front. The dynamics of the precursor films is found to obey the
Lucas-Washburn law as the main capillary front, z2(t) proportional to t,
although with a larger prefactor, which we find to take the same value for both
geometries under inspection. Both hydrokinetic and Molecular Dynamics
approaches indicate a precursor film thickness of the order of one tenth of the
capillary diameter. The quantitative agreement between the hydrokinetic and
atomistic methods indicates that the formation and propagation of thin
precursors can be handled at a mesoscopic/hydrokinetic level, thereby opening
the possibility of using hydrokinetic methods to space-time scales and complex
geometries of direct experimental relevance.
