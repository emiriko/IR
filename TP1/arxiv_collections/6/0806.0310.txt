Electron and phonon correlations in systems of one-dimensional electrons
coupled to phonons are studied at low temperatures by emphasizing on the effect
of electron-phonon backward scattering. It is found that the $2k_F$-wave
components of the electron density and phonon displacement field share the same
correlations. Both correlations are quasi-long-ranged for a single conducting
chain coupled to one-dimensional or three-dimensional phonons, and they are
long-ranged for repulsive electron-electron interactions for a
three-dimensional array of parallel one-dimensional conducting chains coupled
to three-dimensional phonons.
