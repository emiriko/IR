We use resonant soft x-ray scattering (RSXS) to quantify the hole
distribution in a superlattice of insulating La2CuO4 (LCO) and overdoped
La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO4 (LSCO). Despite its non-superconducting constituents, this
structure is superconducting with T_{c}=38 K. We found that the conducting
holes redistribute electronically from LSCO to the LCO layers. The LCO layers
were found to be optimally doped, suggesting they are the main drivers of
superconductivity. Our results demonstrate the utility of RSXS for separating
electronic from structural effects at oxide interfaces.
