Here we report on synthesis and characterization of a new member
LaO1-deltaNiBi in the family of novel superconductors. Though the onset
superconducting temperature ~4 K is smaller compared to 55 K that has been
achieved already in SmO1-deltaFeAs the similarities in crystalline structure,
elec-tronic properties and low-temperature electron transport features give
evidence to the common mechanism that seems to underlie the superconducting
state in lanthanum nickel oxybismuthides and oxyarsenides.
