We describe the notion of a quantum family of maps of a quantum space and
that of a quantum commutant of such a family. Quantum commutants are quantum
semigroups defined by a certain universal property. We give a few examples of
these objects acting on a classical $n$-point space and on the quantum space
underlying the algebra of two by two matrices. We show that some of the
resulting quantum semigroups are not compact quantum groups. The proof of one
result touches on an interesting problem of the theory of compact quantum
groups.
