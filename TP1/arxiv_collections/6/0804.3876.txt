We extend our previous results on local asymptotic normality (LAN) for
qubits, to quantum systems of arbitrary finite dimension $d$. LAN means that
the quantum statistical model consisting of $n$ identically prepared
$d$-dimensional systems with joint state $\rho^{\otimes n}$ converges as
$n\to\infty$ to a statistical model consisting of classical and quantum
Gaussian variables with fixed and known covariance matrix, and unknown means
related to the parameters of the density matrix $\rho$. Remarkably, the limit
model splits into a product of a classical Gaussian with mean equal to the
diagonal parameters, and independent harmonic oscillators prepared in thermal
equilibrium states displaced by an amount proportional to the off-diagonal
elements.
  As in the qubits case, LAN is the main ingredient in devising a general two
step adaptive procedure for the optimal estimation of completely unknown
$d$-dimensional quantum states. This measurement strategy shall be described in
a forthcoming paper.
