Periodically-modulated potentials in the form of light fields have previously
been applied to induce reversible phase transitions in dilute colloidal systems
with long-range interactions. Here we investigate whether similar transitions
can be induced in very dense systems, where inter-particle contacts are
important. Using microscopy we show that particles in such systems are indeed
strongly affected by modulated potentials. We discuss technical aspects
relevant to generating the light-induced potentials and to imaging
simultaneously the particles. We also consider what happens when the particle
size is comparable with the modulation wavelength. The effects of selected
modulation wavelengths as well as pure radiation pressure are illustrated.
