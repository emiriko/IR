In this study, we introduce general frame of MAny Connected Intelligent
Particles Systems (MACIPS). Connections and interconnections between particles
get a complex behavior of such merely simple system (system in
system).Contribution of natural computing, under information granulation
theory, are the main topic of this spacious skeleton. Upon this clue, we
organize different algorithms involved a few prominent intelligent computing
and approximate reasoning methods such as self organizing feature map (SOM)[9],
Neuro- Fuzzy Inference System[10], Rough Set Theory (RST)[11], collaborative
clustering, Genetic Algorithm and Ant Colony System. Upon this, we have
employed our algorithms on the several engineering systems, especially emerged
systems in Civil and Mineral processing. In other process, we investigated how
our algorithms can be taken as a linkage of government-society interaction,
where government catches various fashions of behavior: solid (absolute) or
flexible. So, transition of such society, by changing of connectivity
parameters (noise) from order to disorder is inferred. Add to this, one may
find an indirect mapping among finical systems and eventual market fluctuations
with MACIPS. In the following sections, we will mention the main topics of the
suggested proposal, briefly Details of the proposed algorithms can be found in
the references.
