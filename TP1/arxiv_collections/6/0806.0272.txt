Tomography of the two qubit density matrix shared by Alice and Bob is an
essential ingredient for guaranteeing an acceptable margin of confidentiality
during the establishment of a secure fresh key through the Quantum Key
Distribution (QKD) scheme. We show how the Singapore protocol for key
distribution is optimal from this point of view, due to the fact that it is
based on so called SIC POVM qubit tomography which allows the most accurate
full tomographic reconstruction of an unknown density matrix on the basis of a
restricted set of experimental data. We illustrate with the help of
experimental data the deep connections that exist between SIC POVM tomography
and discrete Wigner representations. We also emphasise the special role played
by Bell states in this approach and propose a new protocol for Quantum Key
Distribution during which a third party is able to concede or to deny A
POSTERIORI to the authorized users the ability to build a fresh cryptographic
key.
