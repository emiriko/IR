We consider the spin--orbital model for a magnetic system with singly
occupied but triply degenerate $t_{2g}$ orbitals coupled into a planar,
triangular lattice, as would be exemplified by NaTiO$_2$. We investigate the
ground states of the model for interactions which interpolate between the
limits of pure superexchange and purely direct exchange interactions. By
considering ordered and dimerized states at the mean--field level, and by
interpreting the results from exact diagonalization calculations on selected
finite systems, we demonstrate that orbital interactions are always frustrated,
and that orbital correlations are dictated by the spin state, manifesting an
intrinsic entanglement of these degrees of freedom. In the absence of Hund
coupling, the ground state changes from a highly resonating, dimer--based,
symmetry--restored spin and orbital liquid phase, to one based on completely
static, spin--singlet valence bonds. The generic properties of frustration and
entanglement survive even when spins and orbitals are nominally decoupled in
the ferromagnetic phases stabilized by a strong Hund coupling. By considering
the same model on other lattices, we discuss the extent to which frustration is
attributable separately to geometry and to interaction effects.
