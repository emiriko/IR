We develop a quantitative version of Aubry duality and use it to obtain
several sharp estimates for the dynamics of Schr\"odinger cocycles associated
to a non-perturbatively small analytic potential and Diophantine frequency. In
particular, we establish the full version of Eliasson's reducibility theory in
this regime (our approach actually leads to improvements even in the
perturbative regime: we are able to show, for all energies, ``almost
reducibility'' in some band of analyticity). We also prove 1/2-H\"older
continuity of the integrated density of states. For the almost Mathieu
operator, our results hold through the entire regime of sub-critical coupling
and imply also the dry version of the Ten Martini Problem for the concerned
parameters.
