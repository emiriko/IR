We study an Anderson impurity embedded in a d-wave superconductor carrying a
supercurrent. The low-energy impurity behavior is investigated by using the
numerical renormalization group method developed for arbitrary electronic bath
spectra. The results explicitly show that the local impurity state is
completely screened upon the non-zero current intensity. The impurity quantum
criticality is in accordance with the well-known Kosterlitz-Thouless
transition.
