We considered two types of string models: on the Riemmann space of string
coordinates with null torsion and on the Riemman-Cartan space of string
coordinates with constant torsion. We used the hydrodynamic approach of
Dubrovin, Novikov to integrable systems and Dubrovin solutions of WDVV
associativity equation to construct new integrable string equations of
hydrodynamic type on the torsionless Riemmann space of chiral currents in first
case. We used the invariant local chiral currents of principal chiral models
for SU(n), SO(n), SP(n) groups to construct new integrable string equations of
hydrodynamic type on the Riemmann space of the chiral primitive invariant
currents and on the chiral non-primitive Casimir operators as Hamiltonians in
second case. We also used Pohlmeyer tensor nonlocal currents to construct new
nonlocal string equation.
