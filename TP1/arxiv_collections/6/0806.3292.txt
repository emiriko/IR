We study the coinvariant ring of the complex reflection group $G(r,p,n)$ as a
module for the corresponding rational Cherednik algebra $\HH$ and its
generalized graded affine Hecke subalgebra $\mathcal{H}$. We construct a basis
consisting of non-symmetric Jack polynomials, and using this basis decompose
the coinvariant ring into irreducible modules for $\mathcal{H}$. The basis
consists of certain non-symmetric Jack polynomials, whose leading terms are the
``descent monomials'' for $G(r,p,n)$ recently studied by Adin, Brenti, and
Roichman and Bagno and Biagoli. The irreducible $\mathcal{H}$-submodules of the
coinvariant ring are their ``colored descent representations''.
