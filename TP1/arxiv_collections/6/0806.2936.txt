In type A, the q,t-Fuss -Catalan numbers can be defined as a bigraded Hilbert
series of a module associated to the symmetric group S_n. We generalize this
construction to (finite) complex reflection groups and exhibit some nice
conjectured algebraic and combinatorial properties of these polynomials in q
and t. Finally, we present an idea how these polynomials could be related to
some graded Hilbert series of modules arising in the context of rational
Cherednik algebras. This is work in progress.
