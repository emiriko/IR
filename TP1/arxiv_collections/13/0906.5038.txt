This paper presents a novel two-stage flexible dynamic decision support based
optimal threat evaluation and defensive resource scheduling algorithm for
multi-target air-borne threats. The algorithm provides flexibility and
optimality by swapping between two objective functions, i.e. the preferential
and subtractive defense strategies as and when required. To further enhance the
solution quality, it outlines and divides the critical parameters used in
Threat Evaluation and Weapon Assignment (TEWA) into three broad categories
(Triggering, Scheduling and Ranking parameters). Proposed algorithm uses a
variant of many-to-many Stable Marriage Algorithm (SMA) to solve Threat
Evaluation (TE) and Weapon Assignment (WA) problem. In TE stage, Threat Ranking
and Threat-Asset pairing is done. Stage two is based on a new flexible dynamic
weapon scheduling algorithm, allowing multiple engagements using
shoot-look-shoot strategy, to compute near-optimal solution for a range of
scenarios. Analysis part of this paper presents the strengths and weaknesses of
the proposed algorithm over an alternative greedy algorithm as applied to
different offline scenarios.
