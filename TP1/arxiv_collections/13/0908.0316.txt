Implementation of quantum information processing faces the contradicting
requirements of combining excellent isolation to avoid decoherence with the
ability to control coherent interactions in a many-body quantum system. For
example, spin degrees of freedom of electrons and nuclei provide a good quantum
memory due to their weak magnetic interactions with the environment. However,
for the same reason it is difficult to achieve controlled entanglement of spins
over distances larger than tens of nanometers. Here we propose a universal
realization of a quantum data bus for electronic spin qubits where spins are
coupled to the motion of magnetized mechanical resonators via magnetic field
gradients. Provided that the mechanical system is charged, the magnetic moments
associated with spin qubits can be effectively amplified to enable a coherent
spin-spin coupling over long distances via Coulomb forces. Our approach is
applicable to a wide class of electronic spin qubits which can be localized
near the magnetized tips and can be used for the implementation of hybrid
quantum computing architectures.
