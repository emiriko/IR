We theoretically analyze atom interferometry based on trapped ultracold
atoms, and employ optimal control theory in order to optimize number squeezing
and condensate trapping. In our simulations, we consider a setup where the
confinement potential is transformed from a single to a double well, which
allows to split the condensate. To avoid in the ensuing phase-accumulation
stage of the interferometer dephasing due to the nonlinear atom-atom
interactions, the atom number fluctuations between the two wells should be
sufficiently low. We show that low number fluctuations (high number squeezing)
can be obtained by optimized splitting protocols. Two types of solutions are
found: in the Josephson regime we find an oscillatory tunnel control and a
parametric amplification of number squeezing, while in the Fock regime
squeezing is obtained solely due to the nonlinear coupling, which is
transformed to number squeezing by peaked tunnel pulses. We study splitting and
squeezing within the frameworks of a generic two-mode model, which allows us to
study the basic physical mechanisms, and the multi-configurational time
dependent Hartree for bosons method, which allows for a microscopic modeling of
the splitting dynamics in realistic experiments. Both models give similar
results, thus highlighting the general nature of these two solution schemes. We
finally analyze our results in the context of atom interferometry.
