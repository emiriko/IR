We investigate twisted C-periodic boundary conditions in SU(N) gauge field
theory with an adjoint Higgs field. We show that with a suitable twist for even
N one can impose a non-zero magnetic charge relative to residual U(1) gauge
groups in the broken phase, thereby creating a 't Hooft-Polyakov magnetic
monopole. This makes it possible to use lattice Monte-Carlo simulations to
study the properties of these monopoles in the quantum theory.
