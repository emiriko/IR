Security protocols often use randomization to achieve probabilistic
non-determinism. This non-determinism, in turn, is used in obfuscating the
dependence of observable values on secret data. Since the correctness of
security protocols is very important, formal analysis of security protocols has
been widely studied in literature. Randomized security protocols have also been
analyzed using formal techniques such as process-calculi and probabilistic
model checking. In this paper, we consider the problem of validating
implementations of randomized protocols. Unlike previous approaches which treat
the protocol as a white-box, our approach tries to verify an implementation
provided as a black box. Our goal is to infer the secrecy guarantees provided
by a security protocol through statistical techniques. We learn the
probabilistic dependency of the observable outputs on secret inputs using
Bayesian network. This is then used to approximate the leakage of secret. In
order to evaluate the accuracy of our statistical approach, we compare our
technique with the probabilistic model checking technique on two examples:
crowds protocol and dining crypotgrapher's protocol.
