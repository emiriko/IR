Using light curves from the HATNet survey for transiting extrasolar planets
we investigate the optical broad-band photometric variability of a sample of
27,560 field K and M dwarfs selected by color and proper-motion. A total of
2120 stars exhibit potential variability, including 95 stars with eclipses and
60 stars with flares. Based on a visual inspection of these light curves and an
automated blending classification, we select 1568 stars, including 78 eclipsing
binaries, as secure variable star detections that are not obvious blends. We
estimate that a further ~26% of these stars may be blends with fainter
variables, though most of these blends are likely to be among the hotter stars
in our sample. We find that only 38 of the 1568 stars, including 5 of the
eclipsing binaries, have previously been identified as variables or are blended
with previously identified variables. One of the newly identified eclipsing
binaries is 1RXS J154727.5+450803, a known P = 3.55 day, late M-dwarf SB2
system, for which we derive preliminary estimates for the component masses and
radii of M_1 = M_2 = 0.258 +- 0.008 M_Sun and R_1 = R_2 = 0.289 +- 0.007 R_Sun.
The radii of the component stars are larger than theoretical expectations if
the system is older than ~200 Myr. The majority of the variables are heavily
spotted BY Dra-type stars for which we determine rotation periods. Using this
sample, we investigate the relations between period, color, age, and activity
measures, including optical flaring, for K and M dwarfs., finding that many of
the well-established relations for F, G and K dwarfs continue into the M dwarf
regime (Abridged).
