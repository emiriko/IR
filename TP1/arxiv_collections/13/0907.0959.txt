We present the results of the multiwavelength observation of the high
frequency-peaked BL Lac object 1ES1426+428 carried in May-June 2008 with the
KVA telescope for the optical band, the Swift and Suzaku satellites for the
X-ray band and the MAGIC telescope for the very high energy band (E>100 GeV).
The optical flux increased by 20% during the observation, while X-ray data show
that the source was in an intermediate state of activity. MAGIC did not detect
a significant gamma-ray emission from the source, so we report flux Upper Limit
at 95% CL for energies above 130 GeV. A Spectral Energy Distribution is also
obtained combining the data from the 2008 campaign with the historical ones.
