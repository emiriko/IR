The mechanisms by which adaptive phenotypes spread within an evolving
population after their emergence are understood fairly well. Much less is known
about the factors that influence the evolutionary accessibility of such
phenotypes, a pre-requisite for their emergence in a population. Here, we
investigate the influence of environmental quality on the accessibility of
adaptive phenotypes of Escherichia coli's central metabolic network. We used an
established flux-balance model of metabolism as the basis for a
genotype-phenotype map (GPM). We quantified the effects of seven qualitatively
different environments (corresponding to both carbohydrate and gluconeogenic
metabolic substrates) on the structure of this GPM. We found that the GPM has a
more rugged structure in qualitatively poorer environments, suggesting that
adaptive phenotypes could be intrinsically less accessible in such
environments. Nevertheless, on average ~74% of the genotype can be altered by
neutral drift, in the environment where the GPM is most rugged; this could
allow evolving populations to circumvent such ruggedness. Furthermore, we found
that the normalized mutual information (NMI) of genotype differences relative
to phenotype differences, which measures the GPM's capacity to transmit
information about phenotype differences, is positively correlated with
(simulation-based) estimates of the accessibility of adaptive phenotypes in
different environments. These results are consistent with the predictions of a
simple analytic theory and they suggest an intuitive information-theoretic
principle for evolutionary adaptation; adaptation could be faster in
environments where the GPM has a greater capacity to transmit information about
phenotype differences.
