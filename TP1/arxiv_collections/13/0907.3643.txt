Based on NASA satellite infrared and visible range measurements, cloud amount
ISCCP_D1 summer nighttime data, representing the tropospheric cloud activity at
Central Russia are examined over 1994-2007, and the lunar signal in the cloud
amount was extracted. The ISCCP_D1 database was used to confirm previous
results of Pertsev, Dalin and Romejko (2007) on the large importance of lunar
declination effect compared to the lunar phase effect. Since this database
provides much more information than it was used in that previous investigation,
it has become possible to separate the lunar phase effect and the lunar
declination effect in cloudiness. The relative cloud amount tends to grow with
a change of lunar phase from a quadrature to the New Moon or Full Moon and with
increasing of the lunar declination by absolute value. The both effects are
statistically significant, the second one is a little stronger.
