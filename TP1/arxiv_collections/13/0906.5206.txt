The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect has been accepted and has promoted
interdisciplinary scientific activities in modern physics. To observe the AB
effect in condensed matter physics, the whole system needs to maintain phase
coherence, in a tiny ring of the diameter 1 micrometer and at low temperatures
below 1 K. We report that AB oscillations have been measured at high
temperature 79 K by use of charge-density wave (CDW) loops in TaS3 ring
crystals. CDW condensate maintained macroscopic quantum coherence, which
extended over the ring circumference 85 micrometer. The periodicity of the
oscillations is h/2e in accuracy within a 10 percent range. The observation of
the CDW AB effect implies Frohlich superconductivity in terms of macroscopic
coherence and will provide a novel quantum interference device running at room
temperature.
