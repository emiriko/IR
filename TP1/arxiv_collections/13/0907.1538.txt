Some recently observed fractional quantum Hall states are not easily
explained in standard hierarchy/composite fermion schemes. This paper gives a
brief introduction to some wavefunctions involving non-Abelian Read-Rezayi
states with negative flux that have been proposed as candidates for these new
quantum Hall fractions.
