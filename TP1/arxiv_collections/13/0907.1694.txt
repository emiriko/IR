If detected, dark matter particles such as WIMPs and sterile neutrinos will
be the earliest relics we can study, the first coming from before Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis, an epoch from which we have no data so far. Here we discuss
how different pre-BBN cosmological models affect the properties of these
particles, and how these properties could thus allow to determine the evolution
of the Universe before BBN.
