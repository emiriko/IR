Freiman's theorem asserts, roughly speaking, if that a finite set in a
torsion-free abelian group has small doubling, then it can be efficiently
contained in (or controlled by) a generalised arithmetic progression. This was
generalised by Green and Ruzsa to arbitrary abelian groups, where the
controlling object is now a coset progression. We extend these results further
to solvable groups of bounded derived length, in which the coset progressions
are replaced by the more complicated notion of a "coset nilprogression". As one
consequence of this result, any subset of such a solvable group of small
doubling is is controlled by a set whose iterated products grow polynomially,
and which are contained inside a virtually nilpotent group. As another
application we establish a strengthening of the Milnor-Wolf theorem that all
solvable groups of polynomial growth are virtually nilpotent, in which only one
large ball needs to be of polynomial size. This result complements recent work
of Breulliard-Green, Fisher-Katz-Peng, and Sanders.
