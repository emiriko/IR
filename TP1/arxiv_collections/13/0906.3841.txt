Stock prices are known to exhibit non-Gaussian dynamics, and there is much
interest in understanding the origin of this behavior. Here, we present a model
that explains the shape and scaling of the distribution of intraday stock price
fluctuations (called intraday returns) and verify the model using a large
database for several stocks traded on the London Stock Exchange. We provide
evidence that the return distribution for these stocks is non-Gaussian and
similar in shape, and that the distribution appears stable over intraday time
scales. We explain these results by assuming the volatility of returns is
constant intraday, but varies over longer periods such that its inverse square
follows a gamma distribution. This produces returns that are Student
distributed for intraday time scales. The predicted results show excellent
agreement with the data for all stocks in our study and over all regions of the
return distribution.
