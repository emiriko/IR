The eigenvalues of Wilson loop matrices in SU(N) gauge theories in dimensions
2,3,4 at infinite N are supported on a small arc on the unit circle centered at
$z=1$ for small loops, but expand to the entire unit circle for large loops.
These two regimes are separated by a large N phase transition whose universal
properties are the same in d=2,3 and 4. Hopefully, this large N universality
could be exploited to bridge traditional perturbation theory calculations,
valid for small loops, with effective string calculations for large loops. A
concrete case of such a calculation would obtain analytically an estimate of
the large N string tension in terms of the perturbative scale Lambda(QCD,N).
