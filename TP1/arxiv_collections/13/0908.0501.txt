Zipf's law is shown to arise as the variational solution of a problem
formulated in Fisher's terms. An appropriate minimization process involving
Fisher information and scale-invariance yields this universal rank
distribution. As an example we show that the number of citations found in the
most referenced physics journals follows this law.
