In models with flavour symmetries added to the gauge group of the Standard
Model the CP-violating asymmetry necessary for leptogenesis may be related with
low-energy parameters. A particular case of interest is when the flavour
symmetry produces exact Tri-Bimaximal lepton mixing leading to a vanishing
CP-violating asymmetry. In this paper we present a model-independent discussion
that confirms this always occurs for unflavoured leptogenesis in type I see-saw
scenarios, noting however that Tri-Bimaximal mixing does not imply a vanishing
asymmetry in general scenarios where there is interplay between type I and
other see-saws. We also consider a specific model where the exact Tri-Bimaximal
mixing is lifted by corrections that can be parametrised by a small number of
degrees of freedom and analyse in detail the existing link between low and
high-energy parameters - focusing on how the deviations from Tri-Bimaximal are
connected to the parameters governing leptogenesis.
