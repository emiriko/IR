Scheideler has shown that peer-to-peer overlays networks can only survive
Byzantine attacks if malicious nodes are not able to predict what is going to
be the topology of the network for a given sequence of join and leave
operations. In this paper we investigate adversarial strategies by following
specific games. Our analysis demonstrates first that an adversary can very
quickly subvert DHT-based overlays by simply never triggering leave operations.
We then show that when all nodes (honest and malicious ones) are imposed on a
limited lifetime, the system eventually reaches a stationary regime where the
ratio of polluted clusters is bounded, independently from the initial amount of
corruption in the system.
