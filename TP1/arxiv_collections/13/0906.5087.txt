The gravitational hydrodynamics of the primordial plasma with neutrino hot
dark matter is considered as a challenge to the bottom-up cold dark matter
paradigm. Viscosity and turbulence induce a top-down fragmentation scenario
before and at decoupling. The first step is the creation of voids in the
plasma, which expand to 37 Mpc on the average now. The remaining matter clumps
turn into galaxy clusters. Turbulence produced at expanding void boundaries
causes a linear morphology of 3 kpc fragmenting protogalaxies along vortex
lines. At decoupling galaxies and proto-globular star clusters arise; the
latter constitute the galactic dark matter halos and consist themselves of
earth-mass H-He planets. Frozen planets are observed in microlensing and
white-dwarf-heated ones in planetary nebulae. The approach also explains the
Tully-Fisher and Faber-Jackson relations, and cosmic microwave temperature
fluctuations of micro-Kelvins.
