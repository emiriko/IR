The cosmic muon generator CMSCGEN is based on a parametrization of the
differential muon flux at ground level, as obtained from the air shower
simulation program CORSIKA. We present the underlying ansatz for this
parameterization and provide an approximation of the momentum and angular
distributions in terms of simple polynomials, in the momentum range 3 to 3000
GeV.
