We propose a computational method to simulate anomalous self-diffusion in a
simple liquid. The method is based on a molecular dynamics simulation on which
we impose the following two conditions: firstly, the inter-particle interaction
is described by a soft-core potential and secondly, the system is forced out of
equilibrium. The latter can be achieved by subjecting the system to changes in
the length scale at intermittent times. In many respects, our simulation system
bears resemblance to slowly driven sandpile models displaying self-organised
criticality. We find non-Gaussian single time step displacement distributions
during the out-of-equilibrium time periods of the simulation.
