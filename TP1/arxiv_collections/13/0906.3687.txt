We show that tunneling and localization properties of interacting ultracold
atoms in an optical lattice can be controlled by adiabatically turning on a
fast oscillatory force even in the presence of disorder. Our calculations are
based on the exact solution of the time-dependent Schroedinger equation, using
the Floquet formalism. Implications of our findings for larger systems and the
possibility of controlling the phase diagram of disordered-interacting bosonic
systems are discussed.
