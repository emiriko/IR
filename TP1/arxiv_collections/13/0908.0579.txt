A new method is described for constructing initial data for a binary
neutron-star (BNS) system in quasi-equilibrium circular orbit. Two formulations
for non-conformally flat data, waveless (WL) and near-zone helically symmetric
(NHS), are introduced; in each formulation, the Einstein-Euler system, written
in 3+1 form on an asymptotically flat spacelike hypersurface, is exactly solved
for all metric components, including the spatially non-conformally flat
potentials, and for irrotational flow. A numerical method applicable to both
formulations is explained with an emphasis on the imposition of a spatial gauge
condition. Results are shown for solution sequences of irrotational BNS with
matter approximated by parametrized equations of state that use a few segments
of polytropic equations of state. The binding energy and total angular momentum
of solution sequences computed within the conformally flat --
Isenberg-Wilson-Mathews (IWM) -- formulation are closer to those of the third
post-Newtonian (3PN) two point particles up to the closest orbits, for the more
compact stars, whereas sequences resulting from the WL/NHS formulations deviate
from the 3PN curve even more for the sequences with larger compactness. We
think it likely that this correction reflects an overestimation in the IWM
formulation as well as in the 3PN formula, by $\sim 1$ cycle in the
gravitational wave phase during the last several orbits. The work suggests that
imposing spatial conformal flatness results in an underestimate of the
quadrupole deformation of the components of binary neutron-star systems in the
last few orbits prior to merger.
