In this paper we consider a system consisting of a two-level atom in an
excited state interacting with two modes of a radiation field prepared
initially in $l$-photon coherent states. This system is described by two-mode
multiphoton (, i.e., $k_1, k_2$) Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM). For this system
we investigate the occurrence of the revival-collapse phenomenon (RCP) in the
evolution of the single-mode, two-mode, sum and difference quadrature
squeezing. We show that there is a class of states for which all these types of
squeezing exhibit RCP similar to that involved in the corresponding atomic
inversion. Also we show numerically that the single-mode squeezing of the first
mode for $(k_1,k_2)=(3,1)$ provides RCP similar to that of the atomic inversion
of the case $(k_1,k_2)=(1,1)$, however, sum and difference squeezing give
partial information on that case. Moreover, we show that single-mode, two-mode
and sum squeezing for the case $(k_1,k_2)=(2,2)$ provide information on the
atomic inversion of the single-mode two-photon JCM. We derive the rescaled
squeezing factors giving accurate information on the atomic inversion for all
cases. The consequences of these results are that the homodyne and heterodyne
detectors can be used to detect the RCP for the two-mode JCM.
