We report on recent progress towards quantitative phenomenology of small x
resummation of deep-inelastic structure functions. We compute small x resummed
K-factors with realistic PDFs and estimate their impact in the HERA kinematical
region. These K-factors, which match smoothly to the fixed order NLO results,
approximately reproduce the effect of a small x resummed PDF analysis. Typical
corrections are found to be of the same order as the NNLO ones, that is, a few
percent, but with opposite sign. These results imply that resummation
corrections could be relevant for a global PDF analysis, especially with the
very precise combined HERA dataset.
