This is the first attempt to model the kinematics of a CME launch and the
resulting EUV dimming quantitatively with a self-consistent model. Our 4D-model
assumes self-similar expansion of a spherical CME geometry that consists of a
CME front with density compression and a cavity with density rarefaction,
satisfying mass conservation of the total CME and swept-up corona. The model
contains 14 free parameters and is fitted to the 2008 March 25 CME event
observed with STEREO/A and B. Our model is able to reproduce the observed CME
expansion and related EUV dimming during the initial phase from 18:30 UT to
19:00 UT. The CME kinematics can be characterized by a constant acceleration
(i.e., a constant magnetic driving force). While the observations of EUVI/A are
consistent with a spherical bubble geometry, we detect significant asymmetries
and density inhomogeneities with EUVI/B. This new forward-modeling method
demonstrates how the observed EUV dimming can be used to model physical
parameters of the CME source region, the CME geometry, and CME kinematics.
