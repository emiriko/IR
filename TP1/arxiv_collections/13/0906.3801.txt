In this talk I report on recent work related to the dynamical generation of
baryonic resonances, some made up from pseudoscalar meson-baryon, others from
vector meson-baryon and a third type from two meson-one baryon systems. We can
establish a correspondence with known baryonic resonances, reinforcing
conclusions previously drawn and bringing new light on the nature of some
baryonic resonances of higher mass.
