Dynamics of biological-ecological systems is strongly depending on spatial
dimensions. Most of powerful simulators in ecology take into account for system
spatiality thus embedding stochastic processes. Due to the difficulty of
researching particular trajectories, biologists and computer scientists aim at
predicting the most probable trajectories of systems under study. Doing that,
they considerably reduce computation times. However, because of the largeness
of space, the execution time remains usually polynomial in time. In order to
reduce execution times we propose an activatability-based search cycle through
the process space. This cycle eliminates the redundant processes on a
statistical basis (Generalized Linear Model), and converges to the minimal
number of processes required to match simulation objectives.
