The mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) will be directly
scrutinized soon at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We analyze the LHC
potential to look for new vector bosons associated with the EWSB sector. We
present a possible model independent approach to search for these new spin--1
resonances. We show that the analyses of the processes pp --> l^+ l^- Emiss_T,
l^\pm j j Emiss_T, l^\pm l^+ l^- Emiss_T, and l^+ l^- j j (with l=e or \mu and
j=jet) have a large reach at the LHC and can lead to the discovery or exclusion
of many EWSB scenarios such as Higgsless models.
