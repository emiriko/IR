We study the LHC signature of the minimal supersymmetric standard model with
non-universal sfermion masses. In the model, soft masses of gauginos and the
3rd generation of 10 of SU(5) are around the weak scale, while other sfermion
soft mass is universal and around a few TeV. Such sfermion mass spectrum is
motivated not only from flavor, CP and naturalness constraints but also from
E_6 grand unified model with non-Abelian horizontal (flavor) symmetry. The
characteristic signature of the model at the LHC is the dominance of the events
with 4 b partons in the final state together with high rate of mildly boosted
top quark arising from gluino decay. The prominent high p_T jet also arises
from squark decay. We show it is possible to find the characteristic signature
in the early stage of the LHC. The discrimination of our scenario from some
CMSSM model points with similar signature may be possible with large integrated
luminosity. The result of sparticle mass measurement using exclusive channel
with the help of hemisphere analysis, and inclusive measurement of gluino and
squark masses using M_{T2} and M_{T2}^{min} in some representative model points
are presented.
