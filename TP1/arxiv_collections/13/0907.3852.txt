Magnetic spiral structures can exhibit ferroelectric moments as recently
demonstrated in various multiferroic materials. In such cases the helicity of
the magnetic spiral is directly correlated with the direction of the
ferroelectric moment and measurement of the helicity of magnetic structures is
of current interest. Soft x-ray resonant diffraction is particularly
advantageous because it combines element selectivity with a large magnetic
cross-section. We calculate the polarization dependence of the resonant
magnetic x-ray cross-section (electric dipole transition) for the basal plane
magnetic spiral in hexaferrite Ba0.8Sr1.2Zn2Fe12O22 and deduce its domain
population using circular polarized incident radiation. We demonstrate there is
a direct correlation between the diffracted radiation and the helicity of the
magnetic spiral.
