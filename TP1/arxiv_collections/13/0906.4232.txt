Direct searches for Dark Matter are experiment dedicated to the observation
of the energetic recoiling ions produced by the scattering of WIMP particles
from our galactic halo on terrestrial targets. The status and prospects of some
currently running experiments are presented, together with new preliminary
results of the experiments EDELWEISS-II.
