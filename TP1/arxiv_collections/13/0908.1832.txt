Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most powerful explosions in the universe and
probe physics under extreme conditions. GRBs divide into two classes, of short
and long duration, thought to originate from different types of progenitor
systems. The physics of their gamma-ray emission is still poorly known, over 40
years after their discovery, but may be probed by their highest-energy photons.
Here we report the first detection of high-energy emission from a short GRB
with measured redshift, GRB 090510, using the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.
We detect for the first time a GRB prompt spectrum with a significant deviation
from the Band function. This can be interpreted as two distinct spectral
components, which challenge the prevailing gamma-ray emission mechanism:
synchrotron - synchrotron self-Compton. The detection of a 31 GeV photon during
the first second sets the highest lower limit on a GRB outflow Lorentz factor,
of >1200, suggesting that the outflows powering short GRBs are at least as
highly relativistic as those powering long GRBs. Even more importantly, this
photon sets limits on a possible linear energy dependence of the propagation
speed of photons (Lorentz-invariance violation) requiring for the first time a
quantum-gravity mass scale significantly above the Planck mass.
