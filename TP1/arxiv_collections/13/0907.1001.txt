MAGIC is currently the most suitable instrument to perform observations of
the prompt an early afterglow emission from Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) at energies
above 25 GeV. The instrument is designed to have the lowest possible energy
threshold and fastest reaction time to GRB Coordinates Network (GCN) alerts.
The MAGIC-I telescope started to follow-up GCN alerts in the beginning of 2005.
Since then, more than 50 GRB candidates were observed. Just now MAGIC-II, the
second telescope has started to operate. Both telescopes together will have a
factor of three better sensitivity.
