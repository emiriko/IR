Boolean networks have been successfully used in modelling gene regulatory
networks. In this paper we propose a reduction method that reduces the
complexity of a Boolean network but keeps dynamical properties and topological
features and hence it makes the analysis easier; as a result, it allows for a
better understanding of the role of network topology on the dynamics. In
particular, we use the reduction method to study steady states of Boolean
models.
