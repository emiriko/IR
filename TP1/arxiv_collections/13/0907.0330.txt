A phenomenological model is developed to explain a new set of detailed
torsional oscillator data for hcp 4He. The model is based on Anderson's idea of
the vortex fluid (vortex tangle) in solid 4He. Utilizing a well-studied
treatment of dynamics of quantized vortices we describe how the "local
superfluid component" is involved in rotation (torsional oscillation) via a
polaried vortices tangle. The polarization in the tangle appears both due to
aligning the remnant or thermal vortices and due to penetration of additional
vortices into volume. Both are supposed to occur in a relaxation manner, and
the inverse full relaxation time tau^-1 is the sum of them. One of them is
found to change linearly with respect to the rim velocity Vac. The developed
approach explains the behavior of both NLRS and Delta Q^-1 seen in the
experiment. We reproduce not only the unique Vac dependence, but also obtain
new information about the vortices tangle, for example, a divergence in tau at
extrapolated T ~ 30 mK.
