"Look before you leap"; "a stitch in time saves nine"; "more haste, less
speed". Many proverbs declare the wisdom of planning before doing. We suggest
how to apply this to Excel, by explaining and specifying spreadsheets before
coding them, so there will always be documentation for auditors and maintenance
programmers. The specification method uses "pseudo-code": code that, for
precision and conciseness, resembles a programming language, but is not
executable. It is, however, based on the notation used by our Excelsior
spreadsheet generator, which is executable. This paper is structured as a
tutorial, in which we develop a simple cash-flow and loans spreadsheet.
