We study the low-energy theorems of QCD from the point of view of the dual
AdS/QCD models and demonstrate that these models are compatible with the
theorems in the chiral limit, i.e. the arising expressions have the same
analytical behavior at the pole when the quark mass tends to zero. Low-energy
theorems are formulated in terms of the spectral density of the Dirac operator.
In order to calculate the spectral density in the dual holographic models we
express it in terms of a partition function of a QCD-like theory.
