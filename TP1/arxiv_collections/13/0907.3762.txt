Studying crystal structures of superprotonic phases of alkali metal hydrogen
sulfates and selenates, a very unusual phenomenon has been revealed.
Dynamically disordered hydrogen atoms with low position occupancies are clearly
seen in corresponding electron density maps. To explain this effect, an idea
about a new type of twinning, dynamic twinning, was proposed and discussed.
