We review what is known about the contributions to the final entropy from the
different stages of a relativistic nuclear collision, including recent results
on the decoherence entropy and the entropy produced during the hydrodynamic
phase by viscous effects. We then present a general framework, based on the
Husimi distribution function, for the calculation of entropy growth in quantum
field theories, which is applicable to the earliest ("glasma") phase of the
collision during which most of the entropy is generated. The entropy calculated
from the Husimi distribution exhibits linear growth when the quantum field
contains unstable modes and is asymptotically equal to the Kolmogorov-Sina\"i
(KS) entropy. We outline how the approach can be used to investigate the
problem of entropy production in a relativistic heavy-ion reaction from first
principles.
