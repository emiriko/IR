Using non-local chiral quark model with simple pole ansatz for mass
dependence on momentum and non-local currents satisfying Ward-Takahashi
identities, we calculate pion to photon transition distribution amplitudes and
relevant form factors. For vector amplitude we recover correct normalization
fixed by the axial anomaly. We find that due to the non-locality in the vector
current, the value of axial form factor at zero momentum transfer is lowered
with respect to the vector form factor. Such behaviour - consistent with
experiment - is not seen in the local models. Where possible we compare our
results to the experimental data.
