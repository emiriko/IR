In a recent Letter we introduced Hellmann-Feynman operator sampling in
diffusion Monte Carlo calculations. Here we derive, by evaluating the second
derivative of the total energy, an efficient method for the calculation of the
static density-response function of a many-electron system. Our analysis of the
effect of the nodes suggests that correlation is described correctly and we
find that the effect of the nodes can be dealt with.
