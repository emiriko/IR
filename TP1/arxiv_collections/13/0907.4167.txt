We compute the binding energy of neutron-rich oxygen isotopes and employ the
coupled-cluster method and chiral nucleon-nucleon interactions at
next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order with two different cutoffs. We obtain
rather well-converged results in model spaces consisting of up to 21 oscillator
shells. For interactions with a momentum cutoff of 500 MeV, we find that 28O is
stable with respect to 24O, while calculations with a momentum cutoff of 600
MeV result in a slightly unbound 28O. The theoretical error estimates due to
the omission of the three-nucleon forces and the truncation of excitations
beyond three-particle-three-hole clusters indicate that the stability of 28O
cannot be ruled out from ab-initio calculations, and that three-nucleon forces
and continuum effects play the dominant role in deciding this question.
