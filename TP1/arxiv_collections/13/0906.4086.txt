In many situations, the statistical properties of wave systems with chaotic
classical limits are well-described by random matrix theory. However,
applications of random matrix theory to scattering problems require
introduction of system specific information into the statistical model, such as
the introduction of the average scattering matrix in the Poisson kernel. Here
it is shown that the average impedance matrix, which also characterizes the
system-specific properties, can be expressed in terms of classical trajectories
that travel between ports and thus can be calculated semiclassically.
Theoretical results are compared with numerical solutions for a model
wave-chaotic system.
