Graphene consists of single or few layers of crystalline ordered carbon
atoms. Its visibility on oxidized silicon (Si/SiO\_2) enabled its discovery and
spawned numerous studies of its unique electronic properties. The combination
of graphene with the equally unique electronic material gallium arsenide (GaAs)
has up to now lacked such easy visibility. Here we demonstrate that a
deliberately tailored GaAs/AlAs (aluminum arsenide) multi-layer structure makes
graphene just as visible on GaAs as on Si/SiO\_2. We show that standard
microscope images of exfoliated graphite on GaAs/AlAs suffice to identify
mono-, bi-, and multi-layers of graphene. Raman data confirm our results.
