We consider P systems with a linear membrane structure working on objects
over a unary alphabet using sets of rules resembling homomorphisms. Such a
restricted variant of P systems allows for a unique minimal representation of
the generated unary language and in that way for an effective solution of the
equivalence problem. Moreover, we examine the descriptional complexity of unary
P systems with respect to the number of membranes.
