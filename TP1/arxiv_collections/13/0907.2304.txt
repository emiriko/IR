Emission processes including $\alpha$-decay, heavy cluster decays, proton and
di-proton emission are analyzed in terms of the well known factorisation
between the penetrability and reduced width. By using a shifted harmonic
oscilator plus Coulomb cluster-daughter interaction it is possible to derive a
linear relation between the logarithm of the reduced width squared and the
fragmentation potential, defined as the difference between the Coulomb barrier
and Q-value. This relation is fulfilled with a good accuracy for transitions
between ground states, as well as for most $\alpha$-decays to low lying $2^+$
excited states. The well known Viola-Seaborg rule, connecting half lives with
the Coulomb parameter and the product between fragment charge numbers, as well
as the Blendowke scalling rule connecting the spectroscopic factor with the
mass number of the emitted cluster, can be easily understood in terms of the
fragmentation potential. It is shown that the recently evidenced two regions in
the dependence of reduced proton half-lives versus the Coulomb parameter are
directly connected with the corresponding regions of the fragmentation
potential.
