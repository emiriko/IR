We derive the exact equations of motion (in Newtonian, F=ma, form) for test
masses in Schwarzschild and Gullstrand-Painlev\'e coordinates. These equations
of motion are simpler than the usual geodesic equations obtained from
Christoffel tensors in that the affine parameter is eliminated. The various
terms can be compared against tests of gravity. In force form, gravity can be
interpreted as resulting from a flux of superluminal particles (gravitons). We
show that the first order relativistic correction to Newton's gravity results
from a two graviton interaction.
