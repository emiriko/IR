The multipole analysis investigates the arrival directions of registered
neutrino events in AMANDA-II by a spherical harmonics expansion. The expansion
of the expected atmospheric neutrino distribution returns a characteristic set
of expansion coefficients. This characteristic spectrum of expansion
coefficients can be compared with the expansion coefficients of the
experimental data. As atmospheric neutrinos are the dominant background of the
search for extraterrestrial neutrinos, the agreement of experimental data and
the atmospheric prediction can give evidence for physical neutrino sources or
systematic uncertainties of the detector. Astrophysical neutrino signals were
simulated and it was shown that they influence the expansion coefficients in a
characteristic way. Those simulations are used to analyze deviations between
experimental data and Monte Carlo simulations with regard to potential physical
reasons. The analysis method was applied on the AMANDA-II neutrino sample
measured between 2000 and 2006 and results are presented.
