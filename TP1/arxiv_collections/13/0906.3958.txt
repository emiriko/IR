Super Mario is imprisoned by a demon in a finite potential well. He can
escape from the well with the help of a flight of magic stairs floating in the
space. However, the hateful demon may occasionally check his status. At that
time, he has to make a judgement of either jumping to the inside ground
immediately in order to avoid the discovery of his escape intention, or
speeding up his escape process. Therefore, if the demon checks him too
frequently such that there is no probability for him to reach the top of the
barrier, he will be always inside the well, then a classical Zeno effect
occurs. On the other hand, if the time interval between two subsequent checks
is large enough such that he has a higher probability of being beyond the
demon's controllable range already, then the demon's check actually speeds up
his escape and a classical anti-Zeno effect takes place.
