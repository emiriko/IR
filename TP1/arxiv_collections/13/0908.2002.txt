The purpose of this note is to make a brief analysis of the physical
principles upon which two methods for relating the mass of an object to
fundamental physical constants are based. The two methods are, namely, the watt
balance method, and a still untested experimental technique based upon a
superconductor electromechanical oscillator. We show that both these methods
are governed by similar equations.
