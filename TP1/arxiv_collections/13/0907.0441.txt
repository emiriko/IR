The ATLAS detector is one of the experiments at the LHC that will detect
high-energy proton collisions at 14 TeV. The commissioning of the detector has
started already in 2005 in parallel to the detector installation and is still
in progress. The data taken so far corresponds to noise runs, cosmic muon
events and beam background events from single beam in September 2008. We
present the current status of the detector and performance results obtained
during commissioning.
