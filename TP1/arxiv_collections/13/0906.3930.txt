The number of web services increased vastly in the last years. Various
providers offer web services with the same functionality, so for web service
consumers it is getting more complicated to select the web service, which best
fits their requirements. That is why a lot of the research efforts point to
discover semantic means for describing web services taking into account not
only functional characteristics of services, but also the quality of service
(QoS) properties such as availability, reliability, response time, trust, etc.
This motivated us to research current approaches presenting complete solutions
for QoS enabled web service description, publication and discovery. In this
paper we present comparative analysis of these approaches according to their
common principals. Based on such analysis we extract the essential aspects from
them and propose a pattern for the development of QoS-aware service-oriented
architectures.
