A well-established, silver fishnet design has been further miniaturized to
function as a negative-index material at the shortest wavelength to date. By
studying the transmittance, reflectance, and corresponding numerical
simulations of the sample, we report in this paper a negative refractive index
of -0.25 at the yellow-light wavelength of 580 nm.
