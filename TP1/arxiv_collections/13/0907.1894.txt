We argue that the existence of Dark Matter (DM) is a possible consequence of
GUT symmetry breaking. In GUTs like SO(10), discrete Z_2 matter parity
(-1)^{3(B-L)} survives despite of broken B-L, and group theory uniquely
determines that the only possible Z_2-odd matter multiplets belong to
representation 16. We construct the minimal non-SUSY SO(10) model containing
one scalar 16 for DM and study its predictions below M_{G}. We find that EWSB
occurs radiatively due to DM couplings to the SM Higgs boson. For thermal relic
DM the mass range M_{DM}\sim (0.1-1) TeV is predicted by model perturbativity
up to M_{G}. For M_{DM}\sim (1) TeV to explain the observed cosmic ray
anomalies with DM decays, there exists a lower bound on the spin-independent
direct detection cross section within the reach of planned experiments.
