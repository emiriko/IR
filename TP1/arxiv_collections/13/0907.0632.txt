We study a diffusive superconductor - normal metal - superconductor (SNS)
junction in an external magnetic field. In the limit of a long junction, we
find that the form of the dependence of the Josephson current on the field and
on the length of the junction depends on the ratio between the junction width
and the length associated with the magnetic field. A certain critical ratio
between these two length scales separates two different regimes. In narrow
junctions, the critical current exhibits a pure decay as a function of the
junction length or of the magnetic field. In wide junctions, the critical
current exhibits damped oscillations as a function of the same parameters. This
damped oscillating behavior differs from the Fraunhofer pattern typical for
short or tunnel junctions. In wide and long junctions, superconducting pair
correlations and supercurrent are localized along the edges of the junction.
