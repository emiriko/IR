We consider various generalisations of the string class of a loop group
bundle. The string class is the obstruction to lifting a bundle whose structure
group is the loop group $LG$ to one whose structure group is the Kac-Moody
central extension of the loop group.
  We develop a notion of higher string classes for bundles whose structure
group is the group of based loops, $\Omega G$. In particular, we give a formula
for characteristic classes in odd dimensions for such bundles which are
associated to characteristic classes for $G$-bundles in the same way that the
string class is related to the first Pontrjagyn class of a certain $G$-bundle
associated to the loop group bundle in question. This provides us with a theory
of characteristic classes for $\Omega G$-bundles analogous to Chern-Weil theory
in finite dimensions. This also gives us a geometric interpretation of the
well-known transgression map $H^{2k}(BG) \to H^{2k-1}(G).$
  We also consider the obstruction to lifting a bundle whose structure group is
not the loop group but the semi-direct product of the loop group with the
circle, $LG \rtimes S^1$. We review the theory of bundle gerbes and their
application to central extensions and lifting problems and use these methods to
obtain an explicit expression for the de Rham representative of the obstruction
to lifting such a bundle. We also relate this to a generalisation of the
so-called `caloron correspondence' (which relates $LG$-bundles over $M$ to
$G$-bundles over $M \times S^1$) to a correspondence which relates $LG \rtimes
S^1$-bundles over $M$ to $G$-bundles over $S^1$-bundles over $M$.
