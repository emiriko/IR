We study a chain of non-linear, interacting spins driven by a static and a
time-dependent magnetic field. The aim is to identify the conditions for the
locally and temporally controlled spin switching. Analytical and full numerical
calculations show the possibility of stochastic control if the underlying
semi-classical dynamics is chaotic. This is achievable by tuning the external
field parameters according to the method described in this paper. We show
analytically for a finite spin chain that Arnold diffusion is the underlying
mechanism for the present stochastic control. Quantum mechanically we consider
the regime where the classical dynamics is regular or chaotic. For the latter
we utilize the random matrix theory. The efficiency and the stability of the
non-equilibrium quantum spin-states are quantified by the time-dependence of
the Bargmann angle related to the geometric phases of the states.
