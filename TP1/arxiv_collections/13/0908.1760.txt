During the last few years, several studies have proposed the existence of a
threshold separating classical from quantum behavior of objects that is
dependent on the size and mass of an object as well as being dependent on
certain properties usually associated with the universe as a whole. Here, we
reexamine the results of these studies and recast the threshold criteria in
terms of a critical threshold value for the moments of inertia of physical
objects. Physical objects having moments of inertia above this critical
threshold value would be expected to behave necessarily in a classical manner
in terms of their center of mass motion as entire objects, while physical
objects having moments of inertia lower than this threshold value could exhibit
quantum behavior unless brought into classicality by other effects. A
comparison with observed values of moments of inertia is presented, and the
moment of inertia is suggested as a classifying parameter for examination of
the quantum versus classical behavior of objects in the mesoscale domain.
