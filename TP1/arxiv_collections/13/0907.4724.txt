The claim in ref.1 [M. Conte et al: "Stern-Gerlach Force on a Precessing
Magnetic Moment", Proceedings of PAC07
(http://cern.ch/AccelConf/p07/PAPER/THPAS105.pdf)] that the Stern-Gerlach force
on a charged particle with a magnetic moment causes a change in longitudinal
momentum proportional to gamma-squared when it traverses a specially configured
localized electromagnetic field, contradicts the prediction based on the
established interaction Lagrangian. It is shown that extending the calculation
in ref. 1 to include the entire spin motion eliminates the gamma-squared term
and thus the inconsistency.
