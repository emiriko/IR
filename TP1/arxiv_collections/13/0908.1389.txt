We present X-ray point source catalogs obtained from archival Swift
observations that have partially or fully covered the 95% confidence error
contour of unidentified Fermi sources. In total, 21 out of 37 unidentified
Fermi sources have been observed by the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) on board the
Swift observatory. Basic properties such as position, positional errors, count
rates, and hardness ratios are derived for a total of 18 X-ray point sources
found in the sample. From these detections, we discuss potential counterparts
to 0FGL J0910.2-5044, 0FGL J1045.6-5937, 0FGL J1115.8-6108, 0FGL J1231.5-1410,
0FGL J1326.6-5302, 0FGL J1604.0-4904, and 0FGL J1805.3-2138. The catalog will
assist observers planning future programs to identify 0FGL sources without
obvious counterparts.
