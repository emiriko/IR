Gamow-Teller and dipole transitions to final states in 13B were studied via
the 13C(t,3He) reaction at Et = 115 AMeV. Besides the strong Gamow-Teller
transition to the 13B ground state, a weaker Gamow-Teller transition to a state
at 3.6 MeV was found. This state was assigned a spin-parity of 3/2- by
comparison with shell-model calculations using the WBP and WBT interactions
which were modified to allow for mixing between nhw and (n+2)hw configurations.
This assignment agrees with a recent result from a lifetime measurement of
excited states in 13B. The shell-model calculations also explained the
relatively large spectroscopic strength measured for a low-lying 1/2+ state at
4.83 MeV in 13B. The cross sections for dipole transitions up to Ex(13B)= 20
MeV excited via the 13C(t,3He) reaction were also compared with the shell-model
calculations. The theoretical cross sections exceeded the data by a factor of
about 1.8, which might indicate that the dipole excitations are "quenched".
Uncertainties in the reaction calculations complicate that interpretation.
