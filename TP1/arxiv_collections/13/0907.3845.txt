We consider the phase space for a system of $n$ identical qudits (each one of
dimension $d$, with $d$ a primer number) as a grid of $d^{n} \times d^{n}$
points and use the finite field $GF(d^{n})$ to label the corresponding axes.
The associated displacement operators permit to define $s$-parametrized
quasidistribution functions in this grid, with properties analogous to their
continuous counterparts. These displacements allow also for the construction of
finite coherent states, once a fiducial state is fixed. We take this reference
as one eigenstate of the discrete Fourier transform and study the factorization
properties of the resulting coherent states. We extend these ideas to include
discrete squeezed states, and show their intriguing relation with entangled
states between different qudits.
