A simple proof is given that the probabilities of observations in a large
universe are not given directly by Born's rule as the expectation values of
projection operators in a global quantum state of the entire universe. An
alternative procedure is proposed for constructing an averaged density matrix
for a random small region of the universe and then calculating observational
probabilities indirectly by Born's rule as conditional probabilities,
conditioned upon the existence of an observation.
