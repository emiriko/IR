The MAGIC collaboration reports the detection of the blazar S5 0716+714
z=0.31+-0.08 in very high energy gamma-rays. The observations were performed in
November 2007 and in April 2008, and were triggered by the KVA telescope due to
the high optical state of the object. An overall significance of the signal
accounts to S =5.8sigma for 13.1 hours of data. Most of the signal S = 6.9sigma
comes from the April 2008 data sample during a higher optical state of the
object suggesting a possible correlation between the VHE gamma-ray and optical
emissions. The differential energy spectrum of the 2008 data sample follows a
power law with a photon index of Gamma = 3.45+-0.54_(stat)+-0.2_(syst), and the
integral flux above 400GeV is at the level of
7.5+-2.2_(stat)+-2.3_(syst)*10^-12 cm^-2 s^-1 corresponding to a 9% Crab Nebula
flux. Modeling of the broad band spectral energy distribution indicates that a
structured jet model appears to be more promising in describing the available
data than a simple one zone synchrotron self-Compton model.
