We discuss certain types of cyclic and nearly cyclic interactions among N
"point"-agents in the plane, leading to formations of interesting limiting
geometric configurations. Cyclic pursuit and local averaging interactions have
been analyzed in the context of multi-agent gathering. In this paper, we
consider some nearly cyclic interactions that break symmetry leading to factor
circulants rather than circulant interaction matrices.
