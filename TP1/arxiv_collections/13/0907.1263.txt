Recent work has shown that the distribution of inter-event times for e-mail
communication exhibits a heavy tail which is statistically consistent with a
cascading Poisson process. In this work we extend the analysis to higher-order
statistics, using the Fano and Allan factors to quantify the extent to which
the empirical data depart from the known correlations of Poissonian statistics.
The analysis shows that the higher-order statistics from the empirical data is
indistinguishable from that of randomly reordered time series, thus
demonstrating that e-mail correspondence is no more bursty or correlated than a
Poisson process. Furthermore synthetic data sets generated by a cascading
Poisson process replicate the burstiness and correlations observed in the
empirical data. Finally, a simple rescaling analysis using the best-estimate
rate of activity, confirms that the empirically observed correlations arise
from a non-homogeneus Poisson process.
