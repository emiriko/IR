This contribution describes the experimental set-up implemented by the
LUNASKA project at the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) to enable the
radio-telescope to be used to search for pulses of coherent Cherenkov radiation
from UHE particle interactions in the Moon with an unprecedented bandwidth, and
hence sensitivity. Our specialised hardware included analogue de-dispersion
filters to coherently correct for the dispersion expected of a ~nanosecond
pulse in the Earth's ionosphere over our wide (600 MHz) bandwidth, and
FPGA-based digitising boards running at 2.048 GHz for pulse detection. The
trigger algorithm is described, as are the methods used discriminate between
terrestrial RFI and true lunar pulses. We also outline the next stage of
hardware development expected to be used in our 2010 observations.
