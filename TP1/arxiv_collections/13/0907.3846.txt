The electronic properties of non-interacting particles moving on a
two-dimensional bricklayer lattice are investigated numerically. In particular,
the influence of disorder in form of a spatially varying random magnetic flux
is studied. In addition, a strong perpendicular constant magnetic field $B$ is
considered. The density of states $\rho(E)$ goes to zero for $E\to 0$ as in the
ordered system, but with a much steeper slope. This happens for both cases: at
the Dirac point for B=0 and at the center of the central Landau band for finite
$B$. Close to the Dirac point, the dependence of $\rho(E)$ on the system size,
on the disorder strength, and on the constant magnetic flux density is analyzed
and fitted to an analytical expression proposed previously in connection with
the thermal quantum Hall effect. Additional short-range on-site disorder
completely replenishes the indentation in the density of states at the Dirac
point.
