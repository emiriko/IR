It is possible in principle to probe the many--atom potential surface using
density functional theory (DFT). This will allow us to apply DFT to the
Hamiltonian formulation of atomic motion in monatomic liquids [\textit{Phys.
Rev. E} {\bf 56}, 4179 (1997)]. For a monatomic system, analysis of the
potential surface is facilitated by the random and symmetric classification of
potential energy valleys. Since the random valleys are numerically dominant and
uniform in their macroscopic potential properties, only a few quenches are
necessary to establish these properties. Here we describe an efficient
technique for doing this. Quenches are done from easily generated "stochastic"
configurations, in which the nuclei are distributed uniformly within a
constraint limiting the closeness of approach. For metallic Na with atomic pair
potential interactions, it is shown that quenches from stochastic
configurations and quenches from equilibrium liquid Molecular Dynamics (MD)
configurations produce statistically identical distributions of the structural
potential energy. Again for metallic Na, it is shown that DFT quenches from
stochastic configurations provide the parameters which calibrate the
Hamiltonian. A statistical mechanical analysis shows how the underlying
potential properties can be extracted from the distributions found in quenches
from stochastic configurations.
