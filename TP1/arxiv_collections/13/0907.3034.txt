GRS 1915+105 is a very well studied microquasar with a wide variety of
temporal and spectral states. Multi-wavelength observations from radio to
X-rays have uncovered clear relations between the variability in different
bands. GRS 1915+105 is also well-known as a source of superluminal jets moving
away from the core with true velocity <=0.9c. Non-thermal emission from the
jets or their termination shock could extend to the VHE gamma-ray domain. GRS
1915+105 was observed with the H.E.S.S. telescope array between 2004 and 2008
for a total of 24 hours. We report on these observations and discuss our
findings.
