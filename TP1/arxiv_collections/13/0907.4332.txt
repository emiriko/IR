The lunar Cherenkov technique is a method to use radio-telescopes to detect
ultra-high energy cosmic rays (CR) and neutrinos ($\nu$). By observing the
short-duration ($\sim$few nanosecond) pulses of coherent Cherenkov radiation
emitted from particle cascades via the Askaryan Effect in the Moon's outer
layers (nominally the regolith), the primary particles initiating the cascades
may be identified. Our collaboration (LUNASKA) aims to develop the technique to
be used with the next generation of giant radio-arrays. Here, we present the
results of our two preliminary UHE particle searches using this technique with
three antennas at the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) during February
and May 2008.
