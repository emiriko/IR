The increasing utilization of charged particle beams for therapeutic purposes
requires designing novel detector systems which shall be capable of assessing
radiation quality for a diversity of ion species. It is shown that the pattern
of energy deposition in thermoluminescent phosphors and biological tissue
contains conceptual parallels. The correlation of physical and radiobiological
parameters observed experimentally for specific endpoints (single- and
double-strand breaks of DNA) opens the possibility of realizing successfully
quasi-biological solid-state nanodosimetry on the basis of thermoluminescence.
