Among natural biological flocks/swarms or even mass social activities, when
the collective behaviors of the followers has been dominated by the moving
direction or opinion of one leader group, it seems very difficult for
later-coming leaders to reverse the orientation of the mass followers,
especially when they are in quantitative minority. This Letter reports a
counter-intuitive phenomenon, Following the Later-coming Minority, provided
that the late-comers obey a favorable distribution pattern which enables them
to spread their influence to as many followers as possible in a given time and
to accumulate enough power to govern these followers. We introduce a
discriminant index to quantify the whole group's orientation under competing
leadership, which helps to design an economic way for the minority later-coming
leaders to defeat the dominating majority leaders solely by optimizing their
distribution pattern. Our investigation provides new insights into the
effective leadership in biological systems, with meaningful implication to
social and industrial applications.
