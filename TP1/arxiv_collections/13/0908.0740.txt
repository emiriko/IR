We study two-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnets with additional
multi-spin interactions which can drive the system into a valence-bond solid
state. For standard SU(2) spins, we consider both four- and six-spin
interactions. We find continuous quantum phase transitions with the same
critical exponents. Extending the symmetry to SU(N), we also find continuous
transitions for N=3 and 4. In addition, we also study quantitatively the
cross-over of the order-parameter symmetry from Z4 deep inside the
valence-bond-solid phase to U(1) as the phase transition is approached.
