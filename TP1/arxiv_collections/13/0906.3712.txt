We analyze the transverse momentum distribution of $J/\psi$ mesons produced
in Au + Au collisions at the top RHIC energy within a blast-wave model that
accounts for a possible inhomogeneity of the charmonium distribution and/or
flow fluctuations. The results imply that the transverse momentum spectra
of$J/\psi$, $\phi$ and $\Omega$ hadrons measured at the RHIC can be described
well if kinetic freeze-out takes place just after chemical freeze-out for these
particles.
