Comtraces (combined traces) are extensions of Mazurkiewicz traces that can
model the "not later than" relationship. In this paper, we first introduce the
novel notion of generalized comtraces, extensions of comtraces that can
additionally model the "non-simultaneously" relationship. Then we study some
basic algebraic properties and canonical reprentations of comtraces and
generalized comtraces. Finally we analyze the relationship between generalized
comtraces and generalized stratified order structures. The major technical
contribution of this paper is a proof showing that generalized comtraces can be
represented by generalized stratified order structures.
