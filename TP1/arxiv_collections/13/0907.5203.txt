Aims: Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are sometimes preceded by dimmer emission
episodes, called "precursors", whose nature is still a puzzle: they could
either have the same origin as the main emission episode or they could be due
to another mechanism. We investigate if precursors have some spectral
distinctive feature with respect to the main GRB episodes. Methods: To this aim
we compare the spectral evolution of the precursor with that of the main GRB
event. We also study if and how the spectral parameters, and in particular the
peak of the vFv spectrum of time resolved spectra, correlates with the flux.
This allows us to test if the spectra of the precursor and of the main event
belong to the same correlation (if any). We searched GRBs with precursor
activity in the complete sample of 2704 bursts detected by BATSE finding that
12% of GRBs have one or more precursors. Among these we considered the bursts
with time resolved spectral analysis performed by Kaneko et al. 2006, selecting
those having at least two time resolved spectra for the precursor. Results: We
find that precursors and main events have very similar spectral properties. The
spectral evolution within precursors has similar trends as the spectral
evolution observed in the subsequent peaks. Also the typical spectral
parameters of the precursors are similar to those of the main GRB events.
Moreover, in several cases we find that within the precursors the peak energy
of the spectrum is correlated with the flux similarly to what happens in the
main GRB event. This strongly favors models in which the precursor is due to
the same fireball physics of the main emission episodes.
