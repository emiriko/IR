It is recently conjectured in quantum information processing that phase-shift
errors occur with high probability than qubit-flip errors, hence the former is
more disturbing to quantum information than the later one. This leads us to
construct asymmetric quantum error controlling codes to protect quantum
information over asymmetric channels, $\Pr Z \geq \Pr X$. In this paper we
present two generic methods to derive asymmetric quantum cyclic codes using the
generator polynomials and defining sets of classical cyclic codes.
Consequently, the methods allow us to construct several families of asymmetric
quantum BCH, RS, and RM codes. Finally, the methods are used to construct
families of asymmetric subsystem codes.
