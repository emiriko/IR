In recent years, the breakdown of spacetime symmetries has been identified as
a promising research field in the context of Planck-scale phenomenology. For
example, various theoretical approaches to the quantum-gravity problem are
known to accommodate minute violations of CPT invariance. This talk covers
various topics within this research area. In particular, some mechanisms for
spacetime-symmetry breaking as well as the Standard-Model Extension (SME) test
framework will be reviewed; the connection between CPT and Lorentz invariance
in quantum field theory will be exposed; and various experimental CPT tests
with emphasis on matter--antimatter comparisons will be discussed.
