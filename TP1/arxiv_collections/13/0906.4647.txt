We introduce the notion of domains with uniform squeezing property, study
various analytic and geometric properties of such domains and show that they
cover many interesting examples, including Teichmuller spaces and Hermitian
symmetric spaces of non-compact type. The properties supported by such
manifolds include pseudoconvexity, hyperconvexity, Kaehler-hyperbolicity,
vanishing of cohomology groups and quasi-isometry of various invariant metrics.
It also leads to nice geometric properties for manifolds covered by bounded
domains and a simple criterion to provide positive examples to a problem of
Serre about Stein properties of holomorphic fiber bundles.
