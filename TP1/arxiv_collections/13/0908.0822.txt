The inverse seesaw mechanism with three pairs of gauge-singlet neutrinos
offers a natural interpretation of the tiny masses of three active neutrinos at
the TeV scale. We combine this picture with the newly-proposed Friedberg-Lee
(FL) symmetry in order to understand the observed pattern of neutrino mixing.
We show that the FL symmetry requires only two pairs of the gauge-singlet
neutrinos to be massive, implying that one active neutrino must be massless. We
propose a phenomenological ansatz with broken FL symmetry and exact \mu-\tau
symmetry in the gauge-singlet neutrino sector and obtain the tri-bimaximal
neutrino mixing pattern by means of the inverse seesaw relation. We demonstrate
that non-unitary corrections to this result are possible to reach the percent
level and a soft breaking of \mu-\tau symmetry can give rise to CP violation in
such a TeV-scale seesaw scenario.
