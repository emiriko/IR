The probabilistic top-k queries based on the interplay of score and
probability, under the possible worlds semantic, become an important research
issue that considers both score and uncertainty on the same basis. In the
literature, many different probabilistic top-k queries are proposed. Almost all
of them need to compute the probability of a tuple t_i to be ranked at the j-th
position across the entire set of possible worlds. The cost of such computing
is the dominant cost and is known as O(kn^2), where n is the size of dataset.
In this paper, we propose a new novel algorithm that computes such probability
in O(kn).
