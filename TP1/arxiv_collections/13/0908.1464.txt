We describe the design and performance of polarization selective
antenna-coupled TES arrays that will be used in several upcoming Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) experiments: SPIDER, BICEP-2/SPUD. The fully
lithographic polarimeter arrays utilize planar phased-antennas for collimation
(F/4 beam) and microstrip filters for band definition (25% bandwidth). These
devices demonstrate high optical efficiency, excellent beam shapes, and
well-defined spectral bands. The dual-polarization antennas provide
well-matched beams and low cross polarization response, both important for
high-fidelity polarization measurements. These devices have so far been
developed for the 100 GHz and 150 GHz bands, two premier millimeter-wave
atmospheric windows for CMB observations. In the near future, the flexible
microstrip-coupled architecture can provide photon noise-limited detection for
the entire frequency range of the CMBPOL mission. This paper is a summary of
the progress we have made since the 2006 SPIE meeting in Orlando, FL.
