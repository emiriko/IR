We provide an analytical proof of the existence of a stable periodic orbit
contained in the region of coexistence of the three species of a tritrophic
chain. The method used consists in analyzing a triple Hopf bifurcation. For
some values of the parameters three limit cycles bear via this bifurcation. One
is contained in the plane where the top predator is absent. Another one is not
contained in the domain of interest where all variables are positive. The third
one is contained where the three species coexist.
