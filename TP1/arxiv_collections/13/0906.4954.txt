We analyze statistical properties of the separate multipole moments of the
CMB temperature maps and find that the distribution tails are slightly
non-Gaussian. Moreover, the deviation from Gaussianity peaks sharply at around
$l\sim45\pm10$. If the detected non-Gaussianities should be attributed to the
remaining foreground contamination from the galactic plane, an appearance of a
similar peak in different frequency bands is unexpected. The presence of the
peak was also confirmed by the analysis of weighted multipoles which is less
susceptible to the galactic noise. A separate analysis of the multipoles with
odd and even $l+m$ shows two opposite types of non-Gaussianities which cannot
be explained with only galactic foregrounds. We argue that cosmic strings or
correlated gravitational waves could lead to the observed effect.
