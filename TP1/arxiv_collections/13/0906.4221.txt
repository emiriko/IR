A large part of the experimental program in Hall B of the Jefferson Lab is
dedicated to baryon spectroscopy. Photoproduction experiments are essential
part of this program. CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) and
availability of circularly and linearly polarized tagged photon beams provide
unique conditions for this type of experiments. Recent addition of the Frozen
Spin Target (FROST) gives a remarkable opportunity to measure double and triple
polarization observables for different pseudo-scalar meson photoproduction
processes. For the first time, a complete or nearly complete experiment becomes
possible and will allow model independent extraction of the reaction amplitude.
An overview of the experiment and its current status is presented.
