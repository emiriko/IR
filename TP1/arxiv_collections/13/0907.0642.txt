In the survey of the Galactic plane conducted with H.E.S.S., many VHE
gamma-ray sources were discovered for which no clear counterpart at other
wavelengths could be identified. HESS J1731-347 initially belonged to this
source class. Recently however, the new shell-type supernova remnant (SNR)
G353.6-0.7 was discovered in radio data, positionally coinciding with the VHE
source. We will present new X-ray observations that cover a fraction of the VHE
source, revealing nonthermal emission that most likely can be interpreted as
synchrotron emission from high-energy electrons. This, along with a larger
H.E.S.S. data set which comprises more than twice the observation time used in
the discovery paper, allows us to test whether the VHE source may indeed be
attributed to shell-type emission from that new SNR. If true, this would make
HESS J1731-347 a new object in the small but growing class of non-thermal
shell-type supernova remnants with VHE emission.
