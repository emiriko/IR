Besides the detection of high energy neutrinos, the ANTARES telescope offers
an opportunity to improve sensitivity to exotic cosmological relics. In this
article we discuss the sensitivity of the ANTARES detector to elativistic
monopoles and slow nuclearites. Dedicated trigger algorithms and search
strategies are being developed to search or them. The data filtering,
background rejection selection criteria are described, as well as the expected
sensitivity of ANTARES to exotic physics.
