Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach, we find the allowed parameter
space of a MSSM model with seven free parameters. In this model universality
conditions at the GUT scale are imposed on the gaugino sector. We require in
particular that the relic density of dark matter saturates the value extracted
from cosmological measurements assuming a standard cosmological scenario. We
characterize the parameter space of the model that satisfies experimental
constraints and illustrate the complementarity of the LHC searches, B-physics
observables and direct dark matter searches for further probing the parameter
space of the model. We also explore the different decay chains expected for the
coloured particles that would be produced at LHC.
