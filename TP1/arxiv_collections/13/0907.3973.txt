75As NMR and susceptiblity were measured in a Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 single crystal
for x=6% for various field H values and orientations. The sharpness of the
superconducting and magnetic transitions demonstrates a homogeneity of the Co
doping x better than +-0.25%. On the nanometer scale, the paramagnetic part of
the NMR spectra is found very anisotropic and very narrow for H//ab which
allows to rule out the interpretation of Ref.[6] in terms of strong Co induced
electronic inhomogeneities. We propose that a distribution of hyperfine
couplings and chemical shifts due to the Co effect on its nearest As explains
the observed linewidths and relaxations. All these measurements show that Co
substitution induces a very homogeneous electronic doping in BaFe2As2, from
nano to micrometer lengthscales, on the contrary to the K doping.
