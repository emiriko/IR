Radiative electron-proton scattering is studied in peripheral kinematics,
where the scattered electron and photon move close to the direction of the
initial electron. Even in the case of unpolarized initial electron the photon
may have a definite polarization. The differential cross sections with
longitudinally or transversal polarized initial electron are calculated. The
same phenomena are considered for the production of an electron-positron pair
by the photon, where the final positron (electron) can be also polarized.
Differential distributions for the case of polarized initial photon are given.
Both cases of unscreened and completely screened atomic targets are considered.
