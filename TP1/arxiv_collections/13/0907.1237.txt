We study a model of a covalent band insulator with on-site Coulomb repulsion
at half-filling using dynamical mean-field theory. Upon increasing the
interaction strength the system undergoes a discontinuous transition from a
correlated band insulator to a Mott insulator with hysteretic behavior at low
temperatures. Increasing the temperature in the band insulator close to the
insulator-insulator transition we find a crossover to a Mott insulator at
elevated temperatures. Remarkably, correlations decrease the energy gap in the
correlated band insulator. The gap renormalization can be traced to the
low-frequency behavior of the self-energy, analogously to the quasiparticle
renormalization in a Fermi liquid. While the uncorrelated band insulator is
characterized by a single gap for both charge and spin excitations, the spin
gap is smaller than the charge gap in the correlated system.
