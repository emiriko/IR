It is found that, in closed-$l$-shell atoms, the exact local exchange
potential $v_{\text{x}}(\bf r)$ of the density functional theory (DFT) is very
well represented, within the region of every atomic shell, by each of the
suitably shifted potentials obtained with the non-local Fock exchange operator
for the individual Hartree-Fock (HF) orbitals belonging to this shell.
Consequently, the continuous piecewise function built of shell-specific
exchange potentials, each defined as the weighted average of the shifted
orbital exchange potentials corresponding %the HF orbitals from to a given
shell, yields another highly-accurate representation of $v_{\text{x}}(\bf r)$.
These newly revealed properties are {\em not} related to the well-known
step-like shell structure in the response part of $v_{\text{x}}(\bf r)$, but
they result from specific relations satisfied by the HF orbital exchange
potentials. These relations explain the outstanding proximity of the occupied
Kohn-Sham and HF orbitals as well as the high quality of the Krieger-Li-Iafrate
and localized HF (or, equivalently, common-energy-denominator) approximations
to the DFT exchange potential $v_{\text{x}}(\bf r)$. The constant shifts added
to the HF orbital exchange potentials, to map them onto $v_{\text{x}}(\bf r)$,
are nearly equal to the differences between the energies of the corresponding
KS and HF orbitals. It is discussed why these differences are positive and grow
when the respective orbital energies become lower for inner orbitals.
