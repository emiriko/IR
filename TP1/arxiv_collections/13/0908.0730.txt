Over the last few years it has become increasingly clear that low energy, but
high precision experiments provide a powerful and complementary window to
physics beyond the Standard Model. In this note we illuminate this by using
minicharged particles as an example. We argue that minicharged particles arise
naturally in extensions of the Standard Model. Compatibility with charge
quantization arguments suggests that minicharged particles typically arise
together with a massless hidden sector U(1) gauge field. We present several low
energy experiments employing strong lasers, electric and magnetic fields that
can be used to search for (light) minicharged particles and their accompanying
U(1) gauge boson.
