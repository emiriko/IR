We report on the generation of multi-wavelength dissipative soliton (DS) in
an all normal dispersion fiber laser passively mode-locked with a semiconductor
saturable absorber mirror (SESAM). We show that depending on the strength of
the cavity birefringence, stable single-, dual- and triple-wavelength DSs can
be formed in the laser. The multi-wavelength soliton operation of the laser was
experimentally investigated, and the formation mechanisms of the
multi-wavelength DSs are discussed.
