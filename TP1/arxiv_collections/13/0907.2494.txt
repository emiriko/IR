Since Descartes' dualism, with his res extensa and res cogitans, six
fundamental problems in the philosophy and natural history of mind are these:
1. how does mind act on matter? 2. If mind does not act on matter is mind a
mere epiphenomenon? 3. What might be the source of free will? 4. What might be
the source of a responsible free will? 5. Why might it have been selectively
advantageous to evolve consciousness? 6. What is consciousness? I approach the
first five of the above six problems based on two physical postulates. First
the mind-brain system is a quantum coherent, but reversibly decohering and
recohering system. This allows me to answer 1) above, mind does not act
causally on brain at all, rather it acausally decohers to classicity (for all
practical purposes), hence has consequences for brain and body as matter.
Epiphenomenalism is averted. A quantum mind, because it is acausal on
Copenhagen including Born, yields a free will, but a merely random free will,
not a responsible free will. Second, the most radical part of this article
proposes that the quantum classical interface is not always describable by a
law: specifically in a special relativity setting, no function, F, maps the
present state of the system mind-brain into its future. In its place is a
nonrandom yet lawless process. I seek in this non-random yet lawless process a
source for a responsible free will. Finally, if the quantum-classical boundary
can be non-random yet lawless, then no algorithmic simulation of the world or
ourselves can calculate the real world, hence the evolutionary selective
advantages for evolving consciousness to know it may be great. I make no
progress on problem 6, the hard problem of qualia.
