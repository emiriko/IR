We report on recent results obtained thanks to Target of Opportunity
observations of the two galactic sources SGR 1627-41 and 1E 1547-5408. These
two transient sources present several similarities which support the
interpretation of Anomalous X-ray Pulsars and Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters as a
single class of strongly magnetized neutron stars.
