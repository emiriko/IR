Collaborative tags are playing more and more important role for the
organization of information systems. In this paper, we study a personalized
recommendation model making use of the ternary relations among users, objects
and tags. We propose a measure of user similarity based on his preference and
tagging information. Two kinds of similarities between users are calculated by
using a diffusion-based process, which are then integrated for recommendation.
We test the proposed method in a standard collaborative filtering framework
with three metrics: ranking score, Recall and Precision, and demonstrate that
it performs better than the commonly used cosine similarity.
