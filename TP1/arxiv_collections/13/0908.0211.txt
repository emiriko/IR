Generalizing Feingold-Frenkel's construction we use Weyl bosonic fields to
construct toroidal Lie algebras of types $A_n, B_n$, $C_n$ and $D_n$ of level
$-1, -2, -1/2$ and -2 respectively. In particular, our construction also gives
new bosonic construction for the orthogonal Lie algebras in the cases of affine
Lie algebras.
