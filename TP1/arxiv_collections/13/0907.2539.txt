We present a study of the extreme O-type supergiant He 3-759 using new
high-resolution FEROS data, revealing that it is a near spectroscopic twin of
HD 151804 (O8 Iaf). We investigate the extinction towards He 3-759 using a
variety of methods, revealing A_V ~ 4.7 mag. If we assume He 3-759 has an
identical absolute K-band magnitude to HD 151804 we find that it lies in the
Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm at a distance of ~6.5 kpc. We derive the physical
and wind properties for He 3-759, revealing T* = 30.5 kK, log L/L(sun) = 5.9
and dM/dt = 10^-5.17 M(sun)/yr for a clumped wind whose terminal velocity is
estimated at 1000 km/s. The atmosphere of He 3-759 is enriched in helium (X_He
= 49%) and nitrogen (X_N = 0.3%). A reanalysis of HD 151804 and HD 152408
(WN9ha) reveals similar parameters except that the WN9ha star possesses a
stronger wind and reduced surface hydrogen content. HD 151804 and HD 152408 lie
within the Sco OB1 association, with initial masses of ~60 M(sun) and ages ~2.7
Myr, consistent with NGC 6231 cluster members using standard Geneva isochrones.
Improved agreement with observed surface abundances are obtained for similar
initial masses with more recent Geneva group predictions from which higher ages
of ~3.75 Myr are obtained. No young, massive star cluster is known to be
associated with He 3-759.
