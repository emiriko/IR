In this paper we present a comprehensive theoretical description of molecular
spectral converters in the specific context of Luminescent Solar Concentrators
(LSCs). The theoretical model is an extension to a three-level system
interacting with a solar radiation bath of the standard quantum theory of
atomic radiative processes. We derive the equilibrium equations of the
conversion process and provide specific examples of application of this
principle to the development of solar concentration devices.
