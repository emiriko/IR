Methods are presented to define and compute source multipoles of dynamical
horizons in numerical relativity codes, extending previous work from the
isolated and dynamical horizon formalisms in a manner that allows for the
consideration of horizons that are not axisymmetric. These methods are then
applied to a binary black hole merger simulation, providing evidence that the
final remnant is a Kerr black hole, both through the (spatially)
gauge-invariant recovery of the geometry of the apparent horizon, and through a
detailed extraction of quasinormal ringing modes directly from the strong-field
region.
