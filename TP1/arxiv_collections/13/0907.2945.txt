We demonstrate a multi-spectral polarization sensitive mid-infrared
dots-in-a-well (DWELL) photodetector utilizing surface-plasmonic resonant
elements, with tailorable frequency response and polarization selectivity. The
resonant responsivity of the surface-plasmon detector shows an enhancement of
up to 5 times that of an unpatterned control detector. As the plasmonic
resonator involves only surface patterning of the top metal contact, this
method is independent of light-absorbing material and can easily be integrated
with current focal plane array processing for imaging applications.
