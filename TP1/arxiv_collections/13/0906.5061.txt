Bohm's interpretation of Quantum Mechanics leads to the derivation of a
Quantum Kinetic Equation (QKE): in the present work, propagation of waves in
charged quantum gases is investigated starting from this QKE. Dispersion
relations are derived for fully and weakly degenerate fermions and bosons
(these latter above critical temperature), and the differences underlined. Use
of a kinetic equation permits investigation of "Landau-type" damping: it is
found that the presence of damping in fermion gases is dependent upon the
degree of degeneracy, whereas it is always present in boson gases. In fully
degenerate fermions a phenomenon appears that is akin to the "zero sound"
propagation.
