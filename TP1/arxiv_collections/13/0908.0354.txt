We consider an action that can generate fluids with three unequal stresses
for metrics with a spacelike Killing vector. The parameters in the action are
directly related to the stress anisotropies. The field equations following from
the action are applied to an anisotropic cosmological expansion and an
extension of the Gott-Hiscock cosmic string.
