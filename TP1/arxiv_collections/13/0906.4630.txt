The electric dipole excitation of various nuclei is calculated with a Random
Phase Approximation phenomenological approach. The evolution of the strength
distribution in various groups of isotopes, oxygen, calcium, zirconium and tin,
is studied. The neutron excess produces $E1$ strength in the low energy region.
Indexes to measure the collectivity of the excitation are defined. We studied
the behavior of proton and neutron transition densities to determine the
isoscalar or isovector nature of the excitation. We observed that in
medium-heavy nuclei the low-energy $E1$ excitation has characteristics rather
different that those exhibited by the giant dipole resonance. This new type of
excitation can be identified as pygmy dipole resonance.
