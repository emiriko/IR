A constructive approach to get the reduced row echelon form of a given matrix
$A$ is presented. It has been shown that after the $k$th step of the
Gauss-Jordan procedure, each entry $a^k_{ij}(i<>j; j > k)$ in the new matrix
$A^k$ can always be expressed as a ratio of two determinants whose entries are
from the original matrix $A$. The new method also gives a more general
generalization of Cramer's rule than existing methods.
