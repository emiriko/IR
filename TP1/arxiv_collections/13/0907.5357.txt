Presented is a topological representation of quantum logic that views
entangled qubit spacetime histories (or qubit world lines) as a generalized
braid, referred to as a superbraid. The crossing of world lines is purely
quantum in nature, most conveniently expressed analytically with
ladder-operator-based quantum gates. At a crossing, independent world lines can
become entangled. Complicated superbraids are systematically reduced by
recursively applying novel quantum skein relations. If the superbraid is closed
(e.g. representing quantum circuits with closed-loop feedback, quantum lattice
gas algorithms, loop or vacuum diagrams in quantum field theory), then one can
decompose the resulting superlink into an entangled superposition of classical
links. In turn, for each member link, one can compute a link invariant, e.g.
the Jones polynomial. Thus, a superlink possesses a unique link invariant
expressed as an entangled superposition of classical link invariants.
