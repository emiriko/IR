There are different manners of teaching a spreadsheet program. In any case,
it is intended that the teacher settles the objectives of the course and adapts
them to the particular audience he/she has to deal with. This paper aims at
providing any teacher whatever his/her specific objectives and his/her audience
with elements to help him/her building a course. It focuses mainly on two
important issues: 1 - select in all that may be said about such complex tools,
what is prior to know and to teach, i.e. what leads to autonomy in using but
also to autonomy in learning (because everything cannot be taught) and 2 - show
how concepts are closely related to good formatting considerations. A method
based on the "invariants of information processing" is outlined, partially
illustrated and an implementation is described throughout a course designed for
students preparing a master in Education Sciences.
