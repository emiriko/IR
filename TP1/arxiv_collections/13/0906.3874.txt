The usefulness of the recent experimentally realized six photon cluster state
by C. Y. Lu et al. (2007, Nature {3} {91}), is investigated for quantum
communication protocols like teleportation, quantum information splitting
(QIS), remote state preparation and dense coding. We show that the present
state can be used for the teleportation of an arbitrary two qubit state
deterministically. Later we devise two distinct protocols for the QIS of an
arbitrary two qubit state among two parties and systematically compare their
relative merits in terms of classical communication and security. Sixteen
orthogonal measurement basis on the cluster state is constructed, which will
lock an arbitrary two qubit state among two parties. The usefulness of the
state for dense coding is investigated and it is shown that one can send five
classical bits by sending only three qubits using this state as a shared
entangled resource. We finally show that this state can also be utilised in the
remote state preparation of an arbitrary two qubit state.
