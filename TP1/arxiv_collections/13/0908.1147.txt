We propose a unified description of cuprate and iron-based superconductivity.
Consistency with magnetic structure inferred from neutron scattering implies
significant constraints on the symmetry of the pairing gap for the iron-based
superconductors. We find that this unification requires the orbital pairing
formfactors for the iron arsenides to differ fundamentally from those for
cuprates at the microscopic level.
