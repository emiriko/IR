The existence of multi-pulse solutions near orbit-flip bifurcations of a
primary single-humped pulse is shown in reversible, conservative, singularly
perturbed vector fields. Similar to the non-singular case, the sign of a
geometric condition that involves the first integral decides whether
multi-pulses exist or not. The proof utilizes a combination of geometric
singular perturbation theory and Lyapunov--Schmidt reduction through Lin's
method. The motivation for considering orbit flips in singularly perturbed
systems comes from the regularized short-pulse equation and the Ostrovsky
equation, which both fit into this framework and are shown here to support
multi-pulses.
