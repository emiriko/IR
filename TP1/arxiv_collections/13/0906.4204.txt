Three different cases of magnetic field reentrant ground states in heavy
fermion systems, URhGe, UGe$_2$ and CeRhIn$_5$ recently studied in Grenoble,
are discussed. URhGe is a ferromagnetic superconductor with reentrace of
superconductivity under magnetic field ($H$) which is associated to the spin
reorientation field. UGe$_2$ is a ferromagnetic superconductor with an
enhancement of the upper critical field $H_{c2}$ of superconductivity at its
metamagnetic transition between 2 ferromagnetic phases. CeRhIn$_5$ is a
superconductor with $H$ reentrant antiferromagnetism. We analyze the links
between the $H$ enhancement of the different contributions to the effective
mass and the field reentrant phase.
