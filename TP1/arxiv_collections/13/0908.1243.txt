The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope
(formerly GLAST), with its improved sensitivity relative to previous generation
gamma-ray telescopes, is significantly increasing the number of known gamma-ray
sources in the sky, including pulsars. In addition to searching for gamma-ray
emission from known radio pulsars, it is now possible to successfully perform
blind searches for pulsars on the gamma-ray data alone, with the goal of
uncovering a new population of potentially radio-quiet (Geminga-like) pulsars.
We describe our methods and some recent results from our searches, performed
using the time-differencing technique, which have resulted in the discovery of
a large number of new gamma-ray pulsars.
