Here we demonstrate that both, tunnel magneto resistance (TMR) and resistive
switching (RS), can be observed simultaneously in nano-scale magnetic tunnel
junctions. The devices show bipolar RS of 6 % and TMR ratios of about 100 %.
For each magnetic state, multiple resistive sates are created depending on the
bias history which provides a method for multi-bit data storage and logic. The
electronic transport measurements are discussed in the framework of a
memristive system. Differently prepared MgO barriers are compared to gain
insight into the switching mechanism.
