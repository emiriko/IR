Context: Asteroseismology has great potential for the study of metal-poor
stars due to its sensitivity to determine stellar ages. Aims: Our goal was to
detect p-mode oscillations in the metal-poor sub-dwarf 85 Peg A and to search
for other variability on longer timescales. Methods: We have obtained
continuous high-precision photometry of the binary system 85 Pegasi with the
MOST space telescope in two seasons (2005 & 2007). Furthermore, we redetermined
vsini for 85 Peg A using high resolution spectra obtained through the ESO
archive, and used photometric spot modeling to interpret long periodic
variations. Results: Our frequency analysis yields no convincing evidence for
p-modes significantly above a noise level of 4 ppm. Using simulated p-mode
patterns we provide upper RMS amplitude limits for 85 Peg A. The light curve
shows evidence for variability with a period of about 11 d and this periodicity
is also seen in the follow up run in 2007; however, as different methods to
remove instrumental trends in the 2005 run yield vastly different results, the
exact shape and periodicity of the 2005 variability remain uncertain. Our
re-determined vsini value for 85 Peg A is comparable to previous studies and we
provide realistic uncertainties for this parameter. Using these values in
combination with simple photometric spot models we are able to reconstruct the
observed variations. Conclusions: The null-detection of p-modes in 85 Peg A is
consistent with theoretical values for pulsation amplitudes in this star. The
detected long-periodic variation must await confirmation by further
observations with similar or better precision and long-term stability. If the
11 d periodicity is real, rotational modulation of surface features on one of
the components is the most likely explanation.
