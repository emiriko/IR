We model the assembly of planets from planetary embryos under the conditions
suggested by various scenarios for the formation of the planetary system around
the millisecond pulsar B1257+12. We find that the most likely models fall at
the low angular momentum end of the proposed range. Models that invoke
supernova fallback produce such disks, although we find that a solar
composition disk produces a more likely evolution than one composed primarily
of heavy elements. Furthermore, we find that dust sedimentation must occur
rapidly as the disk cools, in order that the solid material be confined to a
sufficiently narrow range of radii. A quantitative comparison between the
observations and the best-fit models shows that the simulations can reproduce
the observed eccentricities and masses, but have difficulty reproducing the
compactness of the pulsar planet system. Finally, we examine the results of
similar studies of solar system terrestrial planet accumulation and discuss
what can be learned from the comparison.
