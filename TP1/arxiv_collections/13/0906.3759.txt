We study charmed baryon resonances that are generated dynamically from a
coupled-channel unitary approach that implements heavy-quark symmetry. Some
states can already be identified with experimental observations, such as
$\Lambda_c(2595)$, $\Lambda_c(2660)$, $\Sigma_c(2902)$ or $\Lambda_c(2941)$,
while others need a compilation of more experimental data as well as an
extension of the model to include higher order contributions. We also compare
our model to previous SU(4) schemes.
