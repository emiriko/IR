We present a method for characterizing the propagation of the magnetic flux
in an artificially drilled bulk high-temperature superconductor (HTS) during a
pulsed-field magnetization. As the magnetic pulse penetrates the cylindrical
sample, the magnetic flux density is measured simultaneously in 16 holes by
means of microcoils that are placed across the median plane, i.e. at an equal
distance from the top and bottom surfaces, and close to the surface of the
sample. We discuss the time evolution of the magnetic flux density in the holes
during a pulse and measure the time taken by the external magnetic flux to
reach each hole. Our data show that the flux front moves faster in the median
plane than on the surface when penetrating the sample edge; it then proceeds
faster along the surface than in the bulk as it penetrates the sample further.
Once the pulse is over, the trapped flux density inside the central hole is
found to be about twice as large in the median plane than on the surface. This
ratio is confirmed by modelling.
