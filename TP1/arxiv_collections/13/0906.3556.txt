The structure of the 18O nucleus at excitation energies above the alpha decay
threshold was studied using 14C+alpha resonance elastic scattering. A number of
states with large alpha reduced widths have been observed, indicating that the
alpha-cluster degree of freedom plays an important role in this N not equal Z
nucleus. However, the alpha-cluster structure of this nucleus is very different
from the relatively simple pattern of strong alpha-cluster quasi-rotational
bands in the neighboring 16O and 20Ne nuclei. A 0+ state with an alpha reduced
width exceeding the single particle limit was identified at an excitation
energy of 9.9+/-0.3 MeV. We discuss evidence that states of this kind are
common in light nuclei and give possible explanations of this feature.
