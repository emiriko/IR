We consider the electrostatic field of a point charge coupled to
Horava-Lifshitz gravity and find an exact solution describing the space with a
surplus (or deficit) solid angle. Although, theoretically in general
relativity, a surplus angle is hardly to be obtained in the presence of
ordinary matter with positive energy distribution, it seems natural in
Horava-Lifshitz gravity. We present the sudden disappearance and reappearance
of a star image as an astrophysical effect of a surplus angle. We also consider
matter configurations of all possible power law behaviors coupled to
Horava-Lifshitz gravity and obtain a series of exact solutions.
