Recent measurements of the Zeeman effect in dark-cloud cores provide
important tests for theories of cloud dynamics and prestellar core formation.
In this Letter we report results of simulated Zeeman measurements, based on
radiative transfer calculations through a snapshot of a simulation of
supersonic and super-Alfv\'enic turbulence. We have previously shown that the
same simulation yields a relative mass-to-flux ratio (core versus envelope) in
agreement with the observations (and in contradiction with the ambipolar-drift
model of core formation). Here we show that the mass-to-flux and
turbulent-to-magnetic-energy ratios in the simulated cores agree with observed
values as well. The mean magnetic field strength in the simulation is very low,
\bar{B}=0.34 \muG, presumably lower than the mean field in molecular clouds.
Nonetheless, high magnetic field values are found in dense cores, in agreement
with the observations (the rms field, amplified by the turbulence, is
B_{rms}=3.05 \muG). We conclude that a strong large-scale mean magnetic field
is not required by Zeeman effect measurements to date, although it is not ruled
out by this work.
