In this paper, we use integration method to show that there is no existence
of global $C^{2}$ solution with compact support, to the pressureless
Euler-Poisson equations with attractive forces in $R^{N}$. And the similar
result can be shown, provided that the uniformly bounded functional:%
\int_{\Omega(t)}K\gamma(\gamma-1)\rho^{\gamma-2}(\nabla\rho)^{2}%
dx+\int_{\Omega(t)}K\gamma\rho^{\gamma-1}\Delta\rho dx+\epsilon\geq
-\delta\alpha(N)M, where $M$ is the mass of the solutions and $| \Omega| $ is
the fixed volume of $\Omega(t)$.
  On the other hand, our differentiation method provides a simpler proof to
show the blowup result in "D. H. Chae and E. Tadmor, \textit{On the Finite Time
Blow-up of the Euler-Poisson Equations in}$R^{N}$, Commun. Math. Sci.
\textbf{6} (2008), no. 3, 785--789.".
