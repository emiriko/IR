We propose a "DFT+dispersion" treatment which avoids double counting of
dispersion terms by deriving the dispersion-free density functional theory
(DFT) interaction energy and combining it with DFT-based dispersion. The
formalism involves self-consistent polarization of DFT monomers restrained by
the exclusion principle via the Pauli blockade technique. Any
exchange-correlation potential can be used within monomers, but only the
exchange operates between them. The applications to rare-gas dimers, ion-rare
gas interactions and hydrogen bonds demonstrate that the interaction energies
agree with benchmark values.
