The synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission from Gamma-ray Burst (GRB)
forward shock can extend to the very-high-energy (VHE; $E_\gamma > $100 GeV)
range. Such high energy photons are rare and are attenuated by the cosmic
infrared background before reaching us. In this work, we discuss the prospect
to detect these VHE photons using the current ground-based Cherenkov detectors.
Our calculated results are consistent with the upper limits obtained with
several Cherenkov detectors for GRB 030329, GRB 050509B, and GRB 060505 during
the afterglow phase. For 5 bursts in our nearby GRB sample (except for GRB
030329), current ground-based Cherenkov detectors would not be expected to
detect the modeled VHE signal. Only for those very bright and nearby bursts
like GRB 030329, detection of VHE photons is possible under favorable observing
conditions and a delayed observation time of $\la$10 hours.
