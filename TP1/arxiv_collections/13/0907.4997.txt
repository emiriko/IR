During its first cycle of observations, VERITAS observed several GRBs in
response to broadcast alerts from the Gamma-ray bursts Coordinates Network
(GCN). The GRBs were followed up and observed thereafter with typical delays of
2 to 4 minutes from the beginning of the burst and of 92 s in the best case,
searching for a very high energy (VHE) component above 100 GeV. The aim of the
search for VHE emission from GRBs is to understand the behavior, composition
and dynamics of the most accelerated particles in the bursts, as well as to get
a better overall understanding of the model of GRBs. We report on the results
from two years of observations by VERITAS.
