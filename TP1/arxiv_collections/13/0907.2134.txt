In this paper we report an enhanced temperature coefficient of resistance
(TCR) close to room temperature in La0.7Ca0.3-xBaxMnO3 + Agy (x = 0.10, 0.15
and y = 0.0 to 0.40) (LCBMO+Ag) composite manganites. The observed enhancement
of TCR is attributed to the grain growth and opening of new conducting channels
in the composites. Ag addition has also been found to enhance intra-granular
magneto-resistance. Inter-granular MR, however, is seen to decrease with Ag
addition. The enhanced TCR and MR at / near room temperature open up the
possibility of the use of such materials as infrared bolometric and magnetic
field sensors respectively.
