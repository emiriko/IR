We study the space-time distributions of intensity fluctuations in 2 - 3 hour
sequences of multi-spectral, high-resolution, high-cadence broad-band
filtergram images (BFI) made by the SOT-FG system aboard the Hinode spacecraft.
In the frequency range 5.5 < f < 8.0 mHz both G-band and Ca II H-line
oscillations are suppressed in the presence of magnetic fields, but the
suppression disappears for f > 10 mHz. By looking at G-band frequencies above
10 mHz we find that the oscillatory power, both at these frequencies and at
lower frequencies too, lies in a mesh pattern with cell scale 2 - 3 Mm, clearly
larger than normal granulation, and with correlation times on the order of
hours. The mesh pattern lies in the dark lanes between stable cells found in
time-integrated G-band intensity images. It also underlies part of the bright
pattern in time-integrated H-line emission. This discovery may reflect
dynamical constraints on the sizes of rising granular convection cells together
with the turbulence created in strong intercellular downflows.
