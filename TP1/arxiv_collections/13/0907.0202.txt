Predictions of elliptic flow ($v_2$) and nuclear modification factor
($R_{AA}$) are provided as a function of centrality in U + U collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. Since the $^{238}$U nucleus is naturally
deformed, one could adjust the properties of the fireball, density and duration
of the hot and dense system, for example, in high energy nuclear collisions by
carefully selecting the colliding geometry. Within our Monte Carlo Glauber
based approach, the $v_2$ with respect to the reaction plane $v_2^{RP}$ in U +
U collisions is consistent with that in Au + Au collisions, while the $v_2$
with respect to the participant plane $v_2^{PP}$ increases $\sim$30-60% at top
10% centrality which is attributed to the larger participant eccentricity at
most central U + U collisions. The suppression of $R_{AA}$ increases and
reaches $\sim$0.1 at most central U + U collisions that is by a factor of 2
more suppression compared to the central Au + Au collisions due to large size
and deformation of Uranium nucleus.
