Very recently, PAMELA Collaboration has formally reported two sets of data on
positron and antiproton flux measurements done at very high energies and with
unprecedented accuracy. The reports reveal a puzzle of great topical interest
and importance : it is decisively found that there is a sharp smooth rise of
the positron fraction, whereas for antiproton production no such rises occur;
rather the fraction either flattens, or shows signs of falling off gradually
with increasing energies. The present work is just an attempt to decipher the
riddle with the help of a host of radically new ideas about the
particle-structure, the multiparticle-production mechanisms and the concept of
nucleon break-downs into the constituent partons. The application of these
ideas found remarkable successes in the past; exactly similar or more striking
are the findings by the present study.
