(Abridged) Photometry of archival Spitzer observations of the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) are used to search for young stellar objects (YSOs).
Simple mid-infrared selection criteria were used to exclude most normal and
evolved stars and background galaxies. We identify a sample of 2,910 sources in
the LMC that could potentially be YSOs. We then simultaneously considered
images and photometry from the optical through mid-IR wavelengths to assess the
source morphology, spectral energy distribution (SED), and the surrounding
interstellar environment to determine the most likely nature of each source.
  From this examination of the initial sample, we suggest 1,172 sources are
most likely YSOs and 1,075 probable background galaxies, consistent with
expectations based on SWIRE survey data. Spitzer IRS observations of 269 of the
brightest YSOs from our sample have confirmed that ~>95% are indeed YSOs.
  A comprehensive search for YSOs in the LMC has also been carried out by the
SAGE team. There are three major differences between these two searches. (1) In
the common region of color-magnitude space, ~850 of our 1,172 probable YSOs are
missed in the SAGE YSO catalog because their conservative point source
identification criteria have excluded YSOs superposed on complex diffuse
emission. (2) About 20-30% of the YSOs identified by the SAGE team are sources
we classify as background galaxies. (3) the SAGE YSO catalog identifies YSO in
parts of color-magnitude space that we excluded and thus contains more evolved
or fainter YSOs missed by our analysis. Finally, the mid-IR luminosity
functions of our most likely YSO candidates in the LMC can be well described by
N(L) propto L^-1, which is consistent with the Salpeter initial mass function
if a mass-luminosity relation of L propto M^2.4 is adopted.
