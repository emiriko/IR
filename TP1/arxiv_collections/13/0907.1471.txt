In this paper we consider the transfer operator approach to the Ruelle and
Selberg zeta functions associated to continued fractions transformations and
the geodesic flow on the full modular surface. We extend the results by Ruelle
and Mayer to two-variable zeta functions, $\zeta(q,z)$ and $Z(q,z)$. The $q$
variable plays the role of the inverse temperature and the introduction of the
"geometric variable" $z$ is essential in the tentative to provide a general
approach, based on the Farey map, to the correspondence between the analytic
properties of the zeta functions themselves, the spectral properties of a class
of generalised transfer operators and the theory of a generalisation of the
three-term functional equations studied by Lewis and Zagier. The first step in
this direction is a detailed study of the spectral properties of a family of
signed transfer operators $\PP^{\pm}_{q}$ associated to the Farey map.
