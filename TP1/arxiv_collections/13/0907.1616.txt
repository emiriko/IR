During the past decade several observational and theoretical works provided
evidences of the binary nature of Eta Carinae. Nevertheless, there is still no
direct determination of the orbital parameters, and the different current
models give contradictory results. The orbit is, in general, assumed to
coincide with the Homunculus equator although the observations are not
conclusive. Among all systems, Eta Carinae has the advantage that it is
possible to observe both the direct emission of line transitions in the central
source and its reflection by the Homunculus, which are dependent on the orbital
inclination. In this work, we studied the orbital phase dependent hydrogen
Paschen spectra reflected by the SE lobe of the Homunculus to constrain the
orbital parameters of etaCar and determine its inclination with respect to the
Homunculus axis. Assuming that the emission excess is originated in the
wind-wind shock region we were able to model the latitude dependence of the
spectral line profiles. For the first time, we were able to estimate the
orbital inclination of etaCar with respect to the observer and to the
Homunculus axis. The best fit occurs for an orbital inclination to the line of
sight of i ~ 60 degrees, and i* ~ 35 degrees with respect to the Homunculus
axis, indicating that the angular momenta of the central object and the orbit
are not aligned. We were also able to fix the phase angle of conjunction as ~
-40 degrees, showing that the periastron passage occurs shortly after
conjunction.
