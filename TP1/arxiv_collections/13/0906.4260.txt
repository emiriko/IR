This thesis dissertation presents a prospect for a measurement of the charge
asymmetry of the W boson mass (MW+ - MW-) at the LHC within the ATLAS
experiment. This measurement is of primordial importance for the LHC
experimental program, both as a direct test of the charge sign independent
coupling of the W bosons to the fermions and as a mandatory preliminary step
towards the precision measurement of the charge averaged W boson mass. This
last pragmatic point can be understood since the LHC specific collisions will
provide unprecedented kinematics for the positive and negative channels while
the SPS and Tevatron collider produced W+ and W- on the same footing. For that
reason, the study of the asymmetries between W+ and W- in Drell--Yan like
processes (production of single W decaying into leptons), studied to extract
the properties of the W boson, is described thoroughly in this document. Then,
the prospect for a measurement of MW+ - MW- at the LHC is addressed in a
perspective intending to decrease as much as possible the systematic errors
that will inevitably comes from the misunderstanding of both phenomenological
and apparatus modeling. For that matter strategies have been devised
specifically for the present measurement to display robustness with respect to
the main uncertainties. These strategies consist of introducing new observables
along with considering specific LHC running modes and configurations of the
ATLAS tracker. Eventually we show that the present (2009) precision can be
improved at the LHC by a factor of 20 and argue that such a precision is beyond
the reach of the standard measurement and calibration methods imported to the
LHC from the Tevatron program.
