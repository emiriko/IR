The proximity of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism in the phase
diagram of iron arsenides, the apparently weak electron-phonon coupling and the
"resonance peak" in the superconducting spin excitation spectrum have fostered
the hypothesis of magnetically mediated Cooper pairing. However, since most
theories of superconductivity are based on a pairing boson of sufficient
spectral weight in the normal state, detailed knowledge of the spin excitation
spectrum above the superconducting transition temperature Tc is required to
assess the viability of this hypothesis. Using inelastic neutron scattering we
have studied the spin excitations in optimally doped BaFe1.85Co0.15As2 (Tc = 25
K) over a wide range of temperatures and energies. We present the results in
absolute units and find that the normal state spectrum carries a weight
comparable to underdoped cuprates. In contrast to cuprates, however, the
spectrum agrees well with predictions of the theory of nearly antiferromagnetic
metals, without complications arising from a pseudogap or competing
incommensurate spin-modulated phases. We also show that the temperature
evolution of the resonance energy follows the superconducting energy gap, as
expected from conventional Fermi-liquid approaches. Our observations point to a
surprisingly simple theoretical description of the spin dynamics in the iron
arsenides and provide a solid foundation for models of magnetically mediated
superconductivity.
