I review the progress made in extracting transport properties of the
quark-gluon plasma from lattice QCD simulations. The information on shear and
bulk viscosity, the "low-energy constants" of hydrodynamics, is encoded in the
retarded correlators of Tmunu, the energy-momentum tensor. Euclidean
correlators, computable on the lattice, are related to the retarded correlators
by an integral transform. The most promising strategy to extract shear and bulk
viscosity is to study the shear and sound channel correlators where the
hydrodynamic modes dominate. I present preliminary results from a comprehensive
study of the gluonic plasma between 0.95Tc and 4.0Tc.
