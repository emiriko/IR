In the paper we present analytical calculations of the profiles and average
values correlation radius of polarization fluctuations and generalized
susceptibility in thin ferroelectric films of thickness L with in-plane
(a-films) and out-of-plane (c-films) polarization orientation. The contribution
of polarization gradient, surface energy and depolarization field (if any) were
taken into account. For the second order ferroelectrics the correlation radius
and generalized susceptibility diverge at the film critical thickness Lcr as
anticipated. In the case of a-films where depolarization field is absent, the
surface energy and polarization gradient govern the size effects such as
thickness-induced phase transition, corresponding correlation radius and
generalize susceptibility divergence in the phase transition point. In the case
of c-films with strong depolarization field, the surface energy, polarization
gradient, intrinsic depolarization effect related with polarization
inhomogeneous distribution and incomplete screening in the electrodes determine
the correlation radius and generalized susceptibility size effect. At that
contribution of all the factors are comparable at reasonable material
parameters, but could be easily tuned by varying of surface energy
coefficients, polarization gradient contribution and screening conditions.
