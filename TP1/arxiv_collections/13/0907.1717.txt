The Connes-Kreimer renormalization Hopf algebras are examples of a canonical
quantization procedure for pre-Lie algebras. We give a simple construction of
this quantization using the universal enveloping algebra for so-called twisted
Lie algebras (Lie algebras in the category of symmetric sequences of
k-modules). As an application, we obtain a simple proof of the (quantized) PBW
theorem for Lie algebras which come from a pre-Lie product (over an arbitrary
commutative ring). More generally, we observe that the quantization and the PBW
theorem extend to pre-Lie algebras in arbitrary abelian symmetric monoidal
categories with limits. We also extend a PBW theorem of Stover for connected
twisted Lie algebras to this categorical setting.
