The quantum corrections to the energies of the $\Gamma$ point optical phonon
modes (Kohn anomalies) in graphene nanoribbons are investigated. We show
theoretically that the longitudinal optical modes undergo a Kohn anomaly
effect, while the transverse optical modes do not. In relation to Raman
spectroscopy, we show that the longitudinal modes are not Raman active near the
zigzag edge, while the transverse optical modes are not Raman active near the
armchair edge. These results are useful for identifying the orientation of the
edge of graphene nanoribbons by G band Raman spectroscopy, as is demonstrated
experimentally. The differences in the Kohn anomalies for nanoribbons and for
metallic single wall nanotubes are pointed out, and our results are explained
in terms of pseudospin effects.
