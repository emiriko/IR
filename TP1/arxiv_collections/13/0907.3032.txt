We investigate the low-lying compression modes of a unitary Fermi gas with
imbalanced spin populations. For low polarization, the strong coupling between
the two spin components leads to a hydrodynamic behavior of the cloud. For
large population imbalance we observe a decoupling of the oscillations of the
two spin components, giving access to the effective mass of the Fermi polaron,
a quasi-particle composed of an impurity dressed by particle-hole pair
excitations in a surrounding Fermi sea. We find $m^*/m=1.17(10)$, in agreement
with the most recent theoretical predictions.
