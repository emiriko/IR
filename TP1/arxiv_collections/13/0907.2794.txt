Parameter-dependent statistical properties of spectra of totally connected
irregular quantum graphs with Neumann boundary conditions are studied. The
autocorrelation functions of level velocities c(x) and c(w,x) as well as the
distributions of level curvatures and avoided crossing gaps are calculated. The
numerical results are compared with the predictions of Random Matrix Theory
(RMT) for Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) and for coupled GOE matrices. The
application of coupled GOE matrices was justified by studying localization
phenomena in graphs' wave functions Psi(x) using the Inverse Participation
Ratio (IPR) and the amplitude distribution P(Psi(x)).
