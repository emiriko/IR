We study classes of models which are based on some discrete family symmetry
which is completely broken such that the observed neutrino flavour symmetry
emerges indirectly as an accidental symmetry. For such "indirect" models we
discuss the D-term flavon vacuum alignments which are required for such an
accidental flavour symmetry consistent with tri-bimaximal lepton mixing to
emerge. We identify large classes of suitable discrete family symmetries,
namely the $\Delta(3n^2)$ and $\Delta(6n^2)$ groups, together with other
examples such as $Z_7\rtimes Z_3$. In such indirect models the implementation
of the type I see-saw mechanism is straightforward using constrained sequential
dominance. However the accidental neutrino flavour symmetry may be easily
violated, for example leading to a large reactor angle, while maintaining
accurately the tri-bimaximal solar and atmospheric predictions.
