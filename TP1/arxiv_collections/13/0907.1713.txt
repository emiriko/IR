In this paper, the off-diagonal geometric phase of thermal state in hydrogen
atom under the effects of external magnetic field is considered. Increasing
temperature tends to suppress the off-diagonal geometric phase, including
1-order and 2-order cases. On the other hand, the relationship between the
geometric phase and external magnetic field is discussed.
