In this paper we derive relations between the local resistivities inside the
interfacial region and the overall resistances of the surface between two
phases for a mixture. These resistivities are the coefficients in the
force-flux relations for the stationary heat and mass transfer through the
interface. We have shown that interfacial resistances depend among other things
on the enthalpy profile across the interface. Since this variation is
substantial (the enthalpy of evaporation is one of the main differences between
liquid and vapor phases) the interfacial resistivities are also substantial.
Particularly, surface put up much more resistance to the heat and mass transfer
then the homogeneous phase. This is the case not only for the pure heat
conduction and diffusion but also for the cross effects like thermal diffusion.
