In this second of the set of two papers on Lie symmetry analysis of a class
of Li\'enard type equation of the form $\ddot {x} + f(x)\dot {x} + g(x)= 0$,
where over dot denotes differentiation with respect to time and $f(x)$ and
$g(x)$ are smooth functions of their variables, we isolate the equations which
possess maximal Lie point symmetries. It is well known that any second order
nonlinear ordinary differential equation which admits eight parameter Lie point
symmetries is linearizable to free particle equation through point
transformation. As a consequence all the identified equations turn out to be
linearizable. We also show that one can get maximal Lie point symmetries for
the above Li\'enard equation only when $f_{xx} =0$ (subscript denotes
differentiation). In addition, we discuss the linearising transformations and
solutions for all the nonlinear equations identified in this paper.
