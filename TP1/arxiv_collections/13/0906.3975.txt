A new approach to design wavelength insensitive optical power splitter is
presented. First coupled-mode theory is cast in operatorial form. This allows
to solve the equivalent of coupled differential equations as simple limits. The
operators are then represented on a generalized Poincare sphere, and the
resulting graphical tool is applied to different structures, giving a clear
interpretation of previous results in literature as well as hints on how to
find improved solutions.
