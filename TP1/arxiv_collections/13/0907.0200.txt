According to quantum chromodynamics, matter at ultra-high density and low
temperature is a quark liquid, with a condensate of Cooper pairs of quarks near
the Fermi surface ("color superconductivity"). This paper reviews the physics
of color superconductivity, and discusses some of the proposed signatures by
which we might detect quark matter in neutron stars.
