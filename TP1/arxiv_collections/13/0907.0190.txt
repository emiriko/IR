We investigate a possibility of precision measurements for parameters of the
Littlest Higgs model with T-parity at the International Linear Collider (ILC).
The model predicts new gauge bosons which masses strongly depend on the vacuum
expectation value that breaks a global symmetry of the model. Through Monte
Carlo simulations of production processes of new gauge bosons, we show that
these masses can be determined very accurately at the ILC for a representative
parameter point of the model. From the simulation result, we also discuss the
determination of other model parameters at the ILC.
