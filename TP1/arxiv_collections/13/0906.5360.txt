For the Kac-Wakimoto hierarchy constructed from the principal vertex operator
realization of the basic representation of the affine Lie algebra $D_n^{(1)}$,
we compute the coefficients of the corresponding Hirota bilinear equations, and
verify the coincidence of these bilinear equations with the ones that are
satisfied by Givental's total descendant potential of the $D_n$ singularity, as
conjectured by Givental and Milanov in \cite{GM}
