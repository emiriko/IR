We study spatial analyticity properties of solutions of the Navier-Stokes
equations and obtain new growth rate estimates for the analyticity radius. We
also study stability properties of strong global solutions of the Navier-Stokes
equations with data in H^r, r greater or equal 1/2, and prove a stability
result for the analyticity radius.
