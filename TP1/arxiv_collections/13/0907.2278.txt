A new example of $(2+1)$-dimensional Zollfrei metric, with the topology $R^2
\times S^1 $, is presented. This metric is readily obtained from the celebrated
$(3+1)$- dimensional rotating G\"odel universe $G_{3,1}$. This is because
$G_{3,1}$ has the interesting property that, the light rays which are confined
to move on the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis, return to their origin
after a time period $T = \frac{2 \pi}{\omega}[\sqrt{2}-1]$ -where $\omega$ is
the angular velocity of the universe. Hence by - the topological identification
of pairs of points on the time coordinate, seperated by the time interval $T$.
and droping the flat $x_3$ coordinate - which is directed along the rotation
axis; one obtains the $(2+1)$-dimensional Zollfrei metric with the $R^2 \times
S^1$ topology.
