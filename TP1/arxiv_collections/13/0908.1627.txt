In late 2006, ground-based photometry of $\eta$ Car plus the Homunculus
showed an unexpected decrease in its integrated apparent brightness, an
apparent reversal of its long-term brightening. Subsequent HST/WFPC2 photometry
of the central star in the near-UV showed that this was not a simple reversal.
This multi-wavelength photometry did not support increased extinction by dust
as the explanation for the decrease in brightness. A spectrum obtained with
GMOS on the Gemini-South telescope, revealed subtle changes mid-way in $\eta$
Car's 5.5 yr spectroscopic cycle 0when compared with HST/STIS spectra at the
same phase in the cycle. At mid-cycle the secondary star is 20--30 AU from the
primary. We suggest that the spectroscopic changes are consistent with
fluctuations in the density and velocity of the primary star's wind, unrelated
to the 5.5 yr cycle but possibly related to its latitude-dependent morphology.
We also discuss subtle effects that must be taken into account when comparing
ground-based and HST/STIS spectra.
