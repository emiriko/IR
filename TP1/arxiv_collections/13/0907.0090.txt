We estimate the two-photon exchange corrections to both proton and neutron
electromagnetic physical observables in a relativistic light cone quark model.
At a fixed momentum transfer the corrections are found to be small in
magnitudes, but with a strong angular dependence. Our results are comparable to
those from simple hadronic model in a moderate momentum transfer region.
