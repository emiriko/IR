We present the chiral odd generalized parton distributions (GPDs) for
non-zero skewness $\zeta$ in transverse and longitudinal position spaces by
taking Fourier transform with respect to the transverse and longitudinal
momentum transfer respectively using overlaps of light-front wave functions
(LFWFs) in a simple model. We also present the chiral even GPDs in positon
space in a phenomenological model.
