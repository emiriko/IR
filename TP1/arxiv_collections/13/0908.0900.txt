We study the one-loop quantum corrections for higher-derivative superfield
theories, generalizing the approach for calculating the superfield effective
potential. In particular, we calculate the effective potential for two versions
of higher-derivative chiral superfield models. We point out that the
equivalence of the higher-derivative theory for the chiral superfield and the
one without higher derivatives but with an extended number of chiral
superfields occurs only when the mass term is contained in the general
Lagrangian. The presence of divergences can be taken as an indication of this
equivalence.
