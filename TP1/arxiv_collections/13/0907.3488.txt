A detailed study of emission lines from Fe VII, Fe VIII and Fe IX observed by
the EUV Imaging Spectrometer on board the Hinode satellite is presented.
Spectra in the ranges 170-212 A and 246-292 A show strongly enhanced lines from
the upper solar transition region (temperatures 5.4 <= log T <= 5.9) allowing a
number of new line identifications to be made. Comparisons of Fe VII lines with
predictions from a new atomic model reveal new plasma diagnostics, however
there are a number of disagreements between theory and observation for emission
line ratios insensitive to density and temperature, suggesting improved atomic
data are required. Line ratios for Fe VIII also show discrepancies with theory,
with the strong 185.21 and 186.60 lines under-estimated by 60-80 % compared to
lines between 192 and 198 A. A newly-identified multiplet between 253.9 and
255.8 A offers excellent temperature diagnostic opportunities relative to the
lines between 185-198 A, however the atomic model under-estimates the strength
of these lines by factors 3-6. Two new line identifications are made for Fe IX
at wavelengths 176.959 A and 177.594 A, while seven other lines between 186 and
200 A are suggested to be due to Fe IX but for which transition identifications
can not be made. The new atomic data for Fe VII and Fe IX are demonstrated to
significantly modify models for the response function of the TRACE 195 A
imaging channel, affecting temperature determinations from this channel. The
data will also affect the response functions for other solar EUV imaging
instruments such as SOHO/EIT, STEREO/EUVI and the upcoming AIA instrument on
the Solar Dynamics Observatory.
