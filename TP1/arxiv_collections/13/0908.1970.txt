We calculate the electron spectral functions at the edges of the Moore-Read
Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian fractional quantum Hall states, in the clean limit.
We show that their qualitative differences can be probed using momentum
resolved tunneling, thus providing a method to unambiguously distinguish which
one is realized in the fractional quantum Hall state observed at filling factor
$\nu=5/2$. We further argue that edge reconstruction, which may be less
important in the first excited Landau level (LL) than in the lowest LL, can
also be detected this way if present.
