The LAT instrument on the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope is performing an
all-sky survey from 20 MeV to 300 GeV with unprecedented statistics and angular
resolution. This is providing a wealth of new information on the non-thermal
emission from the Galactic interstellar medium with implications for cosmic
rays and Galactic structure. First results at intermediate latitudes have
already shown good agreement with predictions based on direct measurements of
cosmic rays, suggesting that at least the local (within about 1 kpc from the
Sun) gamma-ray emission is understood. We will present the first spectra from
regions over the sky using the LAT data, and profiles for selected energies.
The aim here is to evaluate the agreement with the models and assess what we
can expect to learn as this analysis matures.
