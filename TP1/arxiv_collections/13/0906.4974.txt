We present XMM observations of the AGN SDSS 1430-0011. The low S/N spectrum
of this source obtained in a snap shot Chandra observation showed an unusually
flat continuum. With the follow up XMM observations we find that the source
spectrum is complex; it either has an ionized absorber or a partially covering
absorber. The underlying power-law is in the normal range observed for AGNs.
The low luminosity of the source during Chandra observations can be understood
in terms of variations in the absorber properties. The X-ray and optical
properties of this source are such that it cannot be securely classified as
either a narrow line Seyfert 1 or a broad line Seyfert 1 galaxy.
