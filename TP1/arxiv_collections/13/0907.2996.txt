A unified approach to decoherence and relaxation of energy resolved single
electron excitations in Integer Quantum Hall edge channels is presented. Within
the bosonization framework, relaxation and decoherence induced by interactions
and capacitive coupling to an external linear circuit are computed. An explicit
connexion with high frequency transport properties of a two terminal device
formed by the edge channel on one side and the linear circuit on the other side
is established.
