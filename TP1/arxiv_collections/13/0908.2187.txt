We present a complete treatment of the diffusion processes for supersymmetric
electroweak baryogenesis that characterizes transport dynamics ahead of the
phase transition bubble wall within the symmetric phase. In particular, we
generalize existing approaches to distinguish between chemical potentials of
particles and their superpartners. This allows us to test the assumption of
superequilibrium (equal chemical potentials for particles and sparticles) that
has usually been made in earlier studies. We show that in the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model, superequilibrium is generically maintained --
even in the absence of fast supergauge interactions -- due to the presence of
Yukawa interactions. We provide both analytic arguments as well as illustrative
numerical examples. We also extend the latter to regions where analytical
approximations are not available since down-type Yukawa couplings or supergauge
interactions only incompletely equilibrate. We further comment on cases of
broken superequilibrium wherein a heavy superpartner decouples from the
electroweak plasma, causing a kinematic bottleneck in the chain of
equilibrating reactions. Such situations may be relevant for baryogenesis
within extensions of the MSSM. We also provide a compendium of inputs required
to characterize the symmetric phase transport dynamics.
