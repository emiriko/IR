We show that graphene-based quantum pumps can tap into evanescent modes,
which penetrate deeply into the device as a consequence of Klein tunneling. The
evanescent modes dominate pumping at the Dirac point, and give rise to a
universal response under weak driving for short and wide pumps, in close
analogy to their role for the minimal conductivity in ballistic transport. In
contrast, evanescent modes contribute negligibly to normal pumps. Our findings
add a new incentive for the exploration of graphene-based nanoelectronic
devices.
