When an oscillating line source is placed in front of a special mirror
consisting of an array of flat uniformly spaced ferrite rods, half of the image
disappeared at some frequency. We believe that this comes from the coupling to
photonic states of the magnetic surface plasmon band. These states exhibit
giant circulations that only go in one direction due to time reversal symmetry
breaking. Possible applications of this "rectifying" reflection include a
robust one-way waveguide, a 90 degree beam bender and a beam splitter, which
are shown to work even in the deep subwavelength scale.
