In this talk I discuss the use of calorimeter timing both for detector
commissioning and in searches for new physics. In particular I present real and
simulated cosmic ray muons data results for the ATLAS Tile Calorimeter system.
The analysis shows that several detector errors such as imperfect calibrations
can be uncovered. I also demonstrate the use of ATLAS Tile Calorimeters
excellent timing resolution in suppressing cosmic ray fake missing transverse
energy in searches for supersymmetry.
