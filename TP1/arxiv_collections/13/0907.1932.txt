We have studied the coherent intercavity coupling of the evanescent fields of
the whispering gallery modes of two terahertz quantum-cascade lasers
implemented as microdisk cavities. The electrically pumped single-mode
operating microcavities allow to electrically control the coherent mode
coupling for proximity distances of the cavities up to 30-40 \mu\m. The optical
emission of the strongest coupled photonic molecule can be perfectly switched
by the electrical modulation of only one of the coupled microdisks. The
threshold characteristics of the strongest coupled photonic molecule
demonstrates the linear dependence of the gain of a quantum-cascade laser on
the applied electric field.
