Signal-processing molecules inside cells are often present at low copy
number, which necessitates probabilistic models to account for intrinsic noise.
Probability distributions have traditionally been found using simulation-based
approaches which then require estimating the distributions from many samples.
Here we present in detail an alternative method for directly calculating a
probability distribution by expanding in the natural eigenfunctions of the
governing equation, which is linear. We apply the resulting spectral method to
three general models of stochastic gene expression: a single gene with multiple
expression states (often used as a model of bursting in the limit of two
states), a gene regulatory cascade, and a combined model of bursting and
regulation. In all cases we find either analytic results or numerical
prescriptions that greatly outperform simulations in efficiency and accuracy.
In the last case, we show that bimodal response in the limit of slow switching
is not only possible but optimal in terms of information transmission.
