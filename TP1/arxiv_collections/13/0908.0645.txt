We review pitfalls in recent efforts to make a conventional semiconductor,
namely ZnO, ferromagnetic by means of doping with transition metal ions. Since
the solubility of those elements is rather low, formation of secondary phases
and the creation of defects upon low temperature processing can lead to
unwanted magnetic effects. Among others, ion implantation is a method of
doping, which is highly suited for the investigation of those effects. By
focussing mainly on Fe, Co or Ni implanted ZnO single crystals we show that
there are manifold sources for ferromagnetism in this material which can easily
be confused with the formation of a ferromagnetic diluted magnetic
semiconductor (DMS). We will focus on metallic as well as oxide precipitates
and the difficulties of their identification.
