I review constraints on the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson from high energy
electroweak (EW) precision data. The same data set also strongly limits various
mixing effects of hypothetical extra neutral gauge bosons (Z') with the
ordinary Z. I also discuss low energy precision measurements which are
sensitive to other aspects of Z' physics, such as the direct exchange amplitude
and the flavor or CP violating sectors.
