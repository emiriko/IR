We place constraints on the formation redshifts for blue globular clusters
(BGCs), independent of the details of hydrodynamics and population III star
formation. The observed radial distribution of BGCs in the Milky Way Galaxy
suggests that they formed in biased dark matter halos at high redshift. As a
result, simulations of a ~1 Mpc box up to z~10 must resolve BGC formation in
LCDM. We find that most halo stars could be produced from destroyed BGCs and
other low-mass clusters that formed at high redshift. We present a
proof-of-concept simulation that captures the formation of globular-like star
clusters.
