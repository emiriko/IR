We give a characterization of the minimal tropical half-spaces containing a
given tropical polyhedron, from which we derive a counter example showing that
the number of such minimal half-spaces can be infinite, contradicting some
statements which appeared in the tropical literature, and disproving a
conjecture of F. Block and J. Yu. We also establish an analogue of the
Minkowski-Weyl theorem, showing that a tropical polyhedron can be equivalently
represented internally (in terms of extreme points and rays) or externally (in
terms of half-spaces containing it). A canonical external representation of a
polyhedron turns out to be provided by the extreme elements of its tropical
polar. We characterize these extreme elements, showing in particular that they
are determined by support vectors.
