We propose a simplification of the full "2 sets" Time dependent Self
Interaction Correction (TD-SIC) method, applying the Optimized Effective
Potential (OEP) method. The new resulting scheme is called time-dependent
"Generalized SIC-OEP". A straightforward approximation, using the spatial
localization of one set of orbitals, leads to the "Generalized SIC-Slater"
formalism. We show that it represents a great improvement compared to the
traditional SIC-Slater/KLI formalisms.
