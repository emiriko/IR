We consider the following question, motivated by the enumeration of
fullerenes. A fullerene patch is a 2-connected plane graph G in which inner
faces have length 5 or 6, non-boundary vertices have degree 3, and boundary
vertices have degree 2 or 3. The degree sequence along the boundary is called
the boundary code of G. We show that the question whether a given sequence S is
a boundary code of some fullerene patch can be answered in polynomial time when
such patches have at most five 5-faces. We conjecture that our algorithm gives
the correct answer for any number of 5-faces, and sketch how to extend the
algorithm to the problem of counting the number of different patches with a
given boundary code.
