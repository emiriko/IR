One of Jefferson Lab's original missions was to further our understanding of
the short-distance structure of nuclei. In particular, to understand what
happens when two or more nucleons within a nucleus have strongly overlapping
wave-functions; a phenomena commonly referred to as short-range correlations.
Herein, we review the results of the (e,e'), (e,e'p) and (e,e'pN) reactions
that have been used at Jefferson Lab to probe this short-distance structure as
well as provide an outlook for future experiments.
