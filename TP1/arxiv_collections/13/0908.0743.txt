We show that the assembly of the Solar System terrestrial planets can be
successfully modelled with all of the mass initially confined to a narrow
annulus between 0.7 and 1.0 AU. With this configuration, analogues of Mercury
and Mars often form from the collisional evolution of material diffusing out of
the annulus under the scattering of the forming Earth and Venus analogues. The
final systems also possess eccentricities and inclinations that match the
observations, without recourse to dynamical friction from remnant small body
populations. Finally, the characteristic assembly timescale for Earth analogues
is rapid in this model, and consistent with cosmochemical models based on the
$^{182}$Hf--$^{182}$W isotopes. The agreement between this model and the
observations suggests that terrestrial planet systems may also be formed in
`planet traps', as has been proposed recently for the cores of giant planets in
our solar system and others.
