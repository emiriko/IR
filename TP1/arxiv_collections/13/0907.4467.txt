Interstellar extinction is investigated in a 1.5 square degree area in the
direction of the reflection nebula NGC 7023 at l = 104.1 deg, b = +14.2 deg.
The study is based on photometric classification and the determination of
interstellar extinctions and distances of 480 stars down to V = 16.5 mag from
photometry in the Vilnius seven-color system published in Paper I (2008). The
investigated area is divided into five smaller subareas with slightly different
dependence of the extinction on distance. The distribution of reddened stars is
in accordance with the presence of two dust clouds at 282 pc and 715 pc,
however in some directions the dust distribution can be continuous or more
clouds can be present.
