We report the first measurement of high order cumulants of the current
fluctuations in an avalanche diode run through by a stationary dc current. Such
a system is archetypic of devices in which transport is governed by a
collective mechanism, here charge multiplication by avalanche. We have measured
the first 5 cumulants of the probability distribution of the current
fluctuations. We show that the charge multiplication factor is distributed
according to a power law that is different from that of the usual avalanche
below breakdown, when avalanches are well separated.
