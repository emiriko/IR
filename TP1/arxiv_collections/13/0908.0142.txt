1ES 1218+304 is among a group of several TeV blazars that exhibit
surprisingly hard energy spectra given their redshifts. The VERITAS
collaboration has carried out an intensive observing campaign of 1ES 1218+304
in early 2009 to characterize the emission properties of one of these
hard-spectra distant blazars in more detail. While hard-spectra TeV blazars are
most promising for unveiling putative signatures from EBL absorption, they may
also have implications on shock acceleration scenarios in relativistic jets.
Our observations of 1ES 1218+304 demonstrate significant flux variability.
Furthermore, we present an energy spectrum extending into the multi-TeV regime.
The implications of these data for $\gamma$-ray emission models are discussed.
