Circumstellar discs are expected to be the nursery of planets. Grain growth
within such discs is the first step in the planet formation process. The Bok
globule CB 26 harbours such a young disc. We present a detailed model of the
edge-on circumstellar disc and its envelope in the Bok globule CB 26. The model
is based on HST near-infrared maps in the I, J, H, and K bands, OVRO and SMA
radio maps at 1.1mm, 1.3mm and 2.7mm, and the spectral energy distribution
(SED) from 0.9 microns to 3mm. New photometric and spectroscopic data from the
Spitzer Space Telescope and the Caltech Submilimeter Observatory have been
obtained and are part of our analysis. Using the self-consistent radiative
transfer code MC3D, the model we construct is able to discriminate parameter
sets and dust properties of both its parts, namely envelope and disc. We find
that the disc has an inner hole with a radius of 45 +/- 5 AU. Based on a dust
model including silicate and graphite the maximum grain size needed to
reproduce the spectral millimetre index is 2.5 microns. Features seen in the
near-infrared images, dominated by scattered light, can be described as a
result of a rotating envelope. Successful employment of ISM dust in both the
disc and envelope hint that grain growth may not yet play a significant role
for the appearance of this system. A larger inner hole gives rise to the
assumption that CB 26 is a circumbinary disc.
