This note concerns a one-line diagrammatic proof of the Cayley-Hamilton
Theorem. We discuss the proof's implications regarding the "core truth" of the
theorem, and provide a generalization. We review the notation of trace diagrams
and exhibit explicit diagrammatic descriptions of the coefficients of the
characteristic polynomial, which occur as the n+1 "simplest" trace diagrams. We
close with a discussion of diagrammatic polarization related to the theorem.
