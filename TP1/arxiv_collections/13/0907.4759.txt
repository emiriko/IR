In the lenticular galaxy NGC1023 a third population of globular clusters
(GCs), called faint fuzzies (FFs), was discovered next to the blue and red GC
populations by Larsen & Brodie. While these FFs have colors comparable to the
red population, the new population is fainter, larger (R_eff > 7 pc) and, most
importantly, shows clear signs of co-rotation with the galactic disk of
NGC1023. We present N-body simulations verifying the hypothesis that these
disk-associated FFs are related to the young massive cluster complexes (CCs)
observed by Bastian et. al in M51, who discovered a mass-radius relation for
these CCs. Our models have an initial configuration based on the observations
from M51 and are placed on various orbits in a galactic potential derived for
NGC1023. All computations end up with a stable object containing 10 to 60% of
the initial CC mass after an integration time of 5 Gyr. A conversion to visual
magnitudes demonstrates that the resulting objects cover exactly the observed
range for FFs. Moreover, the simulated objects show projected half-mass radii
between 3.6 and 13.4 pc, in good agreement with the observed FF sizes. We
conclude that objects like the young massive CCs in M51 are likely progenitors
of the FFs observed in NGC1023.
