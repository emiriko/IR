We undertook searches for isolated galaxies based on automatic selection of
infrared sources from the Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) followed by a
visual inspection of their surrounding. Using a modified criterion by
Karachentseva (1973), we compiled a catalog of 3227 isolated galaxies (2MIG)
containing 6% of 2MASS Extended Sources (2MASX) brighter than $K_s = 12^m$ with
angular diameters $a_K \geq 30\arcsec$.
  The most isolated 2493 galaxies among them enter in the 2MASS Very Isolated
Galaxy Catalog, 2MVIG. Being situated in the regions of extremely low mass
density, the 2MVIG galaxies can serve as a reference sample for investigation
the influence of environment on structure and evolution of galaxies.
