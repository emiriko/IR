The actual transition from IPv4 to IPv6 requires network administrators to
become aware of the next generation protocol and the associated risk
problems.Due to the scale and complexity of current internet architecture how
to protect from the existing investment and reduce the negative influence to
users and service providers during the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 is a very
important future topic for the advanced version of an internet
architecture.This paper summarizes and compares the IPv6 transition mechanism
methods like Dual Stack,Tunneling issues like IPv6 Automatic tunneling and
manually configured tunneling considerations, the IPv6 transition
scenarios,IPv6 transition security problems,highlights IPv6 and IPv4 threat
review with automatic tunneling and configuration tunneling considerations.In
this paper we have proposed a transitional threat model for automatic tunneling
and a configuration tunneling that could be followed by the University of
Mysore(UoM),to estimate automatic tunneling and a manually configured tunneling
threat review issues.Furthermore,there are different tunneling mechanisms such
as IPv6 over IPv4 GRE Tunnel,Tunnel broker,Automatic IPv4 Compatible Tunnel and
Automatic 6 to 4 Tunnel and also outlines many of the common known threats
against IPv6 and then it compares and contrast how these threats are similar
ones,might affect an IPv6 network.
