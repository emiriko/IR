Different theoretical models predict VHE gamma-ray emission to arise in tight
binary star systems (high mass-loss and high wind speeds), which has not been
confirmed experimentally so far. Here we present the first bounds on the VHE
emission from two isolated Wolf-Rayet star binaries, WR147 and WR146, obtained
with the MAGIC telescope.
