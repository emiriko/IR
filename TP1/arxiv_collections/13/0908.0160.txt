Byzantine agreement algorithms typically assume implicit initial state
consistency and synchronization among the correct nodes and then operate in
coordinated rounds of information exchange to reach agreement based on the
input values. The implicit initial assumptions enable correct nodes to infer
about the progression of the algorithm at other nodes from their local state.
This paper considers a more severe fault model than permanent Byzantine
failures, one in which the system can in addition be subject to severe
transient failures that can temporarily throw the system out of its assumption
boundaries. When the system eventually returns to behave according to the
presumed assumptions it may be in an arbitrary state in which any
synchronization among the nodes might be lost, and each node may be at an
arbitrary state. We present a self-stabilizing Byzantine agreement algorithm
that reaches agreement among the correct nodes in an optimal ration of faulty
to correct, by using only the assumption of eventually bounded message
transmission delay. In the process of solving the problem, two additional
important and challenging building blocks were developed: a unique
self-stabilizing protocol for assigning consistent relative times to protocol
initialization and a Reliable Broadcast primitive that progresses at the speed
of actual message delivery time.
