We propose to apply Ramsey's method of separated oscillating fields to the
spectroscopy of the quantum states in the gravity potential above a vertical
mirror. This method allows a precise measurement of quantum mechanical
phaseshifts of a Schr\"odinger wave packet bouncing off a hard surface in the
gravitational field of the earth. Measurements with ultra-cold neutrons will
offer a sensitivity to Newton's law or hypothetical short-ranged interactions,
which is about 21 orders of magnitude below the energy scale of
electromagnetism.
