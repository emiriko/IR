We calculate the spectrum of the relic gravitational wave due to the
trans-Planckian effect in which the standard linear dispersion relations may be
modified. Of the modified dispersion relations suggested in literatures which
have investigated the trans-Planckian effect, we especially use the
Corley-Jacobson dispersion relations. The Corley-Jacobson type modified
dispersion relations can be obtained from Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity which is
non-relativistic and UV complete. Although it is not clear how the transitions
from Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity in the UV regime to Einstein gravity in the IR
limit occur, we assume Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity regime is followed by the
inflationary phase in Einstein gravity.
