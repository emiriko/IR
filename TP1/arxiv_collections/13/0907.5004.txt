Charmonia suppression is one of the main signatures for the formation of a
deconfined medium. However, also nuclear effects, not related to the production
of a hot medium, can affect the J/psi yield. The determination, from the study
of p-A collisions, of the J/psi behaviour in nuclear matter is, therefore,
extremely important to correctly quantify the amount of charmonia suppression
induced by the deconfined medium. In this paper the new NA60 results collected
at 158 GeV incident energy, i.e. under the same kinematical conditions as the
In-In (NA60) and Pb-Pb (NA50) data, are presented and compared with p-A
measurements from other fixed target experiments. Results on A-A collisions are
also reviewed taking into account the new available information on the
influence of cold nuclear matter on the J/psi production yield. Finally,
results on the J/psi polarization are shown for p-A and A-A collisions.
