We present a procedure to evaluate the action for dielectric branes in
non-trivial backgrounds. These backgrounds must be capable to be taken into a
Kaluza-Klein form, with some non-zero wrapping factor. We derive the way this
wrapping factor is gauged away. Examples of this are AdS_5xS^5 and
AdS_3xS^3xT^4, where we perform the construction of different stable systems,
which stability relies in its dielectric character.
