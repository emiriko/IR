CuCrS2 is a triangular lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet with a rhombohedral
crystal structure. We report on neutron and synchrotron powder diffraction
results which reveal a monoclinic lattice distortion at the magnetic transition
and verify a magnetoelastic coupling. CuCrS2 is therefore an interesting
material to study the influence of magnetism on the relief of geometrical
frustration.
