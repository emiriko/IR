We report new results on nearly conformal gauge theories with fermions in the
fundamental representation of the SU(3) color gauge group as the number of
fermion flavors is varied in the Nf = 4-16 range. To unambiguously identify the
chirally broken phase below the conformal window we apply a comprehensive
lattice tool set in finite volumes which includes the test of Goldstone pion
dynamics, the spectrum of the fermion Dirac operator, and eigenvalue
distributions of random matrix theory. We also discuss the theory inside the
conformal window and present our first results on the running of the
renormalized gauge coupling and the renormalization group beta function. The
importance of understanding finite volume zero momentum gauge field dynamics
inside the conformal window is illustrated. Staggered lattice fermions are used
throughout the calculations.
