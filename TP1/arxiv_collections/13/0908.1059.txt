This article analyses three methods of remote voting in an uncontrolled
environment: postal voting, internet voting and hybrid voting. It breaks down
the voting process into different stages and compares their vulnerabilities
considering criteria that must be respected in any democratic vote:
confidentiality, anonymity, transparency, vote unicity and authenticity.
Whether for safety or reliability, each vulnerability is quantified by three
parameters: size, visibility and difficulty to achieve. The study concludes
that the automatisation of treatments combined with the dematerialisation of
the objects used during an election tends to substitute visible vulnerabilities
of a lesser magnitude by invisible and widespread vulnerabilities.
