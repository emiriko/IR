The one-loop diffractive amplitude for emission of two real gluons with
widely different rapidities is studied in the Lipatov effective action
formalism. It is shown that after integration over longitudinal momenta in the
loop the resulting expression coincides with the one obtained by the
Lipatov-Bartels formalism in transversal space provided the same prescription
is used to exclude divergent contributions as previously proposed for emission
of a single real gluon.
