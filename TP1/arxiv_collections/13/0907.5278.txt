The refraction of linearly polarized plane waves into a half-space occupied
by a material moving at constant velocity was studied by directly implementing
the Lorentz transformations of electric and magnetic fields. From the
perspective of a co-moving observer, the moving material was a spatially local,
pseudochiral omega material. Numerical studies revealed that whether or not
negative refraction occurrs in the moving material depends upon the speed of
movement as well as the angle of incidence and the polarization state of the
incident plane wave. Furthermore, the phenomenons of negative phase velocity
and counterposition in the moving material were similarly found not to be
Lorentz covariant; both phenomenons were also found to be sensitive to the
angle of incidence and the polarization state of the incident plane wave.
