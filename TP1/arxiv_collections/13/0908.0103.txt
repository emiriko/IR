An interaction of electromagnetic field with metamaterial thin film
containing split-ring resonators with Josephson junctions is considered. It is
shown that dynamical self-inductance in a split rings results in reduction of
magnetic flux through a ring and this reduction is proportional to a time
derivative of split ring magnetization. Evolution of thin film magnetization
taking into account dynamical self-inductance is studied. New mechanism for
excitation of waves in one dimensional array of split-ring resonators with
Josephson junctions is proposed. Nonlinear magnetic susceptibility of such thin
films is obtained in the weak amplitude approximation.
