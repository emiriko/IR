The steady state of a Langevin equation with short ranged memory and coloured
noise is analyzed. When the fluctuation-dissipation theorem of second kind is
not satisfied, the dynamics is irreversible, i.e. detailed balance is violated.
We show that the entropy production rate for this system should include the
power injected by ``memory forces''. With this additional contribution, the
Fluctuation Relation is fairly verified in simulations. Both dynamics with
inertia and overdamped dynamics yield the same expression for this additional
power. The role of ``memory forces'' within the fluctuation-dissipation
relation of first kind is also discussed.
