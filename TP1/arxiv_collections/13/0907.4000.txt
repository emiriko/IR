In dynamic models of infectious disease transmission, typically various
mixing patterns are imposed on the so-called Who-Acquires-Infection-From-Whom
matrix (WAIFW). These imposed mixing patterns are based on prior knowledge of
age-related social mixing behavior rather than observations. Alternatively, one
can assume that transmission rates for infections transmitted predominantly
through non-sexual social contacts, are proportional to rates of conversational
contact which can be estimated from a contact survey. In general, however,
contacts reported in social contact surveys are proxies of those events by
which transmission may occur and there may exist age-specific characteristics
related to susceptibility and infectiousness which are not captured by the
contact rates. Therefore, in this paper, transmission is modeled as the product
of two age-specific variables: the age-specific contact rate and an
age-specific proportionality factor, which entails an improvement of fit for
the seroprevalence of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in Belgium. Furthermore,
we address the impact on the estimation of the basic reproduction number, using
non-parametric bootstrapping to account for different sources of variability
and using multi-model inference to deal with model selection uncertainty. The
proposed method makes it possible to obtain important information on
transmission dynamics that cannot be inferred from approaches traditionally
applied hitherto.
