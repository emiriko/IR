A non-canonical correspondence of the complete sets of solutions to the Dirac
and Klein-Gordon free equations in Minkowski space-time is established. This
allows for a novel viewpoint on the relationship of relativistic equations for
different spins and on the origin of spinor transformations. In particular,
starting from a solution to the Dirac equation, one obtains a chain of other
solutions to both Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations. A comparison with the
massless case is performed, and examples of non-trivial singular solutions are
presented. A generalization to Riemannian space-time and inclusion of
interactions are briefly discussed.
