We report results of spectroscopic and photometric observations of ten delta
Scuti stars and one eclipsing binary in the open cluster NGC1817, and of ten
delta Scuti stars and two other variables in the open cluster NGC7062. For all
targets in NGC1817 and for three targets in NGC7062, the radial velocity and
projected rotational velocity are determined. For all stars, the effective
temperature and surface gravity is measured. Two delta Scuti stars, NGC1817-V1
and NGC7062-V1, and the eclipsing binary, NGC1817-V18, are discovered to be
single-lined spectroscopic binaries. The eclipsing binary delta Scuti star
NGC1817-V4 is discovered to be a double-lined spectroscopic binary. All delta
Scuti stars which we observed spectroscopically are found to be moderate or
fast rotators.
