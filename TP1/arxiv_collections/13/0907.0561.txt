I have developed two numerical codes to investigate the dynamics of
collapsars. One is two-dimensional MHD code that are performed using the
Newtonian (ZEUS-2D) code where realistic equation of state, neutrino cooling
and heating processes are taken into account. The other one is two-dimensional
general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) code. I have performed
numerical simulations of collapsars using these codes and realistic progenitor
models. In the Newtonian code, it is found that neutrino heating processes are
not efficient enough to launch a jet in this study. It is also found that a jet
is launched mainly by toroidal fields that are amplified by the winding-up
effect. However, since the ratio of total energy relative to the rest-mass
energy in the jet is not as high as several hundred, we conclude that the jets
seen in this study are not GRB jets. In the GRMHD simulation, it is shown that
a jet is launched from the center of the progenitor. We also find that the mass
accretion rate after the launch of the jet shows rapid time variability that
resembles to a typical time profile of a GRB. We find that the energy flux per
unit rest-mass flux is as high as 10^2 at the bottom of the jet. Thus we
conclude that the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet can be potentially high when
it propagates outward. We also performed two-dimensional relativistic
hydrodynamic simulations of the collapsar model to investigate the explosive
nucleosynthesis happened there. It is found that the amount of 56Ni is very
sensitive to the energy deposition rate. Thus the synthesized 56Ni can be
little even if the total explosion energy is as large as 10^52 erg. We conclude
that some GRBs can associate with faint supernovae.
