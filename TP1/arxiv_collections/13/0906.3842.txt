Properties of scalar mesons below 1.0 GeV have been studied by regarding them
as hadronic molecular states. Using the effective Lagrangian approach, we have
calculated their leptonic decays, strong decays and productions via the $\phi$
meson radiative decays. Comparing our results with that given in the literature
and the data, we conclude that it is difficult to arrange them in the same
nonet if some of them are pure hadronic molecules.
