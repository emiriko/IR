We analyze coherent spin phenomena in triple quantum dots in triangular
configuration under crossed DC and AC magnetic fields. In particular, we
discuss the interplay between Aharonov-Bohm current oscillations, coherent
electron trapping and spin blockade under electron spin resonance conditions.
We demonstrate that, for certain field frequencies, AC magnetic fields induce
an antiresonant behavior in the current, allowing for both removal and
restoration of entangled spin blockaded states by tuning the AC field
frequency. Our theoretical predictions indicate how to manipulate spin qubits
in a triangular quantum dot array.
