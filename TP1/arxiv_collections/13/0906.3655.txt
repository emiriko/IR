We introduce a point-line incidence geometry in which the commutation
relations of the real Pauli group of multiple qubits are fully encoded. Its
points are pairs of Pauli operators differing in sign and each line contains
three pairwise commuting operators any of which is the product of the other two
(up to sign).
  We study the properties of its Veldkamp space enabling us to identify subsets
of operators which are distinguished from the geometric point of view. These
are geometric hyperplanes and pairwise intersections thereof.
  Among the geometric hyperplanes one can find the set of self-dual operators
with respect to the Wootters spin-flip operation well-known from studies
concerning multiqubit entanglement measures. In the two- and three-qubit cases
a class of hyperplanes gives rise to Mermin squares and other generalized
quadrangles. In the three-qubit case the hyperplane with points corresponding
to the 27 Wootters self-dual operators is just the underlying geometry of the
E6(6) symmetric entropy formula describing black holes and strings in five
dimensions.
