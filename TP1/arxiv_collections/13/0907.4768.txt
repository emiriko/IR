A model of charged hole-pair bosons, with long range Coulomb interactions and
very weak interlayer coupling, is used to calculate the order parameter -Phi-
of underdoped cuprates. Model parameters are extracted from experimental
superfluid densities and plasma frequencies. The temperature dependence
-Phi(T)- is characterized by a 'trapezoidal' shape. At low temperatures, it
declines slowly due to harmonic phase fluctuations which are suppressed by
anisotropic plasma gaps. Above the single layer Berezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless
(BKT) temperature, Phi(T) falls rapidly toward the three dimensional transition
temperature. The theoretical curves are compared to c-axis superfluid density
data by H. Kitano et al., (J. Low Temp. Phys. 117, 1241 (1999)) and to the
-transverse nodal velocity- measured by angular resolved photoemmission spectra
on BSCCO samples by W.S. Lee et al., (Nature 450, 81 (2007)), and by A.
Kanigel, et al., (Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 157001 (2007)).
