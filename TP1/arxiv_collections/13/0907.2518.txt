We consider a prototypical nonlinear system which can be stabilized by
multiplicative noise: an underdamped non-linear pendulum with a stochastically
vibrating pivot. A numerical solution of the pertinent Fokker-Planck equation
shows that the upper equilibrium point of the pendulum can become stable even
when the noise is white, and the "Kapitsa pendulum" effect is not at work. The
stabilization occurs in a strong-noise regime where WKB approximation does not
hold.
