We use QCD sum rules to test the nature of the meson X(3872), assumed to be a
mixture between charmonium and exotic molecular [c\bar{q}][q\bar{c}] states
with J^{PC}=1^{++}. We find that there is only a small range for the values of
the mixing angle, \theta, that can provide simultaneously good agreement with
the experimental value of the mass and the decay width, and this range is
\theta between 5 and 13 degrees. In this range we get m_X=(3.77 \pm 0.18) GeV
and \Gamma(X to J/\psi \pi^+ \pi^-)=(9.3 \pm 6.9) MeV, which are compatible,
within the errors, with the experimental values. We, therefore, conclude that
the X(3872) is approximately 97% a charmonium state with 3% admixture of \sim
88% D^0D^{*0} molecule and \sim 12% D^+D^{*-} molecule.
