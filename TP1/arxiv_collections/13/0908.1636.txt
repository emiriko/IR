In this paper we prove that the canonical seesaw mechanism can naturally be
implemented in a particular class of electro-weak SU(4)L x U(1)Y gauge models.
The resulting neutrino mass spectrum is determined by just tuning a unique free
parameter 'a' within the algebraical method of solving gauge models with high
symmetries. All the Standard Model phenomenology is preserved, being unaffected
by the new physics occuring at a high breaking scale m ~ 10^11GeV.
