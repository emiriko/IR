Jet-quenching and photon production at high transverse momentum are studied
at RHIC energies, together with the correlation between jets and photons. The
energy loss of hard partons traversing the hot QGP is evaluated in the AMY
formalism, consistently taking into account both induced gluon emission and
elastic collisions. The production of high $p_T$ photons in Au+Au collisions is
calculated, incorporating a complete set of photon-production channels. Putting
all these ingredients together with a (3+1)-dimensional ideal relativistic
hydrodynamical description of the thermal medium, we achieve a good description
of the current experimental data. Our results illustrate that the interaction
between hard jets and the soft medium is important for a complete understanding
of jet quenching, photon production, and photon-hadron correlations in
relativistic nuclear collisions.
