We consider the gl_N Gaudin model of a tensor power of the standard vector
representation. The geometric Langlands correspondence in the Gaudin model
relates the Bethe algebra of the commuting Gaudin Hamiltonians and the algebra
of functions on a suitable space of N-th order differential operators. In this
paper we introduce a third side of the correspondence: the algebra of functions
on the critical set of a master function. We construct isomorphisms of the
third algebra and the first two.
  A new object is the Bethe vector averaging maps.
