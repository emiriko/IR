We determine the distance to the open cluster NGC 2264 using a statistical
analysis of cluster member inclinations. We derive distance-dependent values of
sin i (where i is the inclination angle) for 97 stars in NGC 2264 from the
rotation periods, luminosities, effective temperatures, and projected
equatorial rotation velocities, v sin i, measured for these stars. We have
measured 96 of the v sin i values in our sample by analyzing high-resolution
spectra with a cross-correlation technique. We model the observed distribution
of sin i for the cluster by assuming that member stars have random axial
orientations and by adopting prescriptions for the measurement errors in our
sample. By adjusting the distance assumed in the observed sin i distribution
until it matches the modeled distribution, we obtain a best-fit distance for
the cluster. We find the data to be consistent with a distance to NGC 2264 of
913 pc. Quantitative tests of our analysis reveals uncertainties of 40 and 110
pc due to sampling and systematic effects, respectively. This distance estimate
suggests a revised age for the cluster of 1.5 Myrs, although more detailed
investigations of the full cluster membership are required to draw strong
conclusions.
