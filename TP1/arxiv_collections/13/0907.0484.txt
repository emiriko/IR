A new analysis of 63Cu and 17O NMR shift data on La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 is reported
that supports earlier work arguing for a two-component description of this
material, but conflicts with the widely held view that the cuprates are a
one-component system. The data are analyzed in terms of two components A and B
with susceptibilities Chi(A), Chi(B), and Chi(AB)=Chi(BA) . We find that above
Tc, Chi(AB) and Chi(BB) are independent of temperature and obtain for the first
time the temperature dependence of all three susceptibilities above Tc as well
as the complete temperature dependence of Chi(AA)+Chi(AB) and of
Chi(AB)+Chi(BB) below Tc. The form of the results agrees with that recently
proposed by Barzykin and Pines.
