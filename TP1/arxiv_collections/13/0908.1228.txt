Much of the discussion in the literature of the low frequency part of the
density of states of amorphous solids was dominated for years by comparing
measured or simulated density of states to the classical Debye model. Since
this model is hardly appropriate for the materials at hand, this created some
amount of confusion regarding the existence and universality of the so- called
``Boson Peak'' which results from such comparisons. We propose that one should
pay attention to the different roles played by different aspects of disorder,
the first being disorder in the interaction strengths, the second positional
disorder, and the third coordination disorder. These have different effects on
the low-frequency part of the density of states. We examine the density of
states of a number of tractable models in one and two dimensions, and reach a
clearer picture of the softening and redistribution of frequencies in such
materials. We discuss the effects of disorder on the elastic moduli and the
relation of the latter to frequency softening, reaching the final conclusion
that the Boson peak is not universal at all.
