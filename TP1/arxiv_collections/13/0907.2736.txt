Modern density functional theory (DFT) calculations employ the Kohn-Sham (KS)
system of non-interacting electrons as a reference, with all complications
buried in the exchange-correlation energy (Exc). The adiabatic connection
formula gives an exact expression for Exc. We consider DFT calculations that
instead employ a reference of strictly-correlated electrons. We define a
"decorrelation energy" that relates this reference to the real system, and
derive the corresponding adiabatic connection formula. We illustrate this
theory in three situations, namely the uniform electron gas, Hooke's atom, and
the stretched hydrogen molecule. The adiabatic connection for
strictly-correlated electrons provides an alternative perspective for
understanding density functional theory and constructing approximate
functionals.
