We study the structures in cross sections and R ratios concerning
electron-positron annihilation reactions, for open-strangeness, open-charm and
open-beauty hadron-pair production, from the perspective of a recently
developed production formalism. Special attention is paid to non-resonant
contributions. Known, tentative, and yet unknown resonances are spotted, with
estimates for their masses and widths.
