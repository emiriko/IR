We study triplet pairing correlations induced in an SFS trilayer (where F is
a ferromagnet and S an ordinary s-wave superconductor) by spin flip scattering
at the interfaces. We derive and solve self consistently the appropriate
Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations in the clean limit. We find that the spin flip
scattering generates $m=\pm 1$ triplet correlations, odd in time. We study the
general spatial behavior of these and of $m=0$ correlations as a function of
position and of spin-flip strength, $H_{spin}$. We concentrate on the case
where the ferromagnet is half-metallic. We find that for certain values of
$H_{spin}$, the triplet correlations pervade the magnetic layer and can
penetrate deeply into the superconductor. The behavior we find depends very
strongly on whether the singlet order parameter is in the 0 or $\pi$ state,
which must in turn be determined self-consistently. We also present results for
the density of states (DOS) and for the local magnetization, which, due to
spin-flip processes, is not in general aligned with the magnetization of the
half metal, and near the interfaces, rotates as a function of position and
$H_{spin}$. The average DOS in both F and S is shown to exhibit various subgap
bound states positioned at energies that depend strongly on the particular
junction state and the spin
