We analyze transitions between quantum Hall ground states at prominent
filling factors $\nu$ in the spherical geometry by tuning the width parameter
of the Zhang-Das Sarma interaction potential. We find that incompressible
ground states evolve adiabatically under this tuning, whereas the compressible
ones are driven through a first order phase transition. Overlap calculations
show that the resulting phase is increasingly well described by appropriate
analytic model wavefunctions (Laughlin, Moore-Read, Read-Rezayi). This scenario
is shared by both odd ($\nu=1/3, 1/5, 3/5, 7/3, 11/5, 13/5$) and even
denominator states ($\nu=1/2, 1/4, 5/2, 9/4$). In particular, the Fermi
liquid-like state at $\nu=1/2$ gives way, at large enough value of the width
parameter, to an incompressible state identified as the Moore-Read Pfaffian on
the basis of its entanglement spectrum.
