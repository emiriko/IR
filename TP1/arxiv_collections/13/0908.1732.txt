This paper has been withdrawn. I belatedly found that the alignment I saw in
galaxy cluster axes was bogus. It turns out that it is due to a well-known
effect called the "Fingers of God" that stretches out the redshifts of galaxies
in a cluster due to their motion within the cluster. This would not cause an
overall bias if the SDSS survey were complete, but there is no coverage toward
right ascensions near 90 degrees or 270 deg. Thus the apparent alignment
appears along 0 -- 180 deg.
