At present time Robotic observatory making is of current importance. Having a
large field of view and being able to point at anywhere, Robotic astronomical
systems are indispensable when they looking for transients like grb, supernovae
explosions, novae etc, as it's impossible in these cases to foresee what you
should point you telescope at and when. In work are described prompt GRB
observations received on wide-field chambers MASTER-VWF, and also methods of
the images analysis and transients classifications applied in real-time data
processing in this experiment. For 7 months of operation 6 synchronous
observations of gamma-ray burst had been made by MASTER VWF in Kislovodsk and
Irkutsk. In all cases a high upper limits have been received (see tabl \ref
{tab_grbwf} and fig. \ref {allgrb}).
