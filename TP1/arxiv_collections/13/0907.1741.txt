The origin of the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGRB) is still an open
question, even after nearly forty years of its discovery. The emission could
originate from either truly diffuse processes or from unresolved point sources.
Although the majority of the 271 point sources detected by EGRET (Energetic
Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope) are unidentified, of the identified sources,
blazars are the dominant candidates. Therefore, unresolved blazars may be
considered the main contributor to the EGRB, and many studies have been carried
out to understand their distribution, evolution and contribution to the EGRB.
Considering that gamma-ray emission comes mostly from jets of blazars and that
the jet emission decreases rapidly with increasing jet to line-of-sight angle,
it is not surprising that EGRET was not able to detect many large inclination
angle active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Though Fermi could only detect a few large
inclination angle AGNs in the first three months' survey, it is expected to
detect many such sources in the near future. Since non-blazar AGNs are expected
to have higher density as compared to blazars, these could also contribute
significantly to the EGRB. In this paper we discuss contributions from
unresolved discrete sources including normal galaxies, starburst galaxies,
blazars and off-axis AGNs to the EGRB.
