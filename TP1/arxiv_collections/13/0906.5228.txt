Radiative recombination of a relativistic electron with a highly charged ion
in the presence of an intense laser field is considered. Various relativistic
effects, caused by the high energy of the incoming electron and its strong
coupling to the intense laser field, are found to clearly manifest themselves
in the spectra of the emitted $\gamma$-photons.
