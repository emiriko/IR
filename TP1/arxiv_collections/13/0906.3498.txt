The UV-Excess Survey of the Northern Galactic Plane images a 10x185 degree
wide band, centered on the Galactic Equator using the 2.5m Isaac Newton
Telescope in four bands (U,g,r,HeI5875) down to ~21st-22nd magnitude (~20th in
HeI5875). The setup and data reduction procedures are described. Simulations of
the colours of main-sequence stars, giant, supergiants, DA and DB white dwarfs
and AM CVn stars are made, including the effects of reddening. A first look at
the data of the survey (currently 30% complete) is given.
