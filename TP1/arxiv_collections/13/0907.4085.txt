We propose a routing protocol for wireless networks. Wireless routing
protocols allow hosts within a network to have some knowledge of the topology
in order to know when to forward a packet (via broadcast) and when to drop it.
Since a routing protocol forms the backbone of a network, it is a lucrative
target for many attacks, all of which attempt to disrupt network traffic by
corrupting routing tables of neighboring routers using false updates. Secure
routing protocols designed for wired networks (such as S-BGP) are not scalable
in an ad-hoc wireless environment because of two main drawbacks: (1) the need
to maintain knowledge about all immediate neighbors (which requires a discovery
protocol), and (2) the need to transmit the same update several times, one for
each neighbor. Although information about neighbors is readily available in a
fairly static and wired network, such information is often not updated or
available in an ad-hoc wireless network with mobile devices. Our protocol is a
variant of S-BGP called SS-BGP and allows a single broadcast for routing
updates without having the need to be aware of every neighboring router. The
protocol is based on a novel authentication primitive called Enhanced Chain
Signatures (ECS).
