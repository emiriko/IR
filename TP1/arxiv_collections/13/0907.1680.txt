Radio astrometry of nearby, low-mass stars has the potential to be a powerful
tool for the discovery and characterization of planetary companions. We present
a Very Large Array survey of 172 active M dwarfs at distances of less than 10
pc. Twenty nine stars were detected with flux densities greater than 100
microJy. We observed 7 of these stars with the Very Long Baseline Array at
milliarcsecond resolution in three separate epochs. With a detection threshold
of 500 microJy in images of sensitivity 1 sigma ~ 100 microJy, we detected
three stars three times (GJ 65B, GJ896A, GJ 4247), one star twice (GJ 285), and
one star once (GJ 803). Two stars were undetected (GJ 412B and GJ 1224). For
the four stars detected in multiple epochs, residuals from the
optically-determined proper motions have an rms deviation of ~0.2
milliarcseconds, consistent with statistical noise limits. Combined with
previous optical astrometry, these residuals provide acceleration upper limits
that allow us to exclude planetary companions more massive than 3-6 M_Jup at a
distance of ~1 AU with a 99% confidence level.
