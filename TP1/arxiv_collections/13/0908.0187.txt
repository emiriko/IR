Based on the {\it nonlinear coherent states} method, a general and simple
algebraic formalism for the construction of \textit{`$f$-deformed intelligent
states'} has been introduced. The structure has the potentiality to apply to
systems with a known discrete spectrum as well as the generalized coherent
states with known nonlinearity function $f (n)$. As some physical appearance of
the proposed formalism, a few new classes of intelligent states associated with
\textit{`center of-mass motion of a trapped ion'}, \textit{`harmonious states'}
and \textit{`hydrogen-like spectrum'} have been realized. Finally, the
nonclassicality of the obtained states has been investigated. To achieve this
purpose the quantum statistical properties using the Mandel parameter and the
squeezing of the quadratures of the radiation field corresponding to the
introduced states have been established numerically.
