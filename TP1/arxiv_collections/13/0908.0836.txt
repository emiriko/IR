Magic state distillation is an important primitive in fault-tolerant quantum
computation. The magic states are pure non-stabilizer states which can be
distilled from certain mixed non-stabilizer states via Clifford group
operations alone. Because of the Gottesman-Knill theorem, mixtures of Pauli
eigenstates are not expected to be magic state distillable, but it has been an
open question whether all mixed states outside this set may be distilled. In
this Letter we show that, when resources are finitely limited, non-distillable
states exist outside the stabilizer octahedron. In analogy with the bound
entangled states, which arise in entanglement theory, we call such states bound
states for magic state distillation.
