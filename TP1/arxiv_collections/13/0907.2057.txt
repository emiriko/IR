Attention is drawn to the several 2-3 $\sigma$ "anomalies" in B, $B_s$
mixings and decays involving CP-observables. Perhaps the most interesting
theoretical scenario that could cause such effects is based on warped
extra-dimensional models and indeed some of the effects were predicted there.
However, a rather simple explanation is that based on a fourth family of quarks
with masses in the range of(400 - 600) GeV. The built-in hierarchy of the
4$\times$4 mixing matrix is such that the $t'$ readily provides a needed {\it
perturbation} ($\approx 15%$) to $\sin 2 \beta$ as measured in $B \to \psi K_s$
and simultaneously is the dominant source of CP asymmetry in $B_s \to \psi
\phi$. The latter mode is theoretically very clean (unlike the others) and
therefore it would be extremely desirable that Fermilab gives a very high
priority to clarify this anomaly at the earliest. 4th family explanation
allows, with relative ease, to accomodate the stringent flavor changing
constraints which usually can be quite challenging for new physics
scenarios.Implications for the LHC are briefly discussed; $t'$ and $b'$ lead to
high $p_t$ multilepton events, in particular $b'$ decays produce rather
distinctive same sign leptons with asymmetric energies.
