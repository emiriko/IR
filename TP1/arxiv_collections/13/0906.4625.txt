In classical Drude theory the conductivity is determined by the mass of the
propagating particles and the mean free path between two scattering events. For
a quantum particle this simple picture of diffusive transport loses relevance
if strong correlations dominate the particle motion. We study a situation where
the propagation of a fermionic particle is possible only through creation and
annihilation of local bosonic excitations. This correlated quantum transport
process is outside the Drude picture, since one cannot distinguish between free
propagation and intermittent scattering. The characterization of transport is
possible using the Drude weight obtained from the f-sum rule, although its
interpretation in terms of free mass and mean free path breaks down. For the
situation studied we calculate the Green's function and Drude weight using a
Green's functions expansion technique, and discuss their physical meaning.
