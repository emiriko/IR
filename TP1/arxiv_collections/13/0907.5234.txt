In this paper we consider modifications to Darcy's equation wherein the drag
coefficient is a function of pressure, which is a realistic model for
technological applications like enhanced oil recovery and geological carbon
sequestration. We first outline the approximations behind Darcy's equation and
the modifications that we propose to Darcy's equation, and derive the governing
equations through a systematic approach using mixture theory. We then propose a
stabilized mixed finite element formulation for the modified Darcy's equation.
To solve the resulting nonlinear equations we present a solution procedure
based on the consistent Newton-Raphson method. We solve representative test
problems to illustrate the performance of the proposed stabilized formulation.
One of the objectives of this paper is also to show that the dependence of
viscosity on the pressure can have a significant effect both on the qualitative
and quantitative nature of the solution.
