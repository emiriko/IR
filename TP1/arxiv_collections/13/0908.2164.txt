Thermal-magnetic noise at ferromagnetic resonance (T-FMR) can be used to
measure magnetic perpendicular anisotropy of nanoscale magnetic tunnel
junctions (MTJs). For this purpose, T-FMR measurements were conducted with an
external magnetic field up to 14 kOe applied perpendicular to the film surface
of MgO-based MTJs under a dc bias. The observed frequency-field relationship
suggests that a 20 A CoFeB free layer has an effective demagnetization field
much smaller than the intrinsic bulk value of CoFeB, with 4PiMeff = (6.1 +/-
0.3) kOe. This value is consistent with the saturation field obtained from
magnetometry measurements on extended films of the same CoFeB thickness.
In-plane T-FMR on the other hand shows less consistent results for the
effective demagnetization field, presumably due to excitations of more complex
modes. These experiments suggest that the perpendicular T-FMR is preferred for
quantitative magnetic characterization of nanoscale MTJs.
