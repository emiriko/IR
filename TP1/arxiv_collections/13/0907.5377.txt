We present the first detections of the 3um water ice and 3.4um amorphous
hydrocarbon (HAC) absorption features in z~2 ULIRGs. These are based on deep
rest-frame 2-8um Spitzer IRS spectra of 11 sources selected for their
appreciable silicate absorption. The HAC-to-silicate ratio for our z~2 sources
is typically higher by a factor of 2-5 than that observed in the Milky Way.
This HAC `excess' suggests compact nuclei with steep temperature gradients as
opposed to predominantly host obscuration. Beside the above molecular
absorption features, we detect the 3.3um PAH emission feature in one of our
sources with three more individual spectra showing evidence for it. Stacking
analysis suggests that water ice, hydrocarbons, and PAH are likely present in
the bulk of this sample even when not individually detected. The most
unexpected result of our study is the lack of clear detections of the 4.67um CO
gas absorption feature. Only three of the sources show tentative signs of this
feature and at significantly lower levels than has been observed in local
ULIRGs. Overall, we find that the closest local analogs to our sources, in
terms of 3-4um color, HAC-to-silicate and ice-to-silicate ratios, as well as
low PAH equivalent widths are sources dominated by deeply obscured nuclei. Such
sources form only a small fraction of ULIRGs locally and are commonly believed
to be dominated by buried AGN. Our sample suggests that, in absolute number,
such buried AGN are at least an order of magnitude more common at z~2 than
today. The presence of PAH suggests that significant levels of star-formation
are present even if the obscured AGN typically dominate the power budget.
