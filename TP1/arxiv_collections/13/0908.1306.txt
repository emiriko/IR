We consider the two-loop four-point amplitude in N=2 super QED, and show that
there exists an approximate recursive structure similar to that captured by the
ABDK/BDS ansatz for MHV amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills. Furthermore, we
present a simple relation between the box coefficients of one-loop photon MHV
amplitudes in (super) QED, and sums of box coefficients of one-loop MHV
amplitudes in (super) Yang-Mills.
