We present results for the next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the
production and semi-leptonic decays of a top quark pair in hadron collisions,
retaining all spin correlations. To evaluate the virtual corrections, we employ
generalized D-dimensional unitarity. The computation is implemented in a
numerical program which allows detailed studies of ttbar-related observables at
the Tevatron and the LHC.
