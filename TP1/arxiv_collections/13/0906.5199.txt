Low-temperature electronic states in SrRu_{1-x}Mn_xO_3 for x <= 0.6 have been
investigated by means of specific-heat C_p measurements. We have found that a
jump anomaly observed in C_p at the ferromagnetic (FM) transition temperature
for SrRuO_3 changes into a broad peak by only 5% substitution of Mn for Ru.
With further doping Mn, the low-temperature electronic specific-heat
coefficient gamma is markedly reduced from the value at x=0 (33 mJ/K^2 mol), in
connection with the suppression of the FM phase as well as the enhancement of
the resistivity. For x >= 0.4, gamma approaches to ~ 5 mJ/K^2 mol or less,
where the antiferromagnetic order with an insulating feature in resistivity is
generated. We suggest from these results that both disorder and reconstruction
of the electronic states induced by doping Mn are coupled with the magnetic
ground states and transport properties.
