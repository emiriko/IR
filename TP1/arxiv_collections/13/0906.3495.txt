The 4-loop 4-point amplitude in N=8 d=4 supergravity is UV finite due to
supersymmetry. Even better UV behavior of the 4-loop 4-point amplitude,
analogous to that of N=4 SYM theory, has been recently established by
computation in [1]. All n-point 4-loop amplitudes with n greater than 5 are
finite on dimensional grounds. However, the situation with the 5-point
amplitudes remained unclear. In this paper we will show that the 5-point 4-loop
amplitude must be finite due to supersymmetry, despite the fact that $R^5$ has
a supersymmetric generalization for N=1, N=2 and N=4 SUSY. This means that all
4-loop amplitudes in N = 8 supergravity are UV finite. We also discuss the
current expectations for higher loops.
