We report an optical link on silicon using micrometer-scale ring-resonator
enhanced silicon modulators and waveguide-integrated germanium photodetectors.
We show 3 Gbps operation of the link with 0.5 V modulator voltage swing and 1.0
V detector bias. The total energy consumption for such a link is estimated to
be ~120 fJ/bit. Such compact and low power monolithic link is an essential step
towards large-scale on-chip optical interconnects for future microprocessors.
