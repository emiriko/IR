We have recently introduced the two new computing models of self-similar
cellular automata and self-similar Petri nets. Self-similar automata result
from a progressive, infinite tessellation of space and time. Self-similar Petri
nets consist of a potentially infinite sequence of coupled transitions with
ever increasing firing rates. Both models are capable of hypercomputations and
can, for instance, ``solve'' the halting problem for Turing machines. We survey
the main definitions and propositions and add new results regarding the
indeterminism of self-similar cellular automata.
