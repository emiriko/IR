Recently, a preliminary spectrum from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has
been presented for the inner galaxy (-30 < l < 30, -5 < b < 5), as well as the
galactic center (-1 < l < 1, -1< b < 1). We consider the implications of these
data for dark matter annihilation models, especially models capable of
producing the cosmic-ray excesses previously observed by PAMELA and Fermi.
These local cosmic-ray excesses, when extrapolated to the inner galaxy, imply
inverse Compton scattering (ICS) gamma-ray signals largely consistent with the
preliminary Fermi gamma-ray spectrum. For specific halos and models,
particularly those with prompt photons, the data have begun to constrain the
allowed parameter space. Although significant modeling and background
uncertainties remain, we explore how large a signal is permitted by the current
data. Based upon this, we make predictions for what signal could be present in
other regions of the sky where dark matter signals may be easier to isolate
from the astrophysical backgrounds.
