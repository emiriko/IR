We discuss how the chemical composition of QCD jets is altered by final state
interactions in surrounding nuclear matter. We describe this process through
conversions of leading jet particles. We find that conversions lead to an
enhancement of kaons at high transverse momentum in Au+Au collisions at RHIC,
while their azimuthal asymmetry v_2 is suppressed.
