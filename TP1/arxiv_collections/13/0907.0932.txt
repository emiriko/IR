Half-lives $T_{1/2}^{2\nu}$ for two neutrino positron double beta decay modes
$\beta^{+}$EC/ECEC are calculated for $^{74}$Se, a nucleus of current
experimental interest, using deformed shell model based on Hartree-Fock states
employing a modified Kuo interaction in ($^{2}p_{3/2}$, $^{1}f_{5/2}$,
$^{2}p_{1/2}$, $^{1}g_{9/2}$) space. The calculated half-life for the ECEC mode
is $\sim 10^{26}$yr and it may be possible to observe this in the near future
with improved sensitivity of experiments.
