We report on a systematic investigation of the dominant scattering mechanism
in shallow two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) formed in modulation-doped
GaAs/Al_{x}Ga_{1-x}As heterostructures. The power-law exponent of the electron
mobility versus density, mu \propto n^{alpha}, is extracted as a function of
the 2DEG's depth. When shallower than 130 nm from the surface, the power-law
exponent of the 2DEG, as well as the mobility, drops from alpha \simeq 1.65
(130 nm deep) to alpha \simeq 1.3 (60 nm deep). Our results for shallow 2DEGs
are consistent with theoretical expectations for scattering by remote dopants,
in contrast to the mobility-limiting background charged impurities of deeper
heterostructures.
