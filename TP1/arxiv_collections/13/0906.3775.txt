We report on the first spectroscopic study of the N=22 nucleus 32Ne at the
newly completed RIKEN Radioactive Ion Beam Factory. A single gamma-ray line
with an energy of 722(9) keV was observed in both inelastic scattering of a 226
MeV/u 32Ne beam on a Carbon target and proton removal from 33Na at 245 MeV/u.
This transition is assigned to the de-excitation of the first J^pi = 2+ state
in 32Ne to the 0+ ground state. Interpreted through comparison with
state-of-the-art shell model calculations, the low excitation energy
demonstrates that the Island of Inversion extends to at least N=22 for the Ne
isotopes.
