The study of W UMa binary systems give a wealth of information about its
nature as well as about its parent body (if any), like clusters. In this paper,
we present the I passband photometric solutions of four W UMa binaries in the
open cluster Berkeley 39 using the latest version of WD program. The result
shows that, two binary systems are W subtype W UMa binary systems and another
two systems are H subtype W UMa binary systems. No third body is found in any
of the four systems. We found a correlation between the period and mass-ratio
as well as temperature and mass-ratio for the respective variables which is
similar to the relationship between mass ratio and total mass of the contact
binaries as shown by vant Veer (1996) and Li et al. (2008).
