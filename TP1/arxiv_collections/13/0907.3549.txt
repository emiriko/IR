IGR J16460+0849 is reported in the 3rd IBIS catalog with the shortest
exposure of about 10 ks among all the detected sources, which makes it the most
interesting target to be investigated with a deeper exposure. We analyze all
available observations carried out by the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics
  Laboratory (INTEGRAL) on the unidentified source IGR J16460+0849. The data
were processed by using the latest version OSA 7.0. In addition we analyze also
all the available Swift/XRT data on this source. We find that IGR J16460+0849
has a detection significance of ~ 4.4 sigma in the 20-100 keV band during the
observational period between March 2003 and September 2004, when it was exposed
by ~ 19 ks. Thereafter the source was not detected anymore, despite an
additional exposure of ~ 271 ks. This suggests a flux variability on a
timescale of years. The spectral analysis shows that the IBIS/ISGRI data are
well presented by a power-law shape, with a photon index obtained as
1.45+-0.86. So far, the source has been detected consistently by IBIS/ISGRI in
the subsequent observations and in the adjacent energy bands. We have analyzed
the Swift/XRT observations on IGR J16460+0849 as well, and found no source
inside the IBIS/ISGRI error circle. The non-detection during the Swift/XRT
observation is consistent with the source having a variable nature.
