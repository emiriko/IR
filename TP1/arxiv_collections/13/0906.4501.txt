We use WMAP5 and other cosmological data to constrain model parameters in
quintessence cosmologies, focusing also on their shift when we allow for
non-vanishing neutrino masses. The Ratra-Peebles (RP) and SUGRA potentials are
used here, as examples of slowly or fastly varying state parameter w(a). Both
potentials depend on an energy scale \Lambda. Here we confirm the results of
previous analysis with WMAP3 data on the upper limits on \Lambda, which turn
out to be rather small (down to ~10^{-9} in RP cosmologies and ~10^{-5} for
SUGRA). Our constraints on \Lambda are not heavily affected by the inclusion of
neutrino mass as a free parameter. On the contrary, when the neutrino mass
degree of freedom is opened, significant shifts in the best-fit values of other
parameters occur.
