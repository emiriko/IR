One of the primary goals of high-energy heavy-ion collisions is to establish
the QCD phase diagram and search for possible phase boundaries. The planned
RHIC energy scan program will explore this exciting physics topic using
heavy-ion collisions at various center of mass energies. The first test run
with Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 9.2 GeV took place in early 2008. We
present the results on identified particle ratios, azimuthal anisotropy
parameters (v1 and v2) and HBT at midrapidity using data from this run. These
results are compared to data for both lower and higher center of mass energies
at the AGS, SPS and RHIC. These new data demonstrate the capabilities of the
STAR detector for exploring the QCD phase diagram.
