The PHENIX experiment at RHIC has measured the \phi-meson production at
mid-rapidity in p+p, d+Au, Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at \sqrt{s_{NN}}=200 GeV
via the K^+K^- decay mode. The transverse momentum spectra of the \phi-meson
and the nuclear modification factor as a function of centrality are reviewed
here.
