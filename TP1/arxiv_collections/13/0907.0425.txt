Turyshev, S.G., Toth, V.T., 2009. (preprint arXiv:0906.0399) reported on the
status of the analysis of recently recovered Pioneer 10 (P10) and Pioneer 11
(P11) flight data and commented on some, but not all, of the characteristics of
the Pioneer Anomaly (PA) that must be explained by a candidate model. Only one
model presented to date is consistent with all the characteristics.
