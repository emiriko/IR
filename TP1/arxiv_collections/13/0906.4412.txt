In this paper, a study of light-cone distribution amplitudes for p-wave heavy
quarkonium states are presented. Within the light-front framework, the leading
twist light-cone distribution amplitudes, and their relevant decay constants,
have some simple relations. These relations can be further simplified when the
non-relativistic limit and the wave function as a function of relative momentum
|\vec\kappa| are taken into consideration. In addition, the \kappa_\perp
integrations in the equations of LCDAs and \xi-moments can be completed
analytically when the Gaussian-type wave function is considered. After fixing
the parameters that appear in the wave function, the curves and the
corresponding decay constants of the LCDAs are plotted and calculated for the
charmonium and bottomonium states. The first three \xi-moments of the LCDAs are
estimated and are consistent with those of other theoretical approaches.
