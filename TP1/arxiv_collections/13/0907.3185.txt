We have searched for active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in K+A galaxies, using
multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopy in the Bootes field of the NOAO Deep
Wide-Field Survey. The K+A galaxies, which have had their star formation
rapidly truncated, are selected via their strong Balmer absorption lines and
weak H-alpha emission. Our sample consists of 24 K+A galaxies selected from
6594 0.10<z<0.35 galaxies brighter than I=20 with optical spectroscopy from the
AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey. Two thirds of the K+A galaxies are likely
ongoing galaxy mergers, with nearby companion galaxies or tidal tails. Galaxy
mergers may be responsible for the truncation of star formation, or we are
observing the aftermath of merger triggered starbursts. As expected, the
optical colors of K+A galaxies largely fall between blue galaxies with ongoing
star formation and red passive galaxies. However, only 1% of the galaxies with
colors between the red and blue populations are K+A galaxies, and we conclude
that the truncation of star formation in K+A galaxies must have been unusually
abrupt (<100 Myr). We examined the AGN content of K+A galaxies with both
optical emission-line ratios (BPT diagrams) and Chandra X-ray imaging. At least
half of all K+A galaxies display the optical emission-line ratios of AGNs, and
a third of M_R<-22 K+A galaxies host AGNs with X-ray luminosities of 10^{42}
erg/s. The faintest K+A galaxies do not show clear evidence for hosting AGNs,
having emission-line ratios consistent with photoionization by massive stars
and few X-ray detections. We speculate that two mechanisms may be responsible
for the truncation of star formation in K+A galaxies, with AGN feedback only
playing a role in M_R<-20.5 galaxies.
