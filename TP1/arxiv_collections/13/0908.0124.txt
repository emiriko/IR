The rights and duties of both staff members and students are regulated by a
large and different numbers of legal regulations and rules. This large number
of rules and regulations makes the decision-making process time consuming and
error boring. Smart advisory systems could provide rapid and accurate advices
to managers and give the arguments for these advices. This paper presents an
intelligent advisory system in law to assist the legal educational processes in
universities and institutes. The aims of the system are: to provide smart legal
advisors in the universities and institutes, to integrate rules and regulations
of universities and institutes in the e-government, to ease the burden on the
legal advisor and the provision of consulting services to users, to achieve
accurate and timely presentation of the legal opinion to a given problem and to
assure flexibility for accepting changes in the rules and legal regulations.
The system is based on experienced jurists and the rules and regulations of the
law organizing Saudi Arabia universities and institutes.
