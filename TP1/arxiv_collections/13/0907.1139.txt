Kepler mission will provide a huge amount of asteroseismic data during the
next few years, among which hundreds of solar-like stars will be targeted. The
amount of stars and their observation length represent a step forward in the
comprehension of the stellar evolution that has already been initiated by CoRoT
and MOST missions. Up to now, the slow cadence of observed targets allowed an
individual and personalized analysis of each star. During the survey phase of
Kepler, this will be impossible. This is the reason why, within the AsteroFLAG
team, we have been developing automatic pipelines for the Kepler solar-like
oscillation stars. Our code starts by finding the frequency-range where p-mode
power is present and, after fitting the background, it looks for the mode
amplitudes as well as the central frequency of the p-mode hump. A good
estimation of the large separation can thus be inferred in this region. If the
signal to noise is high enough, the code obtains the characteristics of the p
modes by doing a global fitting on the power spectrum. Here, we will first
describe a few features of this pipeline and its application to AsteroFLAG
synthetic data to check the validity of the code.
