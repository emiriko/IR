Precision saturation spectroscopy of the $^{88}{\rm Sr} ^1S_0-^3P_1$ is
performed in a vapor cell filled with various rare gas including He, Ne, Ar,
and Xe. By continuously calibrating the absolute frequency of the probe laser,
buffer gas induced collision shifts of $\sim $kHz are detected with gas
pressure of 1-20 mTorr. Helium gave the largest fractional shift of $1.6 \times
10^{-9} {\rm Torr}^{-1}$. Comparing with a simple impact calculation and a
Doppler-limited experiment of Holtgrave and Wolf [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 72}, 012711
(2005)], our results show larger broadening and smaller shifting coefficient,
indicating effective atomic loss due to velocity changing collisions. The
applicability of the result to the $^1S_0-^3P_0$ optical lattice clock
transition is also discussed.
