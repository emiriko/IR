Recent theoretical schemes for utilizing cavity QED models as quantum
simulators are reviewed. By considering a quadrature representation for the
fields, it is shown how Jahn-Teller models, effective Abelian or non-Abelian
gauge potentials, transverse Hall currents, and relativistic effects naturally
arise in these systems. Some of the analytical predictions are verified
numerically using realistic experimental parameters taking into account for
system losses. Thereby demonstrating their feasibility with current
experimental setups.
