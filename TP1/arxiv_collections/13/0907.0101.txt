Pulsars are among the prime targets for the Large Area Telescope (LAT) aboard
the recently launched Fermi observatory. The LAT will study the gamma-ray
Universe between 20 MeV and 300 GeV with unprecedented detail. Increasing
numbers of gamma-ray pulsars are being firmly identified, yet their emission
mechanisms are far from being understood. To better investigate and exploit the
LAT capabilities for pulsar science, a set of new detailed pulsar simulation
tools have been developed within the LAT collaboration. The structure of the
pulsar simulator package PulsarSpectrum is presented here. Starting from photon
distributions in energy and phase obtained from theoretical calculations or
phenomenological considerations, gamma rays are generated and their arrival
times at the spacecraft are determined by taking into account effects such as
barycentric effects and timing noise. Pulsars in binary systems also can be
simulated given orbital parameters. We present how simulations can be used for
generating a realistic set of gamma rays as observed by the LAT, focusing on
some case studies that show the performance of the LAT for pulsar observations.
