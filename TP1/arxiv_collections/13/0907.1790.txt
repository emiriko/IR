We derive the threshold-resummed total cross section for heavy quark
production in hadronic collisions accurate to next-to-next-to-leading
logarithm, employing recent advances on soft anomalous dimension matrices for
massive pair production in the relevant kinematic limit. We also derive the
relation between heavy quark threshold resummations for fixed pair kinematics
and the inclusive cross section. As a check of our results, we have verified
that they reproduce all poles of the color-averaged q\bar{q} -> t\bar{t}
amplitudes at two loops, noting that the latter are insensitive to the
color-antisymmetric terms of the soft anomalous dimension.
