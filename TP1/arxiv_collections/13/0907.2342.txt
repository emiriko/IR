We apply the statistical measure of complexity, introduced by L\'{o}pez-Ruiz,
Mancini and Calbet (LMC), to uniform Fermi systems. We investigate the
connection between information and complexity measures with the strongly
correlated behavior of various Fermi systems as nuclear matter, electron gas
and liquid helium. We examine the possibility that LMC complexity can serve as
an index quantifying correlations in the specific system and to which extent
could be related with experimental quantities. Moreover, we concentrate on
thermal effects on the complexity of ideal Fermi systems. We find that
complexity behaves, both at low and high values of temperature, in a similar
way as the specific heat.
