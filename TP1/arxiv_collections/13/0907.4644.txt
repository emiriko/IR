We report an extension of charged kaon transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra at
mid-rapidity ($\mid y\mid <$ 0.5) up to 15 GeV/$c$, neutral kaon $p_T$ spectra
up to 12 GeV/$c$ using events triggered by the Barrel Electro-Magnetic
Calorimeter (BEMC) from p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The
$K^{\pm}/\pi^{\pm}$ and $K^{0}/\pi^{\pm}$ at high $p_T$ are compared in p+p and
Au+Au collisions, and nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$)for pion, kaon,
proton and rho are discussed. The $R_{AA}$ for kaon in central collisions are
consistent with theory calculation having jet conversion in a plasma of quarks
and gluons.
