By means of numerical simulation we confirm that in graphene with point
defects a quasigap opens in the vicinity of the resonance state with increasing
impurity concentration. We prove that states inside this quasigap cannot longer
be described by a wavevector and are strongly localized. We visualize states
corresponding to the density of states maxima within the quasigap and show that
they are yielded by impurity pair clusters.
