We report preliminary results of hypertriton observation in heavy-ion
collisions at RHIC. We have identified 157 +- 30 candidates in the current
sample containing ~10^8 Au+Au events at \sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200 GeV. The production
rate of hypertriton is close to that of helium 3. No extra penalty factor is
observed for hypertriton, in contrast to results observed at the AGS.
