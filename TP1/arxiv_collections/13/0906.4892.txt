We consider quadrangulations with a boundary and derive explicit expressions
for the generating functions of these maps with either a marked vertex at a
prescribed distance from the boundary, or two boundary vertices at a prescribed
mutual distance in the map. For large maps, this yields explicit formulas for
the bulk-boundary and boundary-boundary correlators in the various encountered
scaling regimes: a small boundary, a dense boundary and a critical boundary
regime. The critical boundary regime is characterized by a one-parameter family
of scaling functions interpolating between the Brownian map and the Brownian
Continuum Random Tree. We discuss the cases of both generic and self-avoiding
boundaries, which are shown to share the same universal scaling limit. We
finally address the question of the bulk-loop distance statistics in the
context of planar quadrangulations equipped with a self-avoiding loop. Here
again, a new family of scaling functions describing critical loops is
discovered.
