We study ballistic transport through semiconductor quantum point contact
systems under different confinement geometries and applied fields. In
particular, we investigate how the {\em lateral} spin-orbit coupling,
introduced by asymmetric lateral confinement potentials, affects the spin
polarization of the current. We find that even in the absence of external
magnetic fields, a variable {\em non-zero spin polarization} can be obtained by
controlling the asymmetric shape of the confinement potential. These results
suggest a new approach to produce spin polarized electron sources and we study
the dependence of this phenomenon on structural parameters and applied magnetic
fields. This asymmetry-induced polarization provides also a plausible
explanation of our recent observations of a 0.5 conductance plateau (in units
of $2e^2/h$) in quantum point contacts made on InAs quantum-well structures.
Although our estimates of the required spin-orbit interaction strength in these
systems do not support this explanation, they likely play a role in the effects
enhanced by electron-electron interactions.
