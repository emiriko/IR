Rare events are ubiquitous in many different fields, yet they are notoriously
difficult to simulate because few, if any, events are observed in a conventiona
l simulation run. Over the past several decades, specialised simulation methods
have been developed to overcome this problem. We review one recently-developed
class of such methods, known as Forward Flux Sampling. Forward Flux Sampling
uses a series of interfaces between the initial and final states to calculate
rate constants and generate transition paths, for rare events in equilibrium or
nonequilibrium systems with stochastic dynamics. This review draws together a
number of recent advances, summarizes several applications of the method and
highlights challenges that remain to be overcome.
