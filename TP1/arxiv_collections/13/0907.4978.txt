Blazars are among the most energetic and violent objects in the universe. By
observing blazars at very high energies (VHE, E > 100 GeV) we can better
understand blazar emission mechanisms, jet structure, black hole accretion and
the extragalactic background light (EBL). VERITAS, an array of four 12-meter
diameter imaging atmospheric-Cherenkov telescopes, performs VHE studies of
blazars through intense monitoring and discovery campaigns. Most blazars known
to emit VHE gamma rays are high-frequency-peaked BL Lacertae (HBL) objects, and
VERITAS has discovered VHE emission from two of these: 1ES 0806+524 and RGB
J0710+591. VERITAS has also discovered VHE gamma rays from two
intermediate-frequency-peaked BL Lacertae (IBL) objects: W Com and 3C 66A. The
expansion of the VHE catalog to include IBL objects enables a better
understanding of the AGN population as a whole. This contribution presents
recent results from the VERITAS blazar discovery program.
