We address the classical capacity of a quantum bosonic memory channel with
additive noise, subject to an input energy constraint. The memory is modeled by
correlated noise emerging from a Gauss-Markov process. Under reasonable
assumptions, we show that the optimal modulation results from a "quantum
water-filling" solution above a certain input energy threshold, similar to the
optimal modulation for parallel classical Gaussian channels. We also derive
analytically the optimal multimode input state above this threshold, which
enables us to compute the capacity of this memory channel in the limit of an
infinite number of modes. The method can also be applied to a more general
noise environment which is constructed by a stationary Gauss process. The
extension of our results to the case of broadband bosonic channels with colored
Gaussian noise should also be straightforward.
