This work presents a highly optimized computational framework for the
Discrete Dipole Approximation, a numerical method for calculating the optical
properties associated with a target of arbitrary geometry that is widely used
in atmospheric, astrophysical and industrial simulations. Core optimizations
include the bit-fielding of integer data and iterative methods that complement
a new Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) kernel, which efficiently calculates the
matrix vector products required by these iterative solution schemes. The new
kernel performs the requisite 3-D DFTs as ensembles of 1-D transforms, and by
doing so, is able to reduce the number of constituent 1-D transforms by 60% and
the memory by over 80%. The optimizations also facilitate the use of parallel
techniques to further enhance the performance. Complete OpenMP-based
shared-memory and MPI-based distributed-memory implementations have been
created to take full advantage of the various architectures. Several benchmarks
of the new framework indicate extremely favorable performance and scalability.
