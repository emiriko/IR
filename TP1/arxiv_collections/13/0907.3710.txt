In the paper the method for estimation of throughput metrics like available
bandwidth and end-t-end capacity is supposed. This method is based on
measurement of network delay $D_i$ for packets of different sizes $W_i$. The
simple expression for available bandwidth $B_{av} =(W_2-W_1)/(D_2-D_1)$ is
substantiated. The number of experiments on matching of the results received
new and traditional methods is spent. The received results testify to
possibility of application of new model.
