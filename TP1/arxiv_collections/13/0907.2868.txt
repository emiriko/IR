This paper introduces a scalable approach for probabilistic top-k similarity
ranking on uncertain vector data. Each uncertain object is represented by a set
of vector instances that are assumed to be mutually-exclusive. The objective is
to rank the uncertain data according to their distance to a reference object.
We propose a framework that incrementally computes for each object instance and
ranking position, the probability of the object falling at that ranking
position. The resulting rank probability distribution can serve as input for
several state-of-the-art probabilistic ranking models. Existing approaches
compute this probability distribution by applying a dynamic programming
approach of quadratic complexity. In this paper we theoretically as well as
experimentally show that our framework reduces this to a linear-time complexity
while having the same memory requirements, facilitated by incremental accessing
of the uncertain vector instances in increasing order of their distance to the
reference object. Furthermore, we show how the output of our method can be used
to apply probabilistic top-k ranking for the objects, according to different
state-of-the-art definitions. We conduct an experimental evaluation on
synthetic and real data, which demonstrates the efficiency of our approach.
