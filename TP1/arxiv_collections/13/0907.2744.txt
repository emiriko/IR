Let $M$ be a commutative homogeneous space of a compact Lie group $G$ and $A$
be a closed $G$-invariant subalgebra of the Banach algebra $C(M)$. A function
algebra is called antisymmetric if it does not contain nonconstant real
functions. By the main result of this paper, $A$ is antisymmetric if and only
if the invariant probability measure on $M$ is multiplicative on $A$. This
implies, for example, the following theorem: if $G^{\mathbb C}$ acts
transitively on a Stein manifold $\cal M$, $v\in{\cal M}$, and the compact
orbit $M=Gv$ is a commutative homogeneous space, then $M$ is a real form of
$\cal M$.
