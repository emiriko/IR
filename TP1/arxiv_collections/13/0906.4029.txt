We find that the magnetic plasmon resonance plays a vital role in plasmonic
electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) proposed by Zhang et al. [\prl
\textbf{101}, 047401 (2008)] as well as the localized surface plasmon
polaritons. Based on this picture, the plasmonic EIT control through single
optical field is suggested in a modified scheme for active plasmonic switching
by simply adjusting the incident angle of the optical field. The tunability of
plasmonic EIT in this scheme is exhibited sufficiently.
