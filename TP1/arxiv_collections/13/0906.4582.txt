In recent years, the spectral analysis of appropriately defined kernel
matrices has emerged as a principled way to extract the low-dimensional
structure often prevalent in high-dimensional data. Here we provide an
introduction to spectral methods for linear and nonlinear dimension reduction,
emphasizing ways to overcome the computational limitations currently faced by
practitioners with massive datasets. In particular, a data subsampling or
landmark selection process is often employed to construct a kernel based on
partial information, followed by an approximate spectral analysis termed the
Nystrom extension. We provide a quantitative framework to analyse this
procedure, and use it to demonstrate algorithmic performance bounds on a range
of practical approaches designed to optimize the landmark selection process. We
compare the practical implications of these bounds by way of real-world
examples drawn from the field of computer vision, whereby low-dimensional
manifold structure is shown to emerge from high-dimensional video data streams.
