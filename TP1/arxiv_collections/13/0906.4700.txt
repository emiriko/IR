The infrared [Ne II] and [Ne III] fine structure lines at 12.81um and 15.55um
are predicted to trace the circumstellar disk gas subject to X-ray heating and
ionization. We investigate the origin of these lines by comparing observations
with models of X-ray irradiated disks and by searching for empirical
correlations between the line luminosities and stellar and circumstellar
parameters. We measure neon line fluxes and X-ray luminosities for 28 young
stellar objects in the Rho Ophiuchi star formation region for which good
quality infrared spectra and X-ray data have been obtained, the former with the
Spitzer IRS and the latter with the Deep Rho Ophiuchi XMM-Newton Observation.
  We detect the [Ne II] and the [Ne III] lines in 10 and 1 cases, respectively.
Line luminosities show no correlation with X-ray emission. The luminosity of
the [Ne II] line for one star, and that of both the [Ne II] and [Ne III] lines
for a second star, match the predictions of published models of X-ray
irradiated disks; for the remaining 8 objects the [Ne II] emission is 1-3 dex
higher than predicted on the basis of their L_X. Class I objects show
significantly stronger [Ne II] lines than Class II and Class III ones. A
correlation is moreover found between the [Ne II] line emission and the disk
mass accretion rates. This might point toward a role of accretion-generated UV
emission in the generation of the line or to other mechanisms related to mass
inflows from circumstellar disks and envelopes and/or to the associated mass
outflows (winds and jets). We conclude that the X-ray luminosity is not the
only parameter that determines the [Ne II] emission. Explaining the strong [Ne
II] emission of Class I objects likely requires the inclusion in the models of
additional physical components such as the envelope, inflows, and outflows.
