We calculate nuclear modification factors and pseudorapidity asymmetries in
$pA$ and $dA$ collisions in a pQCD-improved parton model. With the calculations
tuned to describe existing spectra from $pp$ collisions and asymmetric systems
at midrapidity and large rapidities at FNAL and RHIC energies, we make
predictions for LHC energies.
