We study continuum percolation of overlapping circular discs of two sizes. We
propose a phenomenological scaling equation for the increase in the effective
size of the larger discs due to the presence of the smaller discs. The critical
percolation threshold as a function of the ratio of sizes of discs, for
different values of the relative areal densities of two discs, can be described
in terms of a scaling function of only one variable. The recent accurate Monte
Carlo estimates of critical threshold by Quintanilla and Ziff [Phys. Rev. E, 76
051115 (2007)] are in very good agreement with the proposed scaling relation.
