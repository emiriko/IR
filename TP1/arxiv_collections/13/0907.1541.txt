Mode conversion occurs when a wave passes through a region where the sound
and Alfven speeds are equal. At this point there is a resonance, which allows
some of the incident wave to be converted into a different mode. We study this
phenomenon in the vicinity of a two-dimensional, coronal null point. As a wave
approaches the null it passes from low- to high-beta plasma, allowing
conversion to take place. We simulate this numerically by sending in a slow
magnetoacoustic wave from the upper boundary; as this passes through the
conversion layer a fast wave can clearly be seen propagating ahead. Numerical
simulations combined with an analytical WKB investigation allow us to determine
and track both the incident and converted waves throughout the domain.
