X-ray data of the Centaurus cluster, obtained with {\it XMM-Newton} for 45
ksec, were analyzed. Deprojected EPIC spectra from concentric thin shell
regions were reproduced equally well by a single-phase plasma emission model,
or by a two-phase model developed by {\it ASCA}, both incorporating cool
(1.7--2.0 keV) and hot ($\sim 4$ keV) plasma temperatures. However, EPIC
spectra with higher statistics, accumulated over 3-dimentional thick shell
regions, were reproduced better by the two-phase model than by the singe-phase
one. Therefore, hot and cool plasma phases are inferred to co-exist in the
cluster core region within $\sim 70$ kpc. The iron and silicon abundances of
the plasma were reconfirmed to increase significantly towards the center, while
that of oxygen was consistent with being radially constant. The implied
non-solar abundance ratios explains away the previously reported excess X-ray
absorption from the central region. Although an additional cool ($\sim 0.7$
keV) emission was detected within $\sim 20$ kpc of the center, the RGS data
gave tight upper limits on any emission with a tempeartures below $\sim 0.5$
keV. These results are compiled into a magnetosphere model, which interprets
the cool phase as confined within closed magnetic loops anchored to the cD
galaxy. When combined with so-called Rosner-Tucker-Vaiana mechanism which
applies to solar coronae, this model can potentially explain basic properties
of the cool phase, including its temperature and thermal stability.
