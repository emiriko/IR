We assume that, in equilibrium, nuclear matter at reduced density and
moderate finite temperature, breaks up into many fragments. A strong support to
this assumption is provided by date accumulated from intermediate energy heavy
ion collisions. The break-up of hot and expanded nuclear matter according to
rules of equilibrium statistical mechanics is the multifragmentation model. The
model gives a first order phase transition. This is studied in detail here.
Phase-equilibrium lines for different degrees of asymmetry are computed.
