We construct rank varieties for the Drinfel'd double of the Taft algebra and
for U_q(sl2). For the Drinfel'd double when n=2 this uses a result which
identifies a family of subalgebras that control projectivity of A-modules
whenever A is a Hopf algebra satisfying a certain homological condition. In
this case we show that our rank variety is homeomorphic to the cohomological
support variety. We also show that Ext^*(M,M) is finitely generated over the
cohomology ring of the Drinfel'd double for any finitely-generated module M.
