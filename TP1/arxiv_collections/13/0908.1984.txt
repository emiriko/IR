While non-nitride III-V semiconductors typically have a zincblende structure,
they may also form wurtzite crystals under pressure or when grown as
nanowhiskers. This makes electronic structure calculation difficult since the
band structures of wurtzite III-V semiconductors are poorly characterized. We
have calculated the electronic band structure for nine III-V semiconductors in
the wurtzite phase using transferable empirical pseudopotentials including
spin-orbit coupling. We find that all the materials have direct gaps. Our
results differ significantly from earlier {\it ab initio} calculations, and
where experimental results are available (InP, InAs and GaAs) our calculated
band gaps are in good agreement. We tabulate energies, effective masses, and
linear and cubic Dresselhaus zero-field spin-splitting coefficients for the
zone-center states. The large zero-field spin-splitting coefficients we find
may lead to new functionalities for designing devices that manipulate spin
degrees of freedom.
