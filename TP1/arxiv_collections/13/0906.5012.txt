In anticipation of data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the
potential discovery of supersymmetry, in this work we seek an answer to the
following: What are the chances that supersymmetry will be found at the LHC?
Will the LHC data be enough to discover a given supersymmetric model? And what
other measurements can assist the LHC establish the presence of supersymmetry?
As a step toward answering these general questions, we calculate the odds of
the next-to-minimal version of the popular supergravity motivated model
(NmSuGra) being discovered at the LHC to be 4:3 (57 %). We also demonstrate
that viable regions of the NmSuGra parameter space outside the LHC reach can be
covered by upgraded versions of dark matter direct detection experiments, such
as super-CDMS, at 99 % confidence level. Due to the similarities of the models,
we expect very similar results for the constrained minimal supersymmetric
standard model (CMSSM).
