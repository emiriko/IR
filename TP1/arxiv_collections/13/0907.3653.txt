The properties of a two-dimensional electron are investigated in the presence
of a circular step magnetic field profile. Both electrons with parabolic
dispersion as well as Dirac electrons with linear dispersion are studied. We
found that in such a magnetic quantum dot no electrons can be confined.
Nevertheless close to the Landau levels quasi-bound states can exist with a
rather long life time.
