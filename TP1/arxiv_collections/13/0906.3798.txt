We argue that in contrast to the classical physics, the measurements in the
quantum mechanics should provide simultaneous information about all relevant
relative amplitudes (pure states and the transitions between them) and all
relevant relative phases. Simultaneity is needed since in general the
measurement changes the state of the system (in quantum physics and in
classical physics as well). We call that measurement procedure the holographic
detection. Mathematically it is described by the set of mutually commuting self
adjoint operators similar and closely related to projections. We present
explicit examples and discuss general features of the corresponding
experimental setup which we identify as the quantum reference frame.
