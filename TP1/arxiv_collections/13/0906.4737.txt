We establish existence of global-in-time weak solutions to the one
dimensional, compressible Navier-Stokes system for a viscous and heat
conducting ideal polytropic gas (pressure $p=K\theta/\tau$, internal energy
$e=c_v \theta$), when the viscosity $\mu$ is constant and the heat conductivity
$\kappa$ depends on the temperature $\theta$ according to $\kappa(\theta) =
\bar \kappa \theta^\beta$, with $0\leq\beta<{3/2}$. This choice of degenerate
transport coefficients is motivated by the kinetic theory of gasses.
  Approximate solutions are generated by a semi-discrete finite element scheme.
We first formulate sufficient conditions that guarantee convergence to a weak
solution. The convergence proof relies on weak compactness and convexity, and
it applies to the more general constitutive relations $\mu(\theta) = \bar \mu
\theta^\alpha$, $\kappa(\theta) = \bar \kappa \theta^\beta$, with $\alpha\geq
0$, $0 \leq \beta < 2$ ($\bar \mu, \bar \kappa$ constants). We then verify the
sufficient conditions in the case $\alpha=0$ and $0\leq\beta<{3/2}$. The data
are assumed to be without vacuum, mass concentrations, or vanishing
temperatures, and the same holds for the weak solutions.
