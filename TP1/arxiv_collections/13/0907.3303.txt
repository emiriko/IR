We investigate the prompt photon photoproduction at HERA within the framework
of kt-factorization QCD approach. Our consideration is based on the off-shell
matrix elements for the underlying partonic subprocesses. The unintegrated
parton densities in a proton and in a photon are determined using the
Kimber-Martin-Ryskin (KMR) prescription. Additionally, we use the CCFM-evolved
unintegrated gluon as well as valence and sea quark distributions in a proton.
A conservative error analisys is performed. Both inclusive and associated with
the hadronic jet production rates are investigated. The theoretical results are
compared with the recent experimental data taken by the H1 and ZEUS
collaborations. We study also the specific kinematical properties of the
photon-jet system which are strongly sensitive to the transverse momentum of
incoming partons. Using the KMR scheme, the contribution from the quarks
emerging from the earlier steps of the parton evolution is estimated and found
to be of 15 - 20 approximately.
