The Lovasz Local Lemma (LLL) is a powerful result in probability theory that
states that the probability that none of a set of bad events happens is nonzero
if the probability of each event is small compared to the number of events that
depend on it. It is often used in combination with the probabilistic method for
non-constructive existence proofs. A prominent application is to k-CNF
formulas, where LLL implies that, if every clause in the formula shares
variables with at most d <= 2^k/e other clauses then such a formula has a
satisfying assignment. Recently, a randomized algorithm to efficiently
construct a satisfying assignment was given by Moser. Subsequently Moser and
Tardos gave a randomized algorithm to construct the structures guaranteed by
the LLL in a very general algorithmic framework. We address the main problem
left open by Moser and Tardos of derandomizing these algorithms efficiently.
Specifically, for a k-CNF formula with m clauses and d <= 2^{k/(1+\eps)}/e for
any \eps\in (0,1), we give an algorithm that finds a satisfying assignment in
time \tilde{O}(m^{2(1+1/\eps)}). This improves upon the deterministic
algorithms of Moser and of Moser-Tardos with running time m^{\Omega(k^2)} which
is superpolynomial for k=\omega(1) and upon other previous algorithms which
work only for d\leq 2^{k/16}/4. Our algorithm works efficiently for a general
version of LLL under the algorithmic framework of Moser and Tardos, and is also
parallelizable, i.e., has polylogarithmic running time using polynomially many
processors.
