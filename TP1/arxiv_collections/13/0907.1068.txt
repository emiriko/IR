We show that the thermal entanglement in a spin system using only magnetic
susceptibility measurements is restricted to the insulator materials. We
develop a generalization of the thermal entanglement witness that allows us to
get information about the system entanglement with variable local spin lengths
that can be used experimentally in conductor or insulator materials. As an
application, we study thermal entanglement for the half-filled Hubbard model
for linear, square and cubic clusters. We note that it is the itinerancy of
electrons that favors the entanglement. Our results suggest a weak dependence
between entanglement and external spin freedom degrees.
