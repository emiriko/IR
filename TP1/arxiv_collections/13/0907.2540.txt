Molecule-based devices are envisioned to complement silicon devices by
providing new functions or already existing functions at a simpler process
level and at a lower cost by virtue of their self-organization capabilities.
Moreover, they are not bound to von Neuman architecture and this feature may
open the way to other architectural paradigms. Neuromorphic electronics is one
of them. Here we demonstrate a device made of molecules and nanoparticles, a
nanoparticle organic memory filed-effect transistor (NOMFET), which exhibits
the main behavior of a biological spiking synapse. Facilitating and depressing
synaptic behaviors can be reproduced by the NOMFET and can be programmed. The
synaptic plasticity for real time computing is evidenced and described by a
simple model. These results open the way to rate coding utilization of the
NOMFET in dynamical neuromorphic computing circuits.
