The Darboux Dressing Transformations developed in our previous paper
(Multicomponent integrable wave equations I. Darboux-Dressing Transformation,
J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 40, 961-977, 2007) are here applied to construct
soliton solutions for a class of boomeronic type equations. The vacuum (i.e.
vanishing) solution and the generic plane wave solution are both dressed to
yield one soliton solutions. The formulae are specialised to the particularly
interesting case of the resonant interaction of three waves, a well-known model
which is of boomeronic type. For this equation a novel solution which describes
three locked dark pulses (simulton) is introduced.
