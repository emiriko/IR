The hurried development of multimedia and internet allows for wide
distribution of digital media data. It becomes much easier to edit, modify and
duplicate digital information. In additional, digital document is also easy to
copy and distribute, therefore it may face many threats. It became necessary to
find an appropriate protection due to the significance, accuracy and
sensitivity of the information. Furthermore, there is no formal method to be
followed to discover a hidden data. In this paper, a new information hiding
framework is presented.The proposed framework aim is implementation of
framework computation between advance encryption standard (AES) and distortion
technique (DT) which embeds information in image page within executable file
(EXE file) to find a secure solution to cover file without change the size of
cover file. The framework includes two main functions; first is the hiding of
the information in the image page of EXE file, through the execution of four
process (specify the cover file, specify the information file, encryption of
the information, and hiding the information) and the second function is the
extraction of the hiding information through three process (specify the stego
file, extract the information, and decryption of the information).
