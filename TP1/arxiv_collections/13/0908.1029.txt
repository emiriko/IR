Numerical simulations of the evolution of strange-mode instabilities into the
non-linear regime have been performed for a wide range of stellar parameters
for Wolf-Rayet stars. It has been shown that the Wolf-Rayet models reach radial
velocities which amount to up to 30% of their escape velocity. The acoustic
luminosities suggest a connection to the observed mass loss. Most of the models
show a jump in the mean effective temperature after reaching the non-linear
regime. This jump is related to the run of the opacity.
