We explore the predictions of a class of dark energy models, quinstant dark
energy, concerning the structure formation in the Universe, both in the linear
and non-linear regimes. Quinstant dark energy is considered to be formed by
quintessence and a negative cosmological constant. We conclude that these
models give good predictions for structure formation in the linear regime, but
fail to do so in the non-linear one, for redshifts larger than one.
