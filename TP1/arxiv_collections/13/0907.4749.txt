We report on two new measurements by the PHENIX collaboration regarding open
heavy flavor. The first is an additional contribution to the background in the
measurement of the yield of electrons at mid-rapidity from open heavy flavor
decays. We found that the $J/\Psi$ can contribute substantially to the yield at
high $p_T$. PHENIX has also measured the spectrum of muons at forward rapidity
from open heavy flavor decays in Cu+Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV.
