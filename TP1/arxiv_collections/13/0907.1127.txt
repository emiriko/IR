Gene conversion is a mechanism by which a double-strand break in a DNA
molecule is repaired using a homologous DNA molecule as a template. As a
result, one gene is 'copied and pasted' onto the other gene. It was recently
reported that the direction of gene conversion appears to be biased towards G
and C nucleotides. In this paper a stochastic model of the dynamics of the bias
in gene conversion is developed for a finite population of members in a
multigene family. The dual process is the biased voter model, which generates
an ancestral random graph for a given sample. An importance-sampling algorithm
for computing the likelihood of the sample is also given.
