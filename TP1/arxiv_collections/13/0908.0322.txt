In this brief note I argue that putting conscious observers at the center of
the considerations clarifies and strengthens the many-worlds interpretation.
The basic assumption, which seems extremely plausible based on our current
understanding of the brain and of decoherence, is that quantum states
corresponding to distinct conscious experiences have to be orthogonal. I show
that, once this is accepted, probabilistic measurement outcomes corresponding
to basis elements and following Born's rule emerge naturally from global
unitary dynamics.
