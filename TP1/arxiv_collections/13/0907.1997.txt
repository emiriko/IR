We investigate the existence of bounded-memory consistent estimators of
various statistical functionals. This question is resolved in the negative in a
rather strong sense. We propose various bounded-memory approximations, using
techniques from automata theory and stochastic processes. Some questions of
potential interest are raised for future work.
