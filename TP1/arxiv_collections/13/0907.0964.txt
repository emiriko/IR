We review here some conventional as well as less conventional aspects of the
time-independent and time-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) theory and of its
connections with Quantum Mechanics. Less conventional aspects involve the HJ
theory on the tangent bundle of a configuration manifold, the quantum HJ
theory, HJ problems for general differential operators and the HJ problem for
Lie groups.
