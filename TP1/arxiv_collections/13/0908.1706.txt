We show that theory predictions for volume reflection in bent crystals agree
with recent experimental data. This makes possible to predict volume reflection
angle and efficiency in a broad range of energy for various crystals. A simple
formula is proposed for volume reflection efficiency. We derive the physical
limits for application of crystal reflection at high-energy accelerators where
it may help beam collimation.
