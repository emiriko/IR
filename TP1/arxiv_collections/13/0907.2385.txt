Decaying dark matter has previously been proposed as a possible explanation
for the excess high energy cosmic ray electrons and positrons seen by PAMELA
and the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope (FGST). To accommodate these signals
however, the decays must be predominantly leptonic, to muons or taus, and
therefore produce neutrinos, potentially detectable with the IceCube neutrino
observatory. We find that, with five years of data, IceCube (supplemented by
DeepCore) will be able to significantly constrain the relevant parameter space
of decaying dark matter, and may even be capable of discovering dark matter
decaying in the halo of the Milky Way.
