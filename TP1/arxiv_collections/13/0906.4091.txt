A cosmic potential which can relax the vacuum energy is proposed in a
framework of scalar-tensor gravity. In the phase of the gravity scalar field
around the evolution with an approximate emergent conformal symmetry, we have
obtained a set of cosmological equations with the dark energy regulated to the
order of a conformal anomaly parameter. Through a role of the cosmic potential,
the vacuum energy which could be generated in matter Lagrangian does not
contribute to the dark energy in the phase.
