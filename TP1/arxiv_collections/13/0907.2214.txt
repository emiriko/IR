In this paper we proposed quasi-Newton and limited memory quasi-Newton
methods for objective functions defined on Grassmannians or a product of
Grassmannians. Specifically we defined BFGS and L-BFGS updates in local and
global coordinates on Grassmannians or a product of these. We proved that, when
local coordinates are used, our BFGS updates on Grassmannians share the same
optimality property as the usual BFGS updates on Euclidean spaces. When applied
to the best multilinear rank approximation problem for general and symmetric
tensors, our approach yields fast, robust, and accurate algorithms that exploit
the special Grassmannian structure of the respective problems, and which work
on tensors of large dimensions and arbitrarily high order. Extensive numerical
experiments are included to substantiate our claims.
