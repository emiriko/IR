The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), due to launch in 2014, shall provide
an unprecedented wealth of information in the near and mid-infrared
wavelengths, thanks to its high-sensitivity instruments and its 6.5 m primary
mirror, the largest ever launched into space. NIRSpec and MIRI, the two
spectrographs onboard JWST, will play a key role in the study of the spectral
features of Active Galactic Nuclei in the 0.6-28 micron wavelength range. This
talk aims at presenting an overview of the possibilities provided by these two
instruments, in order to prepare the astronomical community for the JWST era.
