GRB 080810 was one of the first bursts to trigger both Swift and the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope. It was subsequently monitored over the X-ray and
UV/optical bands by Swift, in the optical by ROTSE and a host of other
telescopes and was detected in the radio by the VLA. The redshift of z= 3.355
+/- 0.005 was determined by Keck/HIRES and confirmed by RTT150 and NOT. The
prompt gamma/X-ray emission, detected over 0.3-10^3 keV, systematically softens
over time, with E_peak moving from ~600 keV at the start to ~40 keV around 100
s after the trigger; alternatively, this spectral evolution could be identified
with the blackbody temperature of a quasithermal model shifting from ~60 keV to
~3 keV over the same time interval. The first optical detection was made at 38
s, but the smooth, featureless profile of the full optical coverage implies
that this originated from the afterglow component, not the pulsed/flaring
prompt emission.
  Broadband optical and X-ray coverage of the afterglow at the start of the
final X-ray decay (~8 ks) reveals a spectral break between the optical and
X-ray bands in the range 10^15 - 2x10^16 Hz. The decay profiles of the X-ray
and optical bands show that this break initially migrates blueward to this
frequency and then subsequently drifts redward to below the optical band by
~3x10^5 s. GRB 080810 was very energetic, with an isotropic energy output for
the prompt component of 3x10^53 erg and 1.6x10^52 erg for the afterglow; there
is no evidence for a jet break in the afterglow up to six days following the
burst.
