The biexciton cascade in a quantum dot can be used to generate
entangled-photon pairs rapidly and deterministically (on demand). However, due
to a large fine-structure splitting between intermediate exciton energy levels,
which-path information encoded in the frequencies of emitted photon pairs leads
to a small degree of entanglement. Here we show that this information can be
efficiently erased by modulating the exciton and biexciton energy levels,
giving rise to new decay paths through additional sidebands. The resulting
degree of entanglement is substantial, and can be made maximal through spectral
filtering, with only a nominal reduction in collection efficiency.
