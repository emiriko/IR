I examine data from EPR experiments conducted in 1997 through 1999 by Gregor
Weihs and colleagues. They used detection windows of 4-6 ns to identify
coincidences; I find that one obtains better results with windows 40-50 ns
wide. Coincidences identified using different windows have substantially
different distributions over the sixteen combinations of Alice's and Bob's
measurement settings and results, which is the essence of the coincidence time
loophole. However, wide and narrow window coincidences violate a Bell
inequality equally strongly. The wider window yields substantially smaller
violations of no-signaling conditions.
