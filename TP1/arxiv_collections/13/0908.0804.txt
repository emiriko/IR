The ANTARES telescope has the opportunity to detect transient neutrino
sources, such as gamma-ray bursts, core-collapse supernovae, flares of active
nuclei... To enhance the sensitivity to these sources, we have developed a new
detection method based on the optical follow-up of "golden" neutrino events
such as neutrino doublets coincident in time and space or single neutrinos of
very high energy. The ANTARES Collaboration has therefore implemented a very
fast on-line reconstruction with a good angular resolution. These
characteristics allow to trigger an optical telescope network; since February
2009. ANTARES is sending alert trigger one or two times per month to the two 25
cm robotic telescope of TAROT. This follow-up of such special events would not
only give access to the nature of the sources but also improves the sensitivity
for transient neutrino sources.
