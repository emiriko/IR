The presence of a nonconformally invariant term in the photon sector of the
Lorentz-violating extension of Standard Model of particle physics, the
"Kosteleck\'{y} term" $\mathcal{L}_K \propto (k_F)_{\alpha \beta \mu \nu}
F^{\alpha \beta} F^{\m \nu}$, enables a superadiabatic amplification of
magnetic vacuum fluctuations during de Sitter inflation. For a particular form
of the external tensor $k_F$ that parameterizing Lorentz violation, the
generated field possesses a planar symmetry at large cosmological scales and
can have today an intensity of order of nanogauss for a wide range of values of
parameters defining inflation. This peculiar magnetic field could account for
the presently-observed galactic magnetic fields and induces a small
anisotropization of the universe at cosmological scales. The resulting Bianchi
I model could explain the presumedly low-quadrupole power in the Cosmic
Microwave Background radiation.
