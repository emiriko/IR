A fully relativistic treatment of Bernstein waves in an electron-positron
pair plasma has remained too formidable a task owing to the very complex nature
of the problem. In this article, we perform contour integration of the
dielectric response function and numerically compute the dispersion curves for
a uniform, magnetized, relativistic electron-positron pair plasma. The behavior
of the dispersion solution for several cases with different plasma temperatures
is highlighted. In particular, we find two wave modes that exist only for large
wavelengths and frequencies similar to the cyclotron frequency in a moderately
relativistic pair plasma. The results presented here have important
implications for the study of those objects where a hot magnetized
electron-positron plasma plays a fundamental role in generating the observed
radiation.
