The Bell-Lavis model for liquid water is investigated through numerical
simulations. The lattice-gas model on a triangular lattice presents
orientational states and is known to present a highly bonded low density phase
and a loosely bonded high density phase. We show that the model liquid-liquid
transition is continuous, in contradiction with mean-field results on the
Husimi cactus and from the cluster variational method. We define an order
parameter which allows interpretation of the transition as an order-disorder
transition of the bond-network. Our results indicate that the order-disorder
transition is in the Ising universality class. Previous proposal of an
Ehrenfest second order transition is discarded. A detailed investigation of
anomalous properties has also been undertaken. The line of density maxima in
the HDL phase is stabilized by fluctuations, absent in the mean-field solution.
