We report the growth of atomically smooth, single crystalline Bi2Se3 thin
films on Si(111) by using molecular beam epitaxy. Scanning tunneling
microscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, X-ray photoelectron emission
spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the stoichiometry
and crystallinity of the film. The film grows in a self-organized
quintuple-layer by quintuple-layer mode, and atomically smooth film can be
obtained with the thickness down to one quintuple-layer (~1nm).
