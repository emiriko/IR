Gyrosonics refers to novel audio binaural stimulus that produces rotational
perceptions of sound movement in head at a particular predetermined frequency.
Therapeutic effect observed with this is considered to be associated with
modification of arousal of autonomic nervous system. The heart rate variability
(HRV), non-invasive measure of autonomic nervous system, has been measured for
group of 30 subjects for pre- and post- gyrosonic installation. The time- and
frequency- domain analysis of HRV results show overall decrease in sympathetic
response and increase in para- sympathetic response due to listening of gyro
sonics.
