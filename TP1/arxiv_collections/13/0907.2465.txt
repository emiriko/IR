Information, in its communications sense, is a transactional property. If the
received signals communicate choices made by the sender of the signals, then
information has been transmitter by the sender to the receiver. Given this
reality, the potential information in an unknown pure quantum state should be
non-zero. We examine transactional quantum information, which unlike von
Neumann entropy, depends on the mutuality of the relationship between the
sender and the receiver, associating information with an unknown pure state.
The information that can be obtained from a pure state in repeated experiments
is potentially infinite.
