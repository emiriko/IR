Relativistic Continuum Random Phase Approximation (CRPA) is used to
investigate collective excitation phenomena in several spherical nuclei along
the periodic table. We start from relativistic mean field calculations based on
a covariant density functional with density dependent zero range forces. From
the same functional an effective interaction is obtained as the second
derivative with respect to the density. This interaction is used in
relativistic continuum-RPA calculations for the investigation of isoscalar
monopole, isovector dipole and isoscalar quadrupole resonances of spherical
nuclei. In particular we study the low-lying E1 strength in the vicinity of the
neutron evaporation threshold. The properties of the resonances, such as
centroid energies and strengths distributions are compared with results of
discrete RPA calculations for the same model as well as with experimental data.
