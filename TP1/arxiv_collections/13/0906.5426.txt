An approximate many-body theory has been used to calculate the heat capacity
and the condensate fraction of a BEC with effective repulsive interaction. The
effect of interactions has been analyzed and compared with the non-interacting
case. It has been found that the repulsive interaction lowers the critical
temperature from the value found in the non-interacting case. The difference
between the critical temperatures increases with the increase in the total
number of atoms in the trap.
