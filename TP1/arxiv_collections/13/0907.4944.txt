Jets at the LHC are expected to provide the testing ground for studying QCD
energy loss. In this contribution, we briefly outline the strategy that will be
used to measure jets in ATLAS and how we will go about studying energy loss. We
describe the utility of measuring the jet $R_{AA}$, the fragmentation function,
and heavy flavor jets. Utilizing the collision energy provided by the LHC and
the nearly hermetic and highly segmented calorimeter, ATLAS is expected to make
important contributions to the understanding of parton energy loss using fully
reconstructed jets.
