We calculate the contribution arising from nonperturbative quark-gluon
chromomagnetic interaction to the high energy total quark-quark cross section
and to gluon distributions in nucleon. The estimation obtained within the
instanton model of QCD vacuum leads to the conclusion that this type of
interaction gives the dominating contribution to the Pomeron coupling with the
light quarks and to gluon distribution in light hadrons at small virtualities
of quarks and gluons. We argue that the Odderon, which is the $P=C=-1$ partner
of Pomeron, is governed by the spin-flip component related to nonperturbative
three-gluon exchange induced by anomalous quark-gluon chromomagnetic
interaction.
