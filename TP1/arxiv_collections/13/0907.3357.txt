Multiplier circuits play an important role in reversible computation, which
is helpful in diverse areas such as low power CMOS design, optical computing,
DNA computing and bioinformatics. Here we propose a new reversible multiplier
circuit with optimized hardware complexity. The optimized multiplier circuit is
compared with the earlier proposals. We have shown that the quantum cost of
earlier proposals can be further reduced with the help of existing local
optimization algorithms (e.g. template matching, moving rule and deletion
rule). A systematic protocol for reduction of quantum cost has been proposed.
It has also been shown that the advantage in gate count obtained in some of the
earlier proposals by introduction of new reversible gates is an artifact and if
it is allowed then every circuit block can be reduced to a single gate.
Further, it is shown that the 4x4 reversible gates proposed for designing of a
component of multiplier circuit (full adder) is neither unique nor special and
many such 4x4 gates may be proposed. As example three such new gates have been
presented here and it is shown that the proposed gates are universal. It is
also shown that the total cost of our design is minimum.
