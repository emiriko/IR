We have studied the quantum oscillations of the conductance for arrays of
connected mesoscopic metallic rings, in the presence of an external magnetic
field. Several geometries have been considered: a linear array of rings
connected with short or long wires compared to the phase coherence length,
square networks and hollow cylinders. Compared to the well-known case of the
isolated ring, we show that for connected rings, the winding of the Brownian
trajectories around the rings is modified, leading to a different harmonics
content of the quantum oscillations. We relate this harmonics content to the
distribution of winding numbers. We consider the limits where coherence length
$L_\varphi$ is small or large compared to the perimeter $L$ of each ring
constituting the network. In the latter case, the coherent diffusive
trajectories explore a region larger than $L$, whence a network dependent
harmonics content. Our analysis is based on the calculation of the spectral
determinant of the diffusion equation for which we have a simple expression on
any network. It is also based on the hypothesis that the time dependence of the
dephasing between diffusive trajectories can be described by an exponential
decay with a single characteristic time $\tau_\varphi$ (model A) .
  At low temperature, decoherence is limited by electron-electron interaction,
and can be modelled in a one-electron picture by the fluctuating electric field
created by other electrons (model B). It is described by a functional of the
trajectories and thus the dependence on geometry is crucial. Expressions for
the magnetoconductance oscillations are derived within this model and compared
to the results of model A. It is shown that they involve several
temperature-dependent length scales.
