We temporally resolve the resonance fluorescence from an electron spin
confined to a single self-assembled quantum dot to measure directly the spin's
optical initialization and natural relaxation timescales. Our measurements
demonstrate that spin initialization occurs on the order of microseconds in the
Faraday configuration when a laser resonantly drives the quantum dot
transition. We show that the mechanism mediating the optically induced
spin-flip changes from electron-nuclei interaction to hole-mixing interaction
at 0.6 Tesla external magnetic field. Spin relaxation measurements result in
times on the order of milliseconds and suggest that a $B^{-5}$ magnetic field
dependence, due to spin-orbit coupling, is sustained all the way down to 2.2
Tesla.
