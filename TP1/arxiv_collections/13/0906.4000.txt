We calculate the equation of state in 2+1 flavor QCD at finite temperature
with physical strange quark mass and almost physical light quark masses using
lattices with temporal extent $N_{\tau}=8$. Calculations have been performed
with two different improved staggered fermion actions, the asqtad and p4
actions. Overall, we find good agreement between results obtained with these
two $O(a^2)$ improved staggered fermion discretization schemes. A comparison
with earlier calculations on coarser lattices is performed to quantify
systematic errors in current studies of the equation of state. We also present
results for observables that are sensitive to deconfining and chiral aspects of
the QCD transition on $N_\tau=6$ and 8 lattices. We find that deconfinement and
chiral symmetry restoration happen in the same narrow temperature interval.
