This is the second part of a work aimed at constructing the stress-energy
tensor of conformal field theory (CFT) as a local "object" in conformal loop
ensembles (CLE). This work lies in the wider context of re-constructing quantum
field theory from mathematically well-defined ensembles of random objects. In
the present paper, based on results of the first part, we identify the
stress-energy tensor in the dilute regime of CLE. This is done by deriving both
its conformal Ward identities for single insertion in CLE probability
functions, and its properties under conformal transformations involving the
Schwarzian derivative. We also give the one-point function of the stress-energy
tensor in terms of a notion of partition function, and we show that this agrees
with standard CFT arguments. The construction is in the same spirit as that
found in the context of SLE(8/3) by the author, Riva and Cardy (2006), which
had to do with the case of zero central charge. The present construction
generalises this to all central charges between 0 and 1, including all minimal
models. This generalisation is non-trivial: the application of these ideas to
the CLE context requires the introduction of a renormalised probability, and
the derivation of the transformation properties and of the one-point function
do not have counterparts in the SLE context.
