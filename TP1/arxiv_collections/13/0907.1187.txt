We report on preliminary results from a systematic study of the hyperfine
(HF) structure of antiprotonic helium. This precise measurement which was
commenced in 2006, has now been completed. Our initial analysis shows no
apparent density or power dependence and therefore the results can be averaged.
The statistical error of the observable M1 transitions is a factor of 60
smaller than that of three body quantum electrodynamic (QED) calculations,
while their difference has been resolved to a precision comparable to theory (a
factor of 10 better than our first measurement). This difference is sensitive
to the antiproton magnetic moment and agreement between theory and experiment
would lead to an increased precision of this parameter, thus providing a test
of CPT invariance.
