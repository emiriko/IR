We revisit the procedure for comparing the pi pi spectral function measured
in tau decays to that obtained in e+e- annihilation. We re-examine the
isospin-breaking corrections using new experimental and theoretical input, and
find improved agreement between the tau- --> pi- pi0 nu_tau branching fraction
measurement and its prediction using the isospin-breaking-corrected e+e- -->
pi+pi- spectral function, though not resolving all discrepancies. We recompute
the lowest order hadronic contributions to the muon g-2 using e+e- and tau data
with the new corrections, and find a reduced difference between the two
evaluations. The new tau-based estimate of the muon magnetic anomaly is found
to be 1.9 standard deviations lower than the direct measurement.
