The nature of the superconducting state in the recently discovered Fe-based
superconductors1-3 is the subject of intense scrutiny. Neutron scattering
investigations have already elucidated a strong correlation between magnetism
and superconductivity in the form of a spin resonance in the magnetic
excitation spectrum4-7. A central unanswered question concerns the nature of
the normal state spin fluctuations which may be responsible for the pairing
mechanism. Here we show inelastic neutron scattering measurements of
Fe1.04Te0.73Se0.27, not superconducting in bulk, and FeTe0.51Se0.49, a bulk
superconductor. These measurements demonstrate that the spin fluctuation
spectrum is dominated by two-dimensional incommensurate excitations near the
(1/2,1/2) (square lattice (pi,0)) wavevector, the wavevector of interest in
other Fe-based superconductors, that extend to energies at least as high as 300
meV. Most importantly, the spin excitations in Fe1+yTe1-xSex exhibit four-fold
symmetry about the (1,0) (square lattice (pi,pi)) wavevector and are described
by the identical wavevector as the normal state spin excitations in the high-TC
cuprates8-12 demonstrating a commonality between the magnetism in these classes
of materials which perhaps extends to a common origin for superconductivity.
