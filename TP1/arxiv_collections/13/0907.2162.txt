Even if Einstein's General Relativity achieved a great success and overcame
lots of experimental tests, it also showed some shortcomings and flaws which
today advise theorists to ask if it is the definitive theory of gravity. In
this proceeding paper it is shown that, if advanced projects on the detection
of Gravitational Waves (GWs) will improve their sensitivity, allowing to
perform a GWs astronomy, accurate angular and frequency dependent response
functions of interferometers for GWs arising from various Theories of Gravity,
i.e. General Relativity and Extended Theories of Gravity, will be the ultimate
test for General Relativity. This proceeding paper is also a short review of
the Essay which won Honorable Mention at the 2009 Gravity Research Foundation
Awards.
