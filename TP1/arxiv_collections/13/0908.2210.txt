A series of c-axis oriented electron-doped high-Tc superconducting
La(2-x)CexCuO4 thin films, from heavily underdoped x=0.06 to heavily overdoped
x=0.19, have been synthesized by dc magnetron sputtering technique on (100)
SrTiO3 substrates. The influence of various fabrication conditions, such as the
deposition temperature and the deposition rate, etc., on the quality of the
thin films has been scrutinized. We find that the quality of the films is less
sensitive to the deposition temperature in the overdoped region than that in
the underdoped region. In the phase diagram of Tc(x), the superconducting dome
indicates that the optimally doping level is at the point x=0.105 with the
transition temperature Tc0 = 26.5 K. Further more, both the disappearance of
the upturn in the $\rho_{xx}$(T) curve at low temperature under H=10 T and the
positive differential Hall coefficient, $R_H'=d \rho_{xy}/dH$, are observed
around x = 0.15, implying a possible rearrangement of Fermi surface at this
doping level.
