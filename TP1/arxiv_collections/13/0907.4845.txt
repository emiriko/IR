We first note the failures of traditional pQCD techniques as applied to
high-pT heavy ion physics and the suggestion of examining the double ratio of
charm to bottom nuclear modification factors to generically distinguish between
these weak coupling ideas and the strong coupling ideas of AdS/CFT. In order to
gain confidence in the use of AdS/CFT (and to increase the likelihood of
falsifying it and/or pQCD) we extend its application to heavy quark energy loss
in both thermal and nonthermal media by calculating the string drag in a shock
metric.
