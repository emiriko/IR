We consider a quantum model of a nanomechanical flexing beam resonator
interacting with a bath comprising a few damped tunneling two level systems
(TLS's). In contrast with a resonator interacting bilinearly with an ohmic free
oscillator bath (modeling clamping loss, for example), the mechanical resonator
damping is amplitude dependent, while the decoherence of quantum superpositions
of mechanical position states depends only weakly on their spatial separation.
