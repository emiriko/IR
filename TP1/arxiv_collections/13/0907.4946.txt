We combine the analyses for flavor changing neutral current processes and
dark matter solutions in minimal-type supersymmetric grand unified theory (GUT)
models, SO(10) and SU(5), with a large B_s - anti-B_s mixing phase and large
tan beta. For large tan beta, the double penguin diagram dominates the SUSY
contribution to the B_s - anti-B_s mixing amplitude. Also, the Br(B_s -> mu mu)
constraint becomes important as it grows as tan^6 beta, although it can still
be suppressed by large pseudoscalar Higgs mass m_A. We investigate the
correlation between B_s -> mu mu and the dark matter direct detection
cross-section through their dependence on m_A. In the minimal-type of SU(5)
with type I seesaw, the large mixing in neutrino Dirac couplings results in
large lepton flavor violating decay process tau to mu gamma, which in turn sets
upper bound on m_A. In the SO(10) case, the large mixing can be chosen to be in
the Majorana couplings instead, and the constraint from Br(tau -> mu gamma) can
be avoided. The heavy Higgs funnel region turns out to be an interesting
possibility in both cases and the direct dark matter detection should be
possible in the near future in these scenarios.
