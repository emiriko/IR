Apart from the Milky Way, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is the only other
normal star-forming galaxy that was conclusively detected in high energy (> 100
MeV) gamma rays by the Energetic Gamma Ray Telescope (EGRET) on the Compton
Gamma-Ray Observatory. However, the sensitivity of EGRET was sufficient only to
marginally resolve the LMC. We report on measurements of the gamma-ray emission
from the LMC by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space
Telescope. For the first time an externally viewed star-forming galaxy is well
resolved in gamma rays. We discuss the distribution of the LMC diffuse emission
as seen by the LAT and implications for cosmic-ray physics.
