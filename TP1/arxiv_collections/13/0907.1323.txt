We describe a versatile and simple scheme for producing magnetically and
optically-trapped Rb-87 Bose-Einstein condensates, based on a moving-coil
transporter apparatus. The apparatus features a TOP trap that incorporates the
movable quadrupole coils used for magneto-optical trapping and long-distance
magnetic transport of atomic clouds. As a stand-alone device, this trap allows
for the stable production of condensates containing up to one million atoms. In
combination with an optical dipole trap, the TOP trap acts as a funnel for
efficient loading, after which the quadrupole coils can be retracted, thereby
maximizing optical access. The robustness of this scheme is illustrated by
realizing the superfluid-to-Mott insulator transition in a three-dimensional
optical lattice.
