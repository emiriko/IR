We consider a system described by a Fokker-Planck equation with a new type of
momentum-dependent drift coefficient which asymptotically decreases as $-1/p$
for a large momentum $p$. It is shown that the steady-state of this system is a
$\kappa$-generalized Gaussian distribution, which is a non-Gaussian
distribution with a power-law tail.
