Many epidemic processes in networks spread by stochastic contacts among their
connected vertices. There are two limiting cases widely analyzed in the physics
literature, the so-called contact process (CP) where the contagion is expanded
at a certain rate from an infected vertex to one neighbor at a time, and the
reactive process (RP) in which an infected individual effectively contacts all
its neighbors to expand the epidemics. However, a more realistic scenario is
obtained from the interpolation between these two cases, considering a certain
number of stochastic contacts per unit time. Here we propose a discrete-time
formulation of the problem of contact-based epidemic spreading. We resolve a
family of models, parameterized by the number of stochastic contact trials per
unit time, that range from the CP to the RP. In contrast to the common
heterogeneous mean-field approach, we focus on the probability of infection of
individual nodes. Using this formulation, we can construct the whole phase
diagram of the different infection models and determine their critical
properties.
