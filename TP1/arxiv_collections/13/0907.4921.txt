Identified particles have long been of great interest at RHIC in large part
because of the baryon/meson differences observed at intermediate $p_T$ and the
implications for hadronization via quark coalescence. With recent high
statistics data identified particles are also now central to understanding the
details of the jet-medium interactions and energy loss and hadron formation at
intermediate and high $p_T$. In particular, high $p_T$ identified particle
spectra along with two-particle correlations triggered with direct photons,
neutral pions or electrons from heavy flavor decay with hadrons can provide
information about how medium modifications to jet fragmentation depend on
parton type. I will review recent results with identified particles both in
heavy ion systems and the reference measurements in p+p collisions.
