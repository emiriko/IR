The properties of the Galactic supernova remnant SN 1006 are theoretically
reanalysed. Nonlinear kinetic theory is used to determine the acceleration
efficiency of cosmic rays (CRs) in the supernova remnant SN 1006. The known
range of astronomical parameters and the existing measurements of nonthermal
emission are examined in order to define the values of the relevant physical
parameters which determine the CR acceleration efficiency. It is shown that the
parameter values -- proton injection rate, electron to proton ratio and
downstream magnetic field strength -- are determined with the appropriate
accuracy. In particular also the observed azimuthal variations in the gamma-ray
morphology agree with the theoretical expectation. These parameter values,
together with the reduction of the gamma-ray flux relative to a spherically
symmetric acceleration geometry, allow a good fit to the existing data,
including the recently detected TeV emission by H.E.S.S. SN 1006 represents the
first example where a high efficiency of nuclear CR production, required for
the Galactic CR sources, is consistently established.
