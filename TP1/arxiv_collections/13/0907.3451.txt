While frictionless spheres at jamming are isostatic, frictional spheres at
jamming are not. As a result, frictional spheres near jamming do not
necessarily exhibit an excess of soft modes. However, a generalized form of
isostaticity can be introduced if fully mobilized contacts at the Coulomb
friction threshold are considered as slipping contacts. We show here that, in
this framework, the vibrational density of states (DOS) of frictional discs
exhibits a plateau when the generalized isostaticity line is approached. The
crossover frequency to elastic behavior scales linearly with the distance from
this line. Moreover, we show that the frictionless limit, which appears
singular when fully mobilized contacts are treated elastically, becomes smooth
when fully mobilized contacts are allowed to slip.
