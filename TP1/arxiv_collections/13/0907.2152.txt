We present a muon-spin relaxation investigation of the Ising chain magnet
Ca_{3}Co_{2-x}Mn_{x}O_{6} (x~0.95). We find dynamic spin fluctuations
persisting down to the lowest measured temperature of 1.6 K. The previously
observed transition at around T ~18 K is interpreted as a subtle change in
dynamics for a minority of the spins coupling to the muon that we interpret as
spins locking into clusters. The dynamics of this fraction of spins freeze
below a temperature T_{SF}~8 K, while a majority of spins continue to
fluctuate. An explanation of the low temperature behavior is suggested in terms
of the predictions of the anisotropic next-nearest-neighbor Ising model.
