The creation of complex entangled states, resources that enable quantum
computation, can be achieved via simple 'probabilistic' operations which are
individually likely to fail. However, typical proposals exploiting this idea
carry a severe overhead in terms of the accumulation of errors. Here we
describe an method that can rapidly generate large entangled states with an
error accumulation that depends only logarithmically on the failure
probability. We find that the approach may be practical for success rates in
the sub-10% range, while ultimately becoming unfeasible at lower rates. The
assumptions that we make, including parallelism and high connectivity, are
appropriate for real systems including measurement-induced entanglement. This
result therefore shows the feasibility for real devices based on such an
approach.
