The CMS experiment will collect data from the proton-proton collisions
delivered by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at a centre-of-mass energy up to
14 TeV. The CMS trigger system is designed to cope with unprecedented
luminosities and LHC bunch-crossing rates up to 40 MHz. The unique CMS trigger
architecture only employs two trigger levels. The Level-1 trigger is
implemented using custom electronics, while the High Level Trigger (HLT) is
based on software algorithms running on a large cluster of commercial
processors, the Event Filter Farm. We present the major functionalities of the
CMS High Level Trigger system as of the starting of LHC beams operations in
September 2008. The validation of the HLT system in the online environment with
Monte Carlo simulated data and its commissioning during cosmic rays data taking
campaigns are discussed in detail. We conclude with the description of the HLT
operations with the first circulating LHC beams before the incident occurred
the 19th September 2008.
