In this paper we report on a tuneable few electron lateral triple quantum dot
design. The quantum dot potentials are arranged in series. The device is aimed
at studies of triple quantum dot properties where knowing the exact number of
electrons is important as well as quantum information applications involving
electron spin qubits. We demonstrate tuning strategies for achieving required
resonant conditions such as quadruple points where all three quantum dots are
on resonance. We find that in such a device resonant conditions at specific
configurations are accompanied by novel charge transfer behaviour.
