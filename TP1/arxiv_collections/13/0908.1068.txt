In human societies opinion formation is mediated by social interactions,
consequently taking place on a network of relationships and at the same time
influencing the structure of the network and its evolution. To investigate this
coevolution of opinions and social interaction structure we develop a dynamic
agent-based network model, by taking into account short range interactions like
discussions between individuals, long range interactions like a sense for
overall mood modulated by the attitudes of individuals, and external field
corresponding to outside influence. Moreover, individual biases can be
naturally taken into account. In addition the model includes the opinion
dependent link-rewiring scheme to describe network topology coevolution with a
slower time scale than that of the opinion formation. With this model
comprehensive numerical simulations and mean field calculations have been
carried out and they show the importance of the separation between fast and
slow time scales resulting in the network to organize as well-connected small
communities of agents with the same opinion.
