In this paper it is shown that dynamics based on a variation of the
gravitational constant $G$ with time solves several puzzling and anomalous
features observed, for example the rotation curves of galaxies (attributed to
as yet undetected Dark matter). It is also pointed out that this provides an
explanation for the anomalous acceleration of the Pioneer space crafts observed
by J.D.Anderson and co-workers.
