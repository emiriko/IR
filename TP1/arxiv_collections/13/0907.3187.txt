We describe a proposal for fast electron spin initialization in a negatively
charged quantum dot coupled to a microcavity without the need for a strong
magnetic field. We employ two-photon excitation to access trion states that are
spin forbidden by one-photon excitation. Our simulation shows a maximum
initialization speed of 1.3 GHz and maximum fidelity of 99.7% with realistic
system parameters.
