We describe in detail our calculation of the full supersymmetric (SUSY) QCD
corrections to neutralino annihilation into heavy quarks and extend our
numerical analysis of the resulting dark matter relic density to scenarios
without scalar or gaugino mass unification. In these scenarios, the final state
is often composed of top quarks and the annihilation proceeds through Z^0-boson
or scalar top-quark exchanges. The impact of the corrections is again shown to
be sizable, so that they must be taken into account systematically in global
analyses of the supersymmetry parameter space.
