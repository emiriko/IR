We determine all possible multiplicities of general singular fibers of a
holomorphic Lagrangian fibration, under the assumption that all components of
the fibers are of Fujiki class. The multiplicities are at most 6 and the
possible values are intricately related to the Kodaira type of the
characteristic cycle.
