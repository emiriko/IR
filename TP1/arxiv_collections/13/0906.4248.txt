Our understanding of nuclear fission, a fundamental nuclear decay, is still
incomplete due to the complexity of the process. In this paper, we describe a
study of spontaneous fission using the symmetry-unrestricted nuclear density
functional theory. Our results show that the observed bimodal fission can be
explained in terms of pathways in multidimensional collective space
corresponding to different geometries of fission products. We also predict a
new phenomenon of trimodal spontaneous fission for some rutherfordium,
seaborgium, and hassium isotopes.
