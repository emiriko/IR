Recent optical conductivity experiments of doped graphene in the infrared
regime reveal a strong background in the energy region between the intra and
interband transitions difficult to explain within conventional pictures. We
propose a phenomenological model taking into account the marginal Fermi liquid
nature of the quasiparticles in graphene near the neutrality point that can
explain qualitatively the observed features. We also study the electronic Raman
signal and suggest that it will also be anomalous.
