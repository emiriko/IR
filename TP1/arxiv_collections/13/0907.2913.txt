Neutron and x-ray scattering studies on relaxor ferroelectric systems
Pb(Zn$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_3$ (PZN), Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_3$ (PMN), and
their solid solutions with PbTiO$_3$ (PT) have shown that inhomogeneities and
disorder play important roles in the materials properties. Although a
long-range polar order can be established at low temperature - sometimes with
the help of an external electric field; short-range local structures called the
``polar nano-regions'' (PNR) still persist. Both the bulk structure and the PNR
have been studied in details. The coexistence and competition of long- and
short-range polar orders and how they affect the structural and dynamical
properties of relaxor materials are discussed.
