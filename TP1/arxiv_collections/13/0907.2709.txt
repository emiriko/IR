Between 2000 November and 2006 May, one or more spacecraft of the
interplanetary network (IPN) detected 226 cosmic gamma-ray bursts that were
also detected by the FREGATE experiment aboard the HETE-II spacecraft. During
this period, the IPN consisted of up to nine spacecraft, and using
triangulation, the localizations of 157 bursts were obtained. We present the
IPN localization data on these events.
