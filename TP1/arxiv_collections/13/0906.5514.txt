We study the enhancement of the magnetic transition temperature $T_c$ due to
incident light in ferromagnetic semiconductors such as EuS. The photoexcited
carriers mediate an extra ferromagnetic interaction due to the coupling with
the localized magnetic moments. The Hamiltonian consists of a Heisenberg model
for the localized moments and an interaction term between the photoexcited
carriers and the localized moments. The model predicts a small enhancement of
the transition temperature in semi-quantitative agreement with the experiments.
