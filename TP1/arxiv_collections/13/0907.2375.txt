The purpose of this paper is to analyze the stability of interacting matter
in the presence of a cosmological constant. Using an approach based on the heat
equation, no imaginary part is found for the effective potential in the
presence of a fixed background, which is the n-dimensional sphere or else an
analytical continuation thereof, which is explored in some detail.
