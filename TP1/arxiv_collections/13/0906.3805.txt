We study pair production of scalar top quarks in e+e- collisions with the
subsequent decay of the top squarks into b-quarks and charginos. We simulate
this process by using PYTHIA6.4 for the beam energy 2Ebeam = 350, 400, 500,
800, 1000 GeV. A set of criteria for physical variables is proposed, which
provides good separation of stop signal events from top quark pair production
being the main background. These criteria allow us to reconstruct the mass of
the top squark with an integrared luminosity of 1000 1/fb provided that the
neutralino mass is known.
