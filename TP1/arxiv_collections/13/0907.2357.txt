We perform a \chi^2-analysis of Nuclear Parton Distribution Functions (NPDFs)
using neutral current charged-lepton Deeply Inelastic Scattering (DIS) and
Drell-Yan data for several nuclear targets. The nuclear A dependence of the
NPDFs is extracted in a next-to-leading order fit. We compare the nuclear
corrections factors F2(Fe)/F2(D) for this charged-lepton data with other
results from the literature. In particular, we compare and contrast fits based
upon the charged-lepton DIS data with those using neutrino-nucleon DIS data.
