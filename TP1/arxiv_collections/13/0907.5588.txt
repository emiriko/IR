We present a resolution of the Klein paradox within the framework of
one-particle relativistic quantum mechanics. Not only reflection becomes total
but the vacuum remains neutral as well. This is accomplished by replacing the
pair production process with virtual negative energy "incidence" within the
barrier in a similar manner to what is done with image charges in electrostatic
and virtual sources in optics.
