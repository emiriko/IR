In this work we review the entire classification of 2x2 distillable states
for protocols with a finite numbers of copies. We show a distillation protocol
that allows to distill Bell states with non zero probability at any time for an
initial singlet in vacuum. It is shown that the same protocol used in non zero
thermal baths yields a considerable recovering of entanglement.
