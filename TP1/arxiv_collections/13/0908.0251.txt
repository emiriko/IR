We propose a simple method for incorporating correlations into the impact
parameter space description of multiple (semi-)hard partonic collisions in high
energy hadron-hadron scattering. The perturbative QCD input is the standard
factorization theorem for inclusive dijet production with a lower cutoff on
transverse momentum. The width of the transverse distribution of hard partons
is fixed by parameterizations of the two-gluon form factor. We then reconstruct
the hard contribution to the total inelastic profile function and obtain
corrections due to correlations to the more commonly used eikonal description.
Estimates of the size of double correlation corrections are based on the rate
of double collisions measured at the Tevatron. We find that, if typical values
for the lower transverse momentum cutoff are used in the calculation of the
inclusive hard dijet cross section, then the correlation corrections are
necessary for maintaining consistency with expectations for the total inelastic
proton-proton cross section at LHC energies.
