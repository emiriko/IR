Electron and nuclear spins have good coherence times and an ensemble of spins
is a promising candidate for a quantum memory. By employing holographic
techniques via field gradients a single ensemble may be used to store many bits
of information. Here we present a coherent memory using a pulsed magnetic field
gradient, and demonstrate the storage and retrieval of up to 100 weak 10 GHz
coherent excitations in collective states of an electron spin ensemble. We
further show that such collective excitations in the electron spin can then be
stored in nuclear spin states, which offer coherence times in excess of
seconds.
