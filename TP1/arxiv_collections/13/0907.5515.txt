We review the formation scenarios for binary black holes, and show that their
coalescence rate depends very strongly on the outcome of the second mass
transfer. However, the observations of IC10 X-1, an binary with a massive black
hole accreting from a Wolf-Rayet star proves that this mass transfer can be
stable. We analyze the future evolution of IC10 X-1 and show that it is very
likely to form a binary black hole system merging in a few Gyrs. We estimate
the coalescence rate density of such systems to be $ 0.06 {\rm Mpc}^{-3} {\rm
Myr}^{-1}$, and the detection rate for the current LIGO/VIRGO of $ 0.69 {\rm
yr}^{-1} $, a much higher value than the expected double neutron star rate.
Thus the first detection of a gravitational wave source is likely to be a
coalescence of a binary black hole.
