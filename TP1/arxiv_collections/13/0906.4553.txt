Cosmic rays are the most energetic particles arriving at earth. Although most
of them are thought to be accelerated by supernova remnants, the details of the
acceleration process and its efficiency are not well determined. Here we show
that the pressure induced by cosmic rays exceeds the thermal pressure behind
the northeast shock of the supernova remnant RCW 86, where the X-ray emission
is dominated by synchrotron radiation from ultra-relativistic electrons. We
determined the cosmic-ray content from the thermal Doppler broadening measured
with optical spectroscopy, combined with a proper-motion study in X- rays. The
measured post-shock proton temperature in combination with the shock velocity
does not agree with standard shock heating, implying that >50% of the
post-shock pressure is produced by cosmic rays.
