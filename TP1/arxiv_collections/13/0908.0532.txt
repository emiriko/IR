The Gaugephobic Higgs model provides an interpolation between three different
models of electroweak symmetry breaking: Higgsless models, Randall-Sundrum
models, and the Standard Model. At parameter points between the extremes,
Standard Model Higgs signals are present at reduced rates, and Higgsless
Kaluza-Klein excitations are present with shifted masses and couplings, as well
as signals from exotic quarks necessary to protect the Zbb coupling. Using a
new implementation of the model in SHERPA, we show the LHC signals which
differentiate the generic Gaugephobic Higgs model from its limiting cases.
These are all signals involving a Higgs coupling to a Kaluza-Klein gauge boson
or quark. We identify the clean signal $p p \to W^(i) \to W H$ mediated by a
Kaluza-Klein W, which can be present at large rates and is enhanced for even
Kaluza-Klein numbers. Due to the very hard lepton coming from the W decay, this
signature has little background, and provides a better discovery channel for
the Higgs than any of the Standard Model modes, over its entire mass range. A
Higgs radiated from new heavy quarks also has large rates, but is much less
promising due to very high multiplicity final states.
