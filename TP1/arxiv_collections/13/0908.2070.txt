We point out that modern brane theories suffer from a severe vacuum energy
problem. To be specific, the Casimir energy associated with the matter fields
confined to the brane, is stemming from the one and the same localization
mechanism which forms the brane itself, and is thus generically unavoidable.
Possible practical solutions are discussed, including in particular
spontaneously broken supersymmetry, and quantum mechanically induced brane
tension.
