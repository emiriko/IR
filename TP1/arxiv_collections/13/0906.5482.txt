We have studied a quantum dot with Rashba spin orbit interaction on a plane
where the position and momentum coordinates are considered to be
noncommutative. The energy spectrum of the system is found to be equivalent to
that of a quantum dot with Rashba spin-orbit interaction in a magnetic field
under certain conditions.
