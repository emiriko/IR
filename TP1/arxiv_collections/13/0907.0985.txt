Context: Protoplanetary disks are observed to remain dust-rich for up to
several million years. Theoretical modeling, on the other hand, raises several
questions. Firstly, dust coagulation occurs so rapidly, that if the small dust
grains are not replenished by collisional fragmentation of dust aggregates,
most disks should be observed to be dust poor, which is not the case. Secondly,
if dust aggregates grow to sizes of the order of centimeters to meters, they
drift so fast inwards, that they are quickly lost.
  Aims: We attempt to verify if collisional fragmentation of dust aggregates is
effective enough to keep disks 'dusty' by replenishing the population of small
grains and by preventing excessive radial drift.
  Methods: With a new and sophisticated implicitly integrated coagulation and
fragmentation modeling code, we solve the combined problem of coagulation,
fragmentation, turbulent mixing and radial drift and at the same time solve for
the 1-D viscous gas disk evolution.
  Results: We find that for a critical collision velocity of 1 m/s, as
suggested by laboratory experiments, the fragmentation is so effective, that at
all times the dust is in the form of relatively small particles. This means
that radial drift is small and that large amounts of small dust particles
remain present for a few million years, as observed. For a critical velocity of
10 m/s, we find that particles grow about two orders of magnitude larger, which
leads again to significant dust loss since larger particles are more strongly
affected by radial drift.
