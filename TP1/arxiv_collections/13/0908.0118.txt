We present results from Monte Carlo simulations of a three dimensional
fermionic field theory which can be derived from a model of graphene in which
electrons interact via a screened Coulomb potential. For our simulations we
employ lattice gauge theory methods used in elementary particle physics. We
show that the theory undergoes a second order phase transition and we provide
estimates for the critical exponents. The estimated value of the physical
critical coupling implies that graphene in vacuum is an insulator. We also
present the first results for the quasiparticle dispersion relation.
