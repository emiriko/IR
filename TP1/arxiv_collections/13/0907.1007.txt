We argue that the lightest vector bound states of a confining hidden sector
communicating with the Standard Model through the Higgs portal are stable and
are viable candidates of dark matter. The model is based on an SU(2) gauge
group with a scalar field in its fundamental representation and the stability
of the lightest vector bound state results from the existence of a custodial
symmetry. As the relic density depends essentially on the scale of confinement
in the hidden sector, Lambda_HS, agreement with WMAP abundance requires
Lambda_HS in the 20-120 TeV range.
