A CRDT is a data type whose operations commute when they are concurrent.
Replicas of a CRDT eventually converge without any complex concurrency control.
As an existence proof, we exhibit a non-trivial CRDT: a shared edit buffer
called Treedoc. We outline the design, implementation and performance of
Treedoc. We discuss how the CRDT concept can be generalised, and its
limitations.
