We describe experimental signatures of Majorana fermion edge states, which
form at the interface between a superconductor and the surface of a topological
insulator. If a lead couples to the Majorana fermions through electron
tunneling, the Majorana fermions induce \textit{resonant} Andreev reflections
from the lead to the grounded superconductor. The linear tunneling conductance
is $0 $ ($2 e^2/h$) if there is an even (odd) number of vortices in the
superconductor. Similar resonance occurs for tunneling into the zero mode in
the vortex core. We also study the current and noise of a two-lead device.
