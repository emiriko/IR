In a class of the gauge-Higgs unification models the 4D neutral Higgs boson,
which is a part of the extra-dimensional component of the gauge fields, becomes
absolutely stable as a consequence of the gauge invariance and dynamically
generated new parity, serving as a promising candidate for cold dark matter
(CDM). We show that the observed relic abundance of cold dark matter is
obtained in the SO(5) x U(1) model in the warped space with the Higgs mass
around 70 GeV. The Higgs-nucleon scattering cross section is found to be close
to the current CDMS II and XENON10 bounds in the direct detection of dark
matter.
