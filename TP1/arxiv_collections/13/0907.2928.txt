The dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), which is successful in the study of
strongly correlated fermions, was recently extended to boson systems [Phys.
Rev. B {\textbf 77}, 235106 (2008)]. In this paper, we employ the bosonic DMFT
to study the Bose-Hubbard model which describes on-site interacting bosons in a
lattice. Using exact diagonalization as the impurity solver, we get the DMFT
solutions for the Green's function, the occupation density, as well as the
condensate fraction on a Bethe lattice. Various phases are identified: the Mott
insulator, the Bose-Einstein condensed (BEC) phase, and the normal phase. At
finite temperatures, we obtain the crossover between the Mott-like regime and
the normal phase, as well as the BEC-to-normal phase transition. Phase diagrams
on the $\mu/U-\tilde{t}/U$ plane and on the $T/U-\tilde{t}/U$ plane are
produced ($\tilde{t}$ is the scaled hopping amplitude). We compare our results
with the previous ones, and discuss the implication of these results to
experiments.
