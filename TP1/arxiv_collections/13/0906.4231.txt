In this talk, we present our recent next-to-leading order (NLO) nuclear
parton distribution functions (nPDFs), which we call EPS09. As an extension to
earlier NLO analyses, we supplement the deep inelastic scattering and Drell-Yan
dilepton data by inclusive midrapidity pion measurements from RHIC in order to
reduce the otherwize large freedom in the nuclear gluon densities. Our
Hessian-type error analysis leading to a collection of nPDF error sets, is the
first of its kind among the nPDF analyses.
