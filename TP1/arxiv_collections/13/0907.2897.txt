We show that replacing the usual sifting step of the standard
quantum-key-distribution protocol BB84 by a one-way reverse reconciliation
procedure increases its robustness against photon-number-splitting (PNS)
attacks to the level of the SARG04 protocol while keeping the raw key-rate of
BB84. This protocol, which uses the same state and detection than BB84, is the
m=4 member of a protocol-family using m polarization states which we introduce
here. We show that the robustness of these protocols against PNS attacks
increases exponentially with m, and that the effective keyrate of optimized
weak coherent pulses decreases with the transmission T like T^{1+1/(m-2)}.
