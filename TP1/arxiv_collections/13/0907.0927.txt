We describe the structure of "K-approximate subgroups'' of solvable subgroups
of GL_n(C), showing that they have a large nilpotent piece. By combining this
with the main result of our recent paper on approximate subgroups of
torsion-free nilpotent groups, we show that such approximate subgroups are
efficiently controlled by nilpotent progressions.
