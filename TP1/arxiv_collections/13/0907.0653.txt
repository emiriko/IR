All rigorous and detailed dynamical results in Bianchi cosmology rest upon
the existence of a hierarchical structure of conserved quantities and monotonic
functions. In this paper we uncover the underlying general mechanism and derive
this hierarchical structure from the scale-automorphism group for an
illustrative example, vacuum and diagonal class A perfect fluid models. First,
kinematically, the scale-automorphism group leads to a reduced dynamical system
that consists of a hierarchy of scale-automorphism invariant sets. Second, we
show that, dynamically, the scale-automorphism group results in
scale-automorphism invariant monotone functions and conserved quantities that
restrict the flow of the reduced dynamical system.
