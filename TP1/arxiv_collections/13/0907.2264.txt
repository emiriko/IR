We present a theoretical calculation of the pull-in control in capacitive
micro switches actuated by Casimir forces, using external magnetic fields. The
external magnetic fields induces an optical anisotropy due to the excitation of
magneto plasmons, that reduces the Casimir force. The calculations are
performed in the Voigt configuration, and the results show that as the magnetic
field increases the system becomes more stable. The detachment length for a
cantilever is also calculated for a cantilever, showing that it increases with
increasing magnetic field. At the pull-in separation, the stiffness of the
system decreases with increasing magnetic field.
