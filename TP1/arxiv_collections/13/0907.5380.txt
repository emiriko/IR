We present the result of projected cross correlation analysis of AGNs and
galaxies at redshifts from 0.3 to 3.0. The Japanese Virtual Observatory (JVO)
was used to obtain the Subaru Suprime-Cam images and UKIDSS catalog data around
AGNs. We investigated 1,809 AGNs, which is about ten times larger a sample than
that used in previous studies on AGN-galaxy clustering at redshifts larger than
0.6. 90% of the AGN samples are optically-selected AGN from the SDSS and 2dF
catalogs. The galaxy samples at low redshift includes many redder objects from
UKIDSS survey, while at higher redshift they are mainly blue galaxies from
Suprime-Cam. We found significant excess of galaxies around the AGNs at
redshifts from 0.3 to 1.8. For the low redshift samples ($z<0.9$), we obtained
correlation length of $r_{0} = $5--6 $h^{-1}$Mpc ($\gamma = 1.8$), which
indicates that the AGNs at this redshift range reside in a similar environment
around typical local galaxies. We also found that AGNs at higher redshift
ranges reside in a denser environment than lower redshift AGNs; For $z=1.3 \sim
1.8$ AGNs, the cross correlation length was measured as 11$^{+6}_{-3}$
$h^{-1}$Mpc ($\gamma=1.8$). Considering that our galaxies sample is based on
optical observations with Suprime-Cam at the redshift range, it is expected
that blue star-forming galaxies comprise the majority of objects that are
observed to be clustered around the AGNs. It is successfully demonstrated that
the use of the archive through the Virtual Observatory system can provide a
powerful tool for investigating the small scale environment of the intermediate
redshift AGNs.
