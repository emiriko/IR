We study the unique 6 dimensional orbifold with chiral fermions where a
stable dark matter candidate is present due to Lorentz invariance on the
orbifold, with no additional discrete symmetries imposed by hand. We propose a
model of Universal Extra Dimensions where a scalar photon of few hundred GeV is
a good candidate for dark matter. The spectrum of the model is characteristic
of the geometry, and it has clear distinctive features compared to previous
models of Kaluza-Klein dark matter. The 5 dimensional limit of this model is
the minimal model of natural Kaluza-Klein dark matter. Notwithstanding the low
mass range preferred by cosmology, the model will be a challenge for the LHC
due to the relatively small splitting between the states in the same KK level.
