A new family of parameters intended for composition studies is presented.
They make exclusive use of surface data combining the information from the
total signal at each triggered detector and the array geometry. We perform an
analytical study of these composition estimators in order to assess their
reliability, stability and possible optimization. The influence of the
different slopes of the proton and Iron lateral distribution function on the
discrimination power of the estimators is also studied. Additionally, the
stability of the parameter in face of a possible underestimation of the size of
the muon component by the shower simulation codes, as it is suggested by
experimental evidence, is also studied.
