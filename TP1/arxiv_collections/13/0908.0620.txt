We present a new numerical method for the generation of binary neutron star
initial data using a method along the lines of the the Wilson-Mathews or the
closely related conformal thin sandwich approach. Our method uses six different
computational domains, which include spatial infinity. Each domain has its own
coordinates which are chosen such that the star surfaces always coincide with
domain boundaries. These properties facilitate the imposition of boundary
conditions. Since all our fields are smooth inside each domain, we are able to
use an efficient pseudospectral method to solve the elliptic equations
associated with the conformal thin sandwich approach. Currently we have
implemented corotating configurations with arbitrary mass ratios, but an
extension to arbitrary spins is possible. The main purpose of this paper is to
introduce our new method and to test our code for several different
configurations.
