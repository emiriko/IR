We demonstrate that information can be transmitted and processed with pure
spin currents in silicon. Fe/Al2O3 tunnel barrier contacts are used to produce
significant electron spin polarization in the silicon, generating a spin
current which flows outside of the charge current path. The spin orientation of
this pure spin current is controlled in one of three ways: (a) by switching the
magnetization of the Fe contact, (b) by changing the polarity of the bias on
the Fe/Al2O3 (injector) contact, which enables the generation of either
majority or minority spin populations in the Si, providing a way to
electrically manipulate the injected spin orientation without changing the
magnetization of the contact itself, and (c) by inducing spin precession
through application of a small perpendicular magnetic field. Spin polarization
by electrical extraction is as effective as that achieved by the more common
electrical spin injection. The output characteristics of a planar silicon three
terminal device are very similar to those of non-volatile giant
magnetoresistance metal spin-valve structures
