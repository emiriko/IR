We present the results of a transcontinental campaign to observe the 2009
June 5 transit of the exoplanet HD 80606b. We report the first detection of the
transit ingress, revealing the transit duration to be 11.64 +/- 0.25 hr and
allowing more robust determinations of the system parameters. Keck spectra
obtained at midtransit exhibit an anomalous blueshift, giving definitive
evidence that the stellar spin axis and planetary orbital axis are misaligned.
The Keck data show that the projected spin-orbit angle is between 32-87 deg
with 68.3% confidence and between 14-142 deg with 99.73% confidence. Thus the
orbit of this planet is not only highly eccentric (e=0.93), but is also tilted
away from the equatorial plane of its parent star. A large tilt had been
predicted, based on the idea that the planet's eccentric orbit was caused by
the Kozai mechanism. Independently of the theory, it is noteworthy that all 3
exoplanetary systems with known spin-orbit misalignments have massive planets
on eccentric orbits, suggesting that those systems migrate differently than
lower-mass planets on circular orbits.
