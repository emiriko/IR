We discuss the differences and similarities in the interaction of scalar and
vector wave-fields with particles and holes. Analytical results are provided
for the transmission of isolated and arrayed small holes as well as surface
modes in hole arrays for light, electrons, and sound. In contrast to the
optical case, small-hole arrays in perforated perfect screens cannot produce
acoustic or electronic surface-bound states. However, unlike electrons and
light, sound is transmitted through individual holes approximately in
proportion to their area, regardless their size. We discuss these issues with a
systematic analysis that allows exploring both common properties and unique
behavior in wave phenomena for different material realizations.
