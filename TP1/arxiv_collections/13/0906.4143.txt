We study the dynamics of the many-body state of ultracold bosons trapped in a
bistable optical lattice in an optomechanical resonator controlled by a
time-dependent input field. We focus on the dynamics of the many-body system
following discontinuous jumps of the intracavity field. We identify
experimentally realizable parameters for the bistable quantum phase transition
between Mott insulator and superfluid.
