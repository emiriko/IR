We present a search for a standard model Higgs boson produced in association
with a W boson using 2.7 1/fb of integrated luminosity of pbar-p collision data
taken at sqrt{s} = 1.96 TeV. Limits on the Higgs boson production rate are
obtained for masses between 100 GeV and 150 GeV. Through the use of
multivariate techniques, the analysis achieves an observed (expected) 95%
confidence level upper limit of 5.6 (4.8) times the theoretically expected
production cross section for a standard model Higgs boson with a mass of 115
GeV.
