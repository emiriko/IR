Based on data on elastic $\rho^0$ photoproduction from the H1, Omega and ZEUS
collaborations, a fit has been performed to extract the value $\alpha_P (t)$ of
the pomeron trajectory at fixed values of t from the W dependence of the
differential $\gamma p$ cross section $d \sigma_{\gamma p} (W) / d t$. The data
used in the fit cover the range of $8.3 \le W \le 94 GeV$ in $\gamma p$
centre-of-mass energy and $0.01 \le |t| \le 0.95 GeV^2$ in momentum transfer.
  A linear fit to the resulting values of $\alpha_P (t)$ yields $\alpha_{P,0}
=1.0871 \pm 0.0026 (stat.) \pm 0.0030 (syst.)$ for the intercept and $\alpha'_P
= 0.126 \pm 0.013 (stat.) \pm 0.012 (syst.) GeV^{-2}$ for the slope of the
pomeron trajectory. The data are also compatible with the Donnachie-Landshoff
trajectory $\alpha_P (t) = 1.0808 + 0.25 GeV^{-2}\cdot t$ at low values $|t|
\lesssim 0.3 GeV^2$ and with a constant value of $\alpha_P (t)$ at larger
values of $|t|$.
