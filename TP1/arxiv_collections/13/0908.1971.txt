We present deep XMM-Newton EPIC spectroscopic and timing X-ray observations
of the nearby solitary radio millisecond pulsar, PSR J0030+0451. Its emission
spectrum in the 0.1-10 keV range is found to be remarkably similar to that of
the nearest and best studied millisecond pulsar, PSR J0437-4715, being well
described by a predominantly thermal two-temperature model plus a faint hard
tail evident above ~2 keV. The pulsed emission in the 0.3-2 keV band is
characterized by two broad pulses with pulsed fraction ~60-70%, consistent with
a mostly thermal origin of the X-rays only if the surface polar cap radiation
is from a light-element atmosphere. Modeling of the thermal pulses permits us
to place constraints on the neutron star radius of R>10.7 (95% confidence) and
R>10.4 km (at 99.9% confidence) for M=1.4 M_sun.
