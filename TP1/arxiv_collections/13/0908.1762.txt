Let F/Q be number field. The space of positive definite binary Hermitian
forms over F form an open cone in a real vector space. There is a natural
decomposition of this cone into subcones, which descend give rise to hyperbolic
tessellations of 3-dimensional hyperbolic space by ideal polytopes.
  We compute the structure of these polytopes for a range of imaginary
quadratic fields.
