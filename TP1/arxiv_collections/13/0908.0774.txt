Pulsation powered by deuterium burning in brown dwarfs and very low mass
stars has been put forth (Palla & Baraffe 2005) as a novel probe of the
interiors of these objects in the 1-15 Myr age range. Previous observations
have hinted at variability on the expected timescales of a few hours,
suggesting but not confirming that the phenomenon is at work in young brown
dwarfs. We have recently carried out a dedicated campaign to search for this
putative class of pulsators among known low-mass members of five young star
clusters. Our survey achieves sensitivity to periodic oscillations with
photometric amplitudes down to several millimagnitudes. We present the census
of variability over timescales ranging from minutes to days and discuss the
current prospects for pulsation as a tool in the study of young, objects near
the substellar boundary. As a byproduct, this work provides new insights into
the distribution of stellar rotation periods at young ages via the detection of
variability due to cool surface spots.
