We propose to use bifurcation theory and pattern formation as theoretical
probes for various hypotheses about the neural organization of the brain. This
allows us to make predictions about the kinds of patterns that should be
observed in the activity of real brains through, e.g. optical imaging, and
opens the door to the design of experiments to test these hypotheses. We study
the specific problem of visual edges and textures perception and suggest that
these features may be represented at the population level in the visual cortex
as a specific second-order tensor, the structure tensor, perhaps within a
hypercolumn. We then extend the classical ring model to this case and show that
its natural framework is the non-Euclidean hyperbolic geometry. This brings in
the beautiful structure of its group of isometries and certain of its subgroups
which have a direct interpretation in terms of the organization of the neural
populations that are assumed to encode the structure tensor. By studying the
bifurcations of the solutions of the structure tensor equations, the analog of
the classical Wilson and Cowan equations, under the assumption of invariance
with respect to the action of these subgroups, we predict the appearance of
characteristic patterns. These patterns can be described by what we call
hyperbolic or H-planforms that are reminiscent of Euclidean planar waves and of
the planforms that were used in [1, 2] to account for some visual
hallucinations. If these patterns could be observed through brain imaging
techniques they would reveal the built-in or acquired invariance of the neural
organization to the action of the corresponding subgroups.
