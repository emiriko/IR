We summarize and combine the results on the direct measurements of the mass
of the W boson in data collected by the Tevatron experiments CDF and D0 at
Fermilab. Results from CDF Run-0 (1988-1889) and Run-I (1992-1995) have been
combined with D0 results from Run-I, the CDF 200 pb^(-1) published results from
the first period of Run-II (2001-2004) and the recent 1 fb^(-1) result in the
electron channel from D0 (2002-2006). The results are corrected for any
inconsistencies in parton distribution functions and assumptions about
electroweak parameters used in the different analyses. The resulting Tevatron
average for the mass of the W boson is M(W) = 80,420+31 MeV.
