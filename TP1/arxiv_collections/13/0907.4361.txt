Generalizing a recent analysis, we model the quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno
effects with a quickly switched, ideal LC/LR circuit, in the limiting case of
it alternating very many times between its short LC and even shorter LR regime.
If the initial current is arranged to be negligible, the capacitor turns out
never to discharge. If the initial current is made dominant, this capacitor
discharges, and faster than the exponential decay to which it limits. The
existence and simplicity of these phases in such a rudimentary model indicates
that the corresponding effects are ubiquitous throughout physics, both quantum
and classical. In turn, the parameter space of this model contains intermediate
phases in which the circuit exhibits behaviors that seem to foreshadow other
quantum effects of some interest.
