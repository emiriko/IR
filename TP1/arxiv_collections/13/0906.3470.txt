After a brief review of the status of the kilometer-scale neutrino
observatory IceCube, we discuss the prospect that such detectors discover the
still-enigmatic sources of cosmic rays. After all, this aspiration set the
scale of the instrument. While only a smoking gun is missing for the case that
the Galactic component of the cosmic-ray spectrum originates in supernova
remnants, the origin of the extragalactic component remains as inscrutable as
ever. We speculate on the role of the nearby active galaxies Centaurus A and
M87.
