Noncommutative Chern - Simons' system is non-perturbatively investigated at a
full deformed level. A deformed "commutative" phase space is found by a
non-canonical change between two sets of deformed variables of noncommutative
space. It is explored that in the "commutative" phase space all calculations
are similar to the case in commutative space. Spectra of the energy and angular
momentum of the Chern - Simons' system are obtained at the full deformed level.
The noncommutative-commutative correspondence is clearly showed. Formalism for
the general dynamical system is briefly presented. Some subtle points are
clarified.
