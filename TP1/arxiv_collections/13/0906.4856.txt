High-field magnetization, M($H$), on Ni$_{5}$(TeO$_{3}$)$_{4}$X$_{2}$ (X = Br
and Cl) were measured by using a pulse magnet. These compounds have a two
dimensional crystal structure and a distorted kagome spin frustrated system
which is builded by the Ni$^{2+}$ ions ($\textbf{S}$ = 1). The N\'eel
transition temperatures are $T_{N} \sim$ 28 and 23 K for X = Br and Cl,
respectively. When $T < T_{N}$, we observed a step-like transition at $H_{c}
\sim$ 11 and 10 T for X = Br and Cl, respectively. On the other hand, at $T >
T_{N}$, the field-dependent magnetization curves behaved like a monotonically
increasing straight line up to 55 T. The $H_{c}$ value is close to those
obtained by previous spin resonance studies in which a model of spin-flop
scenario was proposed to explain the field-dependent resonance spectra. Their
model predicts a further transition at around 23 T, however, our observations
did not show any plateau behaviors, saturation or other anomalies up to 55 T,
suggesting that the further transition possibly exists at a much higher field
region.
