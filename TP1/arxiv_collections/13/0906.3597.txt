In this paper, the thermo-mechanical behaviour of hemp fibres (Cannabis
sativa L.) is investigated using a Dynamic Mechanical Analyser. Experiments are
performed at a frequency of 1 Hz in the temperature range of 20 to 220\degree
C. When a periodic solicitation is applied to an elementary fibre, an increase
of the fibre rigidity and a reduction of the damping capacity are observed.
These evolutions aim at stabilization after an identified number of cycles,
traducing a phenomenon of "adaptation". This specific mechanical behaviour
certainly involves biochemical and/or structural modifications in the material
organisation as microfibrils reorientation. In addition, the behaviour of hemp
fibres is affected by temperature. Temperature acts as an activation factor but
also as a degradation factor of the viscoelastic properties of fibres. The
rigidity and the endurance of fibres are highly affected by thermal treatment
at temperature above 150\degree C to 180\degree C. Taking into account these
results, polypropylene-hemp fibres composites were manufactured using a
specific processing cycle. By respecting the integrity of fibres during
manufacturing, it appears that the relatively high level of the specific
mechanical properties of composites is really encouraging in sight of
applications requiring high mechanical performances.
