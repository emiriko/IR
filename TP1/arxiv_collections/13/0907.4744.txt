We present new results on 2-particle azimuthal ($\Delta\phi$) correlation
relative to event plane and 3-particle pseudorapidity ($\Delta\eta$)
correlation at mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{{\it s}_{NN}}$ = 200
GeV, measured by the STAR experiment. While jet-like correlation is symmetric,
ridge is found to be asymmetric when trigger particle azimuth is between in-
and out-of-plane. The charge ordering properties between associated and trigger
particles are exploited to separate jet-like and ridge contributions in
3-particle $\Delta\eta$-$\Delta\eta$ correlations. We found that like-sign
triplets are dominated by ridge. The separated ridge, while narrow in
$\Delta\phi$, is extremely broad in $\Delta\eta$. The ridge particles are not
only uncorrelated to the trigger particle in $\Delta\eta$, but also
uncorrelated between themselves.
