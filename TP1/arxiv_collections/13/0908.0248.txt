We have achieved Bose-Einstein condensation of $^{40}$Ca, the first for an
alkaline earth element. The influence of elastic and inelastic collisions
associated with the large ground state s-wave scattering length of $^{40}$Ca
was measured. From these findings, an optimized loading and cooling scheme was
developed that allowed us to condense about $2 \cdot 10^4$ atoms after laser
cooling in a two-stage magneto-optical trap and subsequent forced evaporation
in a crossed dipole trap within less than 3 s. The condensation of an alkaline
earth element opens novel opportunities for precision measurements on the
narrow intercombination lines as well as investigations of molecular states at
the $^1$S--$^3$P asymptotes.
