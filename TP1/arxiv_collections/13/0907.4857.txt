Inflation produces super-horizon sized perturbations that ultimately return
within the horizon and are thought to form the seeds of all observed large
scale structure in the Universe. But inflationary predictions can only be
compared with present day observations if, as conventional wisdom dictates,
they remain unpolluted by subsequent sub-horizon causal physical processes and
therefore remain immune from the vicissitudes of unknown universal dynamics in
the intervening period. Here we demonstrate that conventional wisdom need not
be correct, and as a result cosmological signatures arising from intervening
unknown non-inflationary processes may confuse the interpretation of
observational data today.
