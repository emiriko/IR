The coherent quantum evolution of a one-dimensional many-particle system
after sweeping the Hamiltonian through a critical point is studied using a
generalized quantum Ising model containing both integrable and non-integrable
regimes. It is known from previous work that universal power laws appear in
such quantities as the mean number of excitations created by the sweep. Several
other phenomena are found that are not reflected by such averages: there are
two scaling regimes of the entanglement entropy and a relaxation that is
power-law rather than exponential. The final state of evolution after the
quench is not well characterized by any effective temperature, and the
Loschmidt echo converges algebraically to a constant for long times, with
cusplike singularities in the integrable case that are dynamically broadened by
nonintegrable perturbations.
