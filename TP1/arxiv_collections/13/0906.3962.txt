In this paper, we present several gravity tests made in using the last
INPOP08 planetary ephemerides. We first propose two methods to estimate the PPN
parameter $\beta$ and its correlated value, the Sun J2 and we discuss the
correlation between the Sun J2 and the mass of the asteroid ring. We estimate
possible advance in the planet perihelia. In the end we show that no constant
acceleration larger than 1/4 the Pioneer anomaly can affect the planets of our
solar system.
