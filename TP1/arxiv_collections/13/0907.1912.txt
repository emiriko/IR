These lectures are intended to provide a brief pedagogical review of dark
matter for the newcomer to the subject. We begin with a discussion of the
astrophysical evidence for dark matter. The standard weakly-interacting massive
particle (WIMP) scenario--the motivation, particle models, and detection
techniques--is then reviewed. We provide a brief sampling of some recent
variations to the standard WIMP scenario as well as some alternatives (axions
and sterile neutrinos). Exercises are provided for the reader.
