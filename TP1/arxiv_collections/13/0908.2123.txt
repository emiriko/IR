We integrate the MHD ideal equations of a slender flux tube to simulate the
internal plasma dynamics of coronal post-flare loops. We study the onset and
evolution of the internal plasma instability to compare with observations and
to gain insight into physical processes and characteristic parameters
associated with flaring events. The numerical approach uses a finite-volume
Harten-Yee TVD scheme to integrate the 1D1/2 MHD equations specially designed
to capture supersonic flow discontinuities. We could reproduce the
observational sliding down and upwardly propagating of brightening features
along magnetic threads of an event occurred on October 1st, 2001. We show that
high--speed downflow perturbations, usually interpreted as slow magnetoacoustic
waves, could be better interpreted as slow magnetoacoustic shock waves. This
result was obtained considering adiabaticity in the energy balance equation.
However, a time--dependent forcing from the basis is needed to reproduce the
reiteration of the event which resembles observational patterns -commonly known
as quasi--periodic pulsations (QPPs)- which are related with large scale
characteristic longitudes of coherence. This result reinforces the
interpretation that the QPPs are a response to the pulsational flaring
activity.
