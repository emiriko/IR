In this paper, a newer version of Walsh-Hadamard Transform namely
multiresolution Walsh-Hadamard Transform (MR-WHT) is proposed for images.
Further, a robust watermarking scheme is proposed for copyright protection
using MRWHT and singular value decomposition. The core idea of the proposed
scheme is to decompose an image using MR-WHT and then middle singular values of
high frequency sub-band at the coarsest and the finest level are modified with
the singular values of the watermark. Finally, a reliable watermark extraction
scheme is developed for the extraction of the watermark from the distorted
image. The experimental results show better visual imperceptibility and
resiliency of the proposed scheme against intentional or un-intentional variety
of attacks.
