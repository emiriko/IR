The MAGIC-I telescope is the largest single-dish Imaging Atmospheric
Cherenkov telescope in the world. A second telescope, MAGIC-II, will operate in
coincidence with MAGIC-I in stereoscopic mode. MAGIC-II is a clone of MAGIC-I,
but with a number of significant improvements, namely a highly pixelized camera
with a wider trigger area, improved optical analog signal transmission and a
2-4 GSps fast readout. All the technical elements of MAGIC-II were installed by
the end of 2008. The telescope is currently undergoing commissioning and
integration with MAGIC-I. An update of the technical performance of MAGIC-I, a
description of all the hardware elements of MAGIC-II and first results of the
combined technical performance of the two telescopes will be reported.
