In this survey paper we study the relationships between the coarse moduli
space which parameterizes the finite dimensional linear representations of an
associative alegebra, the non commutative hilbert scheme and the affine scheme
which is the spectrum of the abelianization of algebra of the divided powers.
In particular we will show a map which specialize to the Hlibert - Chow
morphism when the associative algebra is commutative. The extension to the
positive characteristic case of some of the results due to L. Le Bruyn on
noncommutative desingularization is outlined. The possibility to use our
construction to extend the work done by C.H.Liu and S.T.Yau on D-Branes to
their more recent work on non commutative case is underlined.
