The observation of $D^0 - \bar D^0$ oscillations has left us in a tantalizing
quandary concerning the theoretical interpretation: are they still compatible
with the SM or might they require new dynamics (NP)? A comprehensive search for
CP violation in $D$ decays should resolve the issue. Finding it should provide
compelling evidence for the intervention of New Physics. While the absolute
size of CP asymmetries will presumably be modest at best, the ratio of `signal'
to `noise' -- i.e. NP over SM contributions -- might well be larger for $D$
than $B$ transitions. A list of promising channels is provided, most of which
should be observable in a hadronic environment. Yet to saturate the discovery
potential for NP, we need a Superflavour Factory. Valuable lessons can be
obtained by analyzing three- and four-body final states.
