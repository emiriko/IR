Elastic light scattering has been extensively used to study samples showing a
non uniform refraction index on lengthscales from a fraction of a micrometer to
a fraction of a millimeter. Typically, a wide laser beam is sent through the
sample, and the light scattered at any angle is measured by a detector in the
far field. In this Ph. D. thesis, I describe three new techniques, which allow
to measure the scattering intensities, working in the near field: hOmoyne Near
Field Speckles (ONFS), hEterodyne Near Field Speckles (ENFS) and Schlieren-like
Near Field Speckles (SNFS). Basically, the experimental setup consists in a
wide laser beam passing through the sample; a lens forms an image of a plane at
a given distance from the cell on a CCD sensor. The image, in the near field,
shows speckles, since it is formed by the stochastical interference of the
light coming from a random sample. I show that, under suitable conditions, the
correlation function of such a field closely mirrors the correlation function
of the investigated sample; moreover, in general, from the correlation function
of the speckle field it is possible to calculate the scattered intensity. I
present for the first time a mathematical derivation of the working formulas
for the three techniques, and experimental results.
