We performed elastic neutron scattering and magnetization measurements on
Fe(1.07)Te(0.75)Se(0.25) and FeTe(0.7)Se(0.3). Short-range incommensurate
magnetic order is observed in both samples. In the former sample with higher Fe
content, a broad magnetic peak appears around (0.46,0,0.5) at low temperature,
while in FeTe(0.7)Se(0.3) the broad magnetic peak is found to be closer to the
antiferromagnetic (AFM) wave-vector (0.5,0,0.5). The incommensurate peaks are
only observed on one side of the AFM wave-vector for both samples, which can be
modeled in terms of an imbalance of ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic
correlations between nearest-neighbor spins. We also find that with higher Se
(and lower Fe) concentration, the magnetic order becomes weaker while the
superconducting temperature and volume increase.
