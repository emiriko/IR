Relations between bulk mass parameters for fermions propagating in higher
dimensions are studied in analogy with the empirical mass relation for charged
leptons. Masses of three generation of four-dimensional charged leptons are
achieved from the bulk mass parameters of the same-order values. We find that
the observed pattern of charged lepton mass spectrum is accommodated
approximately in a set of simple relations for bulk and physical masses.
