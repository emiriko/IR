There continues to be widespread interest in 1/f^(alpha) behavior in baseline
power spectral densities (PSD's) but its origins remain controversial.
Zwanzig-Mori projection operators provide a rigorous, common starting place for
building a theory of PSD's from the bottom up. In this approach, one separates
out explicit "system" degrees of freedom (which are experimentally monitored)
from all other implicit or "bath" degrees of freedom, and then one "projects"
or integrates out all the implicit degrees of freedom. The result is the
generalized Langevin equation. Within this formalism, the system PSD has a
simple relation to the bath PSD. We explore how several models of the bath PSD
affect the system PSD. We suggest that analyzing the baseline can yield
valuable information on the bath. The Debye model of acoustic bath oscillations
in particular gives rise to a low frequency 1/f divergence. Other power law
behaviors are possible with other models. None of these models require
self-organized criticality.
