Both observations and simulations show that major tidal interactions or
mergers between gas-rich galaxies can lead to intense bursts of starformation.
Yet, the average enhancement in star formation rate (SFR) in major mergers and
the contribution of such events to the cosmic SFR are not well estimated. Here
we use photometric redshifts, stellar masses and UV SFRs from COMBO-17, 24
micron SFRs from Spitzer and morphologies from two deep HST cosmological survey
fields (ECDFS/GEMS and A901/STAGES) to study the enhancement in SFR as a
function of projected galaxy separation. We apply two-point projected
correlation function techniques, which we augment with morphologically-selected
very close pairs (separation <2 arcsec) and merger remnants from the HST
imaging. Our analysis confirms that the most intensely star-forming systems are
indeed interacting or merging. Yet, for massive (M* > 10^10 Msun) star-forming
galaxies at 0.4<z<0.8, we find that the SFRs of galaxies undergoing a major
interaction (mass ratios <1:4 and separations < 40 kpc) are only 1.80 +/- 0.30
times higher than the SFRs of non-interacting galaxies when averaged over all
interactions and all stages of the interaction, in good agreement with other
observational works.
  We demonstrate that these results imply that <10% of star formation at 0.4 <
z < 0.8 is triggered directly by major mergers and interactions; these events
are not important factors in the build-up of stellar mass since z=1.
