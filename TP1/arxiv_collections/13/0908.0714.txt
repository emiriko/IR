X-ray binaries stand as the brightest X-ray sources in the galaxy, showing
both variable X-ray emission and extreme flares. Some of these systems have
been recently discovered to be TeV gamma-ray emitters, with the high energy
emission posited as resulting from particle acceleration in relativistic jets
or from shocks between pulsar and stellar winds. VERITAS, an array of four 12m
imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes has accrued more than 100 hours of
observation time on X-ray binaries. Here we present the results of observations
on 3A 1954+319, XTE J2012+381, 1A 0620-00, EXO 2030+375, KS 1947+300, SS 433,
Cygnus X-1 and Cygnus X-3.
