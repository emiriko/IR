We report on a theoretical study of the effects of time-dependent fields on
electronic transport through graphene nanoribbon devices. The Fabry-P\'{e}rot
interference pattern is modified by an ac gating in a way that depends strongly
on the shape of the graphene edges. While for armchair edges the patterns are
found to be regular and can be controlled very efficiently by tuning the ac
field, samples with zigzag edges exhibit a much more complex interference
pattern due to their peculiar electronic structure. These studies highlight the
main role played by geometric details of graphene nanoribbons within the
coherent transport regime. We also extend our analysis to noise power response,
identifying under which conditions it is possible to minimize the current
fluctuations as well as exploring scaling properties of noise with length and
width of the systems.
