We propose a method to investigate modular structure in networks based on
fitted probabilistic model, where the connection probability between nodes is
related to a set of introduced local attributes. The attributes, as parameters
of the empirical model, can be estimated by maximizing the likelihood function
of the observed network. We demonstrate that the distribution of attributes
provides an informative visulization of modular networks on low-dimensional
space, and suggest the attribute space can be served as a better platform for
further network analysis.
