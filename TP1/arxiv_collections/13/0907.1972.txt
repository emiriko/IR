We investigate the modifications of mesonic properties in a hot medium having
in mind to use the mesonic modes as a tool to analyze the restoration of chiral
and axial symmetries in the context of the SU(3) Polyakov--Nambu--Jona-Lasinio
(PNJL) model. The results lead to the conclusion that the effects of the
Polyakov loop are fundamental for reproducing lattice findings. It is found
that the restoration of chiral symmetry in the PNJL model occurs in a small
range of temperature (smaller that in the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL)), and the
topological susceptibility reproduces well the lattice results around
$T/T_c^\chi\approx 1.0$.
