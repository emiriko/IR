We theoretically investigate a polarized dipolar Fermi gas in free expansion.
The inter-particle dipolar interaction deforms phase-space distribution in trap
and also in the expansion. We exactly predict the minimal quadrupole
deformation in the expansion for the high-temperature Maxwell-Boltzmann and
zero-temperature Thomas-Fermi gases in the Hartree-Fock and Landau-Vlasov
approaches. In conclusion, we provide a proper approach to develop the
time-of-flight method for the weakly-interacting dipolar Fermi gas and also
reveal a scaling law associated with the Liouville's theorem in the long-time
behaviors of the both gases.
