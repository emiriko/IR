We consider the transverse-momentum distribution of colourless high-mass
systems (lepton pairs, vector bosons, Higgs particles...) produced in hadronic
collisions. We briefly review a formalism for the all-order resummation of the
logarithmically-enhanced contributions at small transverse momenta, and we
present an illustrative selection of numerical results obtained by using our
method.
