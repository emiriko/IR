The thermodynamic driving force in the self-assembly of the secondary
structure of a class of donor-acceptor oligorotaxanes is elucidated by means of
molecular dynamics simulations of equilibrium isometric single-molecule force
spectroscopy AFM experiments. The oligorotaxanes consist of
cyclobis(paraquat-\emph{p}-phenylene) rings threaded onto an oligomer of
1,5-dioxynaphthalenes linked by polyethers. The simulations are performed in a
high dielectric medium using MM3 as the force field. The resulting force vs.
extension isotherms show a mechanically unstable region in which the molecule
unfolds and, for selected extensions, blinks in the force measurements between
a high-force and a low-force regime. From the force vs. extension data the
molecular potential of mean force is reconstructed using the weighted histogram
analysis method and decomposed into energetic and entropic contributions. The
simulations indicate that the folding of the oligorotaxanes is energetically
favored but entropically penalized, with the energetic contributions overcoming
the entropy penalty and effectively driving the self-assembly. In addition, an
analogy between the single-molecule folding/unfolding events driven by the AFM
tip and the thermodynamic theory of first-order phase transitions is discussed
and general conditions, on the molecule and the cantilever, for the emergence
of mechanical instabilities and blinks in the force measurements in equilibrium
isometric pulling experiments are presented. In particular, it is shown that
the mechanical stability properties observed during the extension are
intimately related to the fluctuations in the force measurements.
