Crystals are the elementary constituents of Laue lenses, an emerging
technology which could allow the realization of a space borne telescope 10 to
100 times more sensitive than existing ones in the 100 keV - 1.5 MeV energy
range. This study addresses the current endeavor to the development of
efficient crystals for the realization of a Laue lens.
  In the theoretical part 35 candidate-crystals both pure and two-components
are considered. Their peak reflectivity at 100 keV, 500 keV and 1 MeV is
calculated assuming they are mosaic crystals. It results that a careful
selection of crystals can allow a reflectivity above 30% over the whole energy
range, and even reaching 40% in its lower part. Experimentally, we concentrated
on three different materials (Si_{1-x}Ge_x with gradient of composition, mosaic
Cu and Au) that have been measured both at ESRF and ILL using
highly-monochromatic beams ranging from 300 keV up to 816 keV. The aim was to
check their homogeneity, quality and angular spread (mosaicity). These crystals
have shown outstanding performance such as reflectivity up to 31% at ~600 keV
(Au) or 60% at 300 keV (SiGe) and angular spread as low as 15 arcsec for Cu,
fulfilling very well the requirements for a Laue lens application.
Unexpectedly, we also noticed important discrepancies with Darwin's model when
a crystal is measured using various energies.
