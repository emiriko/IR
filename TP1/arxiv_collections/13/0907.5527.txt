This thesis is concerned with investigations into the "complexity of term
rewriting systems". Moreover the majority of the presented work deals with the
"automation" of such a complexity analysis. The aim of this introduction is to
present the main ideas in an easily accessible fashion to make the result
presented accessible to the general public. Necessarily some technical points
are stated in an over-simplified way.
