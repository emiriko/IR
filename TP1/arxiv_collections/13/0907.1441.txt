Aims. We present first results and tests of a time-dependent extension to the
general purpose model atmosphere code PHOENIX. We aim to produce light curves
and spectra of hydro models for all types of supernovae. Methods. We extend our
model atmosphere code PHOENIX to solve time-dependent non-grey, NLTE, radiative
transfer in a special relativistic framework. A simple hydrodynamics solver was
implemented to keep track of the energy conservation of the atmosphere during
free expansion. Results. The correct operation of the new additions to PHOENIX
were verified in test calculations. Conclusions. We have shown the correct
operation of our extension to time-dependent radiative transfer and will be
able to calculate supernova light curves and spectra in future work.
