This is the first volume of Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer
Science (EPTCS), a free international refereed open access venue for the rapid
electronic publication of the proceedings of workshops and conferences, and of
festschriften, etc, in the general area of theoretical computer science,
broadly construed.
  It contains the proceedings of the International Workshop on The Complexity
of Simple Programs, which was hosted at University College Cork on the 6th and
7th of December, 2008. All speakers were invited and all of the papers went
through a thorough peer-review process.
