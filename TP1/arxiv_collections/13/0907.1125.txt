We have studied transport and magnetic properties of Bi_{1-x}Sb_x, which is
believed to be a topological insulator - a new state of matter where an
insulating bulk supports an intrinsically metallic surface. In nominally
insulating Bi_{0.91}Sb_{0.09} crystals, we observed strong quantum oscillations
of the magnetization and the resistivity originating from a Fermi surface which
has a clear two-dimensional character. In addition, a three-dimensional Fermi
surface is found to coexist, which is possibly due to an unusual coupling of
the bulk to the surface. This finding demonstrates that quantum oscillations
can be a powerful tool to directly probe the novel electronic states in
topological insulators.
