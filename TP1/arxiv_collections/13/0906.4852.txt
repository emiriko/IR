We consider chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) with a non-zero theta term. Due
to the CP violating term, the vacuum of chiral fields is shifted to a
non-trivial element on the SU(N_f) group manifold. The CP violation also
provides mixing of different CP eigenstates, between scalar and pseudoscalar,
or vector and axialvector operators. We investigate upto O(theta^2) effects on
the mesonic two point correlators of ChPT to the one-loop order. We also
address the effects of fixing topology, by using saddle point integration in
the Fourier transform with respect to theta.
