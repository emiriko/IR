We point out that the internal spin symmetry of the order parameter manifests
itself at the core of a fractional vortex in real space without spin-orbit
coupling. Such symmetry breaking arises from a topological constraint and the
commensurability between spin symmetries of the order parameters inside and
outside the core. Our prediction can be applied to probe the cyclic order
parameter in a rotating spin-2 $^{87}$Rb condensate as a non-circular vortex
core in a biaxial nematic state.
