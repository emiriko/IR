In his 1971's Dynamic Models of Segregation paper, the economist Thomas C.
Schelling showed that a small preference for one's neighbors to be of the same
color could lead to total segregation, even if total segregation does not
correspond to individual preferences and to a residential configuration
maximizing the collective utility.
  The present work is aimed at deepening the understanding of the properties of
dynamic models of segregation based on Schelling's hypotheses. Its main
contributions are (i) to offer a comprehensive and up-to-date review of this
family of models; (ii) to provide an analytical solution to the most general
form of this model under rather general assumptions; to the best of our
knowledge, such a solution did not exist so far; (iii) to analyse the effect of
two devices aimed at decreasing segregation in such a model.
