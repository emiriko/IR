We calculate the reaction and the fusion cross-sections of neutron-rich heavy
nuclei taking light exotic isotopes as projectiles. Results of neutron-rich Pb
and U isotopes are demonstrated as the representative targets and He, B as the
projectiles. The Gluaber Model and the Coupled Channel Formalism are used to
evaluate the reaction and the fusion cross-sections for the cases
considered.Based on the analysis of these cross-sections, we predict the
formation of heavy, superheavy and super-superheavy elements through rapid
neutron/light nuclei capture r-process of the nucleosynthesis in astrophysical
objects.
