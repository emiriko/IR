The present paper is a continuation of a foregoing paper [Tensor, N. S., 69
(2008), 155-178]. The main aim is to establish \emph{an intrinsic
investigation} of the conformal change of the most important special Finsler
spaces, namely, $C^{h}$-recurrent, $C^{v}$-recurrent, $C^{0}$-recurrent,
$C_{2}$-like, quasi-$C$-reducible, $C$-reducible, Berwald space,
$S^{v}$-recurrent, $P^*$-Finsler manifold, $R_{3}$-like, $P$-symmetric, Finsler
manifold of $p$-scalar curvature and Finsler manifold of $s$-$ps$-curvature.
Necessary and sufficient conditions for such special Finsler manifolds to be
invariant under a conformal change are obtained. Moreover, the conformal change
of Chern and Hashiguchi connections, as well as their curvature tensors, are
given.
