[abridged] We present observations of NGC524 and NGC2549 with LGS AO obtained
at GEMINI North telescope using the NIFS IFU in the K band. The purpose of
these observations, together with previously obtained observations with the
SAURON IFU, is to determine the masses (Mbh) of the supermassive black holes
(SMBH). The targeted galaxies were chosen to have central light profiles
showing a core (NGC524) and a cusp (NGC2549), to probe the feasibility of using
the galaxy centre as the NGS required for LGS AO. We employ an innovative `open
loop' technique. The data have spatial resolution of 0.23" and 0.17" FWHM,
showing that high quality LGS AO observations of these objects are possible. We
construct axisymmetric three-integral dynamical models which are constrained
with both the NIFS and SAURON data. The best fitting models yield Mbh=(8.3 +2.7
-1.3) x 10^8 Msun for NGC524 and Mbh=(1.4 +0.2 -1.3) x 10^7 Msun for NGC2549
(all errors are at the 3 sigma CL). We demonstrate that the wide-field SAURON
data play a crucial role in the M/L determination increasing the accuracy of
M/L by a factor of at least 5, and constraining the upper limits on Mbh. The
NIFS data are crucial in constraining the lower limits of Mbh and in
combination with the large scale data reducing the uncertainty by a factor of 2
or more. We find that the orbital structure of NGC524 shows significant
tangential anisotropy, while at larger radii both galaxies are consistent with
having almost perfectly oblate velocity ellipsoids. Tangential anisotropy in
NGC524 coincides with the size of SMBH sphere of influence and the core region
in the light profile. We test the accuracy to which Mbh can be measured using
seeings obtained from typical LGS AO observations, and conclude that for a
typical conditions and Mbh the expected uncertainty is of the order of 50%.
