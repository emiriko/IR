The standard model is a successful but limited theory. There is significant
theoretical motivation to believe that new physics may appear at the energy
scale of a few TeV, the lower end of which is currently probed by the Fermilab
Tevatron Collider. The methods used to search for physics beyond the standard
model in a model independent way and the results of these searches based on 1.0
fb-1 of data collected with the D0 detector and 2.0 fb^-1 at the CDF detector
are presented.
