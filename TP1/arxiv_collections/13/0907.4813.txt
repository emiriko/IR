Heavy quarks are a valuable probe of the hot, dense medium created in a heavy
ion collision, and are an important test of proposed mechanisms of energy loss.
It was discovered that single non-photonic electrons are suppressed at a
similar level to light hadrons, implying a comparable level of energy loss
between light and heavy partons. Because theory has had a difficult time
explaining the level of heavy quark energy loss, it is crucial to better
understand charm and bottom suppression. Electron-hadron correlations have been
used at PHENIX to study heavy flavor in both p+p and Au+Au collisions. In p+p
the ratio of charm to bottom production has been measured using mass
correlations through a partial reconstruction of the D meson. Electron-hadron
angular correlations have also been used to study medium modification of heavy
flavor, and we see hints of energy loss effects. A complementary study of
correlated electron-muon pairs provides a clean measurement of heavy flavor
production in a rapidity range not yet studied.
