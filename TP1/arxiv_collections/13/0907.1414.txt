The notion of Non-Locality (NL) in physics has great epistemological
implications and impact on the perceptive of Reality. Numerous counter
intuitive experimental results that clearly violate Bell's inequality have
prompted several physicists to believe in 'mysterious' non-local correlations
particularly in quantum systems of EPR type. Not commenting much on whether NL
is true or not, our contention is that NL, in general, leads to the concept of
holistic universe and further to a global concept of
'Consciousness-Centered-Cosmos' (CCC) as almost inevitable rational outcome.
These suggestions though ostensibly unorthodox, are rather within rational and
legitimate frame work of science. Our reasoning is quite distinct from the
erstwhile doctrine of the role of consciousness in the measurement problem and
state vector reduction although the latter may add further credence to the our
contention. We address particularly the implications NL and discuss certain
related aspects of new quantum world view in general. The less recognized
association of the principles of uncertainty with locality, causality, the
arrow of time and reality are brought out. Perhaps these underpinnings are much
less appreciated than necessary.
