The animals, in particular insects (Drosophila melanogaster), response
towards odor stimuli in nature can be established by measuring the dynamic of
the odor response. Such an approach is innovative since responses to odors were
tested only at certain time point so far, not in hour intervals for several
hours. The odor attraction to 14 natural and ecologically relevant odor stimuli
such as fruits- ripe and rotten, yeast and vinegar was tested. A mathematical
model to evaluate obtained data is proposed in this study in which the number
of flies caught over several time points is presented as one simple parameter
showing trapping potential of the trap housing particular odor stimuli. The
knowledge concerning dynamic of the odor response in Drosophila melanogaster
may enlighten the principles of flies behavior in context of exposure towards
odor stimulus.
