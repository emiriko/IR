Dynamics of entanglement due to intensity-dependent interaction between a
two-level atom and a single-mode electromagnetic field in a Kerr medium is
studied. The form of the interaction is such that the Hamiltonian evolution is
exactly solvable. The Hamiltonian is shown to be a deformed Jaynes-Cummings
model admitting a closed, symmetric algebra. Dynamics of population inversion
and atom-field entanglement are studied taking the initial state of the field
to be either a coherent state or a squeezed vacuum. Analysis is extended to the
case of a two-mode cavity field interacting with a two-level atom. For the
two-mode case, the initial field is a pair coherent state or a two-mode
squeezed vacuum. Effects due to nonlinearity, intensity-dependent interaction
and detuning on the dynamics are discussed and compared with those of the
single-mode case.
