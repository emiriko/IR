The solution of the geodesic problem for an oblate ellipsoid is developed in
terms of series. Tables are provided to simplify the computation. [This is a
transcription of F. W. Bessel, Astronomische Nachrichten 4(86), 241-254 (1825).
The text follows the original; however the mathematical notation has been
updated to conform to current conventions. Several errors have been corrected
and the tables have been recomputed.]
