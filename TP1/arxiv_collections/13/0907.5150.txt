Context: CoRoT is a pioneering space mission devoted to the analysis of
stellar variability and the photometric detection of extrasolar planets.
  Aims: We present the list of planetary transit candidates detected in the
first field observed by CoRoT, IRa01, the initial run toward the Galactic
anticenter, which lasted for 60 days.
  Methods: We analysed 3898 sources in the coloured bands and 5974 in the
monochromatic band. Instrumental noise and stellar variability were taken into
account using detrending tools before applying various transit search
algorithms.
  Results: Fifty sources were classified as planetary transit candidates and
the most reliable 40 detections were declared targets for follow-up
ground-based observations. Two of these targets have so far been confirmed as
planets, COROT-1b and COROT-4b, for which a complete characterization and
specific studies were performed.
