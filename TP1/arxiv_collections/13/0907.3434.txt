In this work we consider the phase transition from ordered to disordered
states that occur in the Vicsek model of self-propelled particles. This model
was proposed to describe the emergence of collective order in swarming systems.
When noise is added to the motion of the particles, the onset of collective
order occurs through a dynamical phase transition. Based on their numerical
results, Vicsek and his colleagues originally concluded that this phase
transition was of second order (continuous). However, recent numerical evidence
seems to indicate that the phase transition might be of first order
(discontinuous), thus challenging Vicsek's original results. In this work we
review the evidence supporting both aspects of this debate. We also show new
numerical results indicating that the apparent discontinuity of the phase
transition may in fact be a numerical artifact produced by the artificial
periodicity of the boundary conditions.
