We present a reanalysis of nonstandard neutrino-down-quark interactions of
electron and tau neutrinos using solar, reactor and accelerator data. In
addition updating the analysis by including new solar data from SNO phase III
and Borexino, as well as new KamLAND data and solar fluxes, a key role is
played in our analysis by the combination of these results with the CHARM data.
The latter allows us to better constrain the axial and axial-vector electron
and tau-neutrino nonstandard interaction parameters characterizing the
deviations from the Standard Model predictions.
