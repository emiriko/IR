The author's work over the past years has indicated that the photon has a
small mass $\sim 10^{-33}eV$. Recent observations from three different
viewpoints -- the time lag in cosmic gamma rays with different frequencies, the
observation of the spectra of blazars and an analysis of the CMB power
supression from the WMAP data -- all vindicate this conclusion and remarkably,
the same value.
