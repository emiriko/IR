Studies of heavy-ion collisions at the LHC will benefit from an array of
qualitatively new probes not readily available at lower collision energies.
These include fully formed jets at ET > 50 GeV, Z0's and abundantly produced
heavy flavors. For Pb+Pb running at LHC design luminosity, the collision rate
in the CMS interaction region will exceed the available bandwidth to store data
by several orders of magnitude. Therefore an efficient trigger strategy is
needed to select the few percent of the incoming events containing the most
interesting signatures. In this report, we will present the heavy-ion trigger
strategy developed for the unique two-layer trigger system of the CMS
experiment which consists of a ``Level-1'' trigger based on custom electronics
and a High Level Trigger (HLT) implemented using a large cluster of commodity
computers.
