We present the results of a next-to-leading order calculation of QCD
corrections to the production of an on-shell top-anti-top quark pair in
association with two flavored b-jets. Besides studying the total cross section
and its scale dependence, we give several differential distributions. Where
comparable, our results agree with a previous analysis. While the process under
scrutiny is of major relevance for Higgs boson searches at the LHC, we use it
to demonstrate the ability of our system built around Helac-Phegas to tackle
complete calculations at the frontier of current studies for the LHC. On the
technical side, we show how the virtual corrections are efficiently computed
with Helac-1Loop, based on the OPP method and the reduction code CutTools,
using reweighting and Monte Carlo over color configurations and polarizations.
As far as the real corrections are concerned, we use the recently published
Helac-Dipoles package. In connection with improvements of the latter, we give
the last missing integrated dipole formulae necessary for a complete
implementation of phase space restriction dependence in the massive dipole
subtraction formalism.
