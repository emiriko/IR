Cloning of statistics of general quantum measurement is discussed. The
presented approach is connected with the known concept of observable cloning,
but differs in some essential respects. The reasons are illustrated within some
variety of B92 protocol. As it is shown, there exist pairs of states such that
the perfect cloning of given POVM is not possible. We discuss some properties
of these intolerant sets. An example allowing the perfect cloning is presented
as well.
