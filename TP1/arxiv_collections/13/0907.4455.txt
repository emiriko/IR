A dilute suspension of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in a nematic liquid crystal
(LC) does not disturb the LC director. Due to a strong LC-CNT anchoring energy
and structural symmetry matching, CNT long axis follows the director field,
possessing enhanced dielectric anisotropy. This strong anchoring energy
stabilizes local pseudo-nematic domains, resulting in non-zero dielectric
anisotropy in the isotropic phase. These anisotropic domains respond to
external electric fields and show intrinsic frequency response. The presence of
these domains makes the isotropic phase field-responsive, giving rise to a
large dielectric hysteresis effect.
