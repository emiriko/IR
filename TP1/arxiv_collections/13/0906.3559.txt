We study exact solutions of three-dimensional gravity with a cosmological
constant and a gravitational Chern-Simons term: the theory known as
topologically massive gravity. After reviewing the algebraic classification, we
show that if a solution has curvature of algebraic type D, then it is biaxially
squashed AdS_3. Applying the classification, we provide a comprehensive review
of the literature, showing that most known solutions are locally equivalent to
biaxially squashed AdS_3 or to AdS pp-waves.
