We study the role of the attractive intermolecular forces in the viscous
regime of a simple glass-forming liquid by using computer simulations. To this
end, we compare the structure and the dynamics of a standard Lennard-Jones
glass-forming liquid model with and without the attractive tail of the
interaction potentials. The viscous slowing down of the two systems are found
to be quantitatively and qualitatively different over a broad density range,
whereas the static pair correlations remain close. The common assumption that
the behaviour of dense nonassociated liquids is determined by the short-ranged
repulsive part of the intermolecular potentials dramatically breaks down for
the relaxation in the viscous liquid regime.
