We draw attention on a particular configuration of supersymmetric particle
masses, motivated by naturalness and flavour considerations. All its relevant
phenomenological properties for the LHC are described in terms of a few
physical parameters, irrespective of the underlying theoretical model. This
allows a simple characterization of its main features, useful to define a
strategy for its discovery.
