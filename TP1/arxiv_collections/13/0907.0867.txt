We analyze confining mechanisms for L\'evy flights evolving under an
influence of external potentials. Given a stationary probability density
function (pdf), we address the reverse engineering problem: design a jump-type
stochastic process whose target pdf (eventually asymptotic) equals the
preselected one. To this end, dynamically distinct jump-type processes can be
employed. We demonstrate that one "targeted stochasticity" scenario involves
Langevin systems with a symmetric stable noise. Another derives from the
L\'evy-Schr\"odinger semigroup dynamics (closely linked with topologically
induced super-diffusions), which has no standard Langevin representation. For
computational and visualization purposes, the Cauchy driver is employed to
exemplify our considerations.
