The problem of metastability for a stochastic dynamics with a parallel
updating rule is addressed in the Freidlin--Wentzel regime, namely, finite
volume, small magnetic field, and small temperature. The model is characterized
by the existence of many fixed points and cyclic pairs of the zero temperature
dynamics, in which the system can be trapped in its way to the stable phase.
%The characterization of the metastable behavior %of a system in the context of
parallel dynamics is a very difficult task, %since all the jumps in the
configuration space are allowed. Our strategy is based on recent powerful
approaches, not needing a complete description of the fixed points of the
dynamics, but relying on few model dependent results. We compute the exit time,
in the sense of logarithmic equivalence, and characterize the critical droplet
that is necessarily visited by the system during its excursion from the
metastable to the stable state. We need to supply two model dependent inputs:
(1) the communication energy, that is the minimal energy barrier that the
system must overcome to reach the stable state starting from the metastable
one; (2) a recurrence property stating that for any configuration different
from the metastable state there exists a path, starting from such a
configuration and reaching a lower energy state, such that its maximal energy
is lower than the communication energy.
