We have observed dwarf nova oscillations (DNOs) in OY Car during outburst,
down through decline and beyond; its behaviour is similar to what we have
previously seen in VW Hyi, making it only the second dwarf nova to have DNOs
late in outburst that continue well into quiescence. There are also occasional
examples of DNOs in deep quiescence, well away from outburst - they have
properties similar to those during outburst, indicating similar physical causes
and structures. We discuss the occurrence of DNOs in other dwarf novae and
conclude that DNOs during quiescence are more common than often supposed and
exhibit properties similar to those seen in outburst.
