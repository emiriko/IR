We report the first NMR investigation of spin dynamics in the overdoped
non-superconducting regime of Ba(Fe[1-x]Co[x])2As2 up to x =0.26. We
demonstrate that the absence of inter-band transitions with large momentum
transfer Q(AF) ~ (pi, 0) between the hole and electron Fermi surfaces results
in complete suppression of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations for x > 0.15.
Our experimental results provide direct evidence for a correlation between Tc
and the strength of Q(AF) antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations.
