We theoretically studied the effect of the perpendicular electric field on
the thermoelectric properties of the intrinsic, n-type and p-type bismuth
telluride nanowires with the growth direction [110]. The electronic structure
and the wave functions were calculated by solving self-consistently the system
of the Schrodinger and Poisson equations using the spectral method. The Poisson
equation was solved in terms of the Newton - Raphson method within the
predictor-corrector approach. The electron - electron exchange - correlation
interactions were taken into account in our analysis. In the temperature range
from 77 to 500 K, the dependences of the Seebeck coefficient, thermal
conductivity, electron (hole) concentration, and thermoelectric figure of merit
on the nanowire thickness, gate voltage, and excess hole (electron)
concentration were investigated in the constant relaxation-time approximation.
The results of our calculations indicate that the external perpendicular
electric field can increase the Seebeck coefficient of the bismuth telluride
nanowires with thicknesses of 7 - 15 nm by nearly a factor of 2 and enhance ZT
by an order of magnitude. At room temperature, ZT can reach a value as high as
3.4 under the action of the external perpendicular electric field for realistic
widths of the nanowires. The obtain results may open up a completely new way
for a drastic enhancement of the thermoelectric figure of merit in a wide
temperature range.
