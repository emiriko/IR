We have studied positive-parity states of $^{28}$Si using antisymmetrized
molecular dynamics (AMD) and multi-configuration mixing (MCM) with constrained
variation.
  Applying constraints to the cluster distance and the quadrupole deformation
of the variational calculation, we have obtained basis wave functions that have
various structures such as $\alpha$-$^{24}$Mg and $^{12}$C-$^{16}$O cluster
structures as well as deformed structures.
  Superposing those basis wave functions, we have obtained a oblate ground
state band, a $\beta$ vibration band, a normal-deformed prolate band, and a
superdeformed band. It is found that the normal-deformed and superdeformed
bands contain large amounts of the $^{12}$C-$^{16}$O and $\alpha$-$^{24}$Mg
cluster components, respectively. The results also suggest the presence of two
excited bands with the developed $\alpha$-$^{24}$Mg cluster structure, where
the inter-cluster motion and the $^{24}$Mg-cluster deformation play important
roles.
