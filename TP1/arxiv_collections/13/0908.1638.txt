We calculate the $W^\pm\gamma j + X$-production cross sections at
next-to-leading order QCD for Tevatron and LHC collisions. We include leptonic
decays of the $W$ to light leptons, with all off-shell effects taken into
account. The corrections are sizable and have significant impact on the
differential distributions.
