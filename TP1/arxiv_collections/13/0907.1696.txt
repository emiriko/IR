A detailed study of the criteria for stability of the scalar potential and
the proper electroweak symmetry breaking pattern in the economical 3-3-1 model,
is presented. For the analysis we use, and improve, a method previously
developed to study the scalar potential in the two-Higgs-doublet extension of
the standard model. A new theorem related to the stability of the potential is
stated. As a consequence of this study, the consistency of the economical 3-3-1
model emerges.
