We report the discovery of very shallow (DF/F = 3.4 10-4), periodic dips in
the light curve of an active V = 11.7 G9V star observed by the CoRoT satellite,
which we interpret as due to the presence of a transiting companion. We
describe the 3-colour CoRoT data and complementary ground-based observations
that support the planetary nature of the companion. Methods. We use CoRoT color
information, good angular resolution ground-based photometric observations in-
and out- of transit, adaptive optics imaging, near-infrared spectroscopy and
preliminary results from Radial Velocity measurements, to test the diluted
eclipsing binary scenarios. The parameters of the host star are derived from
optical spectra, which were then combined with the CoRoT light curve to derive
parameters of the companion. We examine carefully all conceivable cases of
false positives, and all tests performed support the planetary hypothesis.
Blends with separation larger than 0.40 arcsec or triple systems are almost
excluded with a 8 10-4 risk left. We conclude that, as far as we have been
exhaustive, we have discovered a planetary companion, named CoRoT-7b, for which
we derive a period of 0.853 59 +/- 3 10-5 day and a radius of Rp = 1.68 +/-
0.09 REarth. Analysis of preliminary radial velocity data yields an upper limit
of 21 MEarth for the companion mass, supporting the finding.
  CoRoT-7b is very likely the first Super-Earth with a measured radius.
