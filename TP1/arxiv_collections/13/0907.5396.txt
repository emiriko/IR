Tunneling measurements on 2D electron gases at high magnetic field reveal a
qualitative difference between the two spin sublevels of the lowest Landau
level. While the tunneling current-voltage characteristic at filling factor
$\nu = 1/2$ is a single peak shifted from zero bias by a Coulomb pseudogap, the
spectrum at $\nu=3/2$ shows a well-resolved double peak structure. This
difference is present regardless of whether $\nu =1/2$ and $\nu = 3/2$ occur at
the same or different magnetic fields. No analogous effect is seen at $\nu =
5/2$ and 7/2 in the first excited Landau level.
