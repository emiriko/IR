This dissertation presents theoretical investigations of universality and
finite-range corrections in few- and many-boson systems. The main focus is on
ultra-cold atomic gases seen both from the three-body, many-body, and
mean-field perspective. Topics include corrections to Efimov physics, the
N-body Efimov effect, two-body correlations in condensates and higher-order
interactions in mean-field BECs.
