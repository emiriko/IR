Although researchers often comment on the rising popularity of
nature-inspired meta-heuristics (NIM), there has been a paucity of data to
directly support the claim that NIM are growing in prominence compared to other
optimization techniques. This study presents evidence that the use of NIM is
not only growing, but indeed appears to have surpassed mathematical
optimization techniques (MOT) in several important metrics related to academic
research activity (publication frequency) and commercial activity (patenting
frequency). Motivated by these findings, this article discusses some of the
possible origins of this growing popularity. I review different explanations
for NIM popularity and discuss why some of these arguments remain unsatisfying.
I argue that a compelling and comprehensive explanation should directly account
for the manner in which most NIM success has actually been achieved, e.g.
through hybridization and customization to different problem environments. By
taking a problem lifecycle perspective, this paper offers a fresh look at the
hypothesis that nature-inspired meta-heuristics derive much of their utility
from being flexible. I discuss global trends within the business environments
where optimization algorithms are applied and I speculate that highly flexible
algorithm frameworks could become increasingly popular within our diverse and
rapidly changing world.
