The existence of light hidden sectors is an exciting possibility that may be
tested in the near future. If DM is allowed to decay into such a hidden sector
through GUT suppressed operators, it can accommodate the recent cosmic ray
observations without over-producing antiprotons or interfering with the
attractive features of the thermal WIMP. Models of this kind are simple to
construct, generic and evade all astrophysical bounds. We provide tools for
constructing such models and present several distinct examples. The light
hidden spectrum and DM couplings can be probed in the near future, by measuring
astrophysical photon and neutrino fluxes. These indirect signatures are
complimentary to the direct production signals, such as lepton jets, predicted
by these models.
