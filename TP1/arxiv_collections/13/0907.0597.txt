In this paper, we explore the interplay between network topology and time
criticality in a military logistics system. A general goal of this work (and
previous work) is to evaluate land transportation requirements or, more
specifically, how to design appropriate fleets of military general service
vehicles that are tasked with the supply and re-supply of military units
dispersed in an area of operation. The particular focus of this paper is to
gain a better understanding of how the logistics environment changes when
current Army vehicles with fixed transport characteristics are replaced by a
new generation of modularised vehicles that can be configured
task-specifically. The experimental work is conducted within a well developed
strategic planning simulation environment which includes a scenario generation
engine for automatically sampling supply and re-supply missions and a
multi-objective meta-heuristic search algorithm (i.e. Evolutionary Algorithm)
for solving the particular scheduling and routing problems. The results
presented in this paper allow for a better understanding of how (and under what
conditions) a modularised vehicle fleet can provide advantages over the
currently implemented system.
