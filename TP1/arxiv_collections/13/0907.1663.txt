We study a certain class of nonextremal D1D5 geometries and their ergoregion
emission. Using a detailed CFT computation and the formalism developed in
arXiv:0906.2015 [hep-th], we compute the full spectrum and rate of emission
from the geometries and find exact agreement with the gravity answer.
Previously, only part of the spectrum had been reproduced using a CFT
description. We close with a discussion of the context and significance of the
calculation.
