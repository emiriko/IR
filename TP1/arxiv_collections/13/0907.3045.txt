SIP-based networks are becoming the de-facto standard for voice, video and
instant messaging services. Being exposed to many threats while playing an
major role in the operation of essential services, the need for dedicated
security management approaches is rapidly increasing. In this paper we present
an original security management approach based on a specific vulnerability
aware SIP stateful firewall. Through known attack descriptions, we illustrate
the power of the configuration language of the firewall which uses the
capability to specify stateful objects that track data from multiple SIP
elements within their lifetime. We demonstrate through measurements on a real
implementation of the firewall its efficiency and performance.
