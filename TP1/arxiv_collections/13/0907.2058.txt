If the fundamental scale of gravity is of the order of 1 TeV, black holes
might be produced at the Large Hadron Collider. This work presents simulations
of black holes and other exotic models of physics beyond the Standard Model -
supersymmetry, extra dimensional models and string theory. Isolated leptons
with high transverse momenta can be used to distinguish black holes from
supersymmetry and models of extra dimensions. Z0 bosons and photons with high
transverse momenta allow the discrimination of black holes and string
resonances. The analysis of visible and missing energy/momenta and event shape
variables complement these techniques.
