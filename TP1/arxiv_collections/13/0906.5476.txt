Titan is one of the primary scientific objectives of the NASA ESA ASI Cassini
Huygens mission. Scattering by haze particles in Titan's atmosphere and
numerous methane absorptions dramatically veil Titan's surface in the visible
range, though it can be studied more easily in some narrow infrared windows.
The Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) instrument onboard the
Cassini spacecraft successfully imaged its surface in the atmospheric windows,
taking hyperspectral images in the range 0.4 5.2 ?m. On 26 October (TA flyby)
and 13 December 2004 (TB flyby), the Cassini Huygens mission flew over Titan at
an altitude lower than 1200 km at closest approach. We report here on the
analysis of VIMS images of the Huygens landing site acquired at TA and TB, with
a spatial resolution ranging from 16 to14.4 km/pixel. The pure atmospheric
backscattering component is corrected by using both an empirical method and a
first-order theoretical model. Both approaches provide consistent results.
After the removal of scattering, ratio images reveal subtle surface
heterogeneities. A particularly contrasted structure appears in ratio images
involving the 1.59 and 2.03 ?m images north of the Huygens landing site.
Although pure water ice cannot be the only component exposed at Titan's
surface, this area is consistent with a local enrichment in exposed water ice
and seems to be consistent with DISR/Huygens images and spectra
interpretations. The images show also a morphological structure that can be
interpreted as a 150 km diameter impact crater with a central peak.
