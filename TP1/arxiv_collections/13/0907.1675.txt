We present the systemic Console, a new all-in-one, general-purpose software
package for the analysis and combined multiparameter fitting of Doppler radial
velocity (RV) and transit timing observations. We give an overview of the
computational algorithms implemented in the Console, and describe the tools
offered for streamlining the characterization of planetary systems. We
illustrate the capabilities of the package by analyzing an updated radial
velocity data set for the HD128311 planetary system. HD128311 harbors a pair of
planets that appear to be participating in a 2:1 mean motion resonance. We show
that the dynamical configuration cannot be fully determined from the current
data. We find that if a planetary system like HD128311 is found to undergo
transits, then self-consistent Newtonian fits to combined radial velocity data
and a small number of timing measurements of transit midpoints can provide an
immediate and vastly improved characterization of the planet's dynamical state.
