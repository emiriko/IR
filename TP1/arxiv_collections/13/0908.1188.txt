Spreadsheet programmers often implement contingent logic using a nested-IF
formula even though this technique is difficult to test and audit and is
believed to be risky. We interpret the programming of contingent logic in
spreadsheets in the context of traditional computer programming. We investigate
the "lookup technique" as an alternative to nested-IF formulas, describe its
benefits for testing and auditing, and define its limitations. The lookup
technique employs four distinct principles: 1) make logical tests visible; 2)
make outcomes visible; 3) make logical structure visible; and 4) replace a
multi-function nested-IF formula with a single-function lookup formula. It can
be used only for certain simple contingent logic. We describe how the
principles can be applied in more complex situations, and suggest avenues for
further research.
