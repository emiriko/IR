We reanalyze the WA98 single photon data at CERN SPS by incorporating several
recent developments in the study of prompt and thermal photon production from
relativistic heavy ion collisions. Isospin and shadowing corrected NLO pQCD,
along with an optimized scale for factorization, fragmentation and
renormalization are considered for prompt photon production. Photons from
thermal medium are estimated by considering a boost invariant azimuthally
anisotropic hydrodynamic expansion of the plasma along with a well tested
equation of state and initial conditions. A quantitative explanation of the
data is obtained by combining $\kappa \times$ prompt with thermal photons,
where $\kappa$ is an overall scaling factor. We show that, elliptic flow of
thermal photons can play a crucial role to distinguish between the `with' and
`without' phase transition scenarios at SPS energy.
