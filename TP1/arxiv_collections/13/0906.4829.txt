We present an overview of a research program for the excited nucleon states
in Excited Baryon Analysis Center (EBAC) at Jefferson Lab. Current status of
our analysis of the meson production reactions based on the unitary dynamical
coupled-channels model is summarized, and the N* pole positions extracted from
the constructed scattering amplitudes are presented. Our plans for future
developments are also discussed.
