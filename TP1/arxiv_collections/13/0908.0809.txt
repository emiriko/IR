We use generating functional analysis to study minority-game type market
models with generalized strategy valuation updates that control the psychology
of agents' actions. The agents' choice between trend following and contrarian
trading, and their vigor in each, depends on the overall state of the market.
Even in `fake history' models, the theory now involves an effective overall bid
process (coupled to the effective agent process) which can exhibit profound
remanence effects and new phase transitions. For some models the bid process
can be solved directly, others require Maxwell-construction type
approximations.
