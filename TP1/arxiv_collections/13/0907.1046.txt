The flat-spectrum radio-quasar 3C279 (z=0.536) is the most distant object
detected at very high energy (VHE) gamma-rays. It is thus an important beacon
for the study of the interaction of the VHE gamma-rays with the Extra-galactic
Background Light (EBL). Previous observations by EGRET showed a highly variable
flux that can differ up to a factor of 100. In this paper results from an
observation campaign with the MAGIC telescope during an optical flare in
January 2007 will be presented and previous MAGIC results from 2006 will be
summarized.
