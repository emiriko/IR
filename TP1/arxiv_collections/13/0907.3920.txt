Suppose one has access to oracles generating samples from two unknown
probability distributions P and Q on some N-element set. How many samples does
one need to test whether the two distributions are close or far from each other
in the L_1-norm ? This and related questions have been extensively studied
during the last years in the field of property testing. In the present paper we
study quantum algorithms for testing properties of distributions. It is shown
that the L_1-distance between P and Q can be estimated with a constant
precision using approximately N^{1/2} queries in the quantum settings, whereas
classical computers need \Omega(N) queries. We also describe quantum algorithms
for testing Uniformity and Orthogonality with query complexity O(N^{1/3}). The
classical query complexity of these problems is known to be \Omega(N^{1/2}).
