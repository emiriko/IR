We describe and present initial results of a weak lensing survey of nearby
($\rm{z}\lesssim0.1$) galaxy clusters in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
In this first study, galaxy clusters are selected from the SDSS spectroscopic
galaxy cluster catalogs of \citet{miller05} and \citet{berlind06}. We report a
total of seven individual low redshift cluster weak lensing measurements which
include: A2048, A1767, A2244, A1066, A2199, and two clusters specifically
identified with the C4 algorithm. Our program of weak lensing of nearby galaxy
clusters in the SDSS will eventually reach $\sim 200$ clusters, making it the
largest weak lensing survey of individual galaxy clusters to date.
