We comment on the recent observation of the decay mode D(sJ)(*)(2860)-->D(*)K
by the BABAR Collaboration [arXiv:0908.0806], and contest their peremptory
conclusion that the data exclude a 0(+) assignment for the D(sJ)(*)(2860). In
particular, we argue that the observed branching fraction
B(D(sJ)(*)(2860)-->D(*)K)/B(D(sJ)(*)(2860)-->DK)=1.1 pm 0.15 pm 0.19 supports
the existence of two largely overlapping resonances at about 2.86 GeV, namely a
pair of radially excited tensor 2(+) and scalar 0(+) c-sbar states. This
scenario is further justified by comparing with the corresponding excited
charmonium states. Also other aspects of the charm-strange spectrum are
discussed.
