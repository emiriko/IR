A four-component Fermi gas in one dimension with a short-range four-body
interaction is shown to exhibit a one-dimensional analog of the BCS-BEC
crossover. Its low-energy physics is governed by a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid
with three spin gaps. The spin gaps are exponentially small in the weak
coupling (BCS) limit where they arise from the charge-density-wave instability,
and become large in the strong coupling (BEC) limit because of the formation of
tightly-bound tetramers. We investigate the ground-state energy, the sound
velocity, and the gap spectrum in the BCS-BEC crossover and discuss exact
relationships valid in our system. We also show that a one-dimensional analog
of the Efimov effect occurs for five bosons while it is absent for fermions.
Our work opens up a very rich new field of universal few-body and many-body
physics in one dimension.
