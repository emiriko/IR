The recently observed quantum states of neutrons bound in a gravitational
field are analyzed in the framework of one-parameter isospectral hamiltonians.
Potentials isospectral to the usual Newton potential are explicitly constructed
for the first time, then constrained using measured properties of the neutron
gravitational states. The corresponding wave functions and the neutron fluxes
are also calculated and analyzed in a simple model, including the ground state
and the excited state contributions. The constructed isospectral potentials are
discussed as candidates for a possible modification of Newton's law at a
submillimetre scale. Our results indicate that significant deviations from the
Newtonian gravity at submillimetre distances could be compatible with
experiment.
