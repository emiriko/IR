We study subgap spectra of fermions localized within vortex cores in
$^3$He-B. We develop an analytical treatment of the low-energy states and
consider the characteristic properties of fermion spectra for different types
of vortices. Due to the removed spin degeneracy the spectra of all singly
quantized vortices consist of two different anomalous branches crossing the
Fermi level. For singular $o$ and $u$ vortices the anomalous branches are
similar to the standard Caroli-de Gennes -Matricon ones and intersect the Fermi
level at zero angular momentum yet with different slopes corresponding to
different spin states. On the contrary the spectral branches of nonsingular
vortices intersect the Fermi level at finite angular momenta which leads to the
appearance of a large number of zero modes, i.e. energy states at the Fermi
level. Considering the $v$, $w$ and $uvw$ vortices with superfluid cores we
show that the number of zero modes is proportional to the size of the vortex
core.
