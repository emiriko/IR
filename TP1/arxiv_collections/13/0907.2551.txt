The problem of minimization of a quadratic functional depending on great
number of binary variables is examined. 3 variants of minimization procedure
are studied with the aid of computer simulation for spin-glass matrices. It is
shown that under other equal conditions evident superiority has the maximal
dynamics (the greedy algorithm). The dependence of the results on a distance
between start points and the ground state is investigated. It is determined
that the character of distribution of local minima depends on this distance
crucially.
