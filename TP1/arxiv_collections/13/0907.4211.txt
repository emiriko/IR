We consider a random graph on a given degree sequence ${\cal D}$, satisfying
certain conditions. We focus on two parameters $Q=Q({\cal D}), R=R({\cal D})$.
Molloy and Reed proved that Q=0 is the threshold for the random graph to have a
giant component. We prove that if $|Q|=O(n^{-1/3} R^{2/3})$ then, with high
probability, the size of the largest component of the random graph will be of
order $\Theta(n^{2/3}R^{-1/3})$. If $|Q|$ is asymptotically larger than
$n^{-1/3}R^{2/3}$ then the size of the largest component is asymptotically
smaller or larger than $n^{2/3}R^{-1/3}$. Thus, we establish that the scaling
window is $|Q|=O(n^{-1/3} R^{2/3})$.
