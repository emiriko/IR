A well established framework of an uncoupled hierarchical modeling approach
is adopted here for the prediction of macroscopic material parameters of the
Generalized Leonov (GL) constitutive model intended for the analysis of
flexible pavements at both moderate and elevated temperature regimes. To that
end, a recently introduced concept of a statistically equivalent periodic unit
cell (SEPUC) is addressed to reflect a real microstructure of Mastic Asphalt
mixtures (MAm). While mastic properties are derived from an extensive
experimental program, the macroscopic properties of MAm are fitted to virtual
numerical experiments performed on the basis of first order homogenization
scheme. To enhance feasibility of the solution of the underlying nonlinear
problem a two-step homogenization procedure is proposed. Here, the effective
material properties are first found for a mortar phase, a composite consisting
of a mastic matrix and a fraction of small aggregates. These properties are
then introduced in place of the matrix in actual unit cells to give estimates
of the model parameters on macroscale. Comparison with the Mori-Tanaka
predictions is also provided suggesting limitations of classical
micromechanical models.
