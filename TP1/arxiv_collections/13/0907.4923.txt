The random-field Ising model (RFIM), one of the basic models for quenched
disorder, can be studied numerically with the help of efficient ground-state
algorithms. In this study, we extend these algorithm by various methods in
order to analyze low-energy excitations for the three-dimensional RFIM with
Gaussian distributed disorder that appear in the form of clusters of connected
spins. We analyze several properties of these clusters. Our results support the
validity of the droplet-model description for the RFIM.
