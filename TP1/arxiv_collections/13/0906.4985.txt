Faraday rotation (FR) is widely used to infer the orientation and strength of
magnetic fields in astrophysical plasmas. Although the absence of
electron-positron pairs is a plausible assumption in many astrophysical
environments, the magnetospheres of pulsars and black holes and their
associated jets may involve a significant pair plasma fraction. This motivates
being mindful of the effect of positrons on FR. Here we derive and interpret
exact expressions of FR for a neutral plasma of arbitrary composition. We focus
on electron-ion-positron plasmas in which charge neutrality is maintained by an
arbitrary combination of ions and positrons. Because a pure electron-positron
plasma has zero FR, the greater the fraction of positrons the higher the field
strength required to account for the same FR. We first obtain general formulae
and then specifically consider parameters relevant to active galctic nuclei
(AGN) jets to illustrate the significant differences in field strengths that FR
measurements from radio frequency measurements. Complementarily, using galaxy
cluster core plasmas as examples, we discuss how plasma composition can be
constrained if independent measurements of the field strength and number
density are available and combined with FR.
