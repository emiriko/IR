We study the predictions of the left-right model of electroweak interaction
based on $SU(2)_{L}\otimes SU(2)_{R}\otimes U(1)$ gauge group by using one
bidoublet and one doublet Higgs fields. We can reproduce the low energy
phenomenology of electroweak interaction by choosing the appropriate values of
vacuum expectation values of Higgs fields. Leptons can obtain a mass via two
scenarios, first via Higgs mechanism with non-zero 'hypercharge-like' $I$ in
Lagrangian density mass termms and put the Yukawa couplings $G_{l}>>G_{l}^{*}$,
and the second via Higgs mechanism followed by a seesaw mechanism without the
requirement $G_{l}>>G_{l}^{*}$.
