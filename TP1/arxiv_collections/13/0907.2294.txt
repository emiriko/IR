In polymer:fullerene solar cells, the origin of the losses in the
field-dependent photocurrent is still controversially debated. We contribute to
the ongoing discussion by performing photo-induced charge extraction
measurements on poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):[6,6]-phenyl-C$_{61}$ butyric
acid methyl ester solar cells in order to investigate the processes ruling
charge carrier decay. Calculating the drift length of photogenerated charges,
we find that polaron recombination is not limiting the photocurrent for
annealed devices. Additionally, we applied Monte Carlo simulations on blends of
conjugated polymer chain donors with acceptor molecules in order to gain
insight into the polaron pair dissociation. The dissociation yield turns out to
be rather high, with only a weak field dependence. With this complementary view
on dissociation and recombination, we stress the importance of accounting for
polaron pair dissociation, polaron recombination as well as charge extraction
when considering the loss mechanisms in organic solar cells.
