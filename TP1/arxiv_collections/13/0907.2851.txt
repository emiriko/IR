We study the electron spin dynamics in p-type GaAs doped with magnetic Mn
acceptors by means of time-resolved pump-probe and photoluminescence
techniques. Measurements in transverse magnetic fields show a long spin
relaxation time of 20 ns that can be uniquely related to electrons. Application
of weak longitudinal magnetic fields above 100 mT extends the spin relaxation
times up to microseconds which is explained by suppression of the
Bir-Aronov-Pikus spin relaxation for the electron on the Mn acceptor.
