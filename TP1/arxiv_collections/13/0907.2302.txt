The new contribution to the non-diagonal matrix element M_12 of the neutral
B_s meson system is investigated in a supersymmetric extension of the standard
model based on the discrete Q6 family symmetry. We assume that CP is
explicitly, but softly broken only by the b terms in the soft supersymmetry
breaking sector. We find that the new contributions to M_12 are real, and that
nevertheless there exists an observable difference in the CP phase compared
with the standard model. We focus our attention on the flavor-specific CP
asymmetry a_fs^s, and find that a_fs^s of the model is mostly negative and its
size can be one order of magnitude larger the standard model value. This
prediction is consistent with the current experimental value, and can be
experimentally tested in the near future.
