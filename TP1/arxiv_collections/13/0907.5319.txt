The chiral components in the magnetic order in multiferroic MnWO4 have been
studied by neutron diffraction using spherical polarization analysis as a
function of temperature and of external electric field. We show that
sufficiently close to the ferroelectric transition it is possible to switch the
chiral component by applying moderate electric fields at constant temperature.
Full hysteresis cycles can be observed which indicate strong pinning of the
magnetic order. MnWO4, furthermore, exhibits a magnetoelectric memory effect
across heating into the paramagnetic and paraelectric phase.
