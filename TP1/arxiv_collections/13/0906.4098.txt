A motion of a classical free charge in an electromagnetic plane wave can be
found exactly in a fully relativistic case. We have found an approximate
non-parameter form of the suitable equations of motion. In a linearly polarized
wave, in the simplest frame of reference, the charge moves along the well-known
"figure-8" path. We have numerically calculated the Lorentz force acting on the
charge as a function of time. In virtue of this, for the low frequency
ionization (or detachment) rate, we discuss a manifestation of nondipole and
relativistic effects.
