Bargaining games on exchange networks have been studied by both economists
and sociologists. A Balanced Outcome for such a game is an equilibrium concept
that combines notions of stability and fairness. In a recent paper, Kleinberg
and Tardos introduced balanced outcomes to the computer science community and
provided a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the set of such outcomes. Their
work left open a pertinent question: are there natural, local dynamics that
converge quickly to a balanced outcome? In this paper, we provide a partial
answer to this question by showing that simple edge-balancing dynamics converge
to a balanced outcome whenever one exists.
