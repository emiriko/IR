We update our 2006-2007 results for FCNC processes in the Littlest Higgs
model with T-parity (LHT). The removal of the logarithmic UV cutoff dependence
in our previous results through a new contribution to the Z^0-penguin diagrams
identified by Goto et al. and del Aguila et al., while making the deviations
from the SM expectations in the quark sector less spectacular, still allows for
sizable new physics effects in K -> pi nu anti-nu and K_L -> pi^0 l^+ l^-
decays and in the CP-asymmetry S_{psi phi} with the latter unaffected by the
new contribution. We extend our analysis by a study of the fine-tuning required
to fit the data on epsilon_K and by the inclusion of the decay K_L -> mu^+
mu^-. A number of correlations can distinguish this model from the custodially
protected Randall-Sundrum model analysed recently. We also reconsider lepton
flavour violating decays, including now a discussion of fine-tuning. While the
l_i -> l_j gamma decays are unaffected by the removal of the logarithmic cutoff
dependence, the branching ratios for decays with three leptons in the final
state, like mu -> 3 e are lowered by almost an order of magnitude. In spite of
this, the pattern of lepton flavour violation in the LHT model can still be
distinguished from the one in supersymmetric models.
