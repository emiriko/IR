Based on the mechanics of the Euler equation at short time, we show that a
Recent Fluid Deformation (RFD) closure for the vorticity field, neglecting the
early stage of advection of fluid particles, allows to build a 3D
incompressible velocity field that shares many properties with empirical
turbulence, such as the teardrop shape of the R-Q plane. Unfortunately, non
gaussianity is weak (i.e. no intermittency) and vorticity gets preferentially
aligned with the wrong eigenvector of the deformation. We then show that
slightly modifying the former vectorial field in order to impose the long range
correlated nature of turbulence allows to reproduce the main properties of
stationary flows. Doing so, we end up with a realistic incompressible, skewed
and intermittent velocity field that reproduces the main characteristics of 3D
turbulence in the inertial range, including correct vorticity alignment
properties.
