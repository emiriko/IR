General relativity can have a significant impact on the long-range escape
trajectories of solar sails deployed near the sun. Spacetime curvature in the
vicinity of the sun can cause a solar sail traveling from 0.01 AU to 2550 AU to
be deflected by as much as one million kilometers, and should therefore be
taken into account at the beginning of the mission. There are a number of
smaller general relativistic effects, such as frame dragging due to the slow
rotation of the sun which can cause a deflection of more than one thousand
kilometers.
