Holes confined in single InAs quantum dots have recently emerged as a
promising system for the storage or manipulation of quantum information. These
holes are often assumed to have only heavy-hole character and further assumed
to have no mixing between orthogonal heavy hole spin projections (in the
absence of a transverse magnetic field). The same assumption has been applied
to InAs quantum dot molecules formed by two stacked InAs quantum dots that are
coupled by coherent tunneling of the hole between the two dots. We present
experimental evidence of the existence of a hole spin mixing term obtained with
magneto-photoluminescence spectroscopy on such InAs quantum dot molecules. We
use a Luttinger spinor model to explain the physical origin of this hole spin
mixing term: misalignment of the dots along the stacking direction breaks the
angular symmetry and allows mixing through the light-hole component of the
spinor. We discuss how this novel spin mixing mechanism may offer new spin
manipulation opportunities that are unique to holes.
