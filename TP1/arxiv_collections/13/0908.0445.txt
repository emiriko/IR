We present a polarising optical microscopy study of a liquid-crystal mixture
of trans-4-hexylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid (C6) and benzoic acid. Both
materials have carboxylic groups that can form dimers through hydrogen bonding.
The mixture is nematic and room temperature and has the clearing point at 88
Celsius. The nematic phase shows ringed spherulites, sometimes looking like
spiral structures, and undulated textures, which remain visible heating the
sample till 71 Celsius. This is the temperature of a texture transition inside
the nematic phase.
