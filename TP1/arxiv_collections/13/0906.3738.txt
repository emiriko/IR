We consider the non-local quantum transport properties of a graphene
superconducting spin-valve. It is shown that one may create a spin-switch
effect between perfect elastic co-tunneling (CT) and perfect crossed
Andreev-reflection (CAR) for all bias voltages in the low-energy regime by
reversing the magnetization direction in one of the ferromagnetic layers. This
opportunity arises due the possibility of tuning the local Fermi-level in
graphene to values equivalent to a weak, magnetic exchange splitting, thus
reducing the Fermi surface for minority spins to a single point and rendering
graphene to be half-metallic. Such an effect is not attainable in a
conventional metallic spin-valve setup, where the contributions from CT and CAR
tend to cancel each other and noise-measurements are necessary to distinguish
these processes.
