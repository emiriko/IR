I discuss viscosity corrections to thermal effects on the static QCD
potential within hard-thermal loop resummed perturbation theory and for a
strongly coupled, large-N_c conformal field theory dual to five-dimensional
Gauss-Bonnet gravity. I also present model predictions for quarkonium binding
energies in the deconfined phase and for suppression of R_{AA}(Upsilon --> e+
e-).
