In non-centrosymmetric magnets the chiral Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange
stabilizes Skyrmion-strings as excitations which may condense into multiply
modulated phases. Such extended Skyrmionic textures are determined by the
stability of the localized "solitonic" Skyrmion cores and their geometrical
incompatibility which frustrates regular space-filling. We present numerically
exact solutions for Skyrmion lattices and formulate basic properties of the
Skyrmionic states.
