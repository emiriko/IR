Experiments involving copper-copper collisions at the RHIC-BNL (USA) at
energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 22.5, 62 and 200 GeV have produced a vast amount of
high-precision data which are to be analysed in the light of various competing
models in the domain of multiparicle production scenario. We have chosen to
analyse here the measured data on the $p_T$ -spectra of various light and
non-strange secondaries at various energies mentioned above, some of their very
important ratio-behaviours at the various centralities of the collisions and
the nuclear modification factors $R_{AA}$ and $R_{CP}$ in the light of a
version of the Sequential Chain Model (SCM). The agreements between the
measured data and model-based results are generally found to be modestly
satisfactory. Besides, our obtained results have also been compared with
results based upon two approaches with strong standard model flavour, of which
one is purely pQCD-oriented and is forwarded by Vitev.
