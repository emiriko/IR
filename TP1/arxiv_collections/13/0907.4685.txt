We reanalyse the measurements of parallax, proper motion, and line-of-sight
velocity for 18 masers in high mass star-forming regions presented by Reid et
al. (2009). We use a likelihood analysis to investigate the distance of the Sun
from the Galactic centre, R_0, the rotational speed of the local standard of
rest, v_0, and the peculiar velocity of the Sun, vsol, for various models of
the rotation curve, and models which allow for a typical peculiar motion of the
high mass star-forming regions.
  We find that these data are best fit by models with non-standard values for
vsol or a net peculiar motion of the high mass star-forming regions. We argue
that a correction to vsol is much more likely, and that these data support the
conclusion of Binney (2009) that V_sol should be revised upwards from 5.2 km/s
to 11 km/s. We find that the values of R_0 and v_0 that we determine are
heavily dependent on the model we use for the rotation curve, with
model-dependent estimates of R_0 ranging from 6.7 \pm 0.5kpc to 8.9 \pm 0.9kpc,
and those of v_0 ranging from 200 \pm 20 km/s to 279 \pm 33 km/s. We argue that
these data cannot be thought of as implying any particular values of R_0 or
v_0. However, we find that v_0/R_0 is better constrained, lying in the range
29.9-31.6 km/s/kpc for all models but one.
