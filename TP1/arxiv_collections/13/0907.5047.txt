We investigate the global existence and scattering for the cubic fourth-order
Schr\"{o}dinger equation $iu_t+\Delta^2u+|u|^2u=0$ in the low regularity space
$H^s(\R^n)$ with $s<2$. We provide an alternative approach to obtain a new
interaction Morawetz estimate and extend the range of the dimension of the
interactive estimate in Pausader \cite{P08} by modifying a tensor product
method appeared in \cite{CGT}. We combine interaction Morawetz estimates,
energy increments for the I-method to prove the result.
