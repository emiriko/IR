We study higher-dimensional soliton and hairy black hole solutions of the
Einstein equations non-minimally coupled to a scalar field. The scalar field
has no self-interaction potential but a cosmological constant is included.
Non-trivial solutions exist only when the cosmological constant is negative and
the constant governing the coupling of the scalar field to the Ricci scalar
curvature is positive. At least some of these solutions are stable when this
coupling constant is not too large.
