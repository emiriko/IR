We suggest a simple highly predictive ansatz for charged lepton and light
neutrino mass matrices, based on the assumption of universality of Yukawa
couplings. Using as input the charged lepton masses and light neutrino masses,
the six parameters characterizing the leptonic mixing matrix $V_{PMNS}$, are
predicted in terms of a single phase $\phi$, which takes a value around
$\phi={\frac{\pi}{2}}$. Correlations among variuos physical quantities are
obtained, in particular $V^{PMNS}_{13}$ is predicted as a function of
${\Delta}m^2_{21}$, ${\Delta}m^2_{31}$ and $\sin^2(\theta_{sol})$, and
restricted to the range $0.167<|V^{PMNS}_{13}|<0.179$.
