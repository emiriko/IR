Particle localization is an essential ingredient in quantum Hall physics
[1,2]. In conventional high mobility two-dimensional electron systems Coulomb
interactions were shown to compete with disorder and to play a central role in
particle localization [3]. Here we address the nature of localization in
graphene where the carrier mobility, quantifying the disorder, is two to four
orders of magnitude smaller [4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. We image the electronic density
of states and the localized state spectrum of a graphene flake in the quantum
Hall regime with a scanning single electron transistor [11]. Our microscopic
approach provides direct insight into the nature of localization. Surprisingly,
despite strong disorder, our findings indicate that localization in graphene is
not dominated by single particle physics, but rather by a competition between
the underlying disorder potential and the repulsive Coulomb interaction
responsible for screening.
