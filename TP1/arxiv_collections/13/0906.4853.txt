We introduce a family of copulas which are locally piecewise uniform in the
interior of the unit cube of any given dimension. Within that family, the
simultaneous control of tail dependencies of all projections to faces of the
cube is possible and we give an efficient sampling algorithm. The combination
of these two properties may be appealing to risk modellers.
