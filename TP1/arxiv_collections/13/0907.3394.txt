We investigate the launching of outflows from the disk-magnetosphere boundary
of slowly and rapidly rotating magnetized stars using axisymmetric and
exploratory 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. We find long-lasting
outflows in both cases. (1) In the case of slowly rotating stars, a new type of
outflow, a conical wind, is found and studied in simulations. The conical winds
appear in cases where the magnetic flux of the star is bunched up by the disk
into an X-type configuration. The winds have the shape of a thin conical shell
with a half-opening angle 30-40 degrees. The conical winds may be responsible
for episodic as well as long-lasting outflows in different types of stars. (2)
In the case of rapidly rotating stars (the "propeller regime"), a two-component
outflow is observed. One component is similar to the conical winds. A
significant fraction of the disk matter may be ejected into the winds. A second
component is a high-velocity, low-density magnetically dominated axial jet
where matter flows along the opened polar field lines of the star. The jet has
a mass flux about 10% that of the conical wind, but its energy flux (dominantly
magnetic) can be larger than the energy flux of the conical wind. The jet's
angular momentum flux (also dominantly magnetic) causes the star to spin-down
rapidly. Propeller-driven outflows may be responsible for the jets in
protostars and for their rapid spin-down. The jet is collimated by the magnetic
force while the conical winds are only weakly collimated in the simulation
region.
