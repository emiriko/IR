We consider a strongly interacting ${}^{6}$Li-${}^{40}$K mixture, which is
imbalanced both in the masses and the densities of the two fermionic species.
At present, it is the experimentalist's favorite for reaching the superfluid
regime. We construct an effective thermodynamic potential that leads to
excellent agreement with Monte Carlo results for the normal state. We use it to
determine the universal phase diagram of the mixture in the unitarity limit,
where we find, in contrast to the mass-balanced case, the presence of a
Lifshitz point. This point is characterized by the effective mass of the Cooper
pairs becoming negative, which signals an instability towards a supersolid
phase.
