We present advances in the software engineering design and implementation of
the multi-tier run-time system for the General Intensional Programming System
(GIPSY) by further unifying the distributed technologies used to implement the
Demand Migration Framework (DMF) in order to streamline distributed execution
of hybrid intensional-imperative programs using Java.
