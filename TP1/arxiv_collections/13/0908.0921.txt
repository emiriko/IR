In this paper, we employ the bifurcation method of dynamical systems to
investigate the exact travelling wave solutions for the Fornberg-Whitham
equation. The implicit expression for solitons is given. The explicit
expressions for peakons and periodic cusp wave solutions are also obtained.
Further, we show that the limits of soliton solutions and periodic cusp wave
solutions are peakons.
