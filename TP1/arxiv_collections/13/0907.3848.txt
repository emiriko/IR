The basic quantum mechanical relation between fluctuations of transported
charge and current correlators is discussed. It is found that, as a rule, the
correlators are to be time-ordered in an unusual way. Instances where the
difference with the conventional ordering matters are illustrated by means of a
simple scattering model. We apply the results to resolve a discrepancy
concerning the third cumulant of charge transport across a quantum point
contact.
