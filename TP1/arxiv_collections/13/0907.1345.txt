It is shown that a homogeneous two-component Fermi gas with (long range)
dipolar and short-range isotropic interactions has a {\em ferro-nematic} phase
for suitable values of the dipolar and short-range coupling constants. The
ferro-nematic phase is characterized by having a non-zero magnetization and
long range orientational uniaxial order. The Fermi surface of spin up (down)
component is elongated (compressed) along the direction of the magnetization.
