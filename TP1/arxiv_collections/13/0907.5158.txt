Top-quark physics is one of the main fields of investigation at the Tevatron
accelerator and, ultimately, at the LHC. We perform a phenomenological analysis
of ttbar events at hadron colliders, with a focus on observables relying on
bottom-quark fragmentation in top-quark decay. In particular, we investigate
the B-lepton invariant-mass distribution in the dilepton channel and give an
estimate of the contribution of bottom fragmentation to the Monte Carlo
uncertainty on the top-quark mass reconstruction.
