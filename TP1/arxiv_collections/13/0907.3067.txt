The discovery of CoRoT-7b, a planet of radius 1.68 +/- 0.09 R_E, mass 4.8 +/-
0.8 M_E and orbital period of 0.854 days demonstrates that small planets can
orbit extremely close to their star. We use knowledge of hot Jupiters, mass
loss estimates and models for the interior structure and evolution of planets
to understand its composition, structure and evolution. The inferred mass and
radius of CoRoT-7b are consistent with a rocky planet that would be depleted in
iron relative to Earth. However, a one sigma increase in mass (5.6 M_E) and
decrease in size (1.59 R_E) are compatible with an Earth-like composition (33%
iron, 67% silicates). Alternatively, it is possible that CoRoT-7b contains a
significant amount of volatiles. An equally good fit to the data is found for a
vapor envelope equal to 3% (and up to 10%) by mass above an Earth-like nucleus.
Because of its intense irradiation and small size, the planet cannot possess an
envelope of H and He of more than 1/10,000 of its total mass. We show that the
mass loss is significant (~ 10^11 g/s) and independent of planetary
composition. This is because the hydrodynamical escape rate is independent of
the atmosphere's mean molecular mass, and owing to the intense irradiation,
even a bare rocky planet would possess an equilibrium vapor atmosphere thick
enough to capture stellar UV photons. This escape rate rules out the
possibility of a H-He envelope as it would escape in only ~1 Ma. A water vapor
atmosphere would escape in ~ 1 Ga, and thus it is a plausible scenario. The
origin of CoRoT-7b cannot be inferred from present observations: It may have
formed rocky; or be the remnant of a Uranus-like ice giant, or a gas giant with
a small core that was stripped of its gaseous envelope.
