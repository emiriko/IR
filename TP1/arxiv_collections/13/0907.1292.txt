Currently, the only known way to obtain experimental information about the
space-time structure of a heavy-ion collision is through 2-particle momentum
correlations. Azimuthally sensitive HBT interferometry (Hanbury Brown-Twiss
intensity interferometry) can complement elliptic flow measurements by
constraining the spatial deformation of the source and its time evolution.
Performing these measurements on photons allows us to access the fireball
evolution at earlier times than with hadrons. Using ideal hydrodynamics to
model the space-time evolution of the collision fireball, we explore
theoretically various aspects of 2-photon intensity interferometry with
transverse momenta up to 2 GeV, in particular the azimuthal angle dependence of
the HBT radii in non-central collisions. We highlight the dual nature of
thermal photon emission, in both central and non-central collisions, resulting
from the superposition of QGP and hadron resonance gas photon production. This
signature is present in both the thermal photon source function and the HBT
radii extracted from Gaussian fits of the 2-photon correlation function.
