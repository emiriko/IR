A so-called "agegraphic dark energy" was recently proposed to explain the
dark energy-dominated universe. In this Letter, we generalize the agegraphic
dark energy models to the universe with spatial curvature in the presence of
interaction between dark matter and dark energy. We show that these models can
accommodate $w_D = -1 $ crossing for the equation of state of dark energy. In
the limiting case of a flat universe, i.e. $k = 0$, all previous results of
agegraphic dark energy in flat universe are restored.
