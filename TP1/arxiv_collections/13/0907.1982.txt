In this paper we calculate the transfer coefficients for evaporation and
condensation of mixtures. We use the continuous profiles of various
thermodynamic quantities through the interface, obtained in our previous works
using the square gradient model. Furthermore we introduce the Gibbs surface and
obtain the excess entropy production for a surface. Following the traditional
non-equilibrium thermodynamic approach we introduce the surface transfer
coefficients which we are able to determine from the continuous solution. The
knowledge of these coefficients is important for many industrial applications
which involve transport through a surface, such as for instance distillation.
In our approach the values of the local resistivities in the liquid and the
vapor phases are chosen on the basis of experimental values. In the interfacial
region there are small peaks in these resistivities. Three amplitudes control
the magnitude of these peaks. Possible values of these amplitudes are found by
matching the diagonal transfer coefficients to values predicted by kinetic
theory. Using these amplitudes we find that the value of the cross
resistivities is 1-2 orders of magnitude higher then the one from kinetic
theory. The results of both kinetic theory and molecular dynamics simulations
support the existence of small peaks in the local resistivities in the
interfacial region. The square gradient approach gives an independent way to
determine the transfer coefficients for surfaces. The results indicate that
kinetic theory underestimates the interfacial transfer coefficients in real
fluids.
