We report on the first measurement of the differential cross section of
$\phi$-meson photoproduction for the $d(\gamma,pK^{+}K^{-})n$ exclusive
reaction channel. The experiment was performed using a
\textcolor{black}{tagged-photon} beam and the CEBAF Large Acceptance
Spectrometer (CLAS) at Jefferson Lab. A combined analysis using data from the
$d(\gamma,pK^{+}K^{-})n$ channel and those from a previous publication on
coherent $\phi$ production on the deuteron has been carried out to extract the
$\phi-N$ total cross section, $\sigma_{\phi N}$. The extracted $\phi-N$ total
cross section favors a value above 20 mb. This value is larger than the value
extracted using vector-meson dominance models for $\phi$ photoproduction on the
proton.
