We investigate the effect of dynamic nuclear spin fluctuation on quantum
tunneling of the magnetization (QTM) in the molecular magnet Fe8 by increasing
the nuclei temperature using radio frequency (RF) pulses before the hysteresis
loop measurements. The RF pulses do not change the electrons spin temperature.
Independently we show that the nuclear spin-spin relaxation time T2 has strong
temperature dependence. Nevertheless, we found no effect of the nuclear spin
temperature on the tunneling probability. This suggests that in our
experimental conditions only the hyperfine field strength is relevant for QTM.
We demonstrate theoretically how this can occur.
