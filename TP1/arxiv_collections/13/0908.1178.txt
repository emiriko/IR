A dynamic crack tip equation of motion is proposed based on the autonomy of
the near-tip nonlinear zone of scale $\ell_{nl}$, symmetry principles,
causality and scaling arguments. Causality implies that the asymptotic
linear-elastic fields at time $t$ are determined by the crack path at a {\bf
retarded time} $t-\tau_d$, where the delay time $\tau_d$ scales with the ratio
of $\ell_{nl}$ and the typical wave speed $c_{nl}$ within the nonlinear zone.
The resulting equation is shown to agree with known results in the quasi-static
regime. As a first application in the fully dynamic regime, an approximate
analysis predicts a high-speed oscillatory instability whose characteristic
scale is determined by $\ell_{nl}$. This prediction is corroborated by
experimental results, demonstrating the emergence of crack tip inertia-like
effects.
