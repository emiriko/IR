The Geminga gamma ray source was first detected by the SAS-2 gamma-ray
satellite observatory and the COS-B x-ray satellite observatory, and has been
identified as a radio-quiet pulsar associated with a 300,000 year old supernova
remnant. Geminga is one of the brightest GeV sources as seen by the Large Area
Telescope on board the Fermi gamma-ray satellite observatory. A ground based
detection was accomplished by the Milagro extensive air shower array at
energies greater than 20 TeV. During 2007 VERITAS performed observations to
search for TeV gamma ray emission from the Geminga pulsar and the region near
Geminga. In this paper, we describe these measurements and the new analysis of
these observations.
