We have used Low Energy Electron Microscopy (LEEM) and Photo Emission
Electron Microscopy (PEEM) to study and improve the quality of graphene films
grown on Ir(111) using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). CVD at elevated
temperature already yields graphene sheets that are uniform and of monatomic
thickness. Besides domains that are aligned with respect to the substrate,
other rotational variants grow. Cyclic growth exploiting the faster growth and
etch rates of the rotational variants, yields films that are 99 % composed of
aligned domains. Precovering the substrate with a high density of graphene
nuclei prior to CVD yields pure films of aligned domains extending over
millimeters. Such films can be used to prepare cluster-graphene hybrid
materials for catalysis or nanomagnetism and can potentially be combined with
lift-off techniques to yield high-quality, graphene based electronic devices.
