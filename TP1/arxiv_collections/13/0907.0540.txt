Inversive meadows are commutative rings with a multiplicative identity
element and a total multiplicative inverse operation whose value at 0 is 0.
Divisive meadows are inversive meadows with the multiplicative inverse
operation replaced by a division operation. We give finite equational
specifications of the class of all inversive meadows and the class of all
divisive meadows. It depends on the angle from which they are viewed whether
inversive meadows or divisive meadows must be considered more basic. We show
that inversive and divisive meadows of rational numbers can be obtained as
initial algebras of finite equational specifications. In the spirit of
Peacock's arithmetical algebra, we study variants of inversive and divisive
meadows without an additive identity element and/or an additive inverse
operation. We propose simple constructions of variants of inversive and
divisive meadows with a partial multiplicative inverse or division operation
from inversive and divisive meadows. Divisive meadows are more basic if these
variants are considered as well. We give a simple account of how mathematicians
deal with 1 / 0, in which meadows and a customary convention among
mathematicians play prominent parts, and we make plausible that a convincing
account, starting from the popular computer science viewpoint that 1 / 0 is
undefined, by means of some logic of partial functions is not attainable.
