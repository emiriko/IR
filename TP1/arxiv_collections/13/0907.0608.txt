Context: The F8 star HD 181906 (effective temperature ~6300K) was observed
for 156 days by the CoRoT satellite during the first long run in the centre
direction. Analysis of the data reveals a spectrum of solar-like acoustic
oscillations. However, the faintness of the target (m_v=7.65) means the
signal-to-noise (S/N) in the acoustic modes is quite low, and this low S/N
leads to complications in the analysis. Aims: To extract global variables of
the star as well as key parameters of the p modes observed in the power
spectrum of the lightcurve. Methods: The power spectrum of the lightcurve, a
wavelet transform and spot fitting have been used to obtain the average
rotation rate of the star and its inclination angle. Then, the autocorrelation
of the power spectrum and the power spectrum of the power spectrum were used to
properly determine the large separation. Finally, estimations of the mode
parameters have been done by maximizing the likelihood of a global fit, where
several modes were fit simultaneously. Results: We have been able to infer the
mean surface rotation rate of the star (~4 microHz) with indications of the
presence of surface differential rotation, the large separation of the p modes
(~87 microHz), and therefore also the ridges corresponding to overtones of the
acoustic modes.
