Low-temperature scanning electron microscopy (LTSEM) has been used to image
the supercurrent distribution in ramp-type Josephson junctions between Nb and
either the electron-doped cuprate Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_{4-y}$ or the hole-doped
cuprate YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$. For zigzag-shaped devices in the short junction
limit the critical current is strongly suppressed at zero applied magnetic
field. The LTSEM images show, that this is due to the Josephson current
counterflow in neighboring 0 and $\pi$ facets, which is induced by the
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ order parameter in the cuprates. Thus, LTSEM provides imaging of
the sign change of the superconducting order parameter, which can also be
applied to other types of Josephson junctions.
