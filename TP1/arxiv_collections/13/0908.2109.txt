In this work we present scanning Fabry-Perot H$\alpha$ observations of the
isolated interacting galaxy pair NGC 5278/79 obtained with the PUMA Fabry-Perot
interferometer. We derived velocity fields, various kinematic parameters and
rotation curves for both galaxies. Our kinematical results together with the
fact that dust lanes have been detected in both galaxies, as well as the
analysis of surface brightness profiles along the minor axis, allowed us to
determine that both components of the interacting pair are trailing spirals.
