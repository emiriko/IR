The canonically quantized 3+1 General Relativity with the global one
dimensionality conjecture defines the model, which dimensionally reduced and
secondary quantized yields the one-dimensional quantum field theory wherein the
generic one-point correlations create a boson mass responsible for quantum
gravity. In this paper, this simple model is developed in a wider sense. We
propose to consider the thermodynamics of space quanta, constructed ab initio
from the entropic formalism, as the quantum gravity phenomenology.
