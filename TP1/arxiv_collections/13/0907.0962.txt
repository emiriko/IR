Some microorganisms, such as spermatozoa, synchronize their flagella when
swimming in close proximity. Using a simplified model (two infinite, parallel,
two-dimensional waving sheets), we show that phase-locking arises from
hydrodynamics forces alone, and has its origin in the front-back asymmetry of
the geometry of their flagellar waveform. The time-evolution of the phase
difference between co-swimming cells depends only on the nature of this
geometrical asymmetry, and microorganisms can phase-lock into conformations
which minimize or maximize energy dissipation.
