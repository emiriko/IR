Leptoquarks are predicted in several extensions of the Standard Model (SM) of
particle physics attempting the unification of the quark and lepton sectors.
Such particles could be produced in the interaction of high energy neutrinos
with matter of the Earth. We investigate the effects of this particles on the
neutrino flux to be detected in a kilometer cubic neutrino telescope such as
IceCube. We calculate the contribution of leptoquarks to the neutrino-nucleon
interaction and, then, to the angular observable $\alpha(E)$ recently proposed
in order to evaluate detectable effects in IceCube. Our results are presented
as an exclusion plot in the relevant parameters of the leptoquarks physics.
