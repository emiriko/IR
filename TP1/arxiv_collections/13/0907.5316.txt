The interaction of the low lying pseudo-scalar mesons with the ground state
baryons in the charm sector is studied within a coupled channel approach using
a t-channel vector-exchange driving force. The amplitudes describing the
scattering of the pseudo-scalar mesons off the ground-state baryons are
obtained by solving the Lippmann--Schwinger equation. We analyze in detail the
effects of going beyond the $t=0$ approximation. Our model predicts the
dynamical generation of several open charmed baryon resonances in different
isospin and strangeness channels, some of which can be clearly identified with
recently observed states.
