We present results that compare the accuracy of the AM05 density functional
to a set of chemical reaction energies. The reactions were generated from the
singlet species in the well-known G2 test suite. Our results show that, in
general, the AM05 functional performs nearly as well as the other "pure"
density functionals, but none of these perform as well as the hybrid B3LYP
functional. These results are nonetheless encouraging because the AM05
functional arises from very simple assumptions, and does not require the
calculation of the Hartree-Fock exchange integrals.
