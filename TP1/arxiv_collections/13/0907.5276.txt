We study the performance of the adaptive construction scheme for a Bayesian
inference on the Quadratic GARCH model which introduces the asymmetry in time
series dynamics. In the adaptive construction scheme a proposal density in the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is constructed adaptively by changing the
parameters of the density to fit the posterior density. Using artificial QGARCH
data we infer the QGARCH parameters by applying the adaptive construction
scheme to the Bayesian inference of QGARCH model. We find that the adaptive
construction scheme samples QGARCH parameters effectively, i.e. correlations
between the sampled data are very small. We conclude that the adaptive
construction scheme is an efficient method to the Bayesian estimation of the
QGARCH model.
