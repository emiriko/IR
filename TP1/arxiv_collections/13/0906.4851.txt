Asymmetric steering is an effect whereby an inseparable bipartite system can
be found to be described by either quantum mechanics or local hidden variable
theories depending on which one of Alice or Bob makes the required
measurements. We show that, even with an inseparable bipartite system,
situations can arise where Gaussian measurements on one half are not sufficient
to answer the fundamental question of which theory gives an adequate
description and the whole system must be considered. This phenomenon is
possible because of an asymmetry in the definition of the original
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox and in this article we show theoretically that
it may be demonstrated, at least in the case where Alice and Bob can only make
Gaussian measurements, using the intracavity nonlinear coupler.
