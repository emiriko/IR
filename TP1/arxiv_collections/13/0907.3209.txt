In this paper, we propose three novel and important methods for the
registration of histological images for 3D reconstruction. First, possible
intensity variations and nonstandardness in images are corrected by an
intensity standardization process which maps the image scale into a standard
scale where the similar intensities correspond to similar tissues meaning.
Second, 2D histological images are mapped into a feature space where continuous
variables are used as high confidence image features for accurate registration.
Third, we propose an automatic best reference slice selection algorithm that
improves reconstruction quality based on both image entropy and mean square
error of the registration process. We demonstrate that the choice of reference
slice has a significant impact on registration error, standardization, feature
space and entropy information. After 2D histological slices are registered
through an affine transformation with respect to an automatically chosen
reference, the 3D volume is reconstructed by co-registering 2D slices
elastically.
