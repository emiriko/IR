The two-body potential of systems with long-range interactions decays at
large distances as $V(r)\sim 1/r^\alpha$, with $\alpha\leq d$, where $d$ is the
space dimension. Examples are: gravitational systems, two-dimensional
hydrodynamics, two-dimensional elasticity, charged and dipolar systems.
Although such systems can be made extensive, they are intrinsically non
additive. Moreover, the space of accessible macroscopic thermodynamic
parameters might be non convex. The violation of these two basic properties is
at the origin of ensemble inequivalence, which implies that specific heat can
be negative in the microcanonical ensemble and temperature jumps can appear at
microcanonical first order phase transitions. The lack of convexity implies
that ergodicity may be generically broken. We present here a comprehensive
review of the recent advances on the statistical mechanics and
out-of-equilibrium dynamics of systems with long-range interactions. The core
of the review consists in the detailed presentation of the concept of ensemble
inequivalence, as exemplified by the exact solution, in the microcanonical and
canonical ensembles, of mean-field type models. Relaxation towards
thermodynamic equilibrium can be extremely slow and quasi-stationary states may
be present. The understanding of such unusual relaxation process is obtained by
the introduction of an appropriate kinetic theory based on the Vlasov equation.
