We have formulated a relaxation mechanism for ferrites and ferromagnetic
metals whereby the coupling between the magnetic motion and lattice is based
purely on continuum arguments concerning magnetostriction. This theoretical
approach contrasts with previous mechanisms based on microscopic formulations
of spin-phonon interactions employing a discrete lattice. Our model explains
for the first time the scaling of the intrinsic FMR linewidth with frequency,
and 1/M temperature dependence and the anisotropic nature of magnetic
relaxation in ordered magnetic materials, where M is the magnetization. Without
introducing adjustable parameters our model is in reasonable quantitative
agreement with experimental measurements of the intrinsic magnetic resonance
linewidths of important class of ordered magnetic materials, insulator or
metals.
