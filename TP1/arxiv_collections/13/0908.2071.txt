We study the widths of interspecies Feshbach resonances in a mixture of the
fermionic quantum gases 6Li and 40K. We develop a model to calculate the width
and position of all available Feshbach resonances for a system. Using the model
we select the optimal resonance to study the 6Li/40K mixture. Experimentally,
we obtain the asymmetric Fano lineshape of the interspecies elastic cross
section by measuring the distillation rate of 6Li atoms from a potassium-rich
6Li/40K mixture as a function of magnetic field. This provides us with the
first experimental determination of the width of a resonance in this mixture,
Delta B=1.5(5) G. Our results offer good perspectives for the observation of
universal crossover physics using this mass-imbalanced fermionic mixture.
