FT-Raman Spectroscopy was applied to identify biochemical alterations
existing between inflammatory fibrous hyperplasia (IFH) and normal tissues of
buccal mucosa. One important implication of this study is related to the cancer
lesion border. In fact, the cancerous normal border line is characterized by
the presence of inflammation and its correct discrimination would increase the
accuracy in delimiting the lesion frontier. Seventy spectra of IFH from 14
patients were compared to 30 spectra of normal tissue from 6 patients. The
statistical analysis was performed with Principal Components Analysis and Soft
Independent Modeling Class Analogy methodologies. After studying several
spectral ranges it was concluded that the best discrimination capability
(sensibility of 95% and specificity of 100%) was found using the 530 to 580
cm$^{-1}$ wavenumbers. The bands in this region are related to vibrational
modes of Collagen aminoacids Cistine, Cysteine, and Proline and their relevant
contribution to the classification probably relies on the extracellular matrix
degeneration process occurring in the inflammatory tissues.
