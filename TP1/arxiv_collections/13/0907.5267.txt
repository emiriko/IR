The Solar Vector Magnetograph (SVM) is a modern imaging spectropolarimeter
installed at Udaipur Solar Observatory (USO). Earlier phases saw the
development of the instrument using off-the-shelf components with in-house
software development. Subsequently, improvements were done in the
opto-mechanical design of the sub-systems and the telescope tracking system.
The third phase of the instrument development saw three major improvements,
these include: (i) installation of a web-camera based telescope guiding system,
developed in-house, (ii) high-cadence spectropolarimetry using Liquid Crystal
Variable Retarders and a fast CCD camera and (iii)inclusion of Na D1 line with
regular photospheric Fe 630.2 nm line for chromospheric observations.
