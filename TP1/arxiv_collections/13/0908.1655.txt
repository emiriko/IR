Observations at 14.2 to 17.9 GHz made with the AMI Small Array towards
fourteen Lynds Dark Nebulae with a resolution of 2' are reported. These sources
are selected from the SCUBA observations of Visser et al. (2001) as small
angular diameter clouds well matched to the synthesized beam of the AMI Small
Array. Comparison of the AMI observations with radio observations at lower
frequencies with matched uv-plane coverage is made, in order to search for any
anomalous excess emission which can be attributed to spinning dust. Possible
emission from spinning dust is identified as a source within a 2' radius of the
Scuba position of the Lynds dark nebula, exhibiting an excess with respect to
lower frequency radio emission. We find five sources which show a possible
spinning dust component in their spectra. These sources have rising spectral
indices in the frequency range 14.2--17.9 GHz. Of these five one has already
been reported, L1111, we report one new definite detection, L675, and three new
probable detections (L944, L1103 and L1246). The relative certainty of these
detections is assessed on the basis of three criteria: the extent of the
emission, the coincidence of the emission with the Scuba position and the
likelihood of alternative explanations for the excess. Extended microwave
emission makes the likelihood of the anomalous emission arising as a
consequence of a radio counterpart to a protostar or a proto-planetary disk
unlikely. We use a 2' radius in order to be consistent with the IRAS
identifications of dark nebulae (Parker 1988), and our third criterion is used
in the case of L1103 where a high flux density at 850 microns relative to the
FIR data suggests a more complicated emission spectrum.
