A neutron source is proposed. It is based on a proton accelerator with the
energy Ep = 1.2 GeV, current Ip = 0.7A, pulse duration T = 3 mcsec, repetition
rate F = 60 Hz, and accelerator length L = 30 m.
  Protons are accelerated by the field of electron rings. The electron rings
are formed from a tube beam by way of modulation and creating rotating motion
by crossing the magnetic field cusp. The frequency of modulation f1 = 142.8
MHz. The bunch is accelerated at the frequency f3 = 2856 MHz. The high
frequency power required for making the field is P1 = 6 - 150 MW/section, the
power transferred to the accelerated beam is P2 = 75 - 100 MW/m.
  The bigger radius of the rings (r0 = 2 cm) and radial dimensions of the ring
(ar = 0.125 cm) are provided by the external magnetic field B0 = 2.4 T. The
longitudinal dimensions (az < 0.22 cm) are maintained by the wave moving
synchronously with the bunches. The number of electrons in each ring Ne = 3e12,
the number of protons Np = 3e10.
  Protons are accelerated at the constant energy gain rate 40 MeV/m. The
electron rings are accelerated in the waveguide with the field strength Ez =
1.08 MV/m. The intensity of the proton beam is 1e13 p/pulse. The average
intensity of the neutron flux on a lead target is Ian = 1e16 n/s, the pulsed
neutron flux is Ipn = 8e19 n/s.
