Motivated by experiments on LBCO-1/8 which suggest that stripe order
co-exists with two-dimensional pairing without inter-layer phase coherence over
an extended range of temperatures, we determine the inter-layer Josephson
coupling in the presence of stripe order. We employ a mean-field description of
bond-centered stripes, with a zero-momentum superconducting condensate and
alternating stripe directions pinned by the low-temperature tetragonal (LTT)
lattice structure. We show that the Fermi-surface reconstruction arising from
strong stripe order can suppress the Josephson coupling between adjacent layers
by more than an order of magnitude.
