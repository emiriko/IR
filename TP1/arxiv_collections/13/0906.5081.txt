The fusion hindrance, which is also denominated by the term extra-push, is
studied on mass-symmetric systems by the use of the liquid drop model with the
two-center parameterization. Following the idea that the fusion hindrance
exists only if the liquid drop barrier (saddle point) is located at the inner
side of the contact point after overcoming the outer Coulomb barrier, the
reactions in which two barriers are overlapped with each other are determined.
It is shown that there are many systems where the fusion hindrance does not
exist for the atomic number of projectile or target nucleus $Z\leq43$, while
for $Z>43$, all of the mass-symmetric reactions are fusion-hindered.
