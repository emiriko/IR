The FIR/submm window is amongst the least explored spectral regions of the
electromagnetic spectrum. It is, however, a key to study the general properties
of the interstellar medium of galaxies, as it contains important spectral line
diagnostics from the neutral, ionized and molecular ISM. The Herschel Space
Observatory, successfully launched on 14 May 2009, is the first observatory to
cover the entire FIR/submm range between 57 and 672 mum. We discuss the main
results from the ISO era on FIR spectroscopy of galaxies and the enormous
science potential of the Herschel mission through a presentation of its
spectroscopic extragalactic key programs.
