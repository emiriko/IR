In this paper we determine the fusion rules of the logarithmic
${\calW}_{p,q}$ triplet theory and construct the Grothendieck group with
subgroups for which consistent product structures can be defined. The fusion
rules are then used to determine projective covers. This allows us also to
write down a candidate for a modular invariant partition function. Our results
demonstrate that recent work on the ${\cal W}_{2,3}$ model generalises
naturally to arbitrary (p,q).
