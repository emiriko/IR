Resonant magnetic x-ray diffraction experiments were carried out on the
stacked triangular lattice antiferromagnet GdPd2Al3. The experiments revealed
an expected initial collinear c-axis order at TN1 followed by an additional
in-plane order at TN2, while at the same time we found that the ground state is
a helically ordered state of a very long incommensurate period of approximately
700A. The distribution of K-domains was highly anisotropic, and the domain with
the modulation vector normal to the surface of the crystal was ascendant.
Low-field magnetization is discussed on the basis of the observed
incommensurate magnetic structure.
