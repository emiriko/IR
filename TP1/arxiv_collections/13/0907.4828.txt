The transverse momentum spectra, yields, and ratios of charged pions,
protons, and antiprotons have been studied up to 5 GeV/c in $p_T$ in 5
different centrality classes in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV.
These results are compared and contrasted with the observables calculated in
recombination models of hadronization. They are also used to examine the color
charge dependence of parton energy loss in the medium.
