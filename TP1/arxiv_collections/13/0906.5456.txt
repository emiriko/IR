We study numerically a Ginzburg-Landau type equation for micelles in two
dimensions. The domain size and the interface length of a cellular structure
are controlled by two feedback terms. The deformation and the successive
splitting of the cellular structure are observed when the controlled interface
length is increased. The splitting instability is further investigated using
coupled mode equations to understand the bifurcation structure.
