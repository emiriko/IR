Full jet reconstruction has traditionally been thought to be difficult in
heavy ion events due to large multiplicity backgrounds. The search for new
physics in high luminosity p+p collisions at the LHC similarly requires the
precise measurement of jets over large backgrounds caused by pile up; this has
motivated the development of a new generation of jet reconstruction algorithms
which are also applicable in the heavy ion environment. We review the latest
results on jet-medium interactions as seen in A+A collisions at RHIC, focusing
on the new techniques for full jet reconstruction.
