We study the effects of dark matter annihilation during and after the cosmic
recombination epoch on the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, taking into
account the detailed energy deposition of the annihilation products. It is
found that a fairly stringent constraint on the annihilation cross section is
imposed for TeV scale dark matter masses from WMAP observations.
