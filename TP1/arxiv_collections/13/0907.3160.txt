Many biological channels perform highly selective transport without direct
input of metabolic energy and without transitions from a 'closed' to an 'open'
state during transport. Mechanisms of selectivity of such channels serve as an
inspiration for creation of artificial nano-molecular sorting devices and
bio-sensors. To elucidate the transport mechanisms, it is important to
understand the transport on the single molecule level in the experimentally
relevant regime when multiple particles are crowded in the channel. In this
paper we analyze the effects of inter-particle crowding on the non-equilibrium
transport times through a finite-length channel by means of analytical theory
and computer simulations.
