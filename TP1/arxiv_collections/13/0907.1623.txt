We give an O(sqrt n log n)-query quantum algorithm for evaluating size-n
AND-OR formulas. Its running time is poly-logarithmically greater after
efficient preprocessing. Unlike previous approaches, the algorithm is based on
a quantum walk on a graph that is not a tree. Instead, the algorithm is based
on a hybrid of direct-sum span program composition, which generates tree-like
graphs, and a novel tensor-product span program composition method, which
generates graphs with vertices corresponding to minimal zero-certificates.
  For comparison, by the general adversary bound, the quantum query complexity
for evaluating a size-n read-once AND-OR formula is at least Omega(sqrt n), and
at most O(sqrt{n} log n / log log n). However, this algorithm is not
necessarily time efficient; the number of elementary quantum gates applied
between input queries could be much larger. Ambainis et al. have given a
quantum algorithm that uses sqrt{n} 2^{O(sqrt{log n})} queries, with a
poly-logarithmically greater running time.
