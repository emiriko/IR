The transport properties of an ac-driving quantum dot in the Kondo regime are
studied by the Floquet-Green's function method with slave-boson infinite-$U$
noncrossing approximation. Our results show that the Kondo peak of the local
density of states is robust against weak ac gate modulation. Significant
suppression of the Kondo peak can be observed when the ac gate field becomes
strong. The photon-assisted noise of Kondo resonance as a function of dc
voltage does not show singularities which are expected for noninteracting
resonant quantum dot. These findings suggest that one may make use of the
photon-assisted noise measurement to tell apart whether the resonant transport
is via noninteracting resonance or strongly-correlated Kondo resonance.
