Using the binary tetrahedral group $T^{'}$, the three angles and phase of the
quark CKM mixing matrix are pursued by symmetry-breaking which involves
$T^{'}$-doublet VEVs and the Chen-Mahanthappa CP-violation mechanism. The
NMRT$^{'}$M, Next-to-Minimal-Renormalizable -T$^{'}$-Model is described, and
its one parameter comparison to experimental data is explored.
