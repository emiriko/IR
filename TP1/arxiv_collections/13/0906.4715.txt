We study the one-loop contribution of the down-type quark of the standard
model-like fourth generation (b') on the top quark electric dipole moment.
Using the known limits on the top quark electric dipole moments, we place
limits on the b' mass. Then, from the estimated ratio for the masses of the
fourth generation of quarks from other studies and the achieved bound from top
quark electric dipole moments on mb', we obtain a limit for the up-type quark
of fourth generation (t') mass.
