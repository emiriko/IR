This paper describes an agent-based model of a finite group of agents in a
single population who each choose which convention to advocate, and which
convention to practice. Influences or dependencies in agents choice exists in
the form of guru effects and what others practice. With payoffs being dependent
on cumulative rewards or actual standings in society, we illustrate the
evolutionary dynamics of the phase structure of each group in the population
via simulations.
