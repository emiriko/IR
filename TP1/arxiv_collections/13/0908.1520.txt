Group theoretical factors from GUT symmetry breaking can lead to predictions
for the ratios of quark and lepton masses at the unification scale. Due to
supersymmetric (SUSY) threshold corrections the viability of such predictions
can depend strongly on the SUSY parameters. We derive possible new predictions
for the GUT scale ratios m_\mu/m_s, y_\tau/y_b and y_t/y_b and compare them
with the experimentally allowed ranges for three common SUSY breaking
scenarios.
