An extensive non-LTE abundance analysis based on Na I 5890/5896 doublet lines
was carried out for a large unbiased sample of ~120 A-type main-sequence stars
(including 23 Hyades stars) covering a wide v_e sin i range of ~10--300 km/s,
with an aim to examine whether the Na abundances in such A dwarfs can be
reliably established from these strong Na I D lines. The resulting abundances
([Na/H]_{58}), which were obtained by applying the T_eff-dependent
microturbulent velocities of \xi ~2--4 km/s with a peak at T_eff ~ 8000 K
(typical for A stars), turned out generally negative with a large diversity
(from ~-1 to ~0), while showing a sign of v_e sin i-dependence (decreasing
toward higher rotation). However, the reality of this apparently subsolar trend
is very questionable, since these [Na/H]_{58} are systematically lower by
~0.3--0.6 dex than more reliable [Na/H]_{61} (derived from weak Na I 6154/6161
lines for sharp-line stars). Considering the large \xi-sensitivity of the
abundances derived from these saturated Na I D lines, we regard that
[Na/H]_{58} must have been erroneously underestimated, suspecting that the
conventional \xi values are improperly too large at least for such strong
high-forming Na I 5890/5896 lines, presumably due to the depth-dependence of
\xi decreasing with height. The nature of atmospheric turbulent velocity field
in mid-to-late A stars would have to be more investigated before we can
determine reliable sodium abundances from these strong resonance D lines.
