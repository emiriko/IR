The exclusive production pp->pXp is known to be one of the most clean
channels at the LHC. We investigate the potential of processes pp -> p l-l+ p
and pp-> p gamma gamma p to probe scalar and tensor unparticles by considering
three different forward detector acceptances; 0.0015<xi<0.15, 0.0015<xi<0.5 and
0.1<xi<0.5. We obtain 95% confidence level sensitivity limits on the unparticle
couplings for various integrated luminosities.
