The spin polarized p_x + ip_y superconductor is known to support Majorana
states but so far there has been no example. We propose a simple setup to
create such a state by depositing a ferromagnetic metal on a
non-centrosymmetric superconductor with strong spin-orbit coupling which
contains a Rashba-type term.
