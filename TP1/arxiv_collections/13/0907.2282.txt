A method is proposed to design arbitrary shaped two dimensional (2D)
isotropic-inertia acoustic cloaks without singularity. The method is based on
the deformation view of the transformation method, where the transformation
tensor A is identified as the deformation gradient tensor and the transformed
material parameters can be expressed by the principal stretches in the
principal system of the deformation. The infinite material parameters of a
perfect 2D cloak is induced by an infinite principal stretch in one direction
while the other two remains finite at the inner boundary during the
transformation. To circumvent this difficulty, for a 2D cloak we can choose the
principal stretch perpendicular to the cloak plane to be also infinite but in
the same order as the infinite principal stretch in the cloak plane during the
transformation, so the transformed material parameters may keep finite. To
illustrate this idea, the analytical expressions of nonsingular material
parameters for a cylindrical acoustic cloak are given. For the acoustic cloaks
with irregular shapes, the numerical method is proposed to evaluate the
principal stretches and in turn the nonsingular material parameters. The
designed 2D cloaks are validated by numerical simulation.
