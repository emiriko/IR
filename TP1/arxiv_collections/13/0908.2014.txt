The infinite series of logarithmic minimal models LM(1,p) is considered in
the W-extended picture where they are denoted by WLM(1,p). As in the rational
models, the fusion algebra of WLM(1,p) is described by a simple graph fusion
algebra. The corresponding fusion matrices are mutually commuting, but in
general not diagonalizable. Nevertheless, they can be simultaneously brought to
Jordan form by a similarity transformation. The spectral decomposition of the
fusion matrices is completed by a set of refined similarity matrices converting
the fusion matrices into Jordan canonical form consisting of Jordan blocks of
rank 1, 2 or 3. The various similarity transformations and Jordan forms are
determined from the modular data. This gives rise to a generalized Verlinde
formula for the fusion matrices. Its relation to the partition functions in the
model is discussed in a general framework. By application of a particular
structure matrix and its Moore-Penrose inverse, this Verlinde formula reduces
to the generalized Verlinde formula for the associated Grothendieck ring.
