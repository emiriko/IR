Context. Cool star model atmospheres are a common tool for the investigation
of stellar masses, ages and elemental abundance composition. Theoretical
atmospheric models strongly depend on the atomic data used when calculating
them. Aims. We present the changes in flux and temperature stratification when
changing from iron data computed by R.L. Kurucz in the mid 90s to the Kurucz
2009 iron computations. Methods. MAFAGS-OS opacity sampling atmospheres were
recomputed with Kurucz 2009 iron atomic data as implemented in the VALD
database by Ryabchikova. Temperature stratification and emergent flux
distribution of the new version, called MAFAGS-OS9, is compared to the former
version and to solar flux measurements. Results. Using the Kurucz line lists
converted into the VALD format and new bound-free opacities for Mg i and Al i
leads to changes in the solar temperature stratification by not more than 28 K.
At the same time, the calculated solar flux distribution shows significantly
better agreement between observations and theoretical solar models. These
changes in the temperature stratification of the corresponding models are
small, but nevertheless of a magnitude that affects stellar parameter
determinations and abundance analysis.
