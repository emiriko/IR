In this paper, we compute the first two equivariant heat kernel coefficients
of the Bochner Laplacian on differential forms. The first two equivariant heat
kernel coefficients of the Bochner Laplacian with torsion are also given. We
also study the equivariant heat kernel coefficients of nonmininmal operators on
differential forms and get the equivariant Gilkey-Branson-Fulling formula.
