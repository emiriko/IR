We have developed a self-consistent-field technique similar to the one
described by Hachisu, Eriguchi, & Nomoto (1986b) that can be used to construct
detailed force-balanced models of synchronously rotating, double white dwarf
(DWD) binaries that have a wide range of total masses, mass ratios, and
separations. In addition to providing a computational tool that can be used to
provide quiet initial starts for dynamical studies of the onset of mass
transfer in DWD systems, we show that this SCF technique can be used to
construct model sequences that mimic the last portion of the detached inspiral
phase of DWD binary evolutions, and semi-detached model sequences that mimic a
phase of conservative mass transfer.
