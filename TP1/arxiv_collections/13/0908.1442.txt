MiniBooNE and K2K collaborations have recently reported the ratio for the
$\nu_\mu$ induced charge current 1$\pi^+$ production cross section to the
charged current induced quasielastic lepton production cross section i.e.
$R(E)=\frac{\sigma^{CC1\pi^+}}{\sigma^{CCQE}}$. In this paper we study,
theoretically, in a local density approximation the effect of nuclear medium in
charged current quasielastic(CCQE) and charged current one pion
production(CC1$\pi^+$) processes for the $\nu_\mu$ induced reaction in nuclei.
The theoretical results have been compared with the results of experimental
observations by the MiniBooNE and K2K collaborations. The ratio R(E) for
$\nu_\mu$ induced reaction in water for the proposed T2K experiment is also
presented.
