The physics and the technical algorithms of the statistical de-excitation
code ABLA07 are documented. The new developments of ABLA07 have been guided by
the empirical knowledge obtained in a recent experimental campaign on the
nuclide distributions measured at GSI, Darmstadt. Besides distinct signatures
of very asymmetric binary splits, lighter systems show clear features of
multifragmentation, while heavy systems reveal the influence of dynamics and
microscopic structure on the fission process. ABLA07 includes elaborate but
efficient descriptions of all these processes, with one set of the model
parameters fixed for all systems and all energies.
