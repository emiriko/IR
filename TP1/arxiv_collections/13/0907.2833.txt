Given oracle access to an unknown unitary C from the Clifford group and its
conjugate, we give an exact algorithm for identifying C with O(n) queries,
which we prove is optimal. We then extend this to all levels of the
Gottesman-Chuang hierarchy (also known as the C_k hierarchy). Further, for
unitaries not in the hierarchy itself but known to be close to an element of
the hierarchy, we give a method of finding this close element. We also present
a Clifford testing algorithm that decides whether a given black-box unitary is
close to a Clifford or far from every Clifford.
