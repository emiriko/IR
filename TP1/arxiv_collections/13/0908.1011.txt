Motivated by recent experiments on nonlocal transport through multiterminal
superconducting hybrid structures, we present self-consistent calculations
based on quasiclassical Green's functions for the order parameter, currents and
voltages in a system consisting of a diffusive superconductor connected to two
normal and one superconducting electrodes. We investigate non-equilibrium
effects for different biasing conditions corresponding to measurements of the
nonlocal conductance and of the nonlocal resistance. It is shown that while the
nonlocal conductance does not change its sign, this change might be observed in
a nonlocal resistance measurement for certain parameter range. The change of
sign of the nonlocal signal takes places at a voltage of the order of the
self-consistent gap of the superconducting region. We show that this is not
related to the nonlocal Andreev processes but rather to non-equilibrium
effects. We finally discuss the case of four terminal measurements and
demonstrate that a change of sign in the nonlocal resistance appears when the
current injected into the superconductor exceeds a critical value. The
connection to the existing experiments is discussed.
