The paper presents a theory of shear-generated turbulence at asymptotically
high Reynolds numbers. It is based on an ensemble of dipole vortex tubes taken
as quasi-particles and realized in form of rings, hairpins or filament couples
of potentially finite length. In a not necesserily planar cross sectional area
through a vortex tangle, taken locally orthogonal through each individual tube,
the dipoles are moving with the classical dipole velocity. The vortex radius is
directly related with Prandtl's classical mixing length. The quasi-particles
perform dipol chaos which reminds of molecular chaos in real gases. Collisions
between quasi-particles lead either to particle annihilation (turbulent
dissipation) or to particle scattering (turbulent diffusion). These ideas
suffice to develop a closed theory of shear-generated turbulence without
empirical parameters, with analogies to birth and death processes of
macromolecules. It coincides almost perfectly with the well-known K-Omega
turbulence closure applied in many branches of science and technology. In the
case of free homogeneous decay the TKE is shown to follow 1/t. For an adiabatic
condition at a solid wall the theory predicts a logarithmic mean-flow boundary
layer with von Karman's constant as 1/SQRT(2 pi)=0.399.
