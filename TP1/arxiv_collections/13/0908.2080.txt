In this paper the Hamiltonian of quantum electrodynamics with spatial cutoffs
is investigated. We define a scaled total Hamiltonian and consider its
asymptotic behavior. In the main theorem, it is shown that the scaled total
Hamiltonian converges to a self-adjoint operator in the strong resolvent sense,
and effective potentials are derived.
