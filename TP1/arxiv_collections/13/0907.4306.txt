In this thesis we investigate finite size effects in 1+1 dimensional
integrable QFT. In particular we consider matrix elements of local operators
(finite volume form factors) and vacuum expectation values and correlation
functions at finite temperature. In the first part of the thesis we give a
complete description of the finite volume form factors in terms of the infinite
volume form factors (solutions of the bootstrap program) and the S-matrix of
the theory. The calculations are correct to all orders in the inverse of the
volume, only exponentially decaying (residual) finite size effects are
neglected. We also consider matrix elements with disconnected pieces and
determine the general rule for evaluating such contributions in a finite
volume. The analytic results are tested against numerical data obtained by the
truncated conformal space approach in the Lee-Yang model and the Ising model in
a magnetic field. In a separate section we also evaluate the leading
exponential correction (the $\mu$-term) associated to multi-particle energies
and matrix elements. In the second part of the thesis we show that finite
volume factors can be used to derive a systematic low-temperature expansion for
correlation functions at finite temperature. In the case of vacuum expectation
values the series is worked out up to the third non-trivial order and a
complete agreement with the LeClair-Mussardo formula is observed. A preliminary
treatment of the two-point function is also given by considering the first
nontrivial contributions.
