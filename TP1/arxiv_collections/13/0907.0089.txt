We introduce new polynomial invariants of a finite-dimensional semisimple and
cosemisimple Hopf algebra A over a field by using the braiding structures of A.
We investigate basic properties of the polynomial invariants including
stability under extension of the base field. Furthermore, we show that our
polynomial invariants are indeed tensor invariants of the representation
category of A, and recognize the difference of the representation category and
the representation ring of A. Actually, by computing and comparing polynomial
invariants, we find new examples of pairs of Hopf algebras whose representation
rings are isomorphic, but representation categories are distinct.
