We investigate the coherent transport of a single photon in coupled
semiconductor microcavity waveguide,which can be controlled by in-plane
excitons in quantum well embedded in the antinode of the electromagnetic field
in one of the cavities. The reflection coefficient and transmissivity for the
single photon propagating in this semiconductor waveguide are obtained. It is
shown that the effect of the excitons decay plays an important role in the
transport properties of the single photon in this microcavity waveguide if we
refer to real systems.
