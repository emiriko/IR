We propose a set of interferometric methods on how to detect Majorana bound
states induced by a topological insulator. The existence of these states can be
easily determined by the conductance oscillations as function of magnetic flux
and/or electric voltage. We study the system in the presence and absence of
Majorana bound states and observe strikingly different behaviors. Importantly,
we show that the presence of coupled Majorana bound states can induce a
persistent current in absence of any external magnetic field.
