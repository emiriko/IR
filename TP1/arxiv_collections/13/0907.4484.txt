The equations connecting elements of the Yukawa matrix to elements of the
active neutrino mass matrix in the \nu MSM theory (an extension of the Standard
Model by a singlet of three right-handed neutrinos) was analyzed, and explicit
relations for the ratio of the Yukawa matrix elements through elements of the
active neutrino mass matrix were obtained. This relation can be used for
getting more accurate constraints on the model parameters. Particularly, with
the help of the obtained results we investigated CP-violating phase in the \nu
MSM theory. We demonstrate that even in the case when elements of the active
neutrino mass matrix are real the baryon asymmetry can be generated also.
