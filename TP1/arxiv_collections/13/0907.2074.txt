We develop a theoretical basis for understanding the spin relaxation
processes in Kondo lattice systems with heavy fermions as experimentally
observed by electron spin resonance (ESR). The Kondo effect leads to a common
energy scale that regulates a logarithmic divergence of different spin kinetic
coefficients and supports a collective spin motion of the Kondo ions with
conduction electrons. We find that the relaxation rate of a collective spin
mode is greatly reduced due to a mutual cancelation of all the divergent
contributions even in the case of the strongly anisotropic Kondo interaction.
The contribution to the ESR linewidth caused by the local magnetic field
distribution is subject to motional narrowing supported by ferromagnetic
correlations. The developed theoretical model successfully explains the ESR
data of YbRh2Si2 in terms of their dependence on temperature and magnetic
field.
