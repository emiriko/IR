Recently Horava proposed a renormalizable gravity theory with higher spatial
derivatives in four dimensions which reduces to Einstein gravity with a
non-vanishing cosmological constant in IR but with improved UV behaviors. Here,
I consider a non-trivial test of the new gravity theory in FRW universe by
considering an IR modification which breaks "softly" the detailed balance
condition in the original Horava model. I separate the dark energy parts from
the usual Einstein gravity parts in the Friedman equations and obtain the
formula of the equations of state parameter. The IR modified Horava gravity
seems to be consistent with the current observational data but we need some
more refined data sets to see whether the theory is really consistent with our
universe. From the consistency of our theory, I obtain some constraints on the
allowed values of w_0 and w_a in the Chevallier, Polarski, and Linder's
parametrization and this may be tested in the near future, by sharpening the
data sets.
