Given a chaotic dynamical system and a time interval in which some quantity
takes an unusually large average value, what can we say of the trajectory that
yields this deviation? As an example, we study the trajectories of the
archetypical chaotic system, the baker's map. We show that, out of all
irregular trajectories, a large-deviation requirement selects (isolated) orbits
that are periodic or quasiperiodic. We discuss what the relevance of this
calculation may be for dynamical systems and for glasses.
