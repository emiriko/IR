We experimentally study the absorption spectroscopy from a collection of
gaseous $^87 Rb$ atoms at room temperature irradiated with three fields. Two of
these fields are in a pump probe saturation absorption configuration. The third
field co-propagates with the pump field. The three fields address Zeeman
degenerate transitions between hyperfine levels $5S_{1/2}, F = 1$ and
$5P_{3/2}, F = 0$ and also between $5S_{1/2}, F = 1$ and $5P_{3/2}, F =1$
around the D2 line. We find a sub-natural absorption resonance in the
counter-propagating probe field. The novel feature of this absorption is its
abrupt onset in the vicinity of $5P_{3/2}, F = 0$, as the laser frequency is
scanned from $5P_{3/2}, F = 0$ to $5P_{3/2}, F =1$. The experimental results
are compared with the theory modeled after a four level system. There is a
qualitative agreement between our theory and experiment. We find the threshold
absorption to be a result of the off-resonant interaction of the strong field
with nearby hyperfine levels.
