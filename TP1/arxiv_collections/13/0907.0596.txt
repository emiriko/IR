We present preliminary results for estimation of barium ([Ba/Fe]) and
strontium ([Sr/Fe]) abundances ratios using medium-resolution spectra (1-2
{\AA}). We established a calibration between the abundance ratios and line
indices for Ba and Sr, using multiple regression and artificial neural network
techniques. A comparison between the two techniques (showing the advantage of
the latter), as well as a discussion of future work, is presented.
