We study lattice SU(2) Yang-Mills theory with dimension $d\ge 4$. The model
can be expressed as a $(d-1)$-dimensional O(4) non-linear $\sigma$-model in a
$d$-dimensional heat bath. As is well known, the non-linear $\sigma$-model
alone shows a phase transition. If the quark confinement is a consequence of
absence of a phase transition for the Yang-Mills theory, then the fluctuations
of the heat bath must destroy the long-range order of the non-linear
$\sigma$-model. In order to clarify whether this is true, we replace the
fluctuations of the heat bath with Gaussian random variables, and obtain a
Langevin equation which yields the effective action of the non-linear
$\sigma$-model through analyzing the Fokker-Planck equation. It turns out that
the fluctuations indeed destroy the long-range order of the non-linear
$\sigma$-model within a mean field approximation estimating a critical point,
whereas for the corresponding U(1) gauge theory, the phase transition to the
massless phase remains against the fluctuations.
