We present new solutions to the strong explosion problem in a non-power law
density profile. The unperturbed self-similar solutions discovered by Waxman &
Shvarts describe strong Newtonian shocks propagating into a cold gas with a
density profile falling off as $r^{-\omega}$, where $\omega>3$ (Type-II
solutions). The perturbations we consider are spherically symmetric and
log-periodic with respect to the radius. While the unperturbed solutions are
continuously self-similar, the log-periodicity of the density perturbations
leads to a discrete self-similarity of the perturbations, i.e. the solution
repeats itself up to a scaling at discrete time intervals. We discuss these
solutions and verify them against numerical integrations of the time dependent
hydrodynamic equations. Finally we show that this method can be generalized to
treat any small, spherically symmetric density perturbation by employing
Fourier decomposition.
