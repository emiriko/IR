In this paper we present a modeling methodology for BPMN, the standard
notation for the representation of business processes. Our methodology
simplifies the development of collaborative BPMN diagrams, enabling the
automated creation of skeleton process diagrams representing complex
choreographies. To evaluate and tune the methodology, we have developed a tool
supporting it, that we apply to the modeling of an international patenting
process as a working example.
