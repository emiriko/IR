Valence band photoemission with photon energies around the Mn2p excitation
threshold has been used to study the development of nanowires catalyzed by MnAs
particles. A gradual change in the spectra with increasing nanowire length is
observed, such that the resonant photoemission eventually dominates over the
Auger decay channel. The change is ascribed to dilution of Mn, showing that Mn
is transferred from the MnAs particles into the nanowires.
