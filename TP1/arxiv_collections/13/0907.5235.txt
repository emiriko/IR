More than 35 million high-energy muons collected with the MACRO detector at
the underground Gran Sasso Laboratory have been used to search for flux
variations of different nature. Two kinds of studies were carried out: a search
for the occurrence of clusters of events and a search for periodic variations.
Different analysis methods, including the Scan Statistics test and the
Lomb-Scargle spectral analysis have been applied to the data.
