We search for new variable B-type pulsators in the CoRoT data assembled
primarily for planet detection, as part of CoRoT's Additional Programme. We aim
to explore the properties of newly discovered B-type pulsators from the
uninterrupted CoRoT space-based photometry and to compare them with known
members of the Beta Cep and slowly pulsating B star (SPB) classes. We developed
automated data analysis tools that include algorithms for jump correction,
light-curve detrending, frequency detection, frequency combination search, and
for frequency and period spacing searches. Besides numerous new, classical,
slowly pulsating B stars, we find evidence for a new class of low-amplitude
B-type pulsators between the SPB and Delta Sct instability strips, with a very
broad range of frequencies and low amplitudes, as well as several slowly
pulsating B stars with residual excess power at frequencies typically a factor
three above their expected g-mode frequencies. The frequency data we obtained
for numerous new B-type pulsators represent an appropriate starting point for
further theoretical analyses of these stars, once their effective temperature,
gravity, rotation velocity, and abundances will be derived spectroscopically in
the framework of an ongoing FLAMES survey at the VLT.
