In this article, we study the finite temperature Casimir effect for scalar
field with Robin boundary conditions on two parallel plates in a background
spacetime that has a compact internal manifold with arbitrary geometry. The
finite temperature Casimir force acting on the plates is derived using the
piston approach, with which we show that the divergences of the Casimir forces
from the region between the plates and the region outside the plates cancel
each other. The nature and asymptotic behaviors of the Casimir force at
different limits such as small and large plate separation, low and high
temperature, are studied in detail. The range of Robin coefficients where the
Casimir force are always attractive or always repulsive are determined. There
are also some range of the Robin coefficients where the Casimir force is shown
to be attractive at small plate separation and repulsive at large plate
separation, or vise versa.
