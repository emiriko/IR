We describe a spheroidal fluid shell between two Kerr vacuum regions which
have opposite rotation parameters. The shell has a stiff equation of state and
a heat flow vector related to the rotational Killing current. The shell
description is useful in exploring the significance of counter-rotation in Kerr
metric matches.
