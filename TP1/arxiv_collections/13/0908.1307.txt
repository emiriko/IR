We give an effective estimate for the totally ramified value number of the
hyperbolic Gauss maps of complete flat fronts in the hyperbolic three-space. As
a corollary, we give the upper bound of the number of exceptional values of
them for some topological cases. Moreover, we obtain some new examples for this
class.
