General Probabilistic Theories provide the most general mathematical
framework for the theory of probability in an operationally natural manner, and
generalize classical and quantum theories. In this article, we study
state-discrimination problems in general probabilistic theories using a
Bayesian strategy. After re-formulation of the theories with mathematical
rigor, we first prove that an optimal observable to discriminate any (finite)
number of states always exists in the most general setting. Next, we revisit
our recently proposed geometric approach for the problem and show that, for
two-state discrimination, this approach is indeed effective in arbitrary
dimensional cases. Moreover, our method reveals an operational meaning of
Gudder's ``intrinsic metric'' by means of the optimal success probability,
which turns out to be a generalization of the trace distance for quantum
systems. As its by-product, an information-disturbance theorem in general
probabilistic theories is derived, generalizing its well known quantum version.
