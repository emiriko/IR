A famous open problem in the theory of quantum error-correcting codes is
whether or not the parameters of an impure quantum code can violate the quantum
Hamming bound for pure quantum codes. We partially solve this problem. We
demonstrate that there exists a threshold such that an arbitrary quantum code
must obey the quantum Hamming bound whenever . We list some values of for small
d and binary quantum codes.
