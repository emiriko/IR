Properties of the charmonium-like state X(3872) are investigated and its
nature is discussed as based on the existing experimental data. In particular,
we analyse the new data from Belle and BaBar Collaborations and argue that,
while the BaBar data prefer the dynamically generated virtual state in the
D\bar{D}* system, the new Belle data clearly indicate a sizable c\bar{c} 2^3P_1
component in the X wave function.
