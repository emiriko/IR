We analyse the influence of entanglement on the emission properties of atoms.
To this end, first, we propose a scheme for the preparation of a pair of
entangled Helium atoms, one in the ortho and the other in the para spin
configuration. We discuss a realistic scenario for this process, based in the
double ionization of He by intense laser fields. These states are used to
analyse disentanglement and the role of entanglement in the spontaneous
emission from the pair. In particular, we show that the decaying rate of an
entangled atom is different from that in a product state, modifying the
temporal emission distribution and lifetime of the atoms.
