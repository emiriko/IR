We have completed a numerical investigation of the Anderson-Hubbard model for
three-dimensional simple cubic lattices using a real-space self-consistent
Hartree-Fock decoupling approximation for the Hubbard interaction. In this
formulation we treat the spatial disorder exactly, and therefore we account for
effects arising from localization physics. We have examined the model for
electronic densities well away 1/2 filling, thereby avoiding the physics of a
Mott insulator. Several recent studies have made clear that the combined
effects of electronic interactions and spatial disorder can give rise to a
suppression of the electronic density of states, and a subsequent
metal-insulator transition can occur. We augment such studies by calculating
the ac conductivity for such systems. Our numerical results show that weak
interactions enhance the density of states at the Fermi level and the
low-frequency conductivity, there are no local magnetic moments, and the ac
conductivity is Drude-like. However, with a large enough disorder strength and
larger interactions the density of states at the Fermi level and the
low-frequency conductivity are both suppressed, the conductivity becomes
non-Drude-like, and these phenomena are accompanied by the presence of local
magnetic moments. The low-frequency conductivity changes from a sigma-sigma_dc
omega^{1/2} behaviour in the metallic phase, to a sigma omega^2 behaviour in
the nonmetallic regime. Our numerical results show that the formation of
magnetic moments is essential to the suppression of the density of states at
the Fermi level, and therefore essential to the metal-insulator transition.
