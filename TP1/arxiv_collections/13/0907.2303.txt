We propose a novel approach for efficient tuning of the transmission
characteristics of metamaterials through a continuous adjustment of the lattice
structure, and confirm it experimentally in the microwave range. The concept is
rather general and applicable to various metamaterials as long as the effective
medium description is valid. The demonstrated continuous tuning of metamaterial
response is highly desirable for a number of emerging applications of
metamaterials including sensors, filters, switches, realizable in a wide
frequency range.
