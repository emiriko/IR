We have conducted a triple-scale simulation of liquid water by concurrently
coupling atomistic, mesoscopic, and continuum models of the liquid. The
presented triple-scale hydrodynamic solver for molecular liquids enables the
insertion of large molecules into the atomistic domain through a mesoscopic
region. We show that the triple-scale scheme is robust against the details of
the mesoscopic model owing to the conservation of linear momentum by the
adaptive resolution forces. Our multiscale approach is designed for molecular
simulations of open domains with relatively large molecules, either in the
grand canonical ensemble or under non-equilibrium conditions.
