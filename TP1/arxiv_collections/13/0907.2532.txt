We show that the integration constant in the vacuum Schwarzschild solution
has the unique value, alpha_0=0, accordingly Black Holes too have the same
unique value of mass M0=0. Therefore the so-called Black Holes Candidates (BHC)
cannot be true BHs. It is also shown that continued collapse of sufficiently
massive bodies would generate radiation pressure and energy dominated
quasistatic objects having surface gravitational redshifts z>>1. Under the
assumption of baryon number conservation, such objects would take infinite time
to collapse to the idealized BH state with M=0 and z=infty. The local
temperature of such a stellar mass Eternally Collapsing Object (ECO) would be
above Quark Gluon Phase transition. ECOs would undergo intermittent violent
radiative eruptions and pollute the interstellar medium with freshly made
hydrogen out of their QGP and also the light elements cooked in their envelope.
It is shown that the extremely redshifted observed temperature of an ECO could
be 2.75 K and superposition of ECO background radiation might generate the
microwave back ground radiation. The predicted 2.75 K luminosity for the
galactic centre ECO, i.e., Sgr A*, L~3x1036 erg/s, nicely matches with the
corresponding estimate by Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP).
