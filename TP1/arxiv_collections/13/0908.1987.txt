Recent quantum Hall experiments conducted on disordered graphene pn junction
provide evidence that the junction resistance could be described by a simple
Ohmic sum of the n and p mediums' resistances. However in the ballistic limit,
theory predicts the existence of chirality-dependent quantum Hall plateaus in a
pn junction. We show that two distinctively separate processes are required for
this ballistic-Ohmic plateau transition, namely (i) hole/electron Landau states
equilibration and (ii) valley iso-spin dilution of the incident Landau edge
state. These conclusions are obtained by a simple scattering theory argument,
and confirmed numerically by performing ensembles of quantum magneto-transport
calculations on a 0.1um-wide disordered graphene pn junction within the
tight-binding model. The former process is achieved by pn interface roughness,
where a pn interface disorder with a root-mean-square roughness of 10nm was
found to suffice under typical experimental conditions. The latter process is
mediated by extrinsic edge roughness for an armchair edge ribbon and by
intrinsic localized intervalley scattering centers at the edge of the pn
interface for a zigzag ribbon. In light of these results, we also examine why
higher Ohmic type plateaus are less likely to be observable in experiments.
