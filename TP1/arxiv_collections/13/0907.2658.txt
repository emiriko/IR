Results are presented from a study of the structure of hadronic events in
high-energy e+e- interactions detected by the L3 detector at LEP. Various event
shape distributions and their moments are measured at several energy points at
and above the Z-boson mass. The event flavour is tagged by using the decay
characteristics of b-hadrons. Measurements of distributions of event shape
variables for all hadronic events, for light (u, d, s, c) and heavy (b) quark
flavours are compared to several QCD models with improved leading log
approximation: JETSET, HERWIG and ARIADNE. A good description of the data is
provided by the models.
