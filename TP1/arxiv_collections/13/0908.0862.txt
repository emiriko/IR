The ANTARES Neutrino Telescope is a water Cherenkov detector composed of an
array of approximately 900 photomultiplier tubes in 12 vertical strings, spread
over an area of about 0.1 km^2 with an instrumented height of about 350 metres.
ANTARES, built in the Mediterranean Sea, is the biggest neutrino Telescope
operating in the northern hemisphere. Acoustic sensors (AMADEUS project) have
been integrated into the infrastructure of ANTARES, grouped in small arrays, to
evaluate the feasibility of a future acoustic neutrino telescope in the deep
sea operating in the ultra-high energy regime.
  In this contribution, the basic principles of acoustic neutrino detection
will be presented. The AMADEUS array of acoustic sensors will be described and
the latest results of the project summarized.
