The precise knowledge of the half-life of the reaction product is of crucial
importance for a nuclear reaction cross section measurement carried out with
the activation technique. The cross section of the 151Eu(alpha,n)154Tb reaction
has been measured recently using the activation method, however, the half-life
of the 10 h isomer in 154Tb has a relatively high uncertainty and ambiguous
values can be found in the literature. Therefore, the precise half-life of the
isomeric state has been measured and found to be 9.994 h +- 0.039 h. With
careful analysis of the systematic errors, the uncertainty of this half-life
value has been significantly reduced.
