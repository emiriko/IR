A consistent query answer in an inconsistent database is an answer obtained
in every (minimal) repair. The repairs are obtained by resolving all conflicts
in all possible ways. Often, however, the user is able to provide a preference
on how conflicts should be resolved. We investigate here the framework of
preferred consistent query answers, in which user preferences are used to
narrow down the set of repairs to a set of preferred repairs. We axiomatize
desirable properties of preferred repairs. We present three different families
of preferred repairs and study their mutual relationships. Finally, we
investigate the complexity of preferred repairing and computing preferred
consistent query answers.
