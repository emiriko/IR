The two primary decoding algorithms for Reed-Solomon codes are the
Berlekamp-Massey algorithm and the Sugiyama et al. adaptation of the Euclidean
algorithm, both designed to solve a key equation. In this article an
alternative version of the key equation and a new way to use the Euclidean
algorithm to solve it are presented, which yield the Berlekamp-Massey
algorithm. This results in a new, simpler, and compacter presentation of the
Berlekamp-Massey algorithm.
