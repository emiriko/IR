\emph{Spiroplasma} swimming is studied with a simple model based on
resistive-force theory. Specifically, we consider a bacterium shaped in the
form of a helix that propagates traveling-wave distortions which flip the
handedness of the helical cell body. We treat cell length, pitch angle, kink
velocity, and distance between kinks as parameters and calculate the swimming
velocity that arises due to the distortions. We find that, for a fixed pitch
angle, scaling collapses the swimming velocity (and the swimming efficiency) to
a universal curve that depends only on the ratio of the distance between kinks
to the cell length. Simultaneously optimizing the swimming efficiency with
respect to inter-kink length and pitch angle, we find that the optimal pitch
angle is 35.5$^\circ$ and the optimal inter-kink length ratio is 0.338, values
in good agreement with experimental observations.
