In this work the existence of a global attractor for the solution semiflow of
the coupled two-cell Brusselator model equations is proved. A grouping
estimation method and a new decomposition approach are introduced to deal with
the challenge in proving the absorbing property and the asymptotic compactness
of this type of four-variable reaction-diffusion systems with cubic
autocatalytic nonlinearity and with linear coupling. It is also proved that the
Hausdorff dimension and the fractal dimension of the global attractor are
finite.
