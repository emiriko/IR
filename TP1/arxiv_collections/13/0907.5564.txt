We consider a parametrically driven Klein--Gordon system describing micro-
and nano-devices, with integrated electrical and mechanical functionality.
Using a multiscale expansion method we reduce the system to a discrete
nonlinear Schrodinger equation. Analytical and numerical calculations are
performed to determine the existence and stability of fundamental bright and
dark discrete solitons admitted by the Klein--Gordon system through the
discrete Schrodinger equation. We show that a parametric driving can not only
destabilize onsite bright solitons, but also stabilize intersite bright
discrete solitons and onsite and intersite dark solitons. Most importantly, we
show that there is a range of values of the driving coefficient for which dark
solitons are stable, for any value of the coupling constant, i.e. oscillatory
instabilities are totally suppressed. Stability windows of all the fundamental
solitons are presented and approximations to the onset of instability are
derived using perturbation theory, with accompanying numerical results.
Numerical integrations of the Klein--Gordon equation are performed, confirming
the relevance of our analysis.
