The mechanisms underlying hadronization are not well understood, both in
vacuum and in hot QCD matter. Precise characterization of jet fragmentation to
hadrons in p-p collisions will help elucidate the fundamental process of
hadronization, and will serve as essential reference to measure the
modification of hadronization in heavy ion collisions. We present measurements
of fragmentation functions for unidentified particles in jets produced in p-p
collisions at 200 GeV using the STAR detector at RHIC. The results from
different jet reconstruction algorithms are compared, including variations of
the resolution parameter. It is found that the results are largely insensitive
to details of the jet-finding algorithm at RHIC energies. Particle production
inside and outside of these reconstructed jets will be compared to improve our
understanding of the hadronization mechanisms for soft and hard particles in
p-p events at RHIC energies.
