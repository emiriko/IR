The MAGIC Collaboration has provided new observational data pertaining to the
TeV J2032+4130 gamma-ray source (within the Cygnus OB2 region), for energies
E_gamma >400 GeV. It is then appropriate to update the impact of these data on
gamma-ray production mechanisms in stellar associations. We consider two
mechanisms of gamma-ray emission, pion production and decay (PION) and
photo-excitation of high-energy nuclei followed by prompt photo-emission from
the daughter nuclei (A*). We find that while the data can be accommodated with
either scenario, the A* features a spectral bump, corresponding to the
threshold for exciting the Giant Dipole Resonance, which can serve to
discriminate between them. We comment on neutrino emission and detection from
the region if the PION and/or A* processes are operative. We also touch on the
implications for this analysis of future Fermi and Cerenkov Telescope Array
data.
