If the hemispherical power asymmetry observed in the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) on large angular scales is attributable to a superhorizon
curvaton fluctuation, then the simplest model predicts that the primordial
density fluctuations should be similarly asymmetric on all smaller scales. The
distribution of high-redshift quasars was recently used to constrain the power
asymmetry on scales k ~ 1.5h/Mpc, and the upper bound on the amplitude of the
asymmetry was found to be a factor of six smaller than the amplitude of the
asymmetry in the CMB. We show that it is not possible to generate an asymmetry
with this scale dependence by changing the relative contributions of the
inflaton and curvaton to the adiabatic power spectrum. Instead, we consider
curvaton scenarios in which the curvaton decays after dark matter freezes out,
thus generating isocurvature perturbations. If there is a superhorizon
fluctuation in the curvaton field, then the rms amplitude of these
perturbations will be asymmetric, and the asymmetry will be most apparent on
large angular scales in the CMB. We find that it is only possible to generate
the observed asymmetry in the CMB while satisfying the quasar constraint if the
curvaton's contribution to the total dark matter density is small, but nonzero.
The model also requires that the majority of the primordial power comes from
fluctuations in the inflaton field. Future observations and analyses of the CMB
will test this model because the power asymmetry generated by this model has a
specific spectrum, and the model requires that the current upper bounds on
isocurvature power are nearly saturated.
