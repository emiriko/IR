Spin correlations in the overdoped region of Bi1.75Pb0.35Sr1.90CuO6+z have
been explored with Fe-doped single crystals characterized by neutron
scattering, muon-spin-rotation (muSR) spectroscopy, and magnetic susceptibility
measurements. Static incommensurate spin correlations induced by the Fe spins
are revealed by elastic neutron scattering. The resultant incommensurability
delta is unexpectedly large (~0.2 r.l.u.), as compared with delta ~ 1/8 in
overdoped superconductor La2-xSrxCuO4. Intriguingly, the large delta in this
overdoped region is close to the hole concentration p. This result is
reminiscent of the delta ~ p trend observed in underdoped La2-xSrxCuO4;
however, it is inconsistent with the saturation of delta in the latter compound
in the overdoped regime. While our findings in Fe-doped
Bi1.75Pb0.35Sr1.90CuO6+z support the commonality of incommensurate spin
correlations in high-Tc cuprate superconductors, they also suggest that the
magnetic response might be dominated by a distinct mechanism in the overdoped
region.
