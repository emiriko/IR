The design of business processes involves the usage of modeling languages,
tools and methodologies. In this paper we highlight and address a relevant
limitation of the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN): its weak data
representation capabilities. In particular, we extend it with data-specific
constructs derived from existing data modeling notations and adapted to blend
gracefully into BPMN diagrams. The extension has been developed taking existing
modeling languages and requirement analyses into account: we characterize our
notation using the Workfl ow Data Patterns and provide mappings to the main
XML-based business process languages.
