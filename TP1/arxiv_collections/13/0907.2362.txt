We compute fully differential next-to-leading order QCD cross-sections for
Higgs boson production via gluon fusion in the Standard Model. We maintain the
full dependence of the cross-sections on the top and bottom quark mass. We find
that finite quark mass effects are important given the achieved precision of
QCD predictions for gluon fusion. Our Monte-Carlo program, HPro, can correct
existing NNLO fully differential calculations, which employ the approximation
of an infinitely heavy top and a vanishing bottom quark Yukawa coupling, for
heavy quark finite mass effects through NLO.
