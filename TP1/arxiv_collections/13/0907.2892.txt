This PhD deals with the notion of pseudo algebraically closed (PAC)
extensions of fields. It develops a group-theoretic machinery, based on a
generalization of embedding problems, to study these extensions. Perhaps the
main result is that although there are many PAC extensions, the Galois closure
of a proper PAC extension is separably closed.
  The dissertation also contains the following subjects. The group theoretical
counterpart of pseudo algebraically closed extensions, the so-called projective
pairs. Applications to seemingly unrelated subjects, e.g., an analog of
Dirichlet's theorem about primes in arithmetic progression for polynomial rings
in one variable over infinite fields.
