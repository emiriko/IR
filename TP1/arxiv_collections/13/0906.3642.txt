In the half-space $\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}_+$, we consider the
Hermite-Schr\"odinger equation $i\partial u/\partial t = - \Delta u + |x|^2 u$,
with given boundary values on $\mathbb{R}^d$.
  We prove a formula that links the solution of this problem to that of the
classical Schr\"odinger equation. It shows that mixed norm estimates for the
Hermite-Schr\"odinger equation can be obtained immediately from those known in
the classical case. In one space dimension, we deduce sharp pointwise
convergence results at the boundary, by means of this link.
