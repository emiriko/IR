In this paper we generalize to higher dimensions several types of fermion
actions on the hyperdiamond lattice including a two-parameter class of
minimal-doubling fermions "Creutz fermion" and a simple fermion with sufficient
discrete symmetry "BBTW fermion". Then it is shown that they possess some
properties in common with the four-dimensional case: BBTW fermions in higher
even dimensions inevitably yield unphysical degrees of freedom. Creutz fermions
are defined on the distorted lattices, and they lose the high discrete symmetry
of the original lattices. We also find properties specific to the
higher-dimensional cases. The parameter range for Creutz action to yield
minimal-doubling and physical fermions becomes narrower with the dimension
getting higher, thus it becomes more and more difficult to realize
minimal-doubling. In addition, we generalize the subspecies of Creutz and BBTW
actions including a new class of minimal-doubling actions "Appended Creutz
action".
