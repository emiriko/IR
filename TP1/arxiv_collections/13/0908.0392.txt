JEM-EUSO is a mission to study ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) by
measuring the fluorescence light from giant air showers at the altitude of the
International Space Station. In the tilted mode, JEM-EUSO will become very
sensitive to the \v{C}erenkov light from the earth skimming tau neutrinos at
the energy range of $10^{16-18}$eV. In this paper we will discuss high-energy
tau neutrinos from nearby gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). From simulations of cascade
in GRB photon fields including various hadronic/leptonic processes, we estimate
the neutrino flux from GRBs. Our results show that both muons and pions are
dominant sources of neutrinos at the energy range of $10^{16-18}$ eV. We
discuss the possibility of detecting the \v{C}erenkov light of upward going
showers from Earth skimming tau neutrinos coming from some closest GRBs.
