We study the gluonic sector of the three-flavor PNJL model by obtaining the
adjoint Polyakov loop and the gluon distribution function in the mean-field
approximation. Besides, we explore the thermal strange quark pair-production
processes, $q\bar {q} \to s\bar {s}$ and $gg \to s \bar {s}$, with the aid of
the three-flavor PNJL model. The results help us identify the temperature where
the gluonic contribution to the production rate becomes dominant, which is an
innovative phenomenon compared with the result obtained in free perturbation
theory.
