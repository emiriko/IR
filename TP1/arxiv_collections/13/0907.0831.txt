The HBL-type blazar Markarian 421 is one of the brightest TeV gamma-ray
sources of the Northern sky. From December 2007 until June 2008 it was
intensively observed in the VHE (E>100 GeV) band by the MAGIC gamma-ray
telescope. The source showed intense and prolonged activity during the whole
period. In some nights the integral flux rose up to 3.6 Crab units (E>200 GeV).
Intra-night rapid flux variations were observed. We compared the optical (KVA)
and X-ray (RXTE-ASM, Swift-XRT) data with the MAGIC VHE data, investigating the
correlations between different energy bands.
