We provide a scenario where naturally small and calculable neutrino masses
arise from a supersymmetry breaking renormalization-group-induced vacuum
expectation value. We adopt a minimal supergravity scenario without ad hoc
supersymmetric mass parameters. The lightest supersymmetric particle can be an
isosinglet scalar neutrino state, potentially viable as WIMP dark matter
through its Higgs new boson coupling. The scenario leads to a plethora of new
phenomenological implications at accelerators including the Large Hadron
Collider.
