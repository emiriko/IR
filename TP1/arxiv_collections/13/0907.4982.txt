A recent survey of the Local Group spiral galaxy M 31 with XMM-Newton yielded
a large number of X-ray sources. This is the second in a series of papers with
the aim of identifying the optical counterparts of these X-ray sources. We have
obtained optical spectra for 21 bright optical counterparts of 20 X-ray sources
in the direction of M 31, using the 1.3-m Skinakas telescope in Crete, Greece.
For 17 of the 20 X-ray sources, we have identified the optical counterpart as a
normal late type star (of type F or later) in the foreground (i.e. in the Milky
Way). For two more sources there were two possible optical counterparts in each
case, while two more objects have X-ray properties that are not compatible with
the spectral characteristics of late type non-flaring stars.
