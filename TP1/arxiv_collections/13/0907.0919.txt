Monte Carlo Renormalization Group (MCRG) methods were designed to study the
non-perturbative phase structure and critical behavior of statistical systems
and quantum field theories. I adopt the 2-lattice matching method used
extensively in the 1980's and show how it can be used to predict the existence
of non-perturbative fixed points and their related critical exponents in many
flavor SU(3) gauge theories. This work serves to test the method and I study
relatively well understood systems: the $N_f=0$, 4 and 16 flavor models. The
pure gauge and $N_f=4$ systems are confining and chirally broken and the MCRG
method can predict their bare step scaling functions. Results for the $N_f=16$
model indicate the existence of an infrared fixed point with nearly marginal
gauge coupling. I present preliminary results for the scaling dimension of the
mass at this new fixed point.
