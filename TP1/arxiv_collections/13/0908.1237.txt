We consider a modified Klein-Gordon equation that arises at ultra high
energies. In a suitable approximation it is shown that for the linear potential
which is of interest in quark interactions, their confinement for example,we
get solutions that mimic the Harmonic oscillator energy levels, surprisingly.
An equation similar to the beam equation is obtained in the process.
