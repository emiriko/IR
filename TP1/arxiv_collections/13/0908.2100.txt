We present accretion rates for selected samples of nova-like variables having
IUE archival spectra and distances uniformly determined using an infrared
method by Knigge (2006). A comparison with accretion rates derived
independently with a multi-parametric optimization modeling approach by Puebla
et al.(2007) is carried out. The accretion rates of SW Sextantis nova-like
systems are compared with the accretion rates of non-SW Sextantis systems in
the Puebla et al. sample and in our sample, which was selected in the orbital
period range of three to four and a half hours, with all systems having
distances using the method of Knigge (2006). Based upon the two independent
modeling approaches, we find no significant difference between the accretion
rates of SW Sextantis systems and non-SW Sextantis nova-like systems insofar as
optically thick disk models are appropriate. We find little evidence to suggest
that the SW Sex stars have higher accretion rates than other nova-like CVs
above the period gap within the same range of orbital periods.
