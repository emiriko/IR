Algorithm::Evolutionary (A::E from now on) was introduced in 2002, after a
talk in YAPC::EU in Munich. 7 years later, A::E is in its 0.67 version (past
its "number of the beast" 0.666), and has been used extensively, to the point
of being the foundation of much of the (computer) science being done by our
research group (and, admittedly, not many others). All is not done, however;
now A::E is being integrated with POE so that evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can
be combined with all kinds of servers and used in client, servers, and anything
in between. In this companion to the talk I will explain what evolutionary
algorithms are, what they are being used for, how to do them with Perl (using
these or other fine modules found in CPAN) and what evolutionary algorithms can
do for Perl at large.
