High-quality averaged radio profiles of some pulsars exhibit double, highly
symmetric features both in emission and absorption. It is shown that both types
of features are produced by a split-fan beam of extraordinary-mode curvature
radiation (CR) that is emitted/absorbed by radially-extended streams of
magnetospheric plasma. With no emissivity in the plane of the stream, such a
beam produces bifurcated emission components (BFCs) when our line of sight
passes through the plane. A distinct example of double component created in
that way is present in averaged profile of the 5 ms pulsar J1012+5307. We show
that the component can indeed be very well fitted by the textbook formula for
the non-coherent beam of curvature radiation in the polarisation state that is
orthogonal to the plane of electron trajectory. The observed width of the BFC
decreases with increasing frequency at the rate that confirms the curvature
origin. Likewise, the double absorption features (double notches) are produced
by the same beam of the extraordinary-mode CR, when it is eclipsed by thin
plasma streams. The intrinsic property of CR to create bifurcated fan beams
explains the double features in terms of very natural geometry and implies the
curvature origin of pulsar radio emission. (abbreviated)
