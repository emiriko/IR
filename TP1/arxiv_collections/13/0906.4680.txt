Information Fusion Systems are now widely used in different fusion contexts,
like scientific processing, sensor networks, video and image processing. One of
the current trends in this area is to cope with distributed systems. In this
context, we have defined and implemented a Dynamic Distributed Information
Fusion System runtime model. It allows us to cope with dynamic execution
supports while trying to maintain the functionalities of a given Dynamic
Distributed Information Fusion System. The paper presents our system, the
reconfiguration problems we are faced with and our solutions.
