The charge pion polarizability is calculated in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model,
where the quark loops (in the mean field approximation) and the meson loops (in
the $1/N_c$ approximation) are taken into account. We show that quark loop
contribution dominates, because the meson loops strongly conceal each other.
The sigma-pole contribution $(m^2_\sigma-t)^{-1}$ plays the main role and
contains strong t-dependence of the effective pion polarizability at the region
$|t|\geq 4M_\pi^2$. Possibilities of experimental test of this sigma-pole
effect in the reaction of Coulomb Nuclear Scattering are estimated for the
COMPASS experiment.
