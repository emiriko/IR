In the framework of gauge invariant Stueckelberg approach, totally symmetric
arbitrary spin shadow fields in flat space-time of dimension greater than or
equal to four are studied. Gauge invariant two-point vertices for such shadow
fields are obtained. We demonstrate that, in Stueckelberg gauge frame, these
gauge invariant vertices become the standard two-point vertices of CFT.
Light-cone gauge two-point vertices of the shadow fields are also obtained.
AdS/CFT correspondence for the shadow fields and the non-normalizable solutions
of free massless totally symmetric arbitrary spin AdS fields is studied. AdS
fields are considered in a modified de Donder gauge and this simplifies
considerably the study of AdS/CFT correspondence. We demonstrate that the bulk
action, when it is evaluated on solution of the Dirichlet problem, leads to the
two-point gauge invariant vertex of shadow field. Also we shown that the bulk
action evaluated on solution of the Dirichlet problem leads to new description
of conformal fields. The new description involves Stueckelberg gauge symmetries
and gives simple higher-derivative Lagrangian for the conformal arbitrary spin
field. In the Stueckelberg gauge frame, our Lagrangian becomes the standard
Lagrangian of conformal field. Light-cone gauge Lagrangian of the arbitrary
spin conformal field is also obtained.
