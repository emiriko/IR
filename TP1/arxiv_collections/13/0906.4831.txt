We performed fluctuation analysis by means of the local scaling dimension for
the strength function of the isoscalar (IS) giant quadrupole resonance (GQR) in
208Pb where the strength function is obtained by the shell model calculation
including 1p1h and 2p2h configurations. It is found that at almost all energy
scales, fluctuation of the strength function obeys the Gaussian orthogonal
ensemble (GOE) random matrix theory limit. This is contrasted with the results
for the GQR in 40Ca, where at the intermediate energy scale about 1.7 MeV a
deviation from the GOE limit was detected. It is found that the physical origin
for this different behavior of the local scaling dimension is ascribed to the
difference in the properties of the damping process.
