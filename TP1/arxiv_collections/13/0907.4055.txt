In this paper we show that, analogously to as it occurs for black holes,
there exist three well-defined laws for Lorentzian wormhole thermodynamics and
that these laws are related with a thermal phantom-like radiation process
coming from the wormhole throat. It is argued that the existence of wormholes
could be manifested by means such a radiation. These results are obtained by
analyzing the Hayward formalism of spherically symmetric solutions containing
trapping horizons, the phenomenon of phantom accretion onto wormholes and the
development of phantom thermodynamics.
