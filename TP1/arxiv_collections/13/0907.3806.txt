Graphene layers are stable, hard, and relatively inert. We study how tensile
stress affects $\sigma$ and $\pi$ bonds and the resulting change in the
chemical activity. Stress affects more strongly $\pi$ bonds that can become
chemically active and bind to adsorbed species more strongly. Upon stretch,
single C bonds are activated in a geometry mixing $120^{o}$ and $90^{o}$; an
intermediate state between $sp^{2}$ and $sp^{3}$ bonding. We use ab-initio
density functional theory to study the adsorption of hydrogen on large clusters
and 2D periodic models for graphene. The influence of the exchange-correlation
functional on the adsorption energy is discussed.
