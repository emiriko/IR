This is the second in a series of papers that investigates the topological
susceptibility in the interacting instanton liquid model (IILM) at finite
temperature, and deals with the technical issues relating to the Monte Carlo
simulations. The IILM reduces field theory to a molecular dynamics description,
and for `physical' quark masses the system behaves like a strongly associating
fluid. We will argue that this is a generic feature for very light Dirac quark
in a non-trivial background, described in the semi-classical approach. To get
rid of unnecessary complications, we will present the ideas of biased Monte
Carlo, and implement the transition probabilities, for a toy model.
