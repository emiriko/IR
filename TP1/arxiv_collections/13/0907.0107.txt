The stellar (n,gamma) cross section of 40Ca at kT=25 keV has been measured
with a combination of the activation technique and accelerator mass
spectrometry (AMS). This combination is required when direct off-line counting
of the produced activity is compromised by the long half-life and/or missing
gamma-ray transitions. The neutron activations were performed at the Karlsruhe
Van de Graaff accelerator using the quasistellar neutron spectrum of kT=25 keV
produced by the 7Li(p,n)7Be reaction. The subsequent AMS measurements were
carried out at the Vienna Environmental Research Accelerator (VERA) with a 3 MV
tandem accelerator. The doubly magic 40Ca is a bottle-neck isotope in
incomplete silicon burning, and its neutron capture cross section determines
the amount of leakage, thus impacting on the eventual production of iron group
elements. Because of its high abundance, 40Ca can also play a secondary role as
"neutron poison" for the s-process. Previous determinations of this value at
stellar energies were based on time-of-flight measurements. Our method uses an
independent approach, and yields for the Maxwellian-averaged cross section at
kT=30 keV a value of <sigma>30 keV= 5.73+/-0.34 mb.
