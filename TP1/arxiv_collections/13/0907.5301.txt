We describe a method to efficiently obtain two-dimensional velocity fields of
distant, faint and small, emission-line galaxies with FORS2 at the VLT. They
are examined for kinematic substructure to identify possible interaction
processes. Numerical simulations of tidal interactions and ram-pressure effects
reveal distinct signatures observable with our method. We detect a significant
fraction of galaxies with irregular velocity fields both in the field and
cluster environments.
