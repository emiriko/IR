Non-relativistic quantum theory is derived from information codified into an
appropriate statistical model. The basic assumption is that there is an
irreducible uncertainty in the location of particles: positions constitute a
configuration space and the corresponding probability distributions constitute
a statistical manifold. The dynamics follows from a principle of inference, the
method of Maximum Entropy. The concept of time is introduced as a convenient
way to keep track of change. A welcome feature is that the entropic dynamics
notion of time incorporates a natural distinction between past and future. The
statistical manifold is assumed to be a dynamical entity: its curved and
evolving geometry determines the evolution of the particles which, in their
turn, react back and determine the evolution of the geometry. Imposing that the
dynamics conserve energy leads to the Schroedinger equation and to a natural
explanation of its linearity, its unitarity, and of the role of complex
numbers. The phase of the wave function is explained as a feature of purely
statistical origin. There is a quantum analogue to the gravitational
equivalence principle.
