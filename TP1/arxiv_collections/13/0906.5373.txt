I propose a simple model of the distribution of the small eigenvalues of the
QCD Dirac operator well above the finite temperature phase transition where
chiral symmetry is restored and the spectral density at zero vanishes. Assuming
the absence of correlations between different regions of the low lying spectrum
I derive analytic formulas for the distribution of the first two eigenvalues. I
find good agreement with data obtained using the overlap Dirac operator in
quenched SU(2) lattice simulations. This suggests that if chiral symmetry is
restored spectral correlations are not important and all the statistical
properties of the spectrum are encoded in the spectral density.
