We analyze how noise correlations probed by time-of-flight (TOF) experiments
reveal antiferromagnetic (AF) correlations of fermionic atoms in
two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) optical lattices. Combining
analytical and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations using experimentally
realistic parameters, we show that AF correlations can be detected for
temperatures above and below the critical temperature for AF ordering. It is
demonstrated that spin-resolved noise correlations yield important information
about the spin ordering. Finally, we show how to extract the spin correlation
length and the related critical exponent of the AF transition from the noise.
