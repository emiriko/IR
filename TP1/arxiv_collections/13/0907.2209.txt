A set of ontology matching algorithms (for finding correspondences between
concepts) is based on a thesaurus that provides the source data for the
semantic distance calculations. In this wiki era, new resources may spring up
and improve this kind of semantic search. In the paper a solution of this task
based on Russian Wiktionary is compared to WordNet based algorithms. Metrics
are estimated using the test collection, containing 353 English word pairs with
a relatedness score assigned by human evaluators. The experiment shows that the
proposed method is capable in principle of calculating a semantic distance
between pair of words in any language presented in Russian Wiktionary. The
calculation of Wiktionary based metric had required the development of the
open-source Wiktionary parser software.
