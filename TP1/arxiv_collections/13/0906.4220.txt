Experimental data on fragmentation channels in peripheral interactions of
$^8$B nuclei in nuclear track emulsions are presented. A detailed analysis made
it possible to justify selections of events of the electromagnetic-dissociation
process $^8$B $\to^7$Be + \emph{p} and to estimate its cross section. Events of
$^{10}$C peripheral dissociation that were observed in the same exposure are
described.
