The single-degenerate model is currently a favourable progenitor model for
Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Recent investigations on the WD + He star channel
of the single-degenerate model imply that this channel is noteworthy for
producing SNe Ia. In this paper we studied SN Ia birthrates and delay times of
this channel via a detailed binary population synthesis approach. We found that
the Galactic SN Ia birthrate from the WD + He star channel is $\sim 0.3\times
10^{-3} {\rm yr}^{-1}$ according to our standard model, and that this channel
can explain SNe Ia with short delay times ($\sim4.5\times10^7 - 1.4\times10^8$
yr). Meanwhile, these WD + He star systems may be related to the young
supersoft X-ray sources prior to SN Ia explosions.
