We identify and investigate the new parameter regime of small charge solitons
in one-dimensional arrays of Josephson junctions. We obtain the dispersion
relation of the soliton and show that it unexpectedly flattens in the outer
region of the Brillouin zone. We demonstrate Lorentz contraction of the soliton
in the middle of the Brillouin zone as well as broadening of the soliton in the
flat band regime.
