Titan, the largest satellite of Saturn, has an atmosphere chiefly made up of
N2 and CH4 and includes traces of many simple organic compounds. This
atmosphere also partly consists of haze and aerosol particles which during the
last 4.5 gigayears have been processed by electric discharges, ions, and
ionizing photons, being slowly deposited over the Titan surface. In this work,
we investigate the possible effects produced by soft X-rays (and secondary
electrons) on Titan aerosol analogs in an attempt to simulate some prebiotic
photochemistry. The experiments have been performed inside a high vacuum
chamber coupled to the soft X-ray spectroscopy beamline at the Brazilian
Synchrotron Light Source, Campinas, Brazil. In-situ sample analyses were
performed by a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The infrared spectra
have presented several organic molecules, including nitriles and aromatic CN
compounds. After the irradiation, the brownish-orange organic residue (tholin)
was analyzed ex-situ by gas chromatographic (GC/MS) and nuclear magnetic
resonance (1H NMR) techniques, revealing the presence of adenine (C5H5N5), one
of the constituents of the DNA molecule. This confirms previous results which
showed that the organic chemistry on the Titan surface can be very complex and
extremely rich in prebiotic compounds. Molecules like these on the early Earth
have found a place to allow life (as we know) to flourish.
