The power distribution of nearly all major countries have accepted 3-phase
distribution as a standard. With increasing power requirements of
instrumentation today even a small physics laboratory requires 3-phase supply.
While physics students are given an introduction of this in passing, no
experiment work is done with 3-phase supply due to the sheer possibility of
accidents while working with such large powers. We believe a conceptual
understanding of 3-phase supply would be useful for physics students with hands
on experience using a simple circuit that can be assembled even in a high
school laboratorys.
