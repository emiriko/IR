We report the resistivity measurements under pressure of two Fe-based
superconductors with a thick perovskite oxide layer, Sr2VFeAsO3 and Sr2ScFePO3.
The superconducting transition temperature Tc of Sr2VFeAsO3 markedly increases
with increasing pressure. Its onset value, which was Tc{onset}=36.4 K at
ambient pressure, increases to Tc{onset}=46.0 K at ~4 GPa, ensuring the
potential of the "21113" system as a high-Tc material. However, the
superconductivity of Sr2ScFePO3 is strongly suppressed under pressure. The
Tc{onset} of ~16 K decreases to ~5 K at ~4 GPa, and the zero-resistance state
is almost lost. We discuss the factor that induces this contrasting pressure
effect.
