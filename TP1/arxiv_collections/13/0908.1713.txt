A peculiar property of complex scattering potentials is the appearance of
spectral singularities. These are energy eigenvalues for certain scattering
states that similarly to resonance states have infinite reflection and
transmission coefficients. This property reveals an interesting resonance
effect with possible applications in waveguide physics. We study the spectral
singularities of a complex barrier potential and explore their application in
designing a waveguide that functions as a resonator. We show that for the
easily accessible sizes of the waveguide and its gain region, we can realize
the spectral singularity-related resonance phenomenon at almost every
wavelength within the visible spectrum or outside it.
