We study infrared spectrum of Arcturus to clarify the nature of the cool
component of its atmosphere, referred to as the CO-mosphere, with the use of
the IR spectral atlas by Hinkle et al.(1995). The nature of CO lines shows an
abrupt change at logW/nu = -4.75, and the lines stronger than this limit can no
longer be analyzed by the classical line-formation theory. A more simple
manifestation of this fact is that the curves-of-growth (CG) of CO lines show
an unpredictable upturn at logW/nu = -4.75. Similar unusual behaviors of
empirical CG are confirmed in other red (super)giant stars, and it looks as if
the CG is a hybrid of at least two components of different origins. Although
strong lines of the CO fundamentals observed in Arcturus show strengthening
compared with the predicted photospheric spectrum, the weaker lines show slight
weakening, and we interpret these results as due to absorption/emission by the
molecular clouds formed in the extended atmosphere. Now do clouds exist in
stellar atmospheres? It is by no means easy to answer this question by
spectroscopic observations alone, but we find several arguments in favor of
such a possibility in Arcturus by analyzing the CO lines. In cooler
(super)giant stars in which CO lines show similar unusual behaviors as in
Arcturus, the presence of molecular clouds in the outer atmospheres was
demonstrated by direct observations with spatial interferometry. We suggest
that the formation of molecular clouds is a general feature in cool luminous
stars from early K to late M (super)giant stars.
