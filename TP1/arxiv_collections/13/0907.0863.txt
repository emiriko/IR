We show that Monte Carlo sampling of the Feynman diagrammatic series (DiagMC)
can be used for tackling hard fermionic quantum many-body problems in the
thermodynamic limit by presenting accurate results for the repulsive Hubbard
model in the correlated Fermi liquid regime. Sampling Feynman's diagrammatic
series for the single-particle self-energy we can study moderate values of the
on-site repulsion ($U/t \sim 4$) and temperatures down to $T/t=1/40$. We
compare our results with high temperature series expansion and with single-site
and cluster dynamical mean-field theory.
