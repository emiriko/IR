We numerically analyze, using Finite Difference Time Domain simulations, the
bandgap properties of photonic quasicrystals with a low index contrast. We
compared 8-, 10- and 12-fold symmetry aperiodically ordered lattices with
different spatial tiling. Our results show that tiling design, more than
symmetry, determines the transmission properties of these structures.
