Three-dimensional numerical simulations of solar surface magnetoconvection
using realistic model physics are conducted. The thermal structure of
convective motions into the upper radiative layers of the photosphere, the main
scales of convective cells and the penetration depths of convection are
investigated. We take part of the solar photosphere with size of 60x60 Mm in
horizontal direction and by depth 20 Mm from level of the visible solar
surface. We use a realistic initial model of the Sun and apply equation of
state and opacities of stellar matter. The equations of fully compressible
radiation magnetohydrodynamics with dynamical viscosity and gravity are solved.
We apply: 1) conservative TVD difference scheme for the magnetohydrodynamics,
2) the diffusion approximation for the radiative transfer, 3) dynamical
viscosity from subgrid scale modeling. In simulation we take uniform
two-dimesional grid in gorizontal plane and nonuniform grid in vertical
direction with number of cells 600x600x204. We use 512 processors with
distributed memory multiprocessors on supercomputer MVS-100k in the Joint
Computational Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
