We present a new dark matter model BDM which is an hybrid between hot dark
matter HDM and cold dark matter CDM, in which the BDM particles behave as HDM
above the energy scale E_c and as CDM below this scale. Evolution of structure
formation is similar to that of CDM model but BDM predicts a nonvanishing free
streaming l_fs scale and a inner galaxy core radius r_core, both quantities
determined in terms of a single parameter E_c, which corresponds to the phase
transition energy scale of the subjacent elementary particle model. For
energies above E_c or for a scale factor a smaller then a_c, with a<a_c<a_{eq},
the particles are massless and rho redshifts as radiation. However, once the
energy becomes E\leq E_c or a>a_c then the BDM particles acquire a large mass
through a non perturbative mechanism, as baryons do, and rho redshifts as
matter with the particles having a vanishing velocity. Typical energies are
E_c=O(10-100) eV giving a l_fs \propto E_c^{-4/3}\lesssim Mpc and m_fs\propto
E_c^{-4}\lesssim 10^9 M\odot. A l_fs\neq 0, r_core\neq 0 help to resolve some
of the shortcomings of CDM such as overabundance substructure in CDM halos and
numerical fit to rotation curves in dwarf spheroidal and LSB galaxies. Finally,
our BDM model and the phase transition scale E_c can be derived from particle
physics.
