Spin-orbit coupling of electrons with the crystal lattice plays a crucial
role in materials without inversion symmetry, lifting spin degeneracy of the
Bloch states and endowing the resulting nondegenerate bands with complex spin
textures and topologically nontrivial wavefunctions. We present a detailed
symmetry-based analysis of the spin-orbit coupling and the band degeneracies in
noncentrosymmetric metals. We systematically derive the semiclassical equations
of motion for fermionic quasiparticles near the Fermi surface, taking into
account both the spin-orbit coupling and the Zeeman interaction with an applied
magnetic field. Some of the lowest-order quantum corrections to the equations
of motions can be expressed in terms of a fictitious "magnetic field" in the
momentum space, which is related to the Berry curvature of the band
wavefunctions. The band degeneracy points or lines serve as sources of a
topologically nontrivial Berry curvature. We discuss the observable effects of
the wavefunction topology, focusing, in particular, on the modifications to the
Lifshitz-Onsager semiclassical quantization condition and the de Haas-van
Alphen effect in noncentrosymmetric metals.
