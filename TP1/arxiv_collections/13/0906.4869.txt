We present a multichannel cardiac magnetic field imaging system built in
Fribourg from optical double-resonance Cs vapor magnetometers. It consists of
25 individual sensors designed to record magnetic field maps of the beating
human heart by simultaneous measurements on a grid of 19 points over the chest.
The system is operated as an array of second order gradiometers using
sophisticated digitally controlled feedback loops.
