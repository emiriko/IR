We investigate the contribution to the angular correlation coefficients of
the neutron beta decay within the R-parity violating (RPV) minimal
supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). The RPV effects contribute to the scalar
interaction at the tree level. The effective scalar interaction of the neutron
beta decay is constructed by making use of the relation between isospin
asymmetries and the proton-neutron mass difference. On the basis of the recent
update of the analyses of the superallowed Fermi transitions and the recent
measurement of transverse polarization of the emitted electrons at PSI, we
deduce new upper limits on the RPV couplings. We also point out the existence
of new types of angular correlations which are sensitive to the RPV
interactions.
