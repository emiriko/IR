We consider a model of bilayer lipid membrane with bola-lipids. The
bola-lipid is modeled by linking tails of the hydrophobic chains in the
opposite monolayers within bilayer as a first approximation. A number of
thermodynamical characteristics are calculated analytically and compared with
the ones of a regular membrane without chains linkage. Pronounced difference
between lateral pressure profiles at the layers interface for linked and
regular bilayer models is found. In the linked case, the lateral pressure
mid-plane peak disappears, while the free energy per chain increases. We have
also calculated distribution of the orientaional order parameter of linked
chains across the bilayer, and found it is in contrast with the usual lipids
case.
