The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope
observatory is a pair conversion telescope sensitive to gamma-rays over more
than four energy decades, between 20 MeV and more than 300 GeV. Acting in
synergy with the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) - the other instrument onboard
the mission - the LAT features unprecedented sensitivity for the study of
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in terms of spectral coverage, effective area, and
instrumental dead time. We will review the main results from Fermi-LAT
observation of GRB, presenting the main properties of GRBs at GeV energies.
