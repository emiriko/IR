The problem of anomalous diffusion in the momentum space is considered on the
basis of the appropriate probability transition function (PTF). New general
equation for description of the diffusion of heavy particles in the gas of the
light particles is formulated on basis of the new approach similar to one in
coordinate space (S. Trigger et al.). The obtained results permit to describe
the various situations when the probability transition function (PTF) has a
long tail in the momentum space. The effective friction and diffusion
coefficients are found.
