The motivation, techniques and performance of the ground-based photometric
follow-up of transit detections by the CoRoT space mission are presented. Its
principal raison d'\^{e}tre arises from the much higher spatial resolution of
common ground-based telescopes in comparison to CoRoT's cameras. This allows
the identification of many transit candidates as arising from eclipsing
binaries that are contaminating CoRoT's lightcurves, even in low-amplitude
transit events that cannot be detected with ground-based obervations. For the
ground observations, 'on'-'off' photometry is now largely employed, in which
only a short timeseries during a transit and a section outside a transit is
observed and compared photometrically. CoRoT planet candidates' transits are
being observed by a dedicated team with access to telescopes with sizes ranging
from 0.2 to 2 m. As an example, the process that led to the rejection of
contaminating eclipsing binaries near the host star of the Super-Earth planet
CoRoT-7b is shown. Experiences and techniques from this work may also be useful
for other transit-detection experiments, when the discovery instrument obtains
data with a relatively low angular resolution.
