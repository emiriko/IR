We investigate theoretically and experimentally the full counting statistics
of bidirectional single-electron tunneling through a double quantum dot in a
GaAs/GaAlAs heterostructure and compare with predictions of the fluctuation
theorem (FT) for Markovian stochastic processes. We observe that the quantum
point contact electrometer used to study the transport induces nonequilibrium
shot noise and dot-level fluctuations and strongly modifies the tunneling
statistics. As a result, the FT appears to be violated. We show that it is
satisfied if the back-action of the electrometer is taken into account, and we
provide a quantitative estimate of this effect.
