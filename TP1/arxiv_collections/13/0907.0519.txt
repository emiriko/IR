We report on a possibility of measuring parity violating effects in radiative
neutrino pair emission from metastable atoms; asymmetric angular distribution
of emitted photons from oriented atoms and emergent circular polarization.
Their observation, along with the continuous photon energy spectrum which has 6
thresholds, may be interpreted as events being a combined weak and QED process,
emission of $\gamma \nu_i \nu_j$ in the final state. The method may greatly
help to perform neutrino mass spectroscopy using atoms, a systematic
determination of the neutrino mass matrix.
