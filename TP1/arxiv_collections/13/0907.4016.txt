Matos, Guzman and Nunez proposed a model for the galactic halo within the
framework of scalar field theory. We argue that an analysis involving the full
metric can reveal the true physical nature of the halo only when a certain
condition is maintained. We fix that condition and also calculate its impact on
observable parameters of the model.
