We estimate black hole masses and Eddington ratios for a sample of 81 young
radio galaxies (42 CSS +39 GPS). We find that the average black hole (BH) mass
of these young radio galaxies is <log Mbh>~8.3, which is less than that of
radio loud QSOs and low redshift radio galaxies. The CSS/GPS sources have
relatively high Eddington ratios, with an average value of <log
Lbol/LEdd>=-0.75, which are similar to those of narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies
(NLS1s). This suggests that young radio galaxies may not only be in the early
stages of their radio activity, but also in the early stage of their accretion
activity. We find that the young radio galaxies as a class deviate
systematically from M_bh-\sigma relation defined by nearby inactive galaxies,
when using [O III] as a surrogate for stellar velocity dispersion, \sigma_* .
We also find that the deviation of the [O III] line width is correlated with
the Eddington ratio and sources with Lbol/LEdd~1 have the largest deviations,
which are similar to those of radio quiet QSOs/NLS1s (radio jets is absent or
weak). A similar result has been obtained for 9 linear radio Seyfert galaxies.
On the basis of these results, we suggest that, in addition to the possible
jet-gas interactions, accretion activities may also play an important role in
shaping the kinematics of the narrow [O III] line in young radio galaxies and
linear radio Seyferts.
