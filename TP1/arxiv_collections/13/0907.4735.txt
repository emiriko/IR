We report the temperature dependence of resistivity (rho) and Hall
coefficient (R_H) in the normal state of homogeneously disordered epitaxial NbN
thin films with kFl~3.27-10.12. The superconducting transition temperature (Tc)
of these films varies from 8.13K to 16.8K. While our least disordered film
displays usual metallic behavior, for all the films with kFl<8.13, both and are
negative up to 300K. We observe that R_H(T) varies linearly with rho(T) for all
the films. Measurements performed on a 2nm thick Be film shows similar behavior
>. This behavior is inconsistent with existing theories of localization and e-e
interactions in a disordered metal.
