A magnetic tunnel junction sensor is proposed, with both the detection and
the reference layers pinned by IrMn. Using the differences in the blocking
temperatures of the IrMn films with different thicknesses, crossed anisotropies
can be induced between the detection and the reference electrodes. The pinning
of the sensing electrode ensures a linear and reversible output. It also allows
tuning both the sensitivity and the linear range of the sensor. The authors
show that the sensitivity varies linearly with the ferromagnetic thickness of
the detection electrode. It is demonstrated that an increased thickness leads
to a rise of sensitivity and a reduction of the operating range.
