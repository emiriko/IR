We measure polarization in the United States Congress using the network
science concept of modularity. Modularity provides a conceptually-clear measure
of polarization that reveals both the number of relevant groups and the
strength of inter-group divisions without making restrictive assumptions about
the structure of the party system or the shape of legislator utilities. We show
that party influence on Congressional blocs varies widely throughout history,
and that existing measures underestimate polarization in periods with weak
party structures. We demonstrate that modularity is a significant predictor of
changes in majority party and that turnover is more prevalent at medium levels
of modularity. We show that two variables related to modularity, called
`divisiveness' and `solidarity,' are significant predictors of reelection
success for individual House members. Our results suggest that modularity can
serve as an early warning of changing group dynamics, which are reflected only
later by changes in party labels.
