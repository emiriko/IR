Mechanical vibrations are known to affect frictional sliding and the
associated stick-slip patterns causing sometimes a drastic reduction of the
friction force. This issue is relevant for applications in nanotribology and to
understand earthquake triggering by small dynamic perturbations .
  We study the dynamics of repulsive particles confined between a horizontally
driven top plate and a vertically oscillating bottom plate. Our numerical
results show a suppression of the high dissipative stick-slip regime in a well
defined range of frequencies that depends on the vibrating amplitude, the
normal applied load, the system inertia and the damping constant. We propose a
theoretical explanation of the numerical results and derive a phase diagram
indicating the region of parameter space where friction is suppressed. Our
results allow to define better strategies for the mechanical control of
friction.
