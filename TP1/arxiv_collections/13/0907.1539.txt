A microscopic theory of nuclei based on a 'free' scattering NN-potential is
meaningful only if this potential fits on-shell scattering data.This is a
necessary but not sufficient condition for the theory to be successful.It has
been demonstrated repeatedly in the past that 2-body off-shell adjustments or
many-body forces are necessary.It has been shown however, using Eff. Field
Theory and formal scattering theory, that off-shell and many-body effects can
not be separated.This 'equivalence theorem' allows us to concentrate on the
off-shell effects.Examples of on-shell equivalent potentials Paris, Bonn etc
but here separable potentials are calculated by inverse scattering from
NN-scattering and Deuteron data, Earlier calculations showed these S-state
potentials to agree with Bonn-B results in Brueckner nuclear matter
calculations. They are here also used to compute the Triton binding energy and
the n-D scattering length.The results are found to lie on the Phillips line
defined in early calculations but like these miss the experimental point on
this line and overbind the Triton but is reached by modifying the off-shell
properties adding a short-range repulsion without affecting fits to the
experimental low-energy phase-shifts.The off-shell induced correlations result
in a repulsive component in the Triton effective interactions.In nuclear matter
the same effect is referred to as the dispersion correction, which is a main
contributor to nuclear saturation.In finite nucleus Brueckner-HF calculations
these same correlations give an important contribution to the selfconsistent
(reaarangement term), without which the finite nucleus would collapse.The main
purpose of the present work is to illustrate that NN-correlations are as
important in the Triton as they are in nuclear matter or other finite nuclei.
