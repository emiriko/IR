I discuss a variety of results involving s(n), the number of representations
of n as a sum of three squares. One of my objectives is to reveal numerous
interesting connections between the properties of this function and certain
modular equations of degree 3 and 5. In particular, I show that
s(25n)=(6-(-n|5))s(n)-5s(n/25) follows easily from the well known Ramanujan
modular equation of degree 5. Moreover, I establish new relations between s(n)
and h(n), g(n), the number of representations of $n$ by the ternary quadratic
forms 2x^2+2y^2+2z^2-yz+zx+xy and x^2+y^2+3z^2+xy, respectively. I propose an
interesting identity for s(p^2n)- p s(n) with p being an odd prime. This
identity makes nontrivial use of the ternary quadratic forms with discriminants
p^2, 16p^2.
