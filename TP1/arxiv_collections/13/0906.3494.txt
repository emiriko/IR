In this sequel we extend the derivation of the third order helicity to
magnetic fields supported on unlinked domains in 3-space. The formula is
expressed in terms of generators of the deRham cohomology of the configuration
space of three points in $\R^3$, which is a more practical domain from the
perspective of applications. It also admits an ergodic interpretation as an
average asymptotic Milnor $\bar{\mu}_{123}$-invariant and allows us to obtain
the $L^2$-energy bound for the magnetic field. As an intermediate step we
derive an integral formula for Milnor $\bar{\mu}_{123}$-invariant for
parametrized Borromean links in $\R^3$.
