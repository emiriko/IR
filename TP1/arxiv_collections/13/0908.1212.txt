We present an expression for curvature with q-deformed calculus such as
considered in \cite{d-k,b-b-k,f-m-r-s-w}. By exploiting the persistence of
Bianchi's second identity, we suggest a way to attach physical meaning to the
$q$ parameters and $d^N\neq 0$ condition by introducing a physical current, an
example of which may be obtained by a procedure outlined in \cite{akofor}.
