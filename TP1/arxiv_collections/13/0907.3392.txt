We demonstrate that the presence of charge around a semiconductor quantum dot
(QD) strongly affects its optical properties and produces non-resonant coupling
to the modes of a microcavity. We first show that, besides (multi)exciton
lines, a QD generates a spectrally broad emission which efficiently couples to
cavity modes. Its temporal dynamics shows that it is related to the Coulomb
interaction between the QD (multi)excitons and carriers in the adjacent wetting
layer. This mechanism can be suppressed by the application of an electric
field, making the QD closer to an ideal two-level system.
