A computational abstract machine based on two operations: referencing and bit
copying is presented. These operations are sufficient for carrying out any
computation. They can be used as the primitives for a Turing-complete
programming language. The interesting point is that the computation can be done
without logic operations such as AND or OR. The compiler and emulator of this
language with sample programs are available on the Internet.
