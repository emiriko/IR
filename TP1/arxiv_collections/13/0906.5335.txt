In the endeavour to scale up the number of qubits in an ion-based quantum
computer several groups have started to develop miniaturized ion traps for
extended spatial control and manipulation of the ions. Shuttling and separation
of ion strings have been the foremost issues in linear-trap arrangements and
some prototypes of junctions have been demonstrated for the extension of ion
motion to two dimensions (2D). While junctions require complex trap structures,
small extensions to the 1D motion can be accomplished in simple linear trap
arrangements. Here, control of the extended field in a planar, linear chip trap
is used to shuttle ions in 2D. With this approach, the order of ions in a
string is deterministically reversed. Optimized potentials are theoretically
derived and simulations show that the reordering can be carried out
adiabatically. The control over individual ion positions in a linear trap
presents a new tool for ion-trap quantum computing. The method is also expected
to work with mixed crystals of different ion species and as such could have
applications for sympathetic cooling of an ion string.
