The theory of formal power series and derivation is developed from the point
of view of the power matrix. A Loewner equation for formal power series is
introduced. We then show that the matrix exponential is surjective onto the
group of power matrices, and the coefficients are entire functions of finitely
many coefficients of the infinitesimal generator. Furthermore coefficients of
the solution to the Loewner equation with constant infinitesimal generator can
be obtained by exponentiating an infinitesimal power matrix. We also use the
formal Loewner equations to investigate the relation between holomorphicity of
an infinitesimal generator to holomorphicity of the exponentiated matrix.
