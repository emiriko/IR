A general framework is proposed for integration of rules and external first
order theories. It is based on the well-founded semantics of normal logic
programs and inspired by ideas of Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) and
constructive negation for logic programs. Hybrid rules are normal clauses
extended with constraints in the bodies; constraints are certain formulae in
the language of the external theory. A hybrid program is a pair of a set of
hybrid rules and an external theory. Instances of the framework are obtained by
specifying the class of external theories, and the class of constraints. An
example instance is integration of (non-disjunctive) Datalog with ontologies
formalized as description logics.
  The paper defines a declarative semantics of hybrid programs and a
goal-driven formal operational semantics. The latter can be seen as a
generalization of SLS-resolution. It provides a basis for hybrid
implementations combining Prolog with constraint solvers. Soundness of the
operational semantics is proven. Sufficient conditions for decidability of the
declarative semantics, and for completeness of the operational semantics are
given.
