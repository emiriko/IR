We compute the Omega- electromagnetic form factors and the decuplet baryon
magnetic moments using a quark model application of the Covariant Spectator
Theory. Our predictions for the Omega- electromagnetic form factors can be
tested in the future by lattice QCD simulations at the physical strange quark
mass.
