Complementary to the conventional experimental studies on $N^*$ from $\pi N$
and $\gamma^{(*)}N$ reactions, the $e^+e^-$, $pp$ and $p\bar p$ collisions can
give novel insights into these $N^*$ resonances. While the $e^+e^-$ collisions
through production and decay of vector charmonium $\psi$ provide a nice isospin
filter for a simultaneously study of $N^*$, $\Delta^*$, $\Lambda^*$, $\Sigma^*$
and $\Xi^*$, the $pp$ collisions should be the best place for producing those
$\Delta^{*++}$ with large coupling to $\rho^+p$ though $pp\to n\Delta^{*++}$
reaction, and the $p\bar p$ collisions should be the best place for looking for
those $N^*$ with large coupling to $\sigma N$.
