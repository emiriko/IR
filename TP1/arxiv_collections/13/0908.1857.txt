We present an experimental demonstration of the full control of the frequency
correlations of entangled photon pairs. The joint spectrum of photon pairs is
continuously varied from photons that exhibit anticorrelation in frequency to
photons that exhibit correlation in frequency, passing through the case of
uncorrelated photons. Highly entangled frequency-anticorrelated photon pairs
were obtained even when an ultrafast laser was used as a pump. The different
kinds of correlations are obtained without changing neither the wavelength, nor
the nonlinear crystal.
