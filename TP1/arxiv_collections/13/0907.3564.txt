We analyze the use of layered superconductors as anisotropic metamaterials.
Layered superconductors can have a negative refraction index in a wide
frequency range for arbitrary incident angles. Indeed, low-Tc (s-wave)
superconductors allow to produce artificial heterostructures with low losses
for T<<Tc. However, the real part of their in-plane effective permittivity is
very large. Moreover, even at low temperatures, layered high-Tc superconductors
have a large in-plane normal conductivity, producing large losses (due to
d-wave symmetry). Therefore, it is difficult to enhance the evanescent modes in
either low-Tc or high-Tc superconductors.
