We consider a microscopic model for a doped quantum ferromagnet as a test
case for the systematic low-energy effective field theory for magnons and
holes, which is constructed in complete analogy to the case of quantum
antiferromagnets. In contrast to antiferromagnets, for which the effective
field theory approach can be tested only numerically, in the ferromagnetic case
both the microscopic and the effective theory can be solved analytically. In
this way the low-energy parameters of the effective theory are determined
exactly by matching to the underlying microscopic model. The low-energy
behavior at half-filling as well as in the single- and two-hole sectors is
described exactly by the systematic low-energy effective field theory. In
particular, for weakly bound two-hole states the effective field theory even
works beyond perturbation theory. This lends strong support to the quantitative
success of the systematic low-energy effective field theory method not only in
the ferromagnetic but also in the physically most interesting antiferromagnetic
case.
