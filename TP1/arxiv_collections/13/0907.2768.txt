The Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Object Monitor (SVOM)
mission is dedicated to the detection, localization and broad-band study of
Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and other high-energy transient phenomena. The Gamma
Ray Monitor (GRM) onboard is designed to observe the GRBs up to 5 MeV. With
this instrument one of the key GRB parameter, Epeak, can be easily measured in
the hard x-ray band. It can achieve a detection rate of 100 GRBs per year which
ensures the scientific output of SVOM.
