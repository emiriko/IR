A new minimal model is constructed for the doped manganese oxides which
exhibit colossal magnetoresistance (CMR), involving broad spin-majority
conduction band as well as nearly localised spin-minority electron states. A
simple mean field analysis yields a temperature-dependent hybridised band
structure with suppressed carrier weight at the Fermi level. Spin stiffness is
complex, indicating unusually strong spin wave damping. Experimental and
theoretical investigations are needed to further verify the relevance of the
proposed model.
