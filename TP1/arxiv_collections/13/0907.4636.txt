This paper extends the modern theory of tunneling transport to finite
temperatures. The extension enables applications to molecular electronic
devices connected to semiconducting leads. The paper presents an application of
the theory to molecular devices made of alkyl chains connected to silicon
nano-wires, mapping their transport characteristics as functions of temperature
and alkyl chain's length. Based on these calculations and on the analytic
theory, it is found that the tunneling decay constant is determined not by the
Fermi level, but by the edge of the valence or conductance band, whichever is
closer to the Fermi level. Further insight is provided by mapping the
evanescent transport channels of the alkyl chains and few other physical
quantities appearing in the analytic formula for conductance. A good
qualitative agreement with the experimental data is obtained.
