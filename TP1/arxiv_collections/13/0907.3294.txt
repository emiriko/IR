We show how to apply the macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) of Bertini, De
Sole, Gabrielli, Jona-Lasinio, and Landim to study the current fluctuations of
diffusive systems with a step initial condition. We argue that one has to
distinguish between two ways of averaging (the annealed and the quenched cases)
depending on whether we let the initial condition fluctuate or not. Although
the initial condition is not a steady state, the distribution of the current
satisfies a symmetry very reminiscent of the fluctuation theorem. We show how
the equations of the MFT can be solved in the case of non-interacting
particles. The symmetry of these equations can be used to deduce the
distribution of the current for several other models, from its knowledge for
the symmetric simple exclusion process. In the range where the integrated
current $Q_t \sim \sqrt{t}$, we show that the non-Gaussian decay $\exp [-
Q_t^3/t]$ of the distribution of $Q_t$ is generic.
