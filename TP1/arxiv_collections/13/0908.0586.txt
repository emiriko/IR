Understanding the similar properties of people involved in group search
sessions has the potential to significantly improve collaborative search
systems; such systems could be enhanced by information retrieval algorithms and
user interface modifications that take advantage of important properties, for
example by re-ordering search results using information from group members'
combined user profiles. Understanding what makes group members similar can also
assist with the identification of groups, which can be valuable for connecting
users with others with whom they might undertake a collaborative search. In
this workshop paper, we describe our current research efforts towards studying
the properties of a variety of group types. We discuss properties of groups
that may be relevant to designers of collaborative search systems, and propose
ways in which understanding such properties could influence the design of
interfaces and algorithms for collaborative Web search.
