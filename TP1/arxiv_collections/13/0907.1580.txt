We exploit the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole to define closed algebra of the
quantum field operators and the BRST charge $Q_{BRST}$. In the first-class
configuration of the Dirac quantization, by including the $Q_{BRST}$-exact
gauge fixing term and the Faddeev-Popov ghost term, we find the BRST invariant
Hamiltonian to investigate the de Rham-type cohomology group structure for the
monopole system. The Bogomol'nyi bound is also discussed in terms of the
first-class topological charge defined on the extended internal 2-sphere.
