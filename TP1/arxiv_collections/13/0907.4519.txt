To investigate the formation and the propagation of relativistic shock waves
in viscous gluon matter we solve the relativistic Riemann problem using a
microscopic parton cascade. We demonstrate the transition from ideal to viscous
shock waves by varying the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio $\eta/s$.
We show that an $\eta/s$ ratio larger than 0.2 prevents the development of
well-defined shock waves on time scales typical for ultrarelativistic heavy-ion
collisions. These findings are confirmed by viscous hydrodynamic calculations.
