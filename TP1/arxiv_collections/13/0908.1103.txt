The main focus of this paper is to determine whether the thermodynamic
magnetization is a physically relevant estimator of the finite-size
magnetization. This is done by comparing the asymptotic behaviors of these two
quantities along parameter sequences converging to either a second-order point
or the tricritical point in the mean-field Blume--Capel model. We show that the
thermodynamic magnetization and the finite-size magnetization are asymptotic
when the parameter $\alpha$ governing the speed at which the sequence
approaches criticality is below a certain threshold $\alpha_0$. However, when
$\alpha$ exceeds $\alpha_0$, the thermodynamic magnetization converges to 0
much faster than the finite-size magnetization. The asymptotic behavior of the
finite-size magnetization is proved via a moderate deviation principle when
$0<\alpha<\alpha_0$ and via a weak-convergence limit when $\alpha >\alpha_0$.
To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first rigorous confirmation
of the statistical mechanical theory of finite-size scaling for a mean-field
model.
