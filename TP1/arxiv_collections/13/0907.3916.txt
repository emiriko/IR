The search for the next Standard Model of fundamental interactions is being
carried out at two frontiers: the high energy frontier involving the Tevatron
and Large Hadron Collider, and the high precision frontier where the focus is
largely on low energy experiments. I discuss the unique and powerful window on
new physics provided by the precision frontier and its complementarity to the
information we hope to gain from present and future colliders.
