In this Letter we present discrete wave turbulence (DWT) as a counterpart of
classical statistical wave turbulence (SWT). DWT is characterized by resonance
clustering, not by the size of clusters, i.e. it includes, but is not reduced
to, the study of low-dimensional systems. Clusters with integrable and chaotic
dynamics co-exist in different sub-spaces of the $\mathbf{k}$-space.
NR-diagrams are introduced, a handy graphical presentation of an arbitrary
resonance cluster allowing to reconstruct uniquely dynamical system describing
the cluster. DWT is shown to be a novel research field in nonlinear science,
with its own methods, achievements and application areas.
