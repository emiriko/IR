Constraints related to transformations of currents under space-time
translations have been considered for the relativistic quantum mechanics
calculation of form factors of J=0 systems composed of scalar constituents with
equal masses. Accounting for these constraints amounts to take into account
many-body currents that restore the equality of the momentum transferred
separately to the system and to the constituents, which holds in field-theory
approaches but is not generally fulfilled in relativistic quantum mechanics
ones. When this was done, discrepancies between results from different
approaches could be found to vanish. The results are extended here to systems
composed of spin-1/2 constituents with unequal masses. Moreover, as far as the
equivalence of different approaches is concerned, some intermediate step could
be skipped and the presentation of these results therefore slightly differs
from the previous one. Due to the technical aspect of present results, this
work is not aimed to be published but it could be useful for some applications
like the form factors of the pion or kaon particles.
