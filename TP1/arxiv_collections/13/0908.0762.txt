Is life a common outcome of physical and chemical processes in the universe?
Within our own solar system, a successful search for even primitive life, were
it to have an origin independent from life on Earth, would dramatically advance
a positive answer. The most stringent test for a second independent origin of
life on Earth would come from examination of either the most physically remote
from Earth, or the most exotic type, of planetary environments in which one
might plausibly imagine a form of life could exist. In this paper I argue that
Saturn's moon Titan is the best such target in our solar system. Further, Titan
might be a type example of a planetary environment abundant throughout the
cosmos.
