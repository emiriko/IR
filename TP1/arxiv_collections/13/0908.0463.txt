We propose a scheme for efficient cavity-enhanced nonlinear THz generation
via difference-frequency generation (DFG) processes using a triply resonant
system based on photonic crystal cavities. We show that high nonlinear overlap
can be achieved by coupling a THz cavity to a doubly-resonant,
dual-polarization near-infrared (e.g. telecom band) photonic-crystal nanobeam
cavity, allowing the mixing of three mutually orthogonal fundamental cavity
modes through a chi(2) nonlinearity. We demonstrate through coupled-mode theory
that complete depletion of the pump frequency - i.e., quantum-limited
conversion - is possible in an experimentally feasible geometry, with the
operating output power at the point of optimal total conversion efficiency
adjustable by varying the mode quality (Q) factors.
