Based on the Langevin description of the Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW),
we consider a generalization of CTRW in which the waiting times between the
subsequent jumps are correlated. We discuss the cases of exponential and slowly
decaying persistent power-law correlations between the waiting times as two
generic examples and obtain the corresponding mean squared displacements as
functions of time. In the case of exponential-type correlations the
(sub)diffusion at short times is slower than in the absence of correlations. At
long times the behavior of the mean squared displacement is the same as in
uncorrelated CTRW. For power-law correlations we find subdiffusion
characterized by the same exponent at all times, which appears to be smaller
than the one in uncorrelated CTRW. Interestingly, in the limiting case of an
extremely long power-law correlations, the (sub)diffusion exponent does not
tend to zero, but is bounded from below by the subdiffusion exponent
corresponding to a short time behavior in the case of exponential correlations.
