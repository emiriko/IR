The ground and $P$-wave excited states of $nnn$, $nns$ and $ssn$ baryons are
studied in the framework of the field correlator method using the running
strong coupling constant in the Coulomb-like part of the three-quark potential.
The string correction for the confinement potential of the orbitally excited
baryons, which is the leading contribution of the proper inertia of the
rotating strings, is estimated.
