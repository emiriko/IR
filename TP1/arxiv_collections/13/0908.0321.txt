We study the solid-on-solid interface model above a horizontal wall in three
dimensional space, with an attractive interaction when the interface is in
contact with the wall, at low temperatures. There is no bulk external field.
The system presents a sequence of layering transitions, whose levels increase
with the temperature, before reaching the wetting transition.
