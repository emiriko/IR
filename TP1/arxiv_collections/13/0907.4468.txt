In this paper correspondence between experimental data for packet delay and
two theoretical types of distribution is investigated. Calculations have shown
that the exponential distribution describes the data on network delay better,
than truncated normal distribution. Precision experimental data to within
microseconds are gathered by means of the RIPE Test Box. In addition to exact
measurements the data gathered by means of the utility {\em ping} has been
parsed that has not changed the main result. As a result, the equation for an
exponential distribution, in the best way describing process of packet delay in
a TCP/IP based network is written. The search algorithm for key parameters as
for normal, and an exponential distribution is resulted.
