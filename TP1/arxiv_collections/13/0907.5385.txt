The spectral density of the phi meson in a hot bath of nucleons and pions is
calculated by relating the vector meson self-energy to the forward scattering
amplitude, which is constrained by experimental data. Dispersion techniques are
used to verify the relationship between real and the imaginary parts of the
in-medium self energy. The position of the spectral peak of the phi meson is
found to be shifted from its vacuum position by only a small amount, but its
width is considerably increased.
