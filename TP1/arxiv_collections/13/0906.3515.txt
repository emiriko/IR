We report Suzaku observations of the galaxy cluster Abell 1795 that extend to
r_200 ~ 2 Mpc, the radius within which the mean cluster mass density is 200
times the cosmic critical density. These observations are the first to probe
the state of the intracluster medium in this object at r > 1.3 Mpc. We sample
two disjoint sectors in the cluster outskirts (1.3 < r < 1.9 Mpc) and detect
X-ray emission in only one of them to a limiting (3-sigma) soft X-ray surface
brightness of B(0.5-2 keV) = 1.8 x 10^-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2 deg^-2, a level less
than 20% of the cosmic X-ray background brightness. We trace the run of
temperature with radius at r > 0.4 Mpc and find that it falls relatively
rapidly (T ~ r^-0.9), reaching a value about one third of its peak at the
largest radius we can measure it. Assuming the intracluster medium is in
hydrostatic equilibrium and is polytropic, we find a polytropic index of 1.3
+0.3-0.2 and we estimate a mass of 4.1 +0.5-0.3 x 10^14 M_solar within 1.3 Mpc,
somewhat (2.7-sigma) lower than that reported by previous observers. However,
our observations provide evidence for departure from hydrostatic equilibrium at
radii as small as r ~ 1.3 Mpc ~ r_500 in this apparently regular and
symmetrical cluster.
