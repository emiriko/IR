The Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of magnetoexcitonic polaritons in a
graphene layer embedded in a optical microcavity in a high magnetic field $B$
is predicted. The essential property of this system (in contrast, e.g., to a
quantum well embedded in a cavity) is stronger influence of magnetic field and
weaker influence of disorder. A two-dimensional (2D) magnetoexcitonic
polaritons gas is considered in a planar harmonic electric field potential
applied to excitons or a parabolic shape of the optical cavity causing the
trapping of microcavity photons. It is shown that the effective polariton mass
$M_{\rm eff}$ increases with magnetic field as $B^{1/2}$. The BEC critical
temperature $T_{c}^{(0)}$ decreases as $B^{-1/4}$ and increases with the spring
constant of the parabolic trap. The Rabi splitting related to the creation of a
magnetoexciton in a high magnetic field in graphene is obtained.
