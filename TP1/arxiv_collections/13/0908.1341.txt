From the observed results of the space distribution of quasars we deduced
that neutrino mass is about 10^(-1) eV. The fourth stable elementary particle
(delta particle) with mass about 10^(0) eV can help explain the energy resource
mechanism in quasars, cosmic ultra-high energy particles, as well as the
flatness of spiral galaxy rotation curves. The blue bump and IR bump in the
quasar irradiation spectra, as well as the peaks of EBL (Extra-galactic
Background Light) around 10^(0) eV and 10^(-1) eV, are related to the
annihilation of delta particle with anti-delta particle and neutrino with
anti-neutrino respectively. This enlightens us to explore the reason for
missing solar neutrinos and the unlimited energy resource in a new manner. For
delta-particle search it is related to Dual SM or Two-fold SM; the relationship
between space electron spectrum (>10^(0)Tev) and cosmic ray spectrum (knee and
ankle) at high energy region; and the characteristics of spherical universe.
Appendix is the theory part, which related to mass tree, inflation, BSM, finite
universe.
