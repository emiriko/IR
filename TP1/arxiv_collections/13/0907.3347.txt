We investigate the cold fission of 252Cf within the two center shell model to
compute the potential energy surface. The fission yields are estimated by using
the semiclassical penetration approach. It turns out that the inner cold valley
of the total potential energy is strongly connected with Z=50 magic number. The
agreement with experimental values is very much improved only by considering
mass and charge asymmetry degrees of freedom. Thus, indeed cold fission of
252Cf is a Sn-like radioactivity, related the other two "magic
radioactivities", namely alpha-decay and heavy-cluster decay, called also
Pb-like radioactivity. This calculation provides the necessary theoretical
confidence to estimate the penetration cross section in producing superheavy
nuclei, by using the inverse fusion process.
