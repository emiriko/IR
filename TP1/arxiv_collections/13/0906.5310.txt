Caviglia et al. [Nature (London) 456, 624 (2008)] have found that the
superconducting LaAlO_3 / SrTiO_3 interface can be gate modulated. A central
issue is to determine the principal effect of the applied electric field. Using
magnetotransport studies of a gated structure, we find that the mobility
variation is almost five times as large as the sheet carrier density.
Furthermore, superconductivity can be suppressed at both positive and negative
gate bias. These results indicate that the relative disorder strength strongly
increases across the superconductor-insulator transition.
