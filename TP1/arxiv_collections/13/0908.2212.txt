The decay rates and spectroscopy of the $D$ and $D_s$ mesons are computed in
a nonrelativistic phenomenological quark-antiquark potential of the type
$V(r)=-{4/3}\frac{\alpha_s}{r}+A r^{\nu}$ with different choices of $\nu$.
Numerical method to solve the Schr\"odinger equation has been used to obtain
the spectroscopy of $q\bar{Q}$ mesons. The spin hyperfine, spin-orbit and
tensor components of the one gluon exchange interactions are employed to
compute the spectroscopy of the excited $S$ states, low lying $P$-waves and
$D$-waves. The numerically obtained radial solutions are employed to obtain the
decay constant and leptonic decay widths. It has been observed that predictions
of the spectroscopy and the decay widths are consistent with other model
predictions as well as with the known experimental values.
