We show that the low-energy electronic structure of graphene under a
one-dimensional inhomogeneous magnetic field can be mapped into that of
graphene under an electric field or vice versa. As a direct application of this
transformation, we find that the carrier velocity in graphene is isotropically
reduced under magnetic fields periodic along one direction with zero average
flux. This counterintuitive renormalization has its origin in the pseudospin
nature of graphene electronic states and is robust against disorder. In
magnetic graphene superlattices with a finite average flux, the Landau level
bandwidth at high fields exhibits an unconventional behavior of decreasing with
increasing strength of the average magnetic field due to the linear energy
dispersion of graphene. As another application of our transformation relation,
we show that the transmission probabilities of an electron through a magnetic
barrier in graphene can directly be obtained from those through an
electrostatic barrier or vice versa.
