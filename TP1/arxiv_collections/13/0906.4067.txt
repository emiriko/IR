The steady state existence problem for Kraichnan advected passive vector
models is considered for isotropic and anisotropic initial values in arbitrary
dimension. The model includes the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, linear
pressure model (LPM) and linearized Navier-Stokes (LNS) equations. In addition
to reproducing the previously known results for the MHD and linear pressure
model, we obtain the values of the Kraichnan model roughness parameter $\xi$
for which the LNS steady state exists.
