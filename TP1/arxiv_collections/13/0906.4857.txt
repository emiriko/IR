Void models provide a possible explanation of the "accelerated expansion" of
the Universe without dark energy. To make the conventional void models more
realistic, we allow the void, an underdense region around us, to be anisotropic
and consider an average of the distance-redshift relations over the solid angle
subtended at the observer. We first show that after taking the average of a
form of the optical scalar equation (distance equation), the effective distance
equation we obtain coincides with the one for the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi
universe with a Dyer-Roeder-like extension. We then numerically solve the
equation to compare with observational data of Type Ia supernovae. We find that
anisotropy allows smaller size of void and larger Omega_m.
