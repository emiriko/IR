The quantum normal form approach to quantum transition state theory is used
to compute the cumulative reaction probability for collinear exchange
reactions. It is shown that for heavy atom systems like the nitrogen exchange
reaction the quantum normal form approach gives excellent results and has major
computational benefits over full reactive scattering approaches. For light atom
systems like the hydrogen exchange reaction however the quantum normal approach
is shown to give only poor results. This failure is attributed to the
importance of tunnelling trajectories in light atom reactions that are not
captured by the quantum normal form as indicated by the only very slow
convergence of the quantum normal form for such systems.
