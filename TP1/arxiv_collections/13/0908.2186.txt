We study the potential LHC discovery of the Z1 KK gauge boson unitarizing
longitudinal W+W- scattering amplitude. In particular, we explore the decay
mode Z1->t tbar along with Z1-> W+W- without specifying the branching
fractions. We propose to exploit the associated production pp-> W Z1, and
select the final state of like-sign dileptons plus multijets and large missing
energy. We conclude that it is possible to observe the Z1 resonance at a 5
sigma level with an integrated luminosity of 100 inverse fb at the LHC upto 650
GeV for a dominant WW channel, and 560 GeV for a dominant ttbar channel.
