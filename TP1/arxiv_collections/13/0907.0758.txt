Motivated by recent cosmic ray experimental results there has been a
proposition for a scenario where a secluded dark matter particle annihilates,
primarily, into Standard Model leptons through a low mass mediator particle. We
consider several varieties of this scenario depending on the type of mixing
among gauge bosons and we study the implications in novel direct dark matter
experiments for detecting low energy recoiling electrons. We find significant
event rates and time modulation effects, especially in the case where the
mediator is massless, that may be complementary to those from recoiling nuclei.
