We generalize the discrete quantum walk on the line using a time dependent
unitary coin operator. We find an analytical relation between the long-time
behaviors of the standard deviation and the coin operator. Selecting the coin
time sequence allows to obtain a variety of predetermined asymptotic
wave-function spreadings: ballistic, sub-ballistic, diffusive, sub-diffusive
and localized.
