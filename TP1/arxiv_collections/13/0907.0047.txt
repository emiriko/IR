In this paper we present high resolution 4.7micron spectra of the isolated
Herbig Be star HD100546. HD100546 has been the subject of intense scrutiny
because it is a young nearby star with a transitional disk. We observe the
Delta v=1 ro-vibrational CO transitions in order to clarify the distribution of
warm gas in the inner disk. Modeling of the CO spectrum indicates that the gas
is vibrationally excited by collisions and UV fluorescence. The observed
emission extends from 13-100AU. The inner edge of the molecular gas emission is
consistent with the inner edge of the optically thick dust disk indicating that
the inner hole is not simply a hole in the dust opacity but is likely cleared
of gas as well. The rotational temperature of the CO is ~1000K - much hotter
than the ~200K CO in the otherwise similar transitional disk surrounding
HD141569. The origin of this discrepancy is likely linked to the brighter PAH
emission observed toward HD100546. We use the excitation of the CO to constrain
the geometry of the inner disk and comment on the evolutionary state of the
system.
