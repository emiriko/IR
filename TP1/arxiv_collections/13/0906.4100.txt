TWA22 was initially regarded as a member of the TW Hydrae association (TWA).
In addition to being one of the youngest (~8Myr) and nearest (~20pc) stars to
Earth, TWA22 has proven to be very interesting after being resolved as a tight,
very low-mass binary. This binary can serve as a very useful dynamical
calibrator for pre-main sequence evolutionary models. However, its membership
in the TWA has been recently questioned despite due to the lack of accurate
kinematic measurements.
  Based on proper motion, radial velocity, and trigonometric parallax
measurements, we aim here to re-analyze the membership of TWA22 to young,
nearby associations.
  Using the ESO NTT/SUSI2 telescope, we observed TWA22AB during 5 different
observing runs over 1.2 years to measure its trigonometric parallax and proper
motion. This is a part of a larger project measuring trigonometric parallaxes
and proper motions of most known TWA members at a sub-milliarcsec level. HARPS
at the ESO 3.6m telescope was also used to measure the system's radial velocity
over 2 years.
  We report an absolute trigonometric parallax of TWA22AB, 57.0mas,
corresponding to a distance 17.5pc from Earth. Measured proper motions of
TWA22AB are -175.8mas/yr in right ascension and -21.3mas/yr in declination.
Finally, from HARPS measurements, we obtain a radial velocity 14.8km/s.
