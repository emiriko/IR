This paper considers the average consensus problem on a network of digital
links, and proposes a set of algorithms based on pairwise ''gossip''
communications and updates. We study the convergence properties of such
algorithms with the goal of answering two design questions, arising from the
literature: whether the agents should encode their communication by a
deterministic or a randomized quantizer, and whether they should use, and how,
exact information regarding their own states in the update.
