Str\"omgren uvby-beta photometry is reported for the RR Lyrae stars AE, RS,
ST, TV, TW, UU, and XX in Bootes. The physical parameters M/Mo, log (L/Lo),
M_V, log T_eff and [Fe/H], have been estimated from the Fourier decomposition
of the light curves and the empirical calibrations developed for this type of
stars. Detailed behavior of the stars along the cycle of pulsation has been
determined from the observed photometric indices and the synthetic indices from
atmospheric models. The reddening of the zone is found to be negligible, as
estimated from the reddening of several objects in the same region of the sky.
Hence the distances to the individual objects are also estimated.
