We study lepton flavor-violating (LFV) processes within a supersymmetric
type-I seesaw framework with flavor-blind universal boundary conditions,
properly accounting for the effect of the neutrino sector on the dark matter
relic abundance. We consider several possibilities for the neutrino Yukawa
coupling matrix and show that in regions of SUSY parameter space that yield the
correct neutralino relic density, LFV rates can differ from naive estimates by
up to two orders of magnitude. Contrary to common belief, we find that current
LFV limits do not exclude neutrino Yukawa couplings larger than top Yukawa
couplings. We introduce the ISAJET-M program that was used for the
computations.
