Nuclear fission energy is considered to be somewhere between the holy grail,
required to solve all energy worries of the human industrialized civilization,
and a fast path directly to hell. Discussions about future energy sources and
the possible contribution from nuclear energy are often dominated by variations
of fundamentalists and often irrational approaches. As a result, very little is
known by the general public and even by decision makers about the contribution
of nuclear energy today, about uranium supplies, uranium resources and current
and future technological challenges and limitations.
  This analysis about nuclear energy and its contribution for tomorrow tries to
shed light on the nuclear reality and its limitations in the near and long term
future. The report, presented in four chapters, is based essentially on the
data provided in the documents from the IAEA (International Atomic Energy
Administration) and the NEA (the Nuclear Energy Agency from the OECD countries,
the WNA (World Nuclear Association) and the IEA (International Energy Agency).
