Since the discovery of the X(3872) in 2003 the B-factory experiments BaBar
and Belle have been driving forces in the spectroscopy of new charmonium-like
states. In this article the latest results on the decays X(3872) -> D0 D*0bar
and X(3872) -> psi gamma, where psi stands for J/psi or psi(2S), are presented
and analyses of Z(4430)+ -> psi pi+ and Z(4050/4250)+ -> chi_c1 pi+ are
discussed.
