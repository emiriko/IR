A new universal model to implement the Seiberg-Witten approach to low-energy
properties of the supersymmetric N=2 gauge theory with an arbitrary compact
simple gauge group, classical or exceptional, is suggested. It is based on the
hyperelliptic curve, whose genus equals the rank of the gauge group. The weak
and strong coupling limits are reproduced. The magnetic and electric charges of
light dyons, which are present in the proposed model comply with recent
predictions derived from the general properties of the theory. The discrete
chiral symmetry is implemented, the duality condition is reproduced, and
connections between monodromies at weak and strong coupling are established. It
is found that the spectra of monopoles and dyons are greatly simplified when
vectors representing the scalar and dual fields in the Cartan algebra are
aligned along the Weyl vector. This general feature of the theory is used for
an additional verification of the model. The model predicts the identical
analytic structures of the coupling constants for the theories based on the
SU(r+1) and Sp(2r) gauge groups.
