We discuss jet production at forward rapidities at the LHC. In this region
QCD logarithmic corrections in the hard transverse momentum and in the large
rapidity interval may both be quantitatively significant. We describe results
of using high-energy factorization techniques, which allow one to take into
account both kinds of corrections to higher orders in QCD.
