The group-theoretical method used to derive horizontal symmetry from neutrino
mixing is reviewed and expanded. Some misunderstanding in the literature
regarding the result is clarified. The method used previously to find vacuum
alignments of $S_4$ is applied to compute those of $A_4$ and $S_3$. A study of
effective theories based on these three groups shows that in each case there
are just enough free parameters to fit all the masses and the remaining mixing
parameters. This places constraint on dynamical models because effective
theories are just dynamical models with the right-handed fermions integrated
out.
  How quarks may fit into this scheme is briefly discussed.
