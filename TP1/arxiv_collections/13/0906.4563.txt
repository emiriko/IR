It is not widely appreciated that many subtleties are involved in the
accurate measurement of intensity-correlated photons; even for the original
experiments of Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT). Using a monolithic 4x4 array of
single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs), together with an off-chip algorithm for
processing streaming data, we investigate the difficulties of measuring
second-order photon correlations g2 in a wide variety of light fields that
exhibit dramatically different correlation statistics: a multimode He-Ne laser,
an incoherent intensity-modulated lamp-light source and a thermal light source.
Our off-chip algorithm treats multiple photon-arrivals at pixel-array pairs, in
any observation interval, with photon fluxes limited by detector saturation, in
such a way that a correctly normalized g2 function is guaranteed. The impact of
detector background correlations between SPAD pixels and afterpulsing effects
on second-order coherence measurements is discussed. These results demonstrate
that our monolithic SPAD array enables access to effects that are otherwise
impossible to measure with stand-alone detectors.
