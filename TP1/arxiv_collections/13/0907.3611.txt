We present a uniform asymptotic expansion of the wobbling kink to any order
in the amplitude of the wobbling mode. The long-range behaviour of the
radiation is described by matching the asymptotic expansions in the far field
and near the core of the kink. The complex amplitude of the wobbling mode is
shown to obey a simple ordinary differential equation with nonlinear damping.
We confirm the $t^{-1/2}$-decay law for the amplitude which was previously
obtained on the basis of energy considerations.
