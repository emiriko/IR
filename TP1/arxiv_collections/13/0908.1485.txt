This paper considers a class of deploy and search strategies for multi-robot
systems and evaluates their performance. The application framework used is a
system of autonomous mobile robots equipped with required sensors and
communication equipment deployed in a search space to gather information. The
lack of information about the search space is modeled as an uncertainty density
distribution over the search space. A {\em combined deploy and search} (CDS)
strategy has been formulated as a modification to {\em sequential deploy and
search} (SDS) strategy presented in our previous work. The optimal deployment
strategy using Voronoi partition forms the basis for these two search
strategies. The strategies are analyzed in presence of constraints on robot
speed and limit on sensor range for convergence of trajectories with
corresponding control laws responsible for the motion of robots. SDS and CDS
strategies are compared with standard greedy and random search strategies on
the basis of time taken to achieve reduction in the uncertainty density below a
desired level. The simulation experiments reveal several important issues
related to the dependence of the relative performances of the strategies on
parameters such as number of robots, speed of robots, and their sensor range
limits.
