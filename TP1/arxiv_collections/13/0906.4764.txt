In this paper, we propose a bid optimizer for sponsored keyword search
auctions which leads to better retention of advertisers by yielding attractive
utilities to the advertisers without decreasing the revenue to the search
engine. The bid optimizer is positioned as a key value added tool the search
engine provides to the advertisers. The proposed bid optimizer algorithm
transforms the reported values of the advertisers for a keyword into a
correlated bid profile using many ideas from cooperative game theory. The
algorithm is based on a characteristic form game involving the search engine
and the advertisers. Ideas from Nash bargaining theory are used in formulating
the characteristic form game to provide for a fair share of surplus among the
players involved. The algorithm then computes the nucleolus of the
characteristic form game since we find that the nucleolus is an apt way of
allocating the gains of cooperation among the search engine and the
advertisers. The algorithm next transforms the nucleolus into a correlated bid
profile using a linear programming formulation. This bid profile is input to a
standard generalized second price mechanism (GSP) for determining the
allocation of sponsored slots and the prices to be be paid by the winners. The
correlated bid profile that we determine is a locally envy-free equilibrium and
also a correlated equilibrium of the underlying game. Through detailed
simulation experiments, we show that the proposed bid optimizer retains more
customers than a plain GSP mechanism and also yields better long-run utilities
to the search engine and the advertisers.
