Recent measurements of the top quark charge asymmetry at Tevatron disfavor
the existence of flavor universal axigluons and colorons at 2 sigmas. In this
letter we explore the possibility to reconcile the data with these models and
use the charge asymmetry and the invariant mass distribution of top-antitop
quark pair events to constrain the mass and couplings of massive color-octet
gauge bosons decaying to top quarks.
