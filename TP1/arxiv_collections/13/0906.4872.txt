The problem of the movement of the drops in a continuous environment
represents a fundamental step for the study of two phases flows. Their domains
of application are enormous as: the combustion of the rooms of the machines
thermal, extraction of a liquid of another liquid, catalyst used to trigger the
chemical reactions occurring in access points, sparkling absorption by the
drops of water in meteorology. The object of our work is to translate the
movement of the immiscibles drops in water by a relation expressing the
terminal velocity of the drop according to her equivalent diameter. This
relation although theoretical has been validated by the experimental and
numeric model.
