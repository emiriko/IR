The use of the spin of the electron as the ultimate logic bit - in what has
been dubbed spintronics - can lead to a novel way of thinking about information
flow. At the same time single layer graphene has been the subject of intense
research due to both its fundamental properties as well as its potential
application in nanoscale electronics. While defects can significantly alter the
electronic properties of nanoscopic systems, the lack of control can lead to
seemingly deleterious effects arising from the random arrangement of such
impurities. Here we demonstrate, using {\it ab initio} density functional
theory and non-equilibrium Green's functions calculations, that it is possible
to obtain perfect spin selectivity in doped graphene nanoribbons to produce a
perfect spin filter. We show that initially unpolarized electrons entering the
system give rise to 100% polarization of the current due to random disorder.
This effect is explained in terms of different localization lengths for each
spin channel which together with the well know exponential dependence of the
conductance on the length of the device leads to a new mechanism for the spin
filtering effect that is enhanced by disorder.
