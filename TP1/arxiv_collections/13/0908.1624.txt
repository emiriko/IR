AG Draconis produces a strong supersoft X-ray emission.The X-ray and
optical/UV fluxes are in a strict anticorrelation throughout the active and
quiescent phases. The aim of this contribution is to identify the source of the
X-ray emission and reveal the nature of the observed flux anticorrelation. For
this purpose we model the X-ray and UV observations with XMM-Newton, far-UV
spectroscopy from FUSE, low- and high-resolution IUE spectra and
optical/near-IR spectroscopic and/or photometric observations. Our analysis
showed that the supersoft X-ray emission is produced by the white dwarf
photosphere. The X-ray and far-UV fluxes make it possible to determine its
temperature unambiguously. The supersoft X-ray--optical/UV flux anticorrelation
is caused by the variable wind from the hot star. The enhanced hot star wind
gives rise to the optical bursts by reprocessing high-energy photons from the
Lyman continuum to the optical/UV.
