The state space of Loop Quantum Gravity admits a decomposition into
orthogonal subspaces associated to diffeomorphism equivalence classes of
spin-network graphs. In this paper I investigate the possibility of obtaining
this state space from the quantization of a topological field theory with many
degrees of freedom. The starting point is a 3-manifold with a network of
defect-lines. A locally-flat connection on this manifold can have non-trivial
holonomy around non-contractible loops. This is in fact the mathematical origin
of the Aharonov-Bohm effect. I quantize this theory using standard field
theoretical methods. The functional integral defining the scalar product is
shown to reduce to a finite dimensional integral over moduli space. A
non-trivial measure given by the Faddeev-Popov determinant is derived. I argue
that the scalar product obtained coincides with the one used in Loop Quantum
Gravity. I provide an explicit derivation in the case of a single defect-line,
corresponding to a single loop in Loop Quantum Gravity. Moreover, I discuss the
relation with spin-networks as used in the context of spin foam models.
