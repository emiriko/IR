Single crystals of superconducting BaFe$_{1.8}$Co$_{0.2}$As$_2$ were exposed
to neutron irradiation in a fission reactor. The introduced defects decrease
the superconducting transition temperature (by about 0.3 K) and the upper
critical field anisotropy (e.g. from 2.8 to 2.5 at 22 K) and enhance the
critical current densities by a factor of up to about 3. These changes are
discussed in the context of similar experiments on other superconducting
materials.
