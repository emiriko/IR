We investigate the influence of couplings among continuum states in
collisions of weakly bound nuclei. For this purpose, we compare cross sections
for complete fusion, breakup and elastic scattering evaluated by continuum
discretized coupled channel (CDCC) calculations, including and not including
these couplings. In our study, we discuss this influence in terms of the
polarization potentials that reproduce the elastic wave function of the coupled
coupled channel method in single channel calculations. We find that the
inclusion of couplings among the continuum states renders the real part of the
polarization potential more repulsive, whereas it leads to weaker apsorption to
the breakup channel. We show that the non-inclusion of continuum-continuum
couplings in CDCC calculations may not lead to qualitative and quantitative
wrong conclusions.
