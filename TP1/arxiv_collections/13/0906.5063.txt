Let G be a simple algebraic group over an algebraically closed field k of bad
characteristic. We classify the spherical unipotent conjugacy classes of G. We
also show that if the characteristic of k is 2, then the fixed point subgroup
of every involutorial automorphism (involution) of G is a spherical subgroup of
G.
