Context: Sodium laser guide stars (LGS) are about to enter a new range of
laser powers. Previous theoretical and numerical methods are inadequate for
accurate computations of the return flux and hence for the design of the
next-generation LGS systems.
  Aims: We numerically optimize the cw (continuous wave) laser format, in
particular the light polarization and spectrum.
  Methods: Using Bloch equations, we simulate the mesospheric sodium atoms,
including Doppler broadening, saturation, collisional relaxation, Larmor
precession, and recoil, taking into account all 24 sodium hyperfine states and
on the order of 100 velocity groups.
  Results: LGS return flux is limited by "three evils": Larmor precession due
to the geomagnetic field, atomic recoil due to radiation pressure, and
transition saturation. We study their impacts and show that the return flux can
be boosted by repumping (simultaneous excitation of the sodium D2a and D2b
lines with 10-20% of the laser power in the latter).
  Conclusions: We strongly recommend the use of circularly polarized lasers and
repumping. As a rule of thumb, the bandwidth of laser radiation in MHz (at each
line) should approximately equal the launched laser power in Watts divided by
six, assuming a diffraction-limited spot size.
