The understanding of the interaction of nucleons in nuclear and neutron-rich
matter at non-zero temperature is important for a variety of applications
ranging from heavy-ion collisions to nuclear astrophysics. In this paper we
apply the Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock method along with the Bonn B
nucleon-nucleon potential to predict single-particle properties in symmetric
nuclear matter and pure neutron matter at finite temperature. It is found that
temperature effects are generally small but can be significant at low density
and momentum.
