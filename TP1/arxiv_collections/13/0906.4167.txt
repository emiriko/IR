We derive Huygens' principle for electrodynamics in terms of 4-vector
potentials defined as distributions supported on a surface surrounding the
charge-current density. By combining the Pauli algebra with distribution
theory, a compact and conceptually simple derivation of the Stratton-Chu and
Kottler-Franz equations is obtained. These are extended to freely moving
integration surfaces, so that the fields due to charge distributions in
arbitrary motion are represented. A further generalization is obtained to
multiple surfaces, which can be used to enclose clusters of transmitters,
scatterers and receivers.
