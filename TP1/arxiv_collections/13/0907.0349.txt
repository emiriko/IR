The necessity of rejecting the numerical model of geometrical extension is
postulated on the basis of the idea of identity of space-time and physical
vacuum. An attempt is made to define space-time not via the concept of
manifold, but via the store of physical functions defined on it. The new
description is based on the commutator representation of the causal structure
of operator field theory. It is not the world point, but a universal field
supermatrix complex U that is assumed to be the carrier of possible local
events. This complex involves a complete set of Heisenberg local field
operators together with their spin-group bases in the Fermi-field
representation. The fundamental element of the extension is described in the
model by the equation of a special commutator algebra closed on two such local
complexes U_1 and U_2 "nearest" in the two-sided light-like connection and
linked by a single virtual field interaction vertex. The discrete character of
the constructed "quantum proximity" equation containing the gravitational
constant is associated with the existence of local curvature on the Planck
scale. Algebraic closed-ness of the basic equation suggests that the charge
symmetry group should be group E_6 with non-standard representations of the
fermion and scalar fields. On the basis of the calculated U expression we
propose an effective superinvariant Lagrangian with fixed coefficients on the
near-Planck scale, from which one can in principle try to obtain a low-energy
limit for comparison with the real world.
