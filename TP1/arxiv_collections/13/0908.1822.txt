Hybrid molecular dynamics/Monte Carlo simulations used to study melts of
unentangled, thermoreversibly associating supramolecular polymers. In this
first of a series of papers, we describe and validate a model that is effective
in separating the effects of thermodynamics and chemical kinetics on the
dynamics and mechanics of these systems, and is extensible to arbitrarily
nonequilibrium situations and nonlinear mechanical properties. We examine the
model's quiescent (and heterogeneous) dynamics, nonequilibrium chemical
dynamics, and mechanical properties. Many of our results may be understood in
terms of the crossover from diffusion-limited to kinetically-limited sticky
bond recombination, which both influences and is influenced by polymer physics,
i. e. the connectivity of the parent chains.
