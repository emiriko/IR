The phenomenon of giant radio pulses (GRP) from the Crab Pulsar can be
studied at gamma-ray energies using atmospheric-Cherenkov telescopes such as
VERITAS and the SGARFACE experiment attached to the Whipple 10 m telescope.
Although these instruments are generally used for very-high-energy gamma-ray
astronomy above 100 GeV, they also provide substantial sensitivity to short
bursts of photons above 100 MeV lasting up to 15 $\mu$s. Motivated by the
theoretical predictions for short microsecond-scale GeV bursts as counterparts
to GRPs \cite{Lyutikov2007}, we report on a search for gamma-ray emission using
simultaneous observations of the Crab Pulsar taken with VERITAS and the
SGARFACE experiment.
