It is shown that random quantum spin systems with centered disorder satisfy
correlation inequalities previously proved (arXiv:cond-mat/0612371) in the
classical case. Consequences include monotone approach of pressure and ground
state energy to the thermodynamic limit. Signs and bounds on the surface
pressures for different boundary conditions are also derived for finite range
potentials.
