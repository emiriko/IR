Current-voltage characteristics of H2-Au molecular junctions exhibit
intriguing steps around a characteristic voltage of 40 mV. Surprisingly, we
find that a hysteresis is connected to these steps with a typical time scale >
10 ms. This time constant scales linearly with the power dissipated in the
junction beyond an ofset power P_s = IV_s. We propose that the hysteresis is
related to vibrational heating of both the molecule in the junction and a set
of surrounding hydrogen molecules. Remarkably, we can engineer our junctions
such that the hysteresis' characteristic time becomes >days. We demonstrate
that reliable switchable devices can be built from such junctions.
