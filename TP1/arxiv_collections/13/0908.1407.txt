An energy efficient distributed Change Detection scheme based on Page's CUSUM
algorithm was presented in \cite{icassp}. In this paper we consider a
nonparametric version of this algorithm. In the algorithm in \cite{icassp},
each sensor runs CUSUM and transmits only when the CUSUM is above some
threshold. The transmissions from the sensors are fused at the physical layer.
The channel is modeled as a Multiple Access Channel (MAC) corrupted with noise.
The fusion center performs another CUSUM to detect the change. In this paper,
we generalize the algorithm to also include nonparametric CUSUM and provide a
unified analysis.
