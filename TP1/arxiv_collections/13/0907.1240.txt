The possibility of the decomposition of the three dimensional (3D)
Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) into a pair of coupled Schr\"{o}dinger-type
equations, is investigated. It is shown that, under suitable mathematical
conditions, solutions of the 3D controlled GPE can be constructed from the
solutions of a 2D linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (transverse component of the
GPE) coupled with a 1D nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (longitudinal
component of the GPE). Such a decomposition, called the 'controlling potential
method' (CPM), allows one to cast the above solutions in the form of the
product of the solutions of the transverse and the longitudinal components of
the GPE. The coupling between these two equations is the functional of both the
transverse and the longitudinal profiles. The analysis shows that the CPM is
based on the variational principle that sets up a condition on the controlling
potential well, and whose physical interpretation is given in terms of the
minimization of the (energy) effects introduced by the control operation.
