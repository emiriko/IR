We report a study of the 16.5 GHz dielectric function of hydrogenated and
deuterated organic salts (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$. The temperature behavior of the
dielectric function is consistent with short-range polar order whose relaxation
time decreases rapidly below the charge ordering temperature. If this
transition has more a relaxor character in the hydrogenated salt, charge
ordering is strengthened in the deuterated one where the transition temperature
has increased by more than thirty percent. Anomalies in the dielectric function
are also observed in the spin-Peierls ground state revealing some intricate
lattice effects in a temperature range where both phases coexist. The variation
of the spin-Peierls ordering temperature under magnetic field appears to follow
a mean-field prediction despite the presence of spin-Peierls fluctuations over
a very wide temperature range in the charge ordered state of these salts.
