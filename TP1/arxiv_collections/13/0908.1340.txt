Calculating highly accurate thermochemical properties of condensed matter via
wave function-based approaches (such as e.g. Hartree-Fock or hybrid
functionals) has recently attracted much interest. We here present two
strategies providing accurate Hartree-Fock energies for solid LiH in a large
Gaussian basis set and applying periodic boundary conditions. The total
energies were obtained using two different approaches, namely a supercell
evaluation of Hartree-Fock exchange using a truncated Coulomb operator and an
extrapolation toward the full-range Hartree-Fock limit of a Pad\'e fit to a
series of short-range screened Hartree-Fock calculations. These two techniques
agreed to significant precision. We also present the Hartree-Fock cohesive
energy of LiH (converged to within sub-meV) at the experimental equilibrium
volume as well as the Hartree-Fock equilibrium lattice constant and bulk
modulus.
