A recently proposed algorithm to obtain global solutions of the double
confluent Heun equation is applied to solve the quantum mechanical problem of
finding the energies and wave functions of a particle bound in a potential sum
of a repulsive supersingular term, Ar(-4), plus an attractive Coulombian one,
-Zr(-1). The existence of exact algebraic solutions for certain values of A is
discussed.
