We present a theory for the coagulation reaction A+A -> A for particles
moving subdiffusively in one dimension. Our theory is tested against numerical
simulations of the concentration of $A$ particles as a function of time
(``anomalous kinetics'') and of the interparticle distribution function as a
function of interparticle distance and time. We find that the theory captures
the correct behavior asymptotically and also at early times, and that it does
so whether the particles are nearly diffusive or very subdiffusive. We find
that, as in the normal diffusion problem, an interparticle gap responsible for
the anomalous kinetics develops and grows with time. This corrects an earlier
claim to the contrary on our part.
