Data on multimode Cepheids from OGLE-III catalog of the LMC Cepheids are
confronted with results from model calculations. Models whose radial mode
periods are consistent with observation are not always in agreement with
published evolutionary models. Nonradial mode interpretation is considered for
the cases of unusual period ratios. The greatest challenge for stellar
pulsation theory is explanation of double-mode pulsators with period ratios
near 0.6.
