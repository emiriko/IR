An analytical solution is found for neutron reflection coefficients from
magnetic mirrors with fan-like magnetization. The main feature of the
reflection curves related to this type of magnetization is pointed out. The
results of calculations for some parameters of the system are presented. Time
parity and detailed balance violation in the model are discussed.
