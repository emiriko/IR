We argue that verification of recursive programs by means of the assertional
method of C.A.R. Hoare can be conceptually simplified using a modular
reasoning. In this approach some properties of the program are established
first and subsequently used to establish other program properties. We
illustrate this approach by providing a modular correctness proof of the
Quicksort program.
