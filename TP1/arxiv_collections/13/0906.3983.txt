We study pseudogap behaviors of ultracold Fermi gases in the BCS-BEC
crossover region. We calculate the density of states (DOS), as well as the
single-particle spectral weight, above the superfluid transition temperature
$T_{\rm c}$ including pairing fluctuations within a $T$-matrix approximation.
We find that DOS exhibits a pseudogap structure in the BCS-BEC crossover
region, which is most remarkable near the unitarity limit. We determine the
pseudogap temperature $T^*$ at which the pseudogap structure in DOS disappears.
We also introduce another temperature $T^{**}$ at which the BCS-like
double-peak structure disappears in the spectral weight. While one finds
$T^*>T^{**}$ in the BCS regime, $T^{**}$ becomes higher than $T^*$ in the
crossover and BEC regime. We also determine the pseudogap region in the phase
diagram in terms of temperature and pairing interaction.
