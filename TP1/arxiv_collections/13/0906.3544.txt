We describe a method to explore the configurational phase space of chemical
systems. It is based on the nested sampling algorithm recently proposed by
Skilling [Skilling J. (2004) In AIP Conference Proceedings, vol. 735, p. 395.;
Skilling J. (2006) J of Bayesian Analysis 1:833-860.] and allows us to explore
the entire potential energy surface (PES) efficiently in an unbiased way. The
algorithm has two parameters which directly control the trade-off between the
resolution with which the space is explored and the computational cost. We
demonstrate the use of nested sampling on Lennard-Jones (LJ) clusters. Nested
sampling provides a straightforward approximation for the partition function,
thus evaluating expectation values of arbitrary smooth operators at arbitrary
temperatures becomes a simple post-processing step. Access to absolute free
energies allows us to determine the temperature-density phase diagram for LJ
cluster stability. Even for relatively small clusters, the efficiency gain over
parallel tempering in calculating the heat capacity is more than an order of
magnitude. Furthermore, by analysing the topology of the resulting samples we
are able to visualise the PES in a new and illuminating way. We identify a
discretely valued order parameter with basins and supra-basins of the PES
allowing a straightforward and unambiguous definition of macroscopic states of
an atomistic system and the evaluation of the associated free energies.
