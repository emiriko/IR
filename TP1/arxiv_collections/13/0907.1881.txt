Cavity quantum-electrodynamics experiments using an atom coupled to a single
radiation-field mode have played a central role in testing foundations of
quantum mechanics, thus motivating solid-state implementations using single
quantum dots coupled to monolithic nano-cavities. In stark contrast to their
atom based counterparts, the latter experiments revealed strong cavity
emission, even when the quantum dot is far off resonance. Here we present
experimental and theoretical results demonstrating that this effect arises from
the mesoscopic nature of quantum dot confinement, ensuring the presence of a
quasi-continuum of transitions between excited quantum dot states that are
enhanced by the cavity mode. Our model fully explains photon correlation
measurements demonstrating that photons emitted at the cavity frequency are
essentially uncorrelated with each other even though they are generated by a
single quantum dot.
