We report lattice computations in SU(N_c) pure gauge theory, where N_c is
increased beyond the physical value of 3. We demonstrate two-loop scaling of
T_c, thus obtaining the variation of T_c/Lambda_MSbar with N_c, and fixing the
temperature scale. We study the equation of state of the gluoN_c plasma, the
conformal anomaly, and the approach to the weak coupling theory. We find that
the weak-coupling prediction is always closer to the lattice data than the
conformal field theory is.
