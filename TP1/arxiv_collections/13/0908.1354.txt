In this paper the implications of a recently proposed phenomenological model
of cosmology, the Asymptotic Cosmological Model (ACM), on the behavior of
scalar perturbations are studied. Firstly we discuss new fits of the ACM at the
homogeneous level, including fits to the Type Ia Supernovae UNION dataset,
first CMB peak of WMAP5 and BAOs. The linearized equations of scalar
perturbations in the FRW metric are derived. A simple model is used to compute
the CMB temperature perturbation spectrum. The results are compared with the
treatment of perturbations in other approaches to the problem of the
accelerated expansion of the universe.
