Using well-known methods we generalize (hyper)virial theorems to case of
singular potential. Discussion is performed for most general second order
differential equation, which involves all physically interesting cases, as
Schrodinger and Klein-Gordon equations with singular potentials. Some physical
consequences are discussed. The connection with Feynman-Hellmann like theorems
are also considered and some relevant differences are underlined.
