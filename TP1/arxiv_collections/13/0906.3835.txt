We review some recent extensions of the Ginzburg-Landau model able to
describe several properties of non-conventional superconductors. In the first
extension, s-wave superconductors endowed with two different critical
temperatures are considered, their main thermodynamical and magnetic properties
being calculated and discussed. Instead in the second extension we describe
spin-triplet superconductivity (with a single critical temperature), studying
in detail the main predicted physical properties. A thorough discussion of the
peculiar predictions of our models and their physical consequences is as well
performed.
