The cosmic star formation rate, AGN activity, galaxy growth, mass assembly
and morphological differentiation all culminate at redshift $\sim 2$. Yet, the
redshift interval $1.4\lsim z\lsim 3$ is harder to explore than the closer and
the more distant Universe. In spite of so much action taking place in this
spacetime portion of the Universe, it has been dubbed the ``Redshift Desert'',
as if very little was happening within its boundaries. The difficulties
encountered in properly mapping the galaxy populations inhabiting the Desert
are illustrated in this paper, along with some possible remedy.
