We study the nonlinear hopping transport in one-dimensional rings and open
channels. Analytical results are derived for the stationary current response to
a constant bias without assuming any specific coupling to the external fields.
It is shown that anomalous large effective jump lengths, as observed in recent
experiments by taking the ratio of the third order nonlinear and the linear
conductivity, can occur already in ordered systems. Rectification effects due
to site energy disorder in ring systems are expected to become irrelevant for
large system sizes. In open channels in contrast, rectification effects occur
already for disorder in the jump barriers and do not vanish in the
thermodynamic limit. Numerical solutions for a sinusoidal bias show that the
ring system provides a good description for the transport behavior in the open
channel for intermediate and high frequencies. For low frequencies temporal
variations in the mean particle number have to be taken into account in the
open channel, which cannot be captured in the more simple ring model.
