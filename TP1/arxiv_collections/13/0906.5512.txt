We discuss the production of two pion pairs in photon collisions at high
energies as it can take place in ultraperipheral collisions at hadron colliders
such as the LHC. We calculate the according matrix elements in kT factorization
and discuss the possibility to reveal the existence of the perturbative Odderon
by charge asymmetries.
