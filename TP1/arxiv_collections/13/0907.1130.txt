Many entanglement distillation schemes use either universal random hashing or
breeding as their final step to obtain almost perfect shared EPR pairs. In
spite of a high yield, the hardness of decoding a random linear code makes the
use of random hashing and breeding infeasible in practice. In this pilot study,
we analyze the performance of the recurrence method, a well-known entanglement
distillation scheme, with its final random hashing or breeding procedure being
replaced by various efficiently decodable quantum codes. Among all the
replacements investigated, the one using a certain adaptive quantum low density
parity check (QLDPC) code is found to give the highest yield for Werner states
over a wide range of noise level --- the yield for using this QLDPC code is
higher than the first runner up by more than 25\% over a wide parameter range.
In this respect, the effectiveness of using QLDPC codes in practical
entanglement distillation is illustrated.
