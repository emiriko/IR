We present methods for exploratory studies of molecular dynamics using
MATLAB. Such methods are not suitable for large scale applications, but they
can be used for developement and testing of new types of interactions and other
aspects of the simulations, or simply for instruction and education purposes.
We also present exploration of forces obtained from 3-body potentials in
Molecular Dynamics in this framework. The methods are based on use of matrices
and multidimensional arrays for which MATLAB has a set of both linear algebra
based as well as element-wise operations. Applications to three-body
interactions are the main aspect of this work, but extension to any general
form of n-body interactions is also discussed. The methods discussed can be
also applied without any change using the latest versions of the package GNU
OCTAVE as a replacement for MATLAB. The code examples are listed in some
detail, a full package of the MATLAB and OCTAVE codes is available for
download.
