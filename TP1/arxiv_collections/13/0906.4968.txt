In this paper we investigate the gravitational waves emission by stellar
dynamical structures as complex systems in the quadrupole approximation
considering bounded and unbounded orbits. Precisely, after deriving analytical
expressions for the gravitational wave luminosity, the total energy output and
gravitational radiation amplitude, we present a computational approach to
evaluate the gravitational wave-forms from elliptical, circular, parabolic and
hyperbolic orbits as a function of Keplerian parameters.
