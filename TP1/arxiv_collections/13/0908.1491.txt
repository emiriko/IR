The dynamics of a cascaded system that consists of two atom-cavity subsystems
is studied by using the quantum trajectory method. Unwanted losses are
included, such as photon absorption and scattering by the cavity mirrors and
spontaneous emission of the atoms. Considering an initially excited two-level
atom in the source subsystem, analytical solutions are obtained. The
entanglement evolution is studied for the two atoms and for the two intracavity
fields.
