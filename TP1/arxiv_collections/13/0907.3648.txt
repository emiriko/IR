It has been recently proposed that the presence of a temporal electromagnetic
field on cosmological scales could explain the phase of accelerated expansion
that the universe is currently undergoing. The field contributes as a
cosmological constant and therefore, the homogeneous cosmology produced by such
a model is exactly the same as that of $\Lambda$CDM. However, unlike a
cosmological constant term, electromagnetic fields can acquire perturbations
which in principle could affect CMB anisotropies and structure formation. In
this work, we study the evolution of inhomogeneous scalar perturbations in this
model. We show that provided the initial electromagnetic fluctuations generated
during inflation are small, the model is perfectly compatible with both CMB and
large scale structure observations at the same level of accuracy as
$\Lambda$CDM.
