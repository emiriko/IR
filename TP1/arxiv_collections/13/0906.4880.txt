V2129 Oph is a 1.35 solar mass classical T Tauri star, known to possess a
strong and complex magnetic field. By extrapolating from an observationally
derived magnetic surface map, obtained through Zeeman-Doppler imaging, models
of V2129 Oph's corona have been constructed, and used to make predictions
regarding the global X-ray emission measure, the amount of modulation of X-ray
emission, and the density of accretion shocks. In late June 2009 we will under
take an ambitious multi-wavelength, multi-observing site, and near
contemporaneous campaign, combining spectroscopic optical, nIR, UV, X-ray,
spectropolarimetric and photometric monitoring. This will allow the validity of
the 3D field topologies derived via field extrapolation to be determined.
