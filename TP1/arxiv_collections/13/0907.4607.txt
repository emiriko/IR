A novel electromagnetic energy squeezing mechanism is proposed based on the
special properties of permeability-near-zero metamaterials. Nearly no energy
stream can enter a conventional dielectric region positioned inside a
permeability-near-zero material. When a source is surrounded by a dielectric
split ring (encloser with a gap opened), the electromagnetic energy generated
by the source is forced to propagate through the gap. When the gap is narrow,
the energy stream density becomes very large and makes the magnetic field
enhanced drastically in the gap. The narrow gap can be long and bended. This
provides us a method to obtain strong magnetic field without using resonance
enhancement.
