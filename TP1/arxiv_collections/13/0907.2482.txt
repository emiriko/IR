We provide a theoretical framework to study the effect of dephasing on the
quantum indistinguishability of single photons emitted from a coherently driven
cavity QED $\Lambda$-system. We show that with a large excited-state detuning,
the photon indistinguishability can be drastically improved provided that the
fluctuation rate of the noise source affecting the excited state is fast
compared with the photon emission rate. In some cases a spectral filter is
required to realize this improvement, but the cost in efficiency can be made
small.
