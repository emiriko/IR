There have been numerous reports of anomalies during transits of the planet
TrES-1b. Recently, Rabus and coworkers' analysis of HST observations lead them
to claim brightening anomalies during transit might be caused by either a
second transiting planet or a cool starspot. Observations of two consecutive
transits are presented here from the University of Arizona's 61-inch Kuiper
Telescope on May 12 and May 15, 2008 UT. A 5.4 +/- 1.7 mmag (0.54 +/- 0.17%)
brightening anomaly was detected during the first half of the transit on May 12
and again in the second half of the transit on May 15th. We conclude that this
is a tentative detection of a r greater than or equal to 6 earth radii starspot
rotating on the surface of the star. We suggest that all evidence to date
suggest TrES-1 has a spotty surface and there is no need to introduce a second
transiting planet in this system to explain these anomalies. We are only able
to constrain the rotational period of the star to 40.2 +22.9 -14.6 days, due to
previous errors in measuring the alignment of the stellar spin axis with the
planetary orbital axis. This is consistent with the previously observed P_obs =
33.2 +22.3 -14.3 day period. We note that this technique could be applied to
other transiting systems for which starspots exist on the star in the transit
path of the planet in order to constrain the rotation rate of the star.
