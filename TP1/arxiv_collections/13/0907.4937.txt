Using the Eguchi-Kawai equivalence, we provide regularizations of
supersymmetric quiver and Chern-Simons gauge theories which leave the
supersymmetries unbroken. This allow us to study many interesting theories on a
computer. As examples we construct large-$N$ reduced models of supersymmetric
QCD with flavor and the ABJM model of multiple M2 branes.
