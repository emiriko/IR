The enormous stiffness and low density of graphene make it an ideal material
for nanoelectromechanical (NEMS) applications. We demonstrate fabrication and
electrical readout of monolayer graphene resonators, and test their response to
changes in mass and temperature. The devices show resonances in the MHz range.
The strong dependence of the resonant frequency on applied gate voltage can be
fit to a membrane model, which yields the mass density and built-in strain.
Upon removal and addition of mass, we observe changes in both the density and
the strain, indicating that adsorbates impart tension to the graphene. Upon
cooling, the frequency increases; the shift rate can be used to measure the
unusual negative thermal expansion coefficient of graphene. The quality factor
increases with decreasing temperature, reaching ~10,000 at 5 K. By establishing
many of the basic attributes of monolayer graphene resonators, these studies
lay the groundwork for applications, including high-sensitivity mass detectors.
