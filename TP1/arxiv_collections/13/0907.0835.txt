Using the {\it nonlinear coherent states method}, a formalism for the
construction of the coherent states associated to {\it "inverse bosonic
operators"} and their dual family has been proposed. Generalizing the approach,
the "inverse of $f$-deformed ladder operators" corresponding to the nonlinear
coherent states in the context of quantum optics and the associated coherent
states have been introduced. Finally, after applying the proposal to a few
known physical systems, particular nonclassical features as sub-Poissonian
statistics and the squeezing of the quadratures of the radiation field
corresponding to the introduced states have been investigated.
