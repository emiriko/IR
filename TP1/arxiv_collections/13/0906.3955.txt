The lattice Boussinesq equation (BSQ) is a three-component
difference-difference equation defined on an elementary square of the 2D
lattice, having 3D consistency. We write the equations in the Hirota bilinear
form and construct their multisoliton solutions in terms of Casoratians,
following the methodology in our previous papers. In the construction it turns
out that instead of the usual discretization of the exponential as
$[(a+k)/(a-k)]^n$ we need two different terms $[(a-\omega k)/(a-k)]^n$ and
$[(a-\omega^2 k)/(a-k)]^n$, where $\omega$ is a cubic root of unity $\neq 1$.
