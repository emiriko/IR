We give a critical analysis of the conceptual foundations of special
relativity. We formulate a simple operational criterion for distinguishing
between noninertial and inertial frames which is introduced prior to geometry.
We associate the concept of maximal velocity with the existence of an upper
bound for a set of rates of movers which travel in the same direction. We
define the standard scale for reading the time flow. We refine the treatment of
both Einstein's postulates, the principle of relativity and constancy of the
velocity of light. The proposed ``reconstruction'' of the geometry of Minkowski
space will hopefully be useful for the ongoing examination of possible Lorentz
violations.
