Previous investigation of coding sequence lengths (CDS) in the bacterial
circular chromosome revealed short range correlation in the series of these
data. We have further analyzed the averaged periodograms of these series and we
found that the organization of CDS can be well described by first order
autoregressive processes. This involves interaction between the neighboring
terms. The autoregressive analysis may have great potential in modeling various
physical and biological processes like light emission of galaxies, protein
organization, cell flickering, cognitive processes and perhaps others.
