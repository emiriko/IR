The suggested model permits to construct gauge-invariant expressions bringing
to the masses of all the fermions, included the neutrinos. The model realizes
Higgs mechanism. It is based on the presence of non-trivial ground states of a
scalar field. An arbitrary fixed ground state generates the masses of all the
particles. The selected symmetry is based on the fact that the sum of the
electric charges of all the well-known fermions (taking into account the
partition of the quarks by colors) is equal to 0. As a result of the Higgs
mechanism massive vector bosons appear. They bring the charges: 0,\pm 1/3,\pm
2/3,\pm 1. It may be, the model will be of interest from the point of view of
the unification of all the vector interactions.
