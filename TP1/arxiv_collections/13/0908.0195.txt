We study the prospects for detecting the annihilation products of Dark Matter
[DM] in the framework of the two highest-resolution numerical simulations
currently available, i.e. {\it Via Lactea II} and {\it Aquarius}. We propose a
strategy to determine the shape and size of the region around the Galactic
center that maximizes the probability of observing a DM signal, and we show
that although the predicted flux can differ by a factor of 10 for a given DM
candidate in the two simulation setups, the search strategy remains actually
unchanged, since it relies on the angular profile of the annihilation flux, not
on its normalization. We present mock gamma-ray maps that keep into account the
diffuse emission produced by unresolved halos in the Galaxy, and we estimate
that in an optimistic DM scenario a few individual clumps can be resolved above
the background with the Fermi-LAT. Finally we calculate the energy-dependent
boost factors for positrons and antiprotons, and show that they are always of
$\cal O$(1), and therefore they cannot lead to the large enhancements of the
antimatter fluxes required to explain the recent PAMELA, ATIC, Fermi and HESS
data.
