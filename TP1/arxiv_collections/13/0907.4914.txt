The Jarzynski equality is generalized to situations in which nonequilibrium
systems are subject to a feedback control. The new terms that arise as a
consequence of the feedback describe the mutual information content obtained by
measurement and the efficacy of the feedback control. Our results lead to a
generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem that reflects the readout
information, and can be experimentally tested using small thermodynamic
systems. We illustrate our general results by an introducing "information
ratchet," which can transport a Brownian particle in one direction and extract
a positive work from the particle.
