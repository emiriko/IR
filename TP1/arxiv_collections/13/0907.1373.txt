We use the continuity of Fourier multiplier operators on $L^p$ to introduce
the $H$-distributions --- an extension of $H$-measures in the $L^p$ framework.
We apply the $H$-distributions to obtain an $L^p$ version of the localisation
principle, and reprove the $L^p$---$L^q$ variant of the Murat--Tartar div-curl
lemma.
