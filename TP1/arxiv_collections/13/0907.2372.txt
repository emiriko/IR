We model the structure of the surface magnetic fields of the hydrogen-rich
white dwarfs in the SDSS. We have calculated a grid of state-of-the-art
theoretical optical spectra of hydrogen-rich magnetic white dwarfs with
magnetic field strengths between 1 MG and 1200 MG for different angles, and for
effective temperatures between 7000 K and 50000 K. We used a least-squares
minimization scheme with an evolutionary algorithm in order to find the
magnetic field geometry best fitting the observed data. We used simple centered
dipoles or dipoles which were shifted along the dipole axis to model the
coadded SDSS fiber spectrum of each object. We have analysed the spectra of all
known magnetic DAs from the SDSS (97 previously published plus 44 newly
discovered) and also investigated the statistical properties of magnetic field
geometries of this sample. The total number of known magnetic white dwarfs
already more than tripled by the SDSS and more objects are expected from a more
systematic search. The magnetic fields span a range between ~1 and 900 MG. Our
results further support the claim that Ap/Bp population is insufficient in
generating the numbers and field strength distributions of the observed MWDs,
and either another source of progenitor types or binary evolution is needed.
Moreover clear indications for non-centered dipoles exist in about ~50% of the
objects which is consistent with the magnetic field distribution observed in
Ap/Bp stars.
