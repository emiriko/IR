We extend recent theoretical studies of entanglement dynamics in the presence
of environmental noise, following the long-time interest of Krzysztof
Wodkiewicz in the effects of stochastic models of noise on quantum optical
coherences. We investigate the quantum entanglement dynamics of two spins in
the presence of classical Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise, obtaining exact solutions
for evolution dynamics. We consider how entanglement can be affected by
non-Markovian noise, and discuss several limiting cases.
