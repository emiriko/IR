In this paper we construct, and investigate some thermal properties of, the
non-commutative counterpart of Rindler space, which we call $\kappa$--Rindler
space. This space is obtained by changing variables in the defining commutators
of $\kappa$--Minkowski space. We then re-derive the commutator structure of
$\kappa$--Rindler space with the help of an appropriate star product, obtained
from the $\kappa$--Minkowski one. Using this star product, following the idea
of Padmanabhan, we find the leading order, $1/\kappa$ correction to the Hawking
thermal spectrum.
