The magnetic state of Nitrogen-doped MgO, with N substituting O at
concentrations between 1% and the concentrated limit, is calculated with
density-functional methods. The N atoms are found to be magnetic with a moment
of 1 Bohr magneton per Nitrogen atom and to interact ferromagnetically via the
double exchange mechanism. The long-range magnetic order is established above a
finite concentration of about 1.5% when the percolation threshold is reached.
The Curie temperature increases linearly with the concentration, and is found
to be about 30 K for 10% concentration. Besides the substitution of single
Nitrogen atoms, also interstitial Nitrogen atoms, clusters of Nitrogen atoms
and their structural relaxation on the magnetism are discussed. Possible
scenarios of engineering a higher Curie temperature are analyzed, with the
conclusion that an increase of the Curie temperature is difficult to achieve,
requiring a particular attention to the choice of chemistry.
