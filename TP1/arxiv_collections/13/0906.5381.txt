We examine correlation functions in the presence of competing long and short
ranged interactions to find multiple correlation and modulation lengths. We
calculate the ground state stripe width of an Ising ferromagnet, frustrated by
an arbitrary long range interaction. In large $n$ systems, we demonstrate that
for a short range system frustrated by a general competing long range
interaction, the crossover temperature $T^*$ veers towards the critical
temperature of the unfrustrated short range system (i.e., that in which the
frustrating long range interaction is removed). We also show that apart from
certain special crossover points, the total number of correlation and
modulation lengths remains conserved. We derive an expression for the change in
modulation length with temperature for a general system near the ground state
with a ferromagnetic interaction and an opposing long range interaction. We
illustrate that the correlation functions associated with the exact dipolar
interactions differ substantially from those in which a scalar product form
between the dipoles is assumed.
