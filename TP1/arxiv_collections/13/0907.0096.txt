With the next start of LHC, a huge production of top quarks is expected.
There are several models that predict the existence of heavy colored resonances
decaying to top quarks in the TeV energy range. A peak in the differential
cross section could reveal the existence of such a resonance, but this is
experimentally challenging, because it requires selecting data samples where
top and antitop quarks are highly boosted. Nonetheless, the production of such
resonances might generate a sizable charge asymmetry of top versus antitop
quarks. We consider a toy model with general flavour independent couplings of
the resonance to quarks, of both vector and axial-vector kind. The charge
asymmetry turns out to be a more powerful observable to detect new physics than
the differential cross section, because its highest statistical significance is
achieved with data samples of top-antitop quark pairs of low invariant masses.
