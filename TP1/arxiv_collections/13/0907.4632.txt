We shall summarize some of the research activities performed in collaboration
with Ben Shen in the OPAL experiment at LEP and in the CMS experiment at the
LHC. And we shall recall the LEP legacy to particle physics in general and to
the Standard Model in particular. Short recollections are made in other fields
in which Ben was interested, in particular in Astroparticle Physics.
