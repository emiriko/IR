We have studied the effect of temperature on aging dynamics of laponite
suspensions by carrying out the rheological oscillatory and creep experiments.
We observed that at higher temperatures the mechanism responsible for aging
became faster thereby shifting the evolution of elastic modulus to lower ages.
Significantly, in the creep experiments, all the aging time and the temperature
dependent strain data superposed to form a master curve. Possibility of such
superposition suggests that the rheological behavior depends on the temperature
and the aging time only through the relaxation processes and both the variables
do not affect the distribution but only the average value of relaxation times.
In addition, this procedure allows us to predict long time rheological behavior
by carrying out short time tests at high temperatures and small ages.
