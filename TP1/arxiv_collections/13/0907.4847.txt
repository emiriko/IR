The PULSE@Parkes project has been designed to monitor the rotation of radio
pulsars over time spans of days to years. The observations are obtained using
the Parkes 64-m and 12-m radio telescopes by Australian and international high
school students. These students learn the basis of radio astronomy and
undertake small projects with their observations. The data are fully calibrated
and obtained with the state-of-the-art pulsar hardware available at Parkes. The
final data sets are archived and are currently being used to carry out studies
of 1) pulsar glitches, 2) timing noise, 3) pulse profile stability over long
time scales and 4) the extreme nulling phenomenon. The data are also included
in other projects such as gamma-ray observatory support and for the Parkes
Pulsar Timing Array project. In this paper we describe the current status of
the project and present the first scientific results from the Parkes 12-m radio
telescope. We emphasise that this project offers a straightforward means to
enthuse high school students and the general public about radio astronomy while
obtaining scientifically valuable data sets.
