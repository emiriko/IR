It is known that near-Earth objects (NEOs) during their orbital evolution may
often undergo close approaches to the Sun. Indeed it is estimated that up to
~70% of them end their orbital evolution colliding with the Sun. Starting from
the present orbital properties, it is possible to compute the most likely past
evolution for every NEO, and to trace its distance from the Sun. We find that a
large fraction of the population may have experienced in the past frequent
close approaches, and thus, as a consequence, a considerable Sun-driven
heating, not trivially correlated to the present orbits. The detailed dynamical
behaviour, the rotational and the thermal properties of NEOs determine the
exact amount of the resulting heating due to the Sun. In the present paper we
discuss the general features of the process, providing estimates of the surface
temperature reached by NEOs during their evolution. Moreover, we investigate
the effects of this process on meteor-size bodies, analyzing possible
differences with the NEO population. We also discuss some possible effects of
the heating which can be observed through remote sensing by ground-based
surveys or space missions.
