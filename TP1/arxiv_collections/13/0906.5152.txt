The physical sense and the properties of a group screening parameters which
are determined in the previous papers (Part~1 and Part~2) for single- and
two-component systems is discussed in this paper. On the base of data from the
mentioned papers are determined two new characteristic lengths which complete a
new hierarchy system of screening lengths in plasma. It was shown that the
methods developed in Part~1 and Part~2 generates results which are applicable
to the strongly non-ideal gaseous and dusty plasmas, and manifest a very good
agreement with the existing experimental data.
