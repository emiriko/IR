The usual formulations of quantum field theory in Minkowski spacetime make
crucial use of Poincare symmetry, positivity of total energy, and the existence
of a unique, Poincare invariant vacuum state. These and other key features of
quantum field theory do not generalize straightforwardly to curved spacetime.
We discuss the conceptual obstacles to formulating quantum field theory in
curved spacetime and how they can be overcome
