In this thesis we consider ordered graphs (that is, graphs with a fixed
linear ordering on their vertices). We summarize and further investigations on
the number of edges an ordered graph may have while avoiding a fixed forbidden
ordered graph as a subgraph. In particular, we take a step toward confirming a
conjecture of Pach and Tardos regarding the number of edges allowed when the
forbidden pattern is a tree by establishing an upper bound for a particular
ordered graph for which existing techniques have failed. We also generalize a
theorem of Geneson by establishing an upper bound on the number of edges
allowed if the forbidden graphs fit a generalized notion of a matching.
