Present work is a theoretical study on the stability of the thermotropic
biaxial nematic liquid crystal phase in model systems. Its main aim is to
present the phase diagrams of spatially uniform liquid mesophases and to
identify the molecular parameters that influence the stability of the biaxial
nematic. The diagrams are obtained by means of the Local Density Functional
Theory in low density approximation, and the relation between the molecular
parameters of the models and macroscopic properties of the system close to the
transition point are obtained by means of bifurcation analysis. We consider
three model systems; the so-called L=2 model (the lowest coupling model of the
orientational part of pair potential), the biaxial Gay-Berne interaction, and
the bent-core system. For the second one, we also briefly investigate the
temperature dependence of elastic constants in rod-like regime and in the
vicinity of the Landau point and comment on the smectic phases. In every case
we take into account rigid molecules. We find that the Landau points acquired
from the square root rule for hard biaxial ellipsoids retain its significance,
and provide qualitatively correct estimations of Landau points positions for
Gay-Berne biaxial ellipsoids. In case of the bent-core model molecules build
from uniaxial and biaxial Gay-Berne ellipsoids we find that the dipole-dipole
interaction and degree of arms biaxiality change the stability of the biaxial
nematic phase.
