We propose an ion trap configuration such that individual traps can be
stacked together in a three dimensional simple cubic arrangement. The isolated
trap as well as the extended array of ion traps are characterized for different
locations in the lattice, illustrating the robustness of the lattice of traps
concept. Ease in the addressing of ions at each lattice site, individually or
simultaneously, makes this system naturally suitable for a number of
experiments. Application of this trap to precision spectroscopy, quantum
information processing and the study of few particle interacting system are
discussed.
