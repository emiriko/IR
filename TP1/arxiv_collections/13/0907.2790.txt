In our experiment we measured the free fall accelerations of the closed
container inside which a mechanical rotor (gyroscope) with a horizontal axis of
rotation was installed. There was observed an appreciable, essentially
exceeding errors of measurements increase of acceleration of free falling of
the container at angular speed of rotation of a rotor up to 20 000 rpm.
