On the basis of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics and point-scattering
techniques, we derive a closed expression for the Casimir-Polder force between
a ground-state atom and a small magnetodielectric sphere in an arbitrary
environment. In order to allow for the presence of both bodies and media,
local-field corrections are taken into account. Our results are compared with
the known van der Waals force between two ground-state atoms. To continuously
interpolate between the two extreme cases of a single atom and a macroscopic
sphere, we also derive the force between an atom and a sphere of variable
radius that is embedded in an Onsager local-field cavity. Numerical examples
illustrate the theory.
