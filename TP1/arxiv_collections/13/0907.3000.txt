Various processes that are forbidden in the vacuum due to angular momentum
conservation can occur in a medium that is isotropic and does not carry any
angular momentum. We illustrate this by considering explicitly two examples.
The first one is the decay of a spin-0 particle into a photon and another
spin-0 particle, using a model involving the Yukawa interactions of the scalar
particles with a charged fermion field. The second one involves the decay of a
neutrino into another neutrino and a graviton, in the standard model of
particle interactions augmented with the linearized gravitational couplings.
