Conventional kinesin is a dimeric motor protein that transports membranous
organelles toward the plus-end of microtubules (MTs). Individual kinesin dimers
show steadfast directionality and hundreds of consecutive steps, yetthe
detailed physical mechanism remains unclear. Here we compute free energies for
the entire dimer-MT system for all possible interacting configurations by
taking full account of molecular details. Employing merely first principles and
several measured binding and barrier energies, the system-level analysis
reveals insurmountable energy gaps between configurations, asymmetric ground
state caused by mechanically lifted configurational degeneracy, and forbidden
transitions ensuring coordination between both motor domains for alternating
catalysis. This wealth of physical effects converts a kinesin dimer into a
molecular ratchet-and-pawl device, which determinedly locks the dimer's
movement into the MT plus-end and ensures consecutive steps in hand-over-hand
gait.Under a certain range of extreme loads, however, the ratchet-and-pawl
device becomes defective but not entirely abolished to allow consecutive
back-steps. This study yielded quantitative evidence that kinesin's multiple
molecular properties have been evolutionarily adapted to fine-tune the
ratchet-and-pawl device so as to ensure the motor's distinguished performance.
