Dust in debris disks is generated by collisions among planetesimals. The
existence of these planetesimals is a consequence of the planet formation
process, but the relationship between debris disks and planets has not been
clearly established. Here we analyze Spitzer/MIPS 24 and 70 micrometer data for
150 planet-bearing stars, and compare the incidence of debris disks around
these stars with a sample of 118 stars around which planets have been searched
for, but not found. Together they comprise the largest sample ever assembled to
deal with this question. The use of survival analysis techniques allows us to
account for the large number of non-detections at 70 micrometer. We discovered
10 new debris disks around stars with planets and one around a star without
known planets. We found that the incidence of debris disks is marginally higher
among stars with planets, than among those without, and that the brightness of
the average debris disk is not significantly different in the two samples. We
conclude that the presence of a planet that has been detected via current
radial velocity techniques is not a good predictor of the presence of a debris
disk detected at infrared wavelengths.
