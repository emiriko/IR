We consider inelastic collisions between relativistic electrons and atomic
targets assisted by a low-frequency laser field in the case when this field is
still much weaker than the typical internal fields in the target. Concentrating
on target transitions we show that they can be substantially affected by the
presence of the laser field. This may occur either via strong modifications in
the motion of the relativistic electrons caused by the electron-laser
interaction or via the Compton effect when the incident electrons convert laser
photon(s) into photons with frequencies equal to target transition frequencies.
