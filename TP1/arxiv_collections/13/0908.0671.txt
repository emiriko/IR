The first numerical simulation of the process of ionization of an atom
adsorbed on a metal surface by the subfemtosecond pulse is presented. The
streaking scheme is considered, when a weak sub-femtosecond pulse comes
together with a strong IR pulse with a variable delay between them. The problem
is analyzed with numerical solving the non-stationary Schroedinger equation in
the cylindrical coordinate. The results obtained are compared with ones in the
gas phase. We show that the surface influences the DDCS, but the observation of
this influence, beside the trivial polarization shift of the energy of the
initial state, requires a quite high experimental resolution.
