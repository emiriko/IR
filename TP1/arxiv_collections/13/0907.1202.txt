We report here on anisotropy of spin polarization obtained in lateral
all-semiconductor all-electrical spin injection devices, employing
$p^{+}-$(Ga,Mn)As/$n^{+}-$GaAs Esaki diode structures as spin aligning
contacts, resulting from the dependence of the efficiency of spin tunneling on
the orientation of spins with respect to different crystallographic directions.
We observed an in-plane anisotropy of $~8%$ in case of spins oriented either
along $[1\bar{1}0]$ or $[110]$ directions and $~25%$ anisotropy between
in-plane and perpendicular-to-plane orientation of spins.
