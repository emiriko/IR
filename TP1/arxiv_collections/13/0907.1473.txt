Casher's argument, which is believed to be quite general, states that in the
confining regime chiral symmetry is necessarily broken. In the large-N_c limit
and at moderate and low temperatures QCD is confining up to arbitrary large
densities, and there should appear a quarkyonic matter. It has been
demonstrated, within a manifestly confining and chirally symmetric model, which
is a 3+1 dimensional generalization of the 't Hooft model, that, at zero
temperature and at a density exceeding a critical one, the chiral symmetry is
restored while quarks remain confined in color-singlet hadrons. This is in
conflict with the Casher's argument. Here we explain the reason why the
Casher's argument fails and clarify the physical mechanism lying behind such
confined but chirally symmetric hadrons.
