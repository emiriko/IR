We propose a modified spin-field-effect transistor fabricated in a two
dimensional electron gas (2DEG) formed at the surface of multiferroic oxides
with a transverse helical magnetic order. The topology of the oxide local
magnetic moments induces a resonant momentum-dependent effective spin-orbit
interaction acting on 2DEG. We show that spin polarization dephasing is
strongly suppressed which is crucial for functionality. The carrier spin
precession phase depend linearly on the magnetic spiral helicity. The latter is
electrically controllable by virtue of the magento-electric effect. We also
suggest a flash-memory device based on this structure.
