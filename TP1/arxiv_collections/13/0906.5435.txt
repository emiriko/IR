The photoproduction of beauty quarks in ep collisions has been measured using
a data sample of 170 pb^-1 collected with the H1 detector at HERA-II in the
years 2006 and 2007. Events with two jets and a muon in the final state were
investigated, and beauty events were identified using the muon's relative
transverse momentum to a jet and its impact parameter. Visible cross sections
were measured differentially in the transverse momenta of the highest energy
jet (p_T^jet1) and the muon (pt_mu), the pseudorapidity of the muon (eta_mu)
and of the photon's momentum fraction x_gamma entering the hard interaction.
The measurements are found to be well described by QCD calculations at NLO.
