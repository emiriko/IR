This second issue of the French Complex Systems Roadmap is the outcome of the
Entretiens de Cargese 2008, an interdisciplinary brainstorming session
organized over one week in 2008, jointly by RNSC, ISC-PIF and IXXI. It
capitalizes on the first roadmap and gathers contributions of more than 70
scientists from major French institutions. The aim of this roadmap is to foster
the coordination of the complex systems community on focused topics and
questions, as well as to present contributions and challenges in the complex
systems sciences and complexity science to the public, political and industrial
spheres.
