We present a class of warped extra dimensional models whose flavor violating
interactions are much suppressed compared to the usual anarchic case due to
flavor alignment. Such suppression can be achieved in models where part of the
global flavor symmetry is gauged in the bulk and broken in a controlled manner.
We show that the bulk masses can be aligned with the down type Yukawa couplings
by an appropriate choice of bulk flavon field representations and TeV brane
dynamics. This alignment could reduce the flavor violating effects to levels
which allow for a Kaluza-Klein scale as low as 2-3 TeV, making the model
observable at the LHC. However, the up-type Yukawa couplings on the IR brane,
which are bounded from below by recent bounds on CP violation in the D system,
induce flavor misalignment radiatively. Off-diagonal down-type Yukawa couplings
and kinetic mixings for the down quarks are both consequences of this effect.
These radiative Yukawa corrections can be reduced by raising the flavon VEV on
the IR brane (at the price of some moderate tuning), or by extending the Higgs
sector. The flavor changing effects from the radiatively induced Yukawa mixing
terms are at around the current upper experimental bounds. We also show the
generic bounds on UV-brane induced flavor violating effects, and comment on
possible additional flavor violations from bulk flavor gauge bosons and the
bulk Yukawa scalars.
