ALICE will study nucleus-nucleus and proton-proton collisions at the LHC. The
main goal of the experiment is to investigate the properties of QCD matter at
the extreme energy densities that will be reached in Pb-Pb collisions. Heavy
quarks (charm and beauty) are regarded as powerful tools for this study. After
briefly reviewing the ALICE heavy-flavour program, we will describe the
preparation for the first measurements to be performed with pp collisions.
