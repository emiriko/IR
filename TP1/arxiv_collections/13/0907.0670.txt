We construct indecomposable and noncrossed product division algebras over
function fields of smooth curves X over Z_p. This is done by defining an index
preserving morphism s:Br(\hat K(X))' -> Br(K(X))' which splits res:Br(K(X)) ->
Br(\hat K(X)), where \hat K(X) is the completion of K(X) at the special fiber,
and using it to lift indecomposable and noncrossed product division algebras
over \hat K(X).
