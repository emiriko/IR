Suppression measurements for neutral pions ($\pi^0$) are used to investigate
the predicted path length ($L$) and transverse momentum ($p_T$) dependent jet
quenching patterns of the hot QCD medium produced in Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. The observed scaling patterns show the predicted
trends for jet-medium interactions dominated by radiative energy loss. They
also allow simple estimates of the transport coefficient $\hat{q}$ and the
ratio of viscosity to entropy density $\eta/s$. These estimates indicate that
the short mean free path ($\lambda$) in the QCD medium leading to
hydrodynamic-like flow with a small value of $\eta/s$, is also responsible for
the strong suppression observed.
