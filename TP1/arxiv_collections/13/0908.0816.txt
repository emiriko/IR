In May 2008, the Antares neutrino telescope was completed at 2.5 km depth in
the Mediterranean Sea; data taking has been going on since. A prerequisite for
neutrino astronomy is an accurate reconstruction of the neutrino events, as
well as a detailed understanding of the atmospheric muon and neutrino
backgrounds. Several methods have been developed to confront the challenges of
muon reconstruction in the sea water environment, which are posed by e.g.
backgrounds due to radioactivity and bioluminescence. I will discuss the
techniques that allowed Antares to confidently identify its first neutrino
events, as well as recent results on the measurement of atmospheric neutrinos.
