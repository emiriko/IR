The VERITAS Cherenkov telescope array has been fully operational since Fall
2007 and has fulfilled or outperformed its design specifications. We are
preparing an upgrade program with the goal to lower the energy threshold and
improve the sensitivity of VERITAS at all accessible energies. In the baseline
program of the upgrade we will relocate one of the four telescopes, replace the
photo-sensors by higher efficiency photomultipliers and install a new trigger
system. In the enhanced program of the upgrade we foresee, in addition, the
construction of a fifth telescope and installation of an active mirror
alignment system.
