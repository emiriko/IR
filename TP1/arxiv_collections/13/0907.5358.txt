We consider parity-violating observables from the processes $\vec n p\to d
\gamma$ and $ np \to d \overset {\circlearrowleft}{\gamma}$. We perform
calculations using pionless effective field theory both with and without
explicit dibaryon fields. After combining these results with ones we have
already obtained on parity-violating asymmetries in $\vec NN$ scattering,
experimental input would in principle allow the extraction of all five
parameters occurring at leading order in the parity-violating Lagrangian.
