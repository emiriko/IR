The drag of a heavy quark and the jet quenching parameter are studied in the
strongly coupled N=2* plasma using the AdS/CFT correspondence. Both increase in
units of the spatial string tension as the theory departs from conformal
invariance. The description of heavy quark dynamics using a Langevin equation
is also considered. It is found that the difference between the velocity
dependent factors of the transverse and longitudinal momentum broadening of the
quark admit an interpretation in terms of relativistic effects, so the
distribution is spherical in the quark rest frame. When conformal invariance is
broken there is a broadening of the longitudinal momentum distribution. This
effect may be useful in understanding the jet distribution observed in
experiments.
