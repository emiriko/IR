The unprecedented sensitivity of current X-ray telescopes allows for the
first time to address the issue of the Fe K line complex variability patterns
in bright, nearby AGNs. We examine XMM-Newton observations of the brightest
sources of the FERO sample of radio-quiet type 1 AGNs with the aim of
characterizing the temporal behaviour of Fe K complex features. A systematic
mapping of residual flux above and below the continuum in the 4-9 keV range is
performed in the time vs energy domain, with the purpose of identifying
interesting spectral features in the three energy bands: 5.4-6.1 keV, 6.1-6.8
keV and 6.8-7.2 keV, corresponding respectively to the redshifted, rest frame
and blueshifted or highly ionized Fe Kalpha line bands. The variability
significance is assessed by extracting light curves and comparing them with
MonteCarlo simulations. The time-averaged profile of the Fe K complex revealed
spectral complexity in several observations. Red- and blue-shifted components
(either in emission or absorption) were observed in 30 out of 72 observations,
with an average <EW>~90 eV for emission and <EW>~ -30 eV for absorption
features. We detected significant line variability (with confidence levels
ranging between 90% and 99.7%) within at least one of the above energy bands in
26 out of 72 observations on time scales of ~6-30 ks. Reliability of these
features has been carefully calculated using this sample and has been assessed
at ~3sigma confidence level. This work increases the currently scanty number of
detections of variable, energy shifted, Fe lines and confirms the reliability
of the claimed detections. We found that the distribution of detected features
is peaked at high variability significances in the red- and blue-shifted energy
bands, suggesting an origin in a relativistically modified accretion flow.
