The MNESIS Project aims to see whether the use of computerized environment by
elderly people in medicalized residences stimulates their cognitive capacities
and contributes to a better integration, recognition or acceptance within their
social environment (friends, family, medical staff). In this paper we present
the protocol of evaluation that is defined to check this assumption. This
protocol is between users' centred traditional protocols (built on
investigations and indirect observation) and studies of Web Usage Mining (where
knowledge databases about the uses are built from traces of use). It allows
collecting direct and indirect information on a large scale and over long
periods.
