We apply statistical physics to study the task of resource allocation in
random networks with limited bandwidths along the transportation links. The
mean-field approach is applicable when the connectivity is sufficiently high.
It allows us to derive the resource shortage of a node as a well-defined
function of its capacity. For networks with uniformly high connectivity, an
efficient profile of the allocated resources is obtained, which exhibits
features similar to the Maxwell construction. These results have good
agreements with simulations, where nodes self-organize to balance their
shortages, forming extensive clusters of nodes interconnected by unsaturated
links. The deviations from the mean-field analyses show that nodes are likely
to be rich in the locality of gifted neighbors. In scale-free networks, hubs
make sacrifice for enhanced balancing of nodes with low connectivity.
