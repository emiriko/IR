Device independent quantum key distribution aims to provide a higher degree
of security than traditional QKD schemes by reducing the number of assumptions
that need to be made about the physical devices used. The previous proof of
security by Pironio et al. applies only to collective attacks where the state
is identical and independent and the measurement devices operate identically
for each trial in the protocol. We extend this result to a more general class
of attacks where the state is arbitrary and the measurement devices have no
memory. We accomplish this by a reduction of arbitrary adversary strategies to
qubit strategies and a proof of security for qubit strategies based on the
previous proof by Pironio et al. and techniques adapted from Renner.
