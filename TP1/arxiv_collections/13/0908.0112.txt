Based on photometric data of the central parts of eight globular clusters and
one open cluster presented by An and his collaborators, we select red
horizontal branch (RHB) stars in the (g-r)0-g0 diagram and make a statistical
study of the distributions of their colors and absolute magnitudes in the SDSS
ugriz system. Meanwhile, absolute magnitudes in the Johnson VRI system are
calculated through the translation formulae between gri and VRI in the
literature. The calibrations of absolute magnitude as functions of metallicity
and age are established by linear regressions of the data.
  It is found that metallicity coefficients in these calibrations decrease,
while age coefficients increase, from the blue $u$ filter to the red $z$
filter. The calibration of Mi= 0.06[Fe/H]+0.040t+0.03 has the smallest scatter
of 0.04 mag, and thus i is the best filter in the $ugriz$ system when RHB stars
are used for distance indicators. The comparison of the MI calibration from our
data with that from red clump stars indicates that the previous suggestion that
the $I$ filter is better than the V filter in distance determination may not be
true because of its significant dependence on age.
