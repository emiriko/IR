Making use of the Kerr theorem for shear-free null congruences and of
Newman's representation for a virtual charge ``moving'' in complex space-time,
we obtain an axisymmetric time-dependent generalization of the Kerr congruence,
with a singular ring uniformly contracting to a point and expanding then to
infinity. Electromagnetic and complex eikonal field distributions are naturally
associated with the obtained congruence, with electric charge being
necesssarily unit (``elementary''). We conjecture that the corresponding
solution to the Einstein-Maxwell equations could describe the process of
continious transition of the naked ringlike singularitiy into a rotating black
hole and vice versa, under a particular current radius of the singular ring.
