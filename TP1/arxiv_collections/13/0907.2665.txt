We propose a new approach to describe baryonic structure in terms of an
effective chiral Lagrangian. The state vector of a baryon is defined on the
light front of general position \omega . x=0, where \omega is an arbitrary
light-like four vector. It is then decomposed in Fock components including an
increasing number of pions. The maximal number of particles in the state vector
is mapped out to the order of decomposition of the chiral effective Lagrangian
to have a consistent calculation of both the state vector and the effective
Lagrangian. An adequate Fock sector dependent renormalization scheme is used in
order to restrict all contributions within the truncated Fock space. To
illustrate our formalism, we calculate the anomalous magnetic moment of a
fermion in the Yukawa model in the three-body truncation. We present
perspectives opened by the use of a new regularization scheme based on the
properties of fields as distributions acting on specific test functions.
