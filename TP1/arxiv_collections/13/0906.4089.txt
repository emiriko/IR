The motion of a ruck in a rug is used as an analogy to explain the role of
dislocations in the deformation of crystalline solids. We take the analogy
literally and study the shape and motion of a bump, wrinkle or ruck in a thin
sheet in partial contact with a rough substrate in a gravitational field. Using
a combination of experiments, scaling analysis and numerical solutions of the
governing equations, we first quantify the static shape of a ruck on a
horizontal plane. When the plane is inclined, the ruck becomes asymmetric and
moves by rolling only when the the inclination of the plane reaches a critical
angle. We find that the angle at which this first occurs is larger than the
angle at which the ruck stops, i.e. static rolling friction is larger than
dynamic rolling friction. Once the ruck is in motion, it travels at a constant
speed proportional to the sine of the angle of inclination, a result that we
rationalize in terms of a simple power balance. We conclude with a simple
implication of our study for the onset of rolling motion at soft interfaces.
