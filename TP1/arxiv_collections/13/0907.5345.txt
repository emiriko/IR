The dissipative dynamics of two interacting qubits coupled to independent
reservoirs at nonzero temperatures is investigated, paying special attention to
the entanglement evolution. The counter-rotating terms in the qubit-qubit
interaction give rise to stationary entanglement, traceable back to the ground
state structure. The robustness of this entanglement against thermal noise is
thoroughly analyzed, establishing that it can be detected at reasonable
experimental temperatures. Some effects linked to a possible reservoir
asymmetry are brought to light.
