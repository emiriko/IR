The Physics and Data Quality Monitoring (DQM) framework aims at providing a
homogeneous monitoring environment across various applications related to data
taking at the CMS experiment. In this contribution, the DQM system for the
Silicon Strip Tracker will be introduced. The set of elements to assess the
status of detector will be mentioned, along with the way to identify problems
and trace them to specific tracker elements. Monitoring tools, user interfaces
and automated software will be briefly described. The system was used during
extensive cosmic data taking of CMS in Autumn 2008, where it demonstrated to
have a flexible and robust implementation and has been essential to improve the
understanding of the detector. CMS collaboration believes that this tool is now
mature to face the forthcoming data-taking era.
