We have studied the magnetic reversal of L-shaped nanostructures fabricated
from (Ga,Mn)As. The strain relaxation due to the lithographic patterning
results in each arm having a uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. Our analysis
confirms that the magnetic reversal takes place via a combination of coherent
rotation and domain wall propagation with the domain wall positioned at the
corner of the device at intermediate stages of the magnetic hysteresis loops.
The domain wall energy can be extracted from our analysis. Such devices have
found implementation in studies of current induced domain wall motion and have
the potential for application as non-volatile memory elements.
