We present the analytic computation of leading high-energy logarithms of the
inclusive Drell-Yan and vector boson production cross-section.
  We also study the phenomenological relevance of the high-energy corrections
for Drell-Yan processes at the LHC. We find that the resummation corrects the
NNLO result by no more than a few percent, for values of the invariant mass of
the lepton pair below 100 GeV.
