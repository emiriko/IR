The effects of meson-exchange currents (MEC) are computed for the
one-particle one-hole transverse response function for finite nuclei at high
momentum transfers $q$ in the region of the quasielastic peak. A
semi-relativistic shell model is used for the one-particle-emission $(e,e')$
reaction. Relativistic effects are included using relativistic kinematics,
performing a semi-relativistic expansion of the current operators and using the
Dirac-equation-based (DEB) form of the relativistic mean field potential for
the final states. It is found that final-state interactions (FSI) produce an
important enhancement of the MEC in the high-energy tail of the response
function for $q\geq 1$ GeV/c. The combined effect of MEC and FSI goes away when
other models of the FSI, not based on the DEB potential, are employed.
