Hadrons are composite objects made of quarks and gluons, and during a
collision one can have several elementary interactions between the
constituents. These elementary interactions, using an appropriate theoretical
framework, can be related to the total and elastic cross sections. At high c.m.
energy it also becomes possible to identify experimentally a high pt subset of
the parton interactions and to study their multiplicity distribution.
Predictions of the multiple interactions rates are difficult because in
principle one needs to have a knowledge of the correlated Parton Distribution
Functions that describe the probability to find simultaneously different
partons in different elements of phase space. In this work we address this
question and suggest a method to describe effectively the fluctuations in the
instantaneous configuration of a colliding hadron. This problem is intimately
related to the origin of the inelastic diffractive processes. We present a new
method to include the diffractive cross section in an eikonal formalism that is
equivalent to a multi-channel eikonal. We compare with data and present an
extrapolation to higher energy.
