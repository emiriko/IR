In the last decade, several new imaging gaseous detectors, called
micro-pattern gaseous detectors, have been conceived and rapidly developed. In
this paper, the most popular designs of these detectors and their applications
to high energy physics and astrophysics experiments will be described. The main
focus of this review will however be on the ongoing activities on practical
applications of micro-pattern detectors to medicine and industry
