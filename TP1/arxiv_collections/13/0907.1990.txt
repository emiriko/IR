Classification of proteins based on their structure provides a valuable
resource for studying protein structure, function and evolutionary
relationships. With the rapidly increasing number of known protein structures,
manual and semi-automatic classification is becoming ever more difficult and
prohibitively slow. Therefore, there is a growing need for automated, accurate
and efficient classification methods to generate classification databases or
increase the speed and accuracy of semi-automatic techniques. Recognizing this
need, several automated classification methods have been developed. In this
survey, we overview recent developments in this area. We classify different
methods based on their characteristics and compare their methodology, accuracy
and efficiency. We then present a few open problems and explain future
directions.
