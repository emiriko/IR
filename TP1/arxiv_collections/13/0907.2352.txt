This review article discusses the experimental and theoretical status of
partonic charge symmetry. It is shown how the partonic content of various
structure functions gets redefined when the assumption of charge symmetry is
relaxed. We review various theoretical and phenomenological models for charge
symmetry violation in parton distribution functions. We summarize the current
experimental upper limits on charge symmetry violation in parton distributions.
A series of experiments are presented, which might reveal partonic charge
symmetry violation, or alternatively might lower the current upper limits on
parton charge symmetry violation.
