Active background reduction in high resolution calorimeters is a promising
approach to achieve ultimate sensitivity in neutrinoless double beta decay
experiments. We propose Cerenkov emission from beta rays in bolometric crystals
as a viable alternative to scintillation. This novel approach could broaden the
range of materials of interest for calorimetric searches of the double beta
decay. We discuss the optical properties of TeO$_2$ crystals, as a show case.
