Following the procedure introduced by Israel and Stewart, we expand the
entropy current up to the third order in the shear stress tensor
$\pi^{\alpha\beta}$ and derive a novel third-order evolution equation for
$\pi^{\alpha\beta}$. This equation is solved for the one-dimensional Bjorken
boost-invariant expansion. The scaling solutions for various values of the
shear viscosity to the entropy density ratio $\eta/s$ are shown to be in very
good agreement with those obtained from kinetic transport calculations. For the
pressure isotropy starting with 1 at $\tau_0=0.4 fm/c$, the third-order
corrections to Israel-Stewart theory are approximately 10\% for $\eta/s=0.2$
and more than a factor of 2 for $\eta/s=3$. We also estimate all higher-order
corrections to Israel-Stewart theory and demonstrate their importance in
describing highly viscous matters.
