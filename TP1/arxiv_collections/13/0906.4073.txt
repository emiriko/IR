This paper continues the study of a kernel family which uses the
Cauchy-Stieltjes kernel in place of the celebrated exponential kernel of the
exponential families theory. We extend the theory to cover generating measures
with support that is unbounded on one side. We illustrate the need for such an
extension by showing that cubic pseudo-variance functions correspond to
free-infinitely divisible laws without the first moment. We also determine the
domain of means, advancing the understanding of Cauchy-Stieltjes kernel
families also for compactly supported generating measures.
