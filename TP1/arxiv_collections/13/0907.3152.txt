We present a spectroscopic catalog of (mostly) red galaxies in 24 galaxy
clusters in the redshift range 0.17 < z < 0.92 obtained with the LRIS
instrument on the Keck I telescope. Here we describe the observations and the
galaxy spectra, including the discovery of three cD galaxies with LINER
emission spectra, and the spectroscopic discovery of four new galaxy-galaxy
lenses in cluster environments.
