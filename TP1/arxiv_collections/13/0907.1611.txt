A macroscopic realization of the strange virtual particles is presented. The
classical Helmholtz and the quantum mechanical Schr\"odinger equations are
analogous differential equations. Their imaginary solutions are called
evanescent modes in the case of elastic and electromagnetic fields. In the case
of non-relativistic quantum mechanical fields they are called tunneling
solutions. The imaginary solutions of this differential equation point to
strange consequences: They are non local, they are not observable, and they
described as virtual particles. During the last two decades QED calculations of
the imaginary solutions have been experimentally confirmed for phonons,
photons, and for electrons. The experimental proofs of the predictions of the
non-relativistic quantum mechanics and of the Wigner phase time approach for
the elastic, the electromagnetic and the Schr\"odinger fields will be presented
in this article. The results are zero tunneling time and an interaction time
(i.e. a phase shift) at the barrier interfaces. The measured barrier
interaction time (i.e. the barrier transmission time) scales approximately
inversely with the particle energy.
