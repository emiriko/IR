We discuss various aspects of models with long-lived or stable colored
particles. In particular we focus on an ideal Quirk model with electroweak
neutral heavy (O(TeV)) particles which carry ordinary color and another $
SU'(3)$ color with a very low scale $\Lambda'$. We show that contrary to what
one might think, such a model is cosmologically consistent and evades many
"Pitfalls" even for very low O(10 eV) $\Lambda'$ and without assuming a low
reheat temperature. We also show that the expected production of Quirks by
cosmic rays which are incorporated in heavy Isotopes in Ocean water is
consistent with the highly stringent bounds on the latter. This evades a real
threat to the Quirk model which would have excluded it regardless of Cosmology.
Finally we briefly comment on possible LHC signatures.
