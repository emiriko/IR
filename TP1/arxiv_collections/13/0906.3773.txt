We propose a new grand unification scenario for ensuring proton stability.
Our scenario is based on the idea that the proton decay problem is an
artificial one, which is caused from the identification of the gauge coupling
unification scale with the grand unification scale or the grand unified
symmetry breaking scale. We discuss a Lifshitz type gauge theory as a candidate
to realize our scenario.
