We consider resonant Dirac leptogenesis in a geometry with three
five-dimensional throats in the flat limit. The baryon asymmetry in the
universe is generated by resonant decays of heavy Kaluza-Klein scalars that are
copies of the standard model Higgs. Discrete exchange symmetries between the
throats are responsible for establishing two key features of the model. First,
they ensure a near degeneracy of the scalar masses and thus a resonant decay of
the scalars. This allows for Dirac leptogenesis at low energies close to the
TeV scale. Second, the discrete symmetries connect the observed baryon
asymmetry with the Yukawa couplings of the low-energy theory. As a consequence,
we obtain correlations between the low-energy leptonic mixing parameters and
the Dirac CP phase that can be tested at future neutrino oscillation
experiments such as neutrino factories.
