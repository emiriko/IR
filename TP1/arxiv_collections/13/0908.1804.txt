We present 3D hydrodynamical simulations of a jet launched from the secondary
star of a binary system inside a proto-planetary nebula. The secondary star
moves around the primary in a close eccentric orbit. From the gasdynamic
simulations we compute synthetic [NII] 6583 emission maps. Different jet axis
inclinations with respect to the orbital plane, as well as different
orientations of the flow with respect to the observer are considered. For some
parameter combinations, we obtain structures that show point- or
mirror-symmetric morphologies depending on the orientation of the flow with
respect to the observer. Furthermore, our models can explain some of the
emission distribution asymmetries that are summarized in the classification
given by Soker & hadar (2002).
