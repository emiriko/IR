Let G be a graph that may be drawn in the plane in such a way that all
internal faces are centrally symmetric convex polygons. We show how to find a
drawing of this type that maximizes the angular resolution of the drawing, the
minimum angle between any two incident edges, in polynomial time, by reducing
the problem to one of finding parametric shortest paths in an auxiliary graph.
The running time is at most O(t^3), where t is a parameter of the input graph
that is at most O(n) but is more typically proportional to n^.5.
