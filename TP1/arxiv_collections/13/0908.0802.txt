This paper presents a statistical analysis of Soft X-ray (SXR) flares during
the period January 1976 to December 2007 covering solar cycles (SCs) 21, 22,
and 23. We have analysed north-south (N-S) and east-west (E-W) asymmetry of SXR
at low (less than equal to 40 degree), high (greater than equal to 50 degree)
and total latitudes and center meridian distances (CMDs) respectively. We have
also presented the N-S and E-W asymmetry of different intensity classes (B, C,
M, and X) during the period of investigation. A slight southern and eastern
excess is found after analysis during SC 21, 22, and 23. We found that the
annual N-S and E-W hemispheric asymmetry at low latitudes and CMDs is the same
as total latitudes and CMDs respectively. E-W asymmetry is different at low and
high CMDs. Our statistical result shows that N-S asymmetry is statistically
more significant than E-W asymmetry. Total SXR flare activity during SC 23 is
high compared to SC 21 and 22. The B class flare activity is higher for SC 23
where as C, M and X class activities are higher for SC 21. We have also
analysied the flare evolution parameters, i.e. duration, rise time, decay time
and event asymmetry for total SXR as well as for different classes for last
three SCs. The duration, rise time and decay time increase with increasing
intensity class. On analysing event asymmetry indices, we found more positive
values during SC 21 (64.86 per cent) and SC 22 (54.31 per cent), but for SC 23
we have more negative values (48.08 per cent). Our study shows that during SC
23 we have more SXR flare events having shorter decay time as compared to SC 21
and SC 22.
