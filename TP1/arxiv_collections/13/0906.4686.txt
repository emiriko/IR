As part of the SMOS mission (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) IMS and EPHYSE
laboratories are involved in the study and validation of the inversion
algorithm LMEB. In the framework of this study, we developed a model using the
numerical modeling software-HFSS ANSOFT. It allows the computation of the
emissivity of multilayer systems (soil-litter for example). We have improved
our approach to incorporate new parameters that can have a significant effect
on the measurements. Indeed, so far the effect of soil roughness associated
with the litter has not been studied. Moreover, the thickness of litter is
never constant and we must therefore introduce a realistic profile of litter
thickness. This article presents our work to integrate these profiles in our
numerical model. These profiles may be derived from measurements (litter
thickness profiles or soil roughness profiles) or calculations (roughness
profile). In both cases the input data of our model are files of XYZ points
representing our profile.
