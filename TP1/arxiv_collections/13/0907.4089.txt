An example of a cold massive core, JCMT 18354-0649S, a possible high mass
analogue to a low mass star forming core is studied. Line and continuum
observations from JCMT, Mopra Telescope and Spitzer are presented and modelled
in detail using a 3D molecular line radiative transfer code. In almost every
way JCMT 18354-0649S is a scaled-up version of a typical low mass core with
similar temperatures, chemical abundances and densities. The difference is that
both the infall velocity and the turbulent width of the line profiles are an
order of magnitude larger. While the higher infall velocity is expected due to
the large mass of JCMT 18354-0649S, we suggest that the dissipation of this
highly supersonic turbulence may lead to the creation of dense clumps of gas
that surround the high mass core.
