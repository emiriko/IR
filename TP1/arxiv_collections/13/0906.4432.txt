A fractal-like (Cantor-like) stratified structure of chiral and convenient
isotropic layers is considered. Peculiarities of the wave localization,
self-similarity, scalability and sequential splitting in the reflected field of
both the co-polarized and cross-polarized components are studied. The appearing
of the additional peak multiplets in stopbands is revealed, and a correlation
of their properties with chirality parameter is established.
