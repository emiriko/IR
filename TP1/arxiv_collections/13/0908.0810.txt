ANTARES is a deep-sea, large volume Mediterranean neutrino telescope
installed off the Coast of Toulon, France. It is taking data in its complete
configuration since May 2008 with nearly 900 photomultipliers installed on 12
lines. It is today the largest high energy neutrino telescope of the northern
hemisphere. The charge calibration and threshold tuning of the photomultipliers
and their associated front-end electronics is of primary importance. It indeed
enables to translate signal amplitudes into number of photo-electrons which is
the relevant information for track and energy reconstruction. It has therefore
a strong impact on physics analysis. We will present the performances of the
front-end chip, so-called ARS, including the waveform mode of acquisition. The
in-laboratory as well as regularly performed in situ calibrations will be
presented together with related studies like the time evolution of the gain of
photomultipliers
