Graphene is a wonder material with many superlatives to its name. It is the
thinnest material in the universe and the strongest ever measured. Its charge
carriers exhibit giant intrinsic mobility, have the smallest effective mass (it
is zero) and can travel micrometer-long distances without scattering at room
temperature. Graphene can sustain current densities 6 orders higher than
copper, shows record thermal conductivity and stiffness, is impermeable to
gases and reconciles such conflicting qualities as brittleness and ductility.
Electron transport in graphene is described by a Dirac-like equation, which
allows the investigation of relativistic quantum phenomena in a bench-top
experiment. What are other surprises that graphene keeps in store for us? This
review analyses recent trends in graphene research and applications, and
attempts to identify future directions in which the field is likely to develop.
