Radio galaxies are the only non-blazar extragalactic objects detected in the
VHE (E >100 GeV) band. These objects enable the investigation of the main
substructures of the AGN, in particular the core, the jet and its interaction
with the intergalactic environment. Clusters of galaxies, instead, have not
been detected by gamma-ray observatories. These objects are collections of up
to thousands of galaxies and are the densest large-scale structures in the
universe. Galaxy clusters consist of up to 85% dark matter, that could reveal
its presence through self-annihilation and VHE gamma-ray emission. The
observation of non-thermal diffuse radio emission in galaxy clusters suggests
the presence of accelerated particles and high magnetic fields that can also
produce VHE emission. Results from the VERTIAS observations of radio galaxies
and galaxy clusters will be presented.
