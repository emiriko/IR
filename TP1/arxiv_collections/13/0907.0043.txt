Interpreting the J/psi suppression reported in nucleus--nucleus collisions at
SPS and RHIC requires the quantitative understanding of cold nuclear matter
effects, such as the inelastic rescattering of J/psi states in nuclei or the
nuclear modification of parton densities. With respect to our former Glauber
analysis, we include in the present work the new PHENIX d--Au measurements, and
analyze as well all existing data using the EPS08 nuclear parton densities
recently released. The largest suppression reported in the new PHENIX analysis
leads in turn to an increase of sigma from 3.5 +/- 0.3 mb to 5.4 +/- 2.5 mb
using proton PDF. The stronger x-dependence of the G^{A}/G^p ratio in EPS08 as
compared to e.g. EKS98 shifts the cross section towards larger values at fixed
target energies (x_2 ~ 0.1) while decreasing somehow the value extracted at
RHIC (x_2 ~10^{-2}).
