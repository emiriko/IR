A large number of energetic electrons are generated during solar flares. They
carry a substantial part of the flare released energy but how these electrons
are created is not fully understood yet. This paper suggests that plasma motion
in an active region in the photosphere is the source of large electric
currents. These currents can be described by macroscopic circuits. Under
special circumstances currents can establish in the corona along magnetic field
lines. The energy released by these currents when moderate assumptions for the
local conditions are made, is found be comparable to the flare energy.
