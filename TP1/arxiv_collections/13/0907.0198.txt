We demonstrate experimentally and numerically that nonplanar chiral
metamaterials give giant optical activity, circular dichroism, and negative
refractive index. The transmission, reflection, and the retrieval results of
the experiments agree pretty well with the simulations. This is an important
step toward the design and fabrication of three-dimensional isotropic chiral
metamaterials.
