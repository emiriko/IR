We demonstrate that the magnetic field dependence of the conductivity
measured at the transition temperature allows the dynamical critical exponent,
the thickness of thin superconducting films and interfaces, and the limiting
lateral length to be determined. The resulting tool is applied to the
conductivity data of an amorphous Nb0.15 Si0.85 film and a LaAlO3/SrTiO3
interface.
