The LHCb experiment is shown to be ideal for studies of exclusive final
states from central diffractive reactions. The gluon-rich environment of the
central system allows detailed QCD studies and searches for exotic meson
states, such as glueballs, molecules, hybrids and new charmonium-like states.
It would also provide a good testing ground for detailed studies of heavy
quarkonia. Due to its distinct design features, the LHCb can accurately measure
the low-mass central systems with good purity. The efficiency of the FSC system
for detecting rapidity gaps is shown to be adequate for the proposed studies.
With this detector arrangement, valuable new data can be obtained by tagging
central diffractive processes.
