Using the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope, we have
obtained deep optical images reaching well below the oldest main sequence
turnoff in six fields of the Andromeda Galaxy. The fields fall at four
positions on the southeast minor axis, one position in the giant stellar
stream, and one position on the northeast major axis. These data were obtained
as part of three large observing programs designed to probe the star formation
history of the stellar population in various structures of the galaxy. In this
paper, we present the images, catalogs, and artificial star tests for these
observing programs as a supplement to the analyses published previously. These
high-level science products are also archived at the Multimission Archive at
the Space Telescope Science Institute.
