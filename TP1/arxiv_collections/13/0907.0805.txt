After introducing sketchily Bohr's wave-particle complementarity principle in
his own words, a derivation of an extended form of the principle from standard
quantum mechanics is performed. Reality-evaluation of each step is given. The
derived theory is applied to simple examples and the extended entities are
illustrated in a thought experiment. Assessment of the approach of Bohr and of
this article is taken up again with a rather negative conclusion as far as
reflecting reality is concerned. The paper ends with selected incisive opinions
on Bohr's dogmatic attitude and with some comments by the present author.
