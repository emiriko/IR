A clear protocol for synthesis of sequential reversible circuits from any
particular gate library has been provided. Using that protocol, reversible
circuits for SR latch, D latch, JK latch and T latch are designed from NCT gate
library. All the circuits have been optimized with the help of existing local
optimization algorithms (e.g. template matching, moving rule and deletion
rule). It has been shown that the present proposals have lower gate
complexities, lower number of garbage bits, lower quantum cost and lower number
of feedback loops compared to the earlier proposals. For a fair comparison, the
optimized sequential circuits have been compared with the earlier proposals for
the same after converting the earlier proposed circuits into equivalent NCT
circuits. Further, we have shown that the advantage in gate count obtained in
some of the earlier proposals by introduction of New gates is an artifact and
if it is allowed then every reversible circuit block can be reduced to a single
gate. In this context, some important conceptual issues related to the
designing and optimization of sequential reversible circuits have been
addressed. A protocol for minimization of quantum cost of reversible circuit
has also been proposed here.
