Generally ``exact'' Quantum Monte Carlo computations for the ground state of
many Bosons make use of importance sampling. The importance sampling is based,
either on a guiding function or on an initial variational wave function. Here
we investigate the need of importance sampling in the case of Path Integral
Ground State (PIGS) Monte Carlo. PIGS is based on a discrete imaginary time
evolution of an initial wave function with a non zero overlap with the ground
state, that gives rise to a discrete path which is sampled via a Metropolis
like algorithm. In principle the exact ground state is reached in the limit of
an infinite imaginary time evolution, but actual computations are based on
finite time evolutions and the question is whether such computations give
unbiased exact results. We have studied bulk liquid and solid 4He with PIGS by
considering as initial wave function a constant, i.e. the ground state of an
ideal Bose gas. This implies that the evolution toward the ground state is
driven only by the imaginary time propagator, i.e. there is no importance
sampling. For both the phases we obtain results converging to those obtained by
considering the best available variational wave function (the Shadow wave
function) as initial wave function. Moreover we obtain the same results even by
considering wave functions with the wrong correlations, for instance a wave
function of a strongly localized Einstein crystal for the liquid phase. This
convergence is true not only for diagonal properties such as the energy, the
radial distribution function and the static structure factor, but also for
off-diagonal ones, such as the one--body density matrix. From this analysis we
conclude that zero temperature PIGS calculations can be as unbiased as those of
finite temperature Path Integral Monte Carlo.
