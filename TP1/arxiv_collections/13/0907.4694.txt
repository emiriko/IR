The common security criterion d in quantum key distribution is taken to solve
the universal composability problem in quantum key distribution as well as
providing good general quantitative security guarantee. In this paper it is
shown that these are a result of an invalid interpretation of d. The general
security significance of d is analyzed in detail. The related issues of
universality and attacker's side information are discussed.
