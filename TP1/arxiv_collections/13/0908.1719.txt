Aims. Intermediate Mass (IM) stars are an important component of our Galaxy,
as they significantly contribute to the interstellar FUV field and,
consequently, play an important role in the energy balance of the ISM. Despite
their importance, very little is known about their formation process and only a
few studies have been devoted to characterize the first phases in the evolution
of intermediate mass protostars. Here we consider in great detail the case of
the brightest and closest known young IM protostar: FIR4 in the OMC2 component
of the Orion molecular cloud complex. Methods. We analyzed the available
continuum emission (maps and SED) through one-dimensional dust radiative
transfer calculations. We ran large grids of models to find the envelope model
that best fits the data. The derived dust density and temperature profiles have
been then used to compute the gas temperature profile, equating gas cooling and
heating terms across the envelope. Last, we computed the water line spectrum
for various possible values of water abundance. Results. The luminosity of FIR4
has been reevaluated to 1000 Lo, making FIR4 definitively an Intermediate Mass
protostar. The envelope surrounding FIR4 has a relatively shallow density power
law index, ~ 0.6. The most surprising result is that the gas and dust are
thermally decoupled in the interior of the envelope, where the dust ices
sublimate at 100 K. This has important consequences in the interpretation of
the line data. We provide the predictions for the water spectrum, and discuss
in detail the lines which will be observed by the Herschel Space Observatory .
