A quantum control landscape is defined as the objective to be optimized as a
function of the control variables. Existing empirical and theoretical studies
reveal that most realistic quantum control landscapes are generally devoid of
false traps. However, the impact of singular controls has yet to be
investigated, which can arise due to a singularity on the mapping from the
control to the final quantum state. We provide an explicit characterization of
such controls that are strongly Hamiltonian-dependent and investigate their
associated landscape geometry. Although in principle the singularities may
correspond to local traps, we did not find any in numerical simulations. Also,
as they occupy a small portion of the entire set of possible critical controls,
their influence is expected to be much smaller than controls corresponding to
the commonly located regular extremals. This observation supports the
established ease of optimal searches to find high-quality controls in
simulations and experiments.
