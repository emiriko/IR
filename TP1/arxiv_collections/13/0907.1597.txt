We show how the necessary and sufficient conditions for the NFL to apply can
be reduced to the single requirement of the set of objective functions under
consideration being closed under permutation, and quantify the extent to which
a set of objectives not closed under permutation can give rise to a performance
difference between two algorithms. Then we provide a more refined definition of
performance under which we show that revisiting algorithms are always trumped
by enumerative ones.
