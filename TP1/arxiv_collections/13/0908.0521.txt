In this work a generalization of Onsager-Machlup's theory of time-dependent
thermal fluctuations of equilibrium systems is proposed, to the case in which
the system relaxes irreversibly along a non-equilibrium trajectory that can be
approximated as a sequence of stationary states. This generalization is
summarized by a canonical description of the dependence of the two-time
correlation function C(t+\tau,t), and of the equal-time correlation function
\sigma(t)= C(t,t) (the covariance of the fluctuations), on the non-equilibrium
relaxation time t.
