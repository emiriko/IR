ASAS, MACHO, OGLE and SAAO JHKL light curves of 13 stars, that have at some
time been classified as D-type symbiotics, are analysed. Most of the near-IR
light-curves that have been monitored over many years show long-term changes
due to variable dust obscuration, in addition to the stellar pulsation. The
distances to these objects are derived from the period-luminosity relation and
estimates of the mass-loss rates made from the Ko-[12] colour.
  We reclassify AS 245 as an S-type symbiotic, with a semi-regular cool
component with a pulsation period of about one year. The periods of the large
amplitude pulsations of SS73 38 (463 days), AS 210 (423 days) and H2-38 (395
days) are estimated for the first time, confirming that they are symbiotic
Miras.
  A comparison of the symbiotic Miras with normal Miras of similar pulsation
period shows that the symbiotic stars have on average higher values of Ko-[12].
This may indicate that they have higher mass-loss rates, or more likely that
the dust which is being lost by the Mira is trapped within the binary system.
