Localization of plastic strain induced by softening can be objectively
described by a regularized plasticity model that postulates a dependence of the
current yield stress on a nonlocal softening variable defined by a differential
(gradient) expression. This paper presents analytical solutions of the
one-dimensional localization problem under certain special nonuniform stress
distributions. The one-dimensional problem can be interpreted as describing
either a tensile bar with variable cross section, or a beam subjected to a
nonuniform bending moment. Explicit as well as implicit gradient formulations
are considered. The evolution of the plastic strain profile and the shape of
the load-displacement diagram are investigated. It is shown that even if the
local constitutive law exhibits softening right from the onset of yielding, the
global load-displacement diagram has a hardening part. The interplay between
the internal length scales characterizing the material and the geometry is
discussed.
