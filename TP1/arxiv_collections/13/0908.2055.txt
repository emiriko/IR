A scheme for the generation of a Tonks-Girardeau gas of photons with purely
dissipative interaction is described.
  We put forward a master equation approach for the description of stationary
light in atomic four-level media and show that, under suitable conditions, two
particle decays are the dominant photon loss mechanism. These dissipative
two-photon losses increase the interaction strength by at least one order of
magnitude as compared to dispersive two-photon processes and can drive the
photons into the Tonks-Girardeau regime. Different scenarios for the
observation of fermionic correlations between photons in the Tonks-Girardeau
gas regime are discussed.
