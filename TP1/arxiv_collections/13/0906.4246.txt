(Abridged) This thesis presents long-term timing results on 20 millisecond
pulsars (MSPs). It has been predicted that such timing may detect gravitational
waves (GWs) - a major (but untested) prediction of general relativity. Our
results demonstrate that most of the investigated MSPs have sufficient
stability to enable such detection experiments. Furthermore, the timing data of
the brightest few sources shows that timing at sub-100 ns precision may be
achievable and that, therefore, GW detection within the next decade is likely.
Finally, we use our data to place a strong limit on the strength of a predicted
background of GWs.
