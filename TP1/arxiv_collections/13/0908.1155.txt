The existence of the QCD critical point at non-zero baryon density is not
only of great interest for experimental physics but also a challenge for the
theory. We use lattice simulations based on the canonical ensemble method to
explore the finite baryon density region and look for the critical point. We
scan the phase diagram of QCD with three degenerate quark flavors using clover
fermions with $m_\pi \approx 700{MeV}$ on $6^3\times4$ lattices. We measure the
baryon chemical potential as we increase the density and we see the
characteristic "S-shape" that signals the first order phase transition. We
determine the phase boundary by Maxwell construction and report our preliminary
results for the location of critical point.
