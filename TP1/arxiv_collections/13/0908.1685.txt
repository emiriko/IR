In the coarse grained Brownian Dynamics simulation method the many solvent
molecules are replaced by random thermal kicks and an effective friction acting
on the particles of interest. For Brownian Dynamics the friction has to be so
strong that the particles' velocities are damped much faster than the duration
of an integration timestep. Here we show that this conceptual limit can be
dropped with an analytic integration of the equations of damped motion. In the
resulting Langevin integration scheme our recently proposed approximate form of
the hydrodynamic interactions between the particles can be incorparated
conveniently, leading to a fast multi-particle propagation scheme, which
captures more of the short-time and short-range solvent effects than standard
BD. Comparing the dynamics of a bead-spring model of a short peptide, we
recommend to run simulations of small biological molecules with the Langevin
type finite damping and to include the hydrodynamic interactions.
