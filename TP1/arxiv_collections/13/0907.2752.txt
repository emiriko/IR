Pierre Auger experiment has detected at least a couple of ray events above
energy 60 EeV from the direction of the radio-galaxy Centaurus A. Assuming
those events are from Centaurus A, we have calculated the number of neutral
cosmic ray events from this source for small values of the degree of violation
in Lorentz invariance. Our results show that a comparison of our calculated
numbers of events with the observed number of events at EeV energy from the
direction of the source can probe extremely low value of the degree of this
violation.
