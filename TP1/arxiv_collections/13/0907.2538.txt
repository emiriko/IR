A model is presented of the leptons, quarks and bosons as non-elementary
particles being composed of spinons. They are defined as massless fermions
obeying the Weyl equations, but in addition are charged and assumed to have two
internal degrees of freedom (weak colour charges). The corresponding total
Lagrangian density of the quantized fields has a fermionic part and a
gauge-field part, which leads to the interaction of the charged spinons. They
are bound together by the gauge fields of the non-Abelian SU(2) symmetry group,
and three of them can combine to a triple state forming the well known first
generation of left- and right-handed leptons and quarks, including their proper
electric charges (fractional for the quarks). The neutral and charged vector
bosons of the weak interactions or the Higgs bosons can be constructed as
binaries of two spinons.
