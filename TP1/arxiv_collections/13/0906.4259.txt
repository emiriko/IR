We present full three-dimensional numerical calculations of single vortex
states in rotating dipolar condensates. We consider a Bose-Einstein condensate
of 52Cr atoms with dipole-dipole and s-wave contact interactions confined in an
axially symmetric harmonic trap. We obtain the vortex states by numerically
solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the rotating frame with no further
approximations. We investigate the properties of a single vortex and calculate
the critical angular velocity for different values of the s-wave scattering
length. We show that, whereas the standard variational approach breaks down in
the limit of pure dipolar interactions, exact solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation can be obtained for values of the s-wave scattering length down to
zero. The energy barrier for the nucleation of a vortex is calculated as a
function of the vortex displacement from the rotation axis for different values
of the angular velocity of the rotating trap.
