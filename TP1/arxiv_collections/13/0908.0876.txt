The prospects for the analysis of tau channels at the SUSY benchmark point
SPS1a', especially from e+e- -> stau_1 stau_1 and e+e- -> stau_2 stau_2, have
been studied in full simulation of the ILD detector concept forseen for the
International Linear Collider. All accessible SUSY channels as well as all
Standard Model backgrounds were generated at a centre-of-mass energy E_CMS=500
GeV, including the beam energy spectrum and beam backgrounds expected for
nominal ILC beam parameters. With an integrated luminosity of 500 fb-1
delivered to the experiment, the masses of the stau_1 and stau_2 can be
measured to 107.69^{+0.03}_{-0.06} GeV +- 1.1 \delta M_LSP and 183 ^{+11}_{-5}
GeV +- 18 \delta M_LSP, respectively, while the true values in SPS1a' are 107.9
GeV and 194.9 GeV, respectively. The cross sections for stau_1 and stau_2 pair
production could be obtained with a precision of 3.1% and 4.2%, respectively.
Combining the mass and cross section measurement in the stau_2 channel allows
to determine the LSP mass with a relative error of 1.7%, assuming a known
mixing angle. In stau_1 -> tau LSP decays, the tau polarisation is measured to
be 91 +- 9% and 87.0 +- 3.4% in the pi and rho decay channels of the tau,
respectively. The true value in the simulated SPS1a' sample is 89.6%.
