Absence of localization is demonstrated analytically to leading order in weak
disorder in a one-dimensional Anderson model of a ring threaded by an
Aharonov-Bohm (A-B) flux. The result follows from adapting an earlier
perturbation treatment of disorder in a superconducting ring subjected to an
imaginary vector potential proportional to a depinning field for flux lines
bound to random columnar defects parallel to the axis of the ring. The absence
of localization in the ring threaded by an A-B flux for sufficiently weak
disorder is compatible with large free electron type persistent current
obtained in recent studies of the above model.
