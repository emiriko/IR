The physical meaning of the particularly simple non-degenerate supermetric,
introduced in the previous part by the authors, is elucidated and the possible
connection with processes of topological origin in high energy physics is
analyzed and discussed. New possible mechanism of the localization of the
fields in a particular sector of the supermanifold is proposed and the
similarity and differences with a 5-dimensional warped model are shown. The
relation with gauge theories of supergravity based in the $OSP(1/4)$ group is
explicitly given and the possible original action is presented. We also show
that in this non-degenerate super-model the physic states, in contrast with the
basic states, are observables and can be interpreted as tomographic projections
or generalized representations of operators belonging to the metaplectic group
$Mp(2)$. The advantage of geometrical formulations based on non-degenerate
super-manifolds over degenerate ones is pointed out and the description and the
analysis of some interesting aspects of the simplest Riemannian superspaces are
presented from the point of view of the possible vacuum solutions.
