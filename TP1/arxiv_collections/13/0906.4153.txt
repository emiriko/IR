We present a new mass estimate of a well-studied gravitational lensing
cluster, Abell 1689, from deep Chandra observations with a total exposure of
200 ks. Within r=200 h-1 kpc, the X-ray mass estimate is systematically lower
than that of lensing by 30-50%. At r>200 h-1 kpc, the mass density profiles
from X-ray and weak lensing methods give consistent results. The most recent
weak lensing work suggest a steeper profile than what is found from the X-ray
analysis, while still in agreement with the mass at large radii. Previous
studies have suggested that cooler small-scale structures can bias X-ray
temperature measurements or that the northern part of the cluster is disturbed.
We find these scenarios unlikely to resolve the central mass discrepancy since
the former requires 70-90% of the space to be occupied by these cool structures
and excluding the northern substructure does not significantly affect the total
mass profiles. A more plausible explanation is a projection effect. We also
find that the previously reported high hard-band to broad-band temperature
ratio in A1689, and many other clusters observed with Chandra, may be resulting
from the instrumental absorption that decreases 10-15% of the effective area at
~1.75 keV.
