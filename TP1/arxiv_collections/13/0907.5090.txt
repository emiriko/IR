We calculate the relic density of the lightest neutralino in a supersymmetric
seesaw type-II (``triplet seesaw'') model with minimal supergravity boundary
conditions at the GUT scale. The presence of a triplet below the GUT scale,
required to explain measured neutrino data in this setup, leads to a
characteristic deformation of the sparticle spectrum with respect to the pure
mSugra expectations, affecting the calculated relic dark matter (DM) density.
We discuss how the DM allowed regions in the (m_0,M_{1/2}) plane change as a
function of the (type-II) seesaw scale. We also compare the constraints imposed
on the models parameter space form upper limits on lepton flavour violating
(LFV) decays to those imposed by DM. Finally, we briefly comment on
uncertainties in the calculation of the relic neutralino density due to
uncertainties in the measured top and bottom masses.
