The formation of H2 in the interstellar medium proceeds on the surfaces of
silicate or carbonaceous particles. To get a deeper insight of its formation on
the latter substrate, this letter focuses on H2 desorption from graphite (0001)
in Temperature-Programmed-Desorption Monte-Carlo simulations. The results are
compared to experimental results which show two main peaks and an intermediate
shoulder for high initial coverage. The simulation program includes barriers
obtained by ab-initio methods and is further optimised to match two independent
experimental observations. The simulations reproduce the two experimental
observed desorption peaks. Additionally, a possible origin of the intermediate
peak is given.
