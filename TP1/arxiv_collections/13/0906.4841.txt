Nonequilibrium Green's functions represent a promising tool for describing
central nuclear reactions. Even at the single-particle level, though, the
Green's functions contain more information that computers may handle in the
foreseeable future. In this study, we investigate whether all the information
contained in the Green's functions is necessarily relevant when describing the
time evolution of nuclear reactions. For this, we carry out mean-field
calculations of slab collisions in one dimension.
