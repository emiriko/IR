Phase transitions and effects of external noise on many body systems are one
of the main topics in physics. In mean field coupled nonlinear dynamical
stochastic systems driven by Brownian noise, various types of phase transitions
including nonequilibrium ones may appear. A Brownian motion is a special case
of L\'evy motion and the stochastic process based on the latter is an
alternative choice for studying cooperative phenomena in various fields.
Recently, fractional Fokker-Planck equations associated with L\'evy noise have
attracted much attention and behaviors of systems with double-well potential
subjected to L\'evy noise have been studied intensively. However, most of such
studies have resorted to numerical computation. We construct an {\it
analytically solvable model} to study the occurrence of phase transitions
driven by L\'evy stable noise.
