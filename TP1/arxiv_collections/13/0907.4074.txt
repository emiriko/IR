Previous formulations of heating and transport associated with strong
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence are generalized to incorporate separate
internal energy equations for electrons and protons. Electron heat conduction
is included. Energy is supplied by turbulent heating that affects both
electrons and protons, and is exchanged between them via collisions. Comparison
to available Ulysses data shows that a reasonable accounting for the data is
provided when (i) the energy exchange timescale is very long and (ii) the
deposition of heat due to turbulence is divided, with 60% going to proton
heating and 40% into electron heating. Heat conduction, determined here by an
empirical fit, plays a major role in describing the electron data.
