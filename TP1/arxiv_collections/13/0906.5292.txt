Proton beam transport in the context of proton driven Fast Ignition is
usually assumed to be stable due to protons high inertia, but an analytical
analysis of the process is still lacking. The stability of a charge and current
neutralized proton beam passing through a plasma is therefore conducted here,
for typical proton driven Fast Ignition parameters. In the cold regime, two
fast growing Buneman-like modes are found, with an inverse growth-rate much
smaller than the beam time-of-flight to the target core. The stability issue is
thus not so obvious, and Kinetic effects are investigated. One unstable mode is
found stabilized by the background plasma protons and electrons temperatures.
The second mode is also damped, providing the proton beam thermal spread is
larger than $\sim$ 10 keV. In Fusion conditions, the beam propagation should
therefore be stable.
