The depolarization channel is usually modelled as a quantum operation that
destroys all input information, replacing it by a completely chaotic state. For
qubits this has a quite intuitive interpretation as a shrinking of the Bloch
sphere. We propose a way to deal with depolarizing dynamics (in the Markov
approximation) for systems with arbitrary symmetries.
