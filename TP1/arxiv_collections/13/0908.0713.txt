Graphene is a relatively new material (2004) made of atomic layers of carbon
arranged in a honeycomb lattice. Josephson junction devices are made from
graphene by depositing two parallel superconducting leads on a graphene flake.
These devices have hysteretic current-voltage characteristics with a
supercurrent branch and Shapiro steps appear when irradiated with microwaves.
These properties motivate us to investigate the presence of quantum metastable
states similar to those found in conventional current-biased Josephson
junctions. We present work investigating the nature of these metastable states
for ballistic graphene Josephson junctions. We model the effective Washboard
potential for these devices and estimate parameters, such as energy level
spacing and critical currents, to deduce the design needed to observe
metastable states. We propose devices consisting of a parallel on-chip
capacitor and suspended graphene. The capacitor is needed to lower the energy
level spacing down to the experimentally accessible range of 1-20 GHz. The
suspended graphene helps reduce the noise that may otherwise come from
two-level states in the insulating oxide layer. Moreover, back-gate voltage
control of its critical current introduces another knob for quantum control. We
will also report on current experimental progress in the area of fabrication of
this proposed device.
