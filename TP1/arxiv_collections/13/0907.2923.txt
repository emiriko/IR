We discuss observational evidence that quasars play a key role in the
formation of galaxies starting from the detailed study of the quasar
HE0450-2958 and extending the discussion to a series of converging evidence
that radio jets may trigger galaxy formation. The direct detection with VISIR
at the ESO-VLT of the 7 kpc distant companion galaxy of HE0450-2958 allows us
to spatially separate the sites of quasar and star formation activity in this
composite system made of two ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). No host
galaxy has yet been detected for this quasar, but the companion galaxy stellar
mass would bring HE0450-2958 in the local M(BH)-M(stellar bulge) relation if it
were to merge with the QSO. This is bound to happen because of their close
distance (7 kpc) and small relative velocity (~60-200 km/s). We conclude that
we may be witnessing the building of the M(BH)-M(stellar bulge) relation, or at
least of a major event in that process. The star formation rate (~340 Msun/yr),
age (40-200 Myr) and stellar mass ([5-6]x10^10 Msun) are consistent with
jet-induced formation of the companion galaxy. We suggest that HE0450-2958 may
be fueled in fresh material by cold gas accretion from intergalactic filaments.
We map the projected galaxy density surrounding the QSO as a potential tracer
of intergalactic filaments and discuss a putative detection. Comparison to
other systems suggests that inside-out formation of quasar host galaxies and
jet-induced galaxy formation may be a common process. Two tests are proposed
for this new paradigm: (1) the detection of offset molecular gas or dust
emission with respect to the position of distant QSOs, (2) the delayed
formation of host galaxies as a result of QSO activity, hence the two step
building of the M(BH)/M(stellar bulge) ratio.
