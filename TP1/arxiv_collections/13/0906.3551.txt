The spontaneous magnetization of a two-dimensional lattice model can be
expressed in terms of the partition function $W$ of a system with fixed
boundary spins and an extra weight dependent on the value of a particular
central spin. For the superintegrable case of the chiral Potts model with
cylindrical boundary conditions, W can be expressed in terms of reduced
hamiltonians H and a central spin operator S. We conjectured in a previous
paper that W can be written as a determinant, similar to that of the Ising
model. Here we generalize this conjecture to any Hamiltonians that satisfy a
more general Onsager algebra, and give a conjecture for the elements of S.
