Bending and vibration tests performed inside the scanning electron microscope
were used to mechanically characterize high-aspect pillars grown by focused
electron-beam (FEB) induced deposition from the precursor Cu(C5HF6O2)2.
Supported by finite element (FE) analysis the Young's modulus was determined
from load-deflection measurements using cantilever-based force sensing and the
material density from additional resonance vibration analysis. The pillar
material consisted of a carbonaceous (C, O, F, H containing) matrix which
embeds 5...10 at. % Cu deposited at 5 keV and 20 keV primary electron energy
and 100 pA beam current, depending on primary electron energy. Young's moduli
of the FEB deposits increased from 17+/-6 GPa to 25+/-8 GPa with increasing
electron dose. The density of the carbonaceous matrix shows a dependence on the
primary electron energy: 1.2+/-0.3 g cm-3 (5 keV) and 2.2+/-0.5 g cm-3 (20
keV). At a given primary energy a correlation with the irradiation dose is
found. Quality factors determined from the phase relation at resonance of the
fundamental pillar vibration mode were in the range of 150 to 600 and
correlated to the deposited irradiation energy.
