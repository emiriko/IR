We describe the temporal evolution of the time-resolved photoemission
response of the spinless Falicov-Kimball model driven out of equilibrium by
strong applied fields. The model is one of the few possessing a metal-insulator
transition and admitting an exact solution in the time domain. The
nonequilibrium dynamics, evaluated using an extension of dynamical mean-field
theory, show how the driven system differs from two common viewpoints - a
quasiequilibrium system at an elevated effective temperature (the "hot"
electron model) or a rapid interaction quench ("melting" of the Mott gap) - due
to the rearrangement of electronic states and redistribution of spectral
weight. The results demonstrate the inherent trade-off between energy and time
resolution accompanying the finite width probe pulses, characteristic of those
employed in pump-probe time-domain experiments, which can be used to focus
attention on different aspects of the dynamics near the transition.
