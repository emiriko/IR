A new efficient algorithm is proposed for factoring polynomials over an
algebraic extension field. The extension field is defined by a polynomial ring
modulo a maximal ideal. If the maximal ideal is given by its Groebner basis, no
extra Groebner basis computation is needed for factoring a polynomial over this
extension field. Nothing more than linear algebraic technique is used to get a
polynomial over the ground field by a generic linear map. Then this polynomial
is factorized over the ground field. From these factors, the factorization of
the polynomial over the extension field is obtained. The new algorithm has been
implemented and computer experiments indicate that the new algorithm is very
efficient, particularly in complicated examples.
