Measuring single spin asymmetries in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering
(SIDIS) on a transversely polarized target gives a handle to investigate the
transversity distribution and transverse momentum dependent distribution
functions. In the years 2002, 2003 and 2004 COMPASS took data with a
transversely polarized deuteron target and in the year 2007 with a proton
target. Three channels for accessing transversity have been analysed. Azimuthal
asymmetries in the production of hadron pairs, involving the polarized two
hadron interference fragmentation function, azimuthal asymmetries in the
production of single hadrons, involving the Collins fragmentation function and
polarization measurements of spin-${1/2} \hbar$ particles like
$\Lambda$-Hyperons via their self analyzing weak decay. In the following we
will focus on new preliminary results from the analysis of two hadron pair
asymmetries measured with the proton target.
