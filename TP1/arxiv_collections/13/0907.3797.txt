As a necessary step towards the extraction of realistic results from Loop
Quantum Cosmology, we analyze the physical consequences of including
inhomogeneities. We consider in detail the quantization of a gravitational
model in vacuo which possesses local degrees of freedom, namely, the linearly
polarized Gowdy cosmologies with the spatial topology of a three-torus. We
carry out a hybrid quantization which combines loop and Fock techniques. We
discuss the main aspects and results of this hybrid quantization, which include
the resolution of the cosmological singularity, the polymeric quantization of
the internal time, a rigorous definition of the quantum constraints and the
construction of their solutions, the Hilbert structure of the physical states,
and the recovery of a conventional Fock quantization for the inhomogeneities.
