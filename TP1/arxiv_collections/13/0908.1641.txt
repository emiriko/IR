As a practical method, the passive scheme is useful to monitor the photon
statistics of an untrusted source in a "Plug & Play" quantum key distribution
(QKD) system. In a passive scheme, three kinds of monitor mode can be adopted:
average photon number (APN) monitor, photon number analyzer (PNA) and photon
number distribution (PND) monitor. In this paper, the security analysis is
rigorously given for APN monitor, while for PNA, the analysis including
statistical fluctuation and random noise, is addressed with a confidence level.
The results show that the PNA can achieve better performance than the APN
monitor and can asymptotically approach the theoretical limit of the PND
monitor. Also, the passive scheme with the PNA works efficiently when the
signal-to-noise ratio ($R^{SN}$) is not too low and so is highly applicable to
solve the untrusted source problem in the QKD system.
