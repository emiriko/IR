The face monoid described in [M1] acts on the integrable highest weight
modules of a symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebra. It has similar structural
properties as a reductive algebraic monoid whose unit group is a Kac-Moody
group. We found in [M5] two natural extensions of the action of the Kac-Moody
group on its building to actions of the face monoid on the building. Now we
give an algebraic geometric model of one of these actions of the face monoid.
The building is obtained as a part of the spectrum of homogeneous prime ideals
of the Cartan algebra of the Kac-Moody group. We describe the full spectrum of
homogeneous prime ideals of the Cartan algebra.
