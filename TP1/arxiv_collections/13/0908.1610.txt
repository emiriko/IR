Observation by the CANGAROO-III stereoscopic system of the Imaging Cherenkov
Telescope has detected extended emission of TeV gamma rays in the vicinity of
the pulsar PSR B1706$-$44. The strength of the signal observed as
gamma-ray-like events varies when we apply different ways of emulating
background events. The reason for such uncertainties is argued in relevance to
gamma-rays embedded in the "off-source data", that is, unknown sources and
diffuse emission in the Galactic plane, namely, the existence of a complex
structure of TeV gamma-ray emission around PSR B1706$-$44.
