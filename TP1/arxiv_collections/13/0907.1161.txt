Control over the properties of nanoparticles obtained by laser ablation in
liquids is experimentally demonstrated via modulation of the beam intensity
profile on the target. Mask projection scheme was used with either a copper
laser (wavelength of 510. 6 nm, pulse duration of 10ns) or with a Ti:sapphire
laser (wavelength of 800 nm and pulse duration of 200 fs). Si and ZnSe were
chosen as target materials. Obtained nanoparticles were characterized using
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), optical absorption spectroscopy and
photoluminescence. It was shown that that size of Si nanoparticles depends on
the spatial profile of the laser beam.
