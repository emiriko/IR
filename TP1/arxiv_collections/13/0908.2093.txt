In this paper, we present a unified computational method based on
pseudospectral approximations for the design of optimal pulse sequences in open
quantum systems. The proposed method transforms the problem of optimal pulse
design, which is formulated as a continuous time optimal control problem, to a
finite dimensional constrained nonlinear programming problem. This resulting
optimization problem can then be solved using existing numerical optimization
suites. We apply the Legendre pseudospectral method to a series of optimal
control problems on open quantum systems that arise in Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in liquids. These problems have been well studied
in previous literature and analytical optimal controls have been found. We find
an excellent agreement between the maximum transfer efficiency produced by our
computational method and the analytical expressions. Moreover, our method
permits us to extend the analysis and address practical concerns, including
smoothing discontinuous controls as well as deriving minimum energy controls.
The method is not restricted to the systems studied in this article but is
universal to every open quantum system whose performance is limited by
dissipation.
