This paper extends results of earlier work on ASEP to the case of step
Bernoulli initial condition. The main results are a representation in terms of
a Fredholm determinant for the probability distribution of a fixed particle,
and asymptotic results which in particular establish KPZ universality for this
probability in one regime. (And, as a corollary, for the current fluctuations.)
