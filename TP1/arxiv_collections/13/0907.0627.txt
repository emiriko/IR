The present work reports synthesis, as well as a detailed and careful
characterization of structural, magnetic, and dielectric properties of
differently tempered undoped and doped CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) ceramics. For this
purpose, neutron and x-ray powder diffraction, SQUID measurements, and
dielectric spectroscopy have been performed. Mn-, Fe-, and Ni-doped CCTO
ceramics were investigated in great detail to document the influence of
low-level doping with 3d metals on the antiferromagnetic structure and
dielectric properties. In the light of possible magnetoelectric coupling in
these doped ceramics, the dielectric measurements were also carried out in
external magnetic fields up to 7 T, showing a minor but significant dependence
of the dielectric constant on the applied magnetic field. Undoped CCTO is
well-known for its colossal dielectric constant in a broad frequency and
temperature range. With the present extended characterization of doped as well
as undoped CCTO, we want to address the question why doping with only 1% Mn or
0.5% Fe decreases the room-temperature dielectric constant of CCTO by a factor
of ~100 with a concomitant reduction of the conductivity, whereas 0.5% Ni
doping changes the dielectric properties only slightly. In addition,
diffraction experiments and magnetic investigations were undertaken to check
for possible correlations of the magnitude of the colossal dielectric constants
with structural details or with magnetic properties like the magnetic ordering,
the Curie-Weiss temperatures, or the paramagnetic moment. It is revealed, that
while the magnetic ordering temperature and the effective moment of all
investigated CCTO ceramics are rather similar, there is a dramatic influence of
doping and tempering time on the Curie-Weiss constant.
