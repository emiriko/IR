We consider a class of continuous-time stochastic growth models on
$d$-dimensional lattice with non-negative real numbers as possible values per
site. The class contains examples such as binary contact path process and
potlatch process. We show the equivalence between the slow population growth
and localization property that the time integral of the replica overlap
diverges. We also prove, under reasonable assumptions, a localization property
in a stronger form that the spatial distribution of the population does not
decay uniformly in space.
