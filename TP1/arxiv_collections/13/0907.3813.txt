We study the avoided crossings in the dynamics of quantum controlled
excitations for an interacting two-boson system in an optical lattice.
Specifically, we perform numerical simulations of quantum control in this
system where driving pulses connect the undriven stationary states in a manner
characteristic of Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP). We demonstrate
that the dynamics of such a transition is affected by chaos induced avoided
crossings, resulting in a loss in coherence of the final outcome in the
adiabatic limit.
