We present measurements of the anomalous WWgamma and WWZ trilinear gauge
couplings from a combination of four diboson production and decay channels
using data collected by the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider.
These results represent the first high statistics combination of limits across
different diboson production processes at the Tevatron and use data
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately 1 fb^-1. When
respecting SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y symmetry, we measure central values and 68% C.L.
allowed intervals of kappa_gamma=1.07^+0.16_-0.20, lambda =0.00^+0.05_-0.04 and
g_1^Z=1.05 +/- 0.06. We present the most stringent measurements to date for the
W boson magnetic dipole and electromagnetic quadrupole moments of
mu_W=2.02^+0.08_-0.09 (e/2M_W) and q_W=-1.00 +/- 0.09 (e/M^2_W), respectively.
