Direct photons associated with jets provide a direct measurement of the
effects of energy loss on the fragmentation of the parton as it propagates
through the medium. Perturbative QCD calculations describe the direct photon
cross section well at next-to-leading order, predicting a significant
contribution from photons produced through parton fragmentation.
Non-perturbative quantities such as the photon fragmentation function, which is
poorly constrained, lead to large theoretical uncertainties. The measurement of
photons correlated with jets in p+p collisions serves as an important test of
these calculations and is an essential baseline measurement for comparison to
A+A collisions. A natural way of selecting such photons is to study
hadron-photon correlations. Results for the production of photons associated
with high pT hadron triggers are presented for PHENIX p+p data at 200 GeV
center-of-mass energy.
