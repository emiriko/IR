One of the few p nuclei with an odd number of protons is 113In. Reaction
cross sections of 113In(alpha,gamma)117Sb and 113In(alpha,n)116Sb have been
measured with the activation method at center-of-mass energies between 8.66 and
13.64 MeV, close to the astrophysically relevant energy range. The experiments
were carried out at the cyclotron accelerator of ATOMKI. The activities were
determined by off-line detection of the decay gamma rays with a HPGe detector.
Measured cross sections and astrophysical S factor results are presented and
compared with statistical model calculations using three different
alpha+nucleus potentials. The comparison indicates that the standard rates used
in the majority of network calculations for these reactions were too fast due
to the energy dependence of the optical alpha potential at low energy.
