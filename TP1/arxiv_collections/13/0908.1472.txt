The family of semiabelian p-groups is the minimal family that contains {1}
and is closed under quotients and semidirect products with finite abelian
p-groups. Kisilevsky and Sonn have solved the minimal ramification problem for
a certain subfamily G_p of the family of semiabelian p-groups. We show that G_p
is in fact the entire family of semiabelian p-groups and by this complete their
solution to all semiabelian p-groups.
