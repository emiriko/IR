We use the linear sigma model with two flavors of quarks to study the phase
diagram at finite temperature and baryon chemical potential as a function of
the vacuum pion mass. Our calculations include thermal fluctuations of both the
bosonic and fermionic fields. An interesting phase structure occurs that
results in two, one, or no critical points depending on the value of the pion
mass.
