In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with three generations of
fermions, there is a stringent upper bound on the mass of the lightest neutral
Higgs h, and the mass of the charged Higgs H^+, must be close (within tens of
GeV) to the heavier neutral Higgs, H, and the pseudoscalar Higgs A. In this
Brief Report, we show that in the four generation MSSM, the upper bound on the
h mass is much higher, as high as 400 GeV, and H^+ is generally much heavier
than the A, allowing the H^+ -> A W^+ decay, potentially changing search
strategies for both the charged Higgs and the pseudoscalar. The H mass, on the
other hand, remains within tens of GeV of the charged Higgs mass.
