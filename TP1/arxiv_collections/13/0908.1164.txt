It is well known that the category of real Lie supergroups is equivalent to
the category of the so-called (real) Harish-Chandra pairs. That means that a
Lie supergroup depends only on the underlying Lie group and its Lie
superalgebra with certain compatibility conditions. More precisely, the
structure sheaf of a Lie supergroup and the supergroup morphisms can be
explicitly described in terms of the corresponding Lie superalgebra. In this
paper, we give a proof of this result in the complex-analytic case.
Furthermore, if $(G,\mathcal{O}_G)$ is a complex Lie supergroup and $H\subset
G$ is a closed Lie subgroup, i.e. it is a Lie subsupergroup of
$(G,\mathcal{O}_G)$ and its odd dimension is zero, we show that the
corresponding homogeneous supermanifold $(G/H,\mathcal{O}_{G/H})$ is split. In
particular, any complex Lie supergroup is a split supermanifold.
  It is well known that a complex homogeneous supermanifold may be non-split.
We find here necessary and sufficient conditions for a complex homogeneous
supermanifold to be split.
