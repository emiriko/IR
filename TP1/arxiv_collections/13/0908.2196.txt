Santer et al (2008) (S08) compared climate models and observations in the
tropical troposphere and reported that "there is no longer a serious
discrepancy between modeled and observed trends in tropical lapse rates." They
found no statistically significant differences between modeled (ensemble mean)
trends and observed trends at the T2LT and T2 layers, and they found no
significant difference between observed and modeled surface-minus-troposphere
lapse rates. However they only used data over the 1979-1999 period. Using the
S08 methodology on up-to-date data, we find a statistically significant
discrepancy between observations and models with respect to trends in the UAH
data, as well as lapse rate trends comparing either RSS or UAH to the HADCRUT3v
land-ocean surface trend.
