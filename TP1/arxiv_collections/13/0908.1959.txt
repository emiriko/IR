The nonlinear dielectric effect for dipolar fluids is studied within the
framework of the mean spherical approximation (MSA) of hard core dipolar Yukawa
fluids. Based on earlier results for the electric field dependence of the
polarization our analytical results show so-called normal saturation effects
which are in good agreement with corresponding NVT ensemble Monte Carlo
simulation data. The linear and the nonlinear dielectric permittivities
obtained from MC simulations are determined from the fluctuations of the total
dipole moment of the system in the absence of an applied electric field. We
compare the MSA based theoretical results with the corresponding Langevin and
Debye-Weiss behaviors.
