An in vacuo thermal desorption process has been accomplished to form
epitaxial graphene (EG) on 4H- and 6H-SiC substrates using a commercial
chemical vapor deposition reactor. Correlation of growth conditions and the
morphology and electrical properties of EG are described. Raman spectra of EG
on Si-face samples were dominated by monolayer thickness. This approach was
used to grow EG on 50 mm SiC wafers that were subsequently fabricated into
field effect transistors with fmax of 14 GHz.
