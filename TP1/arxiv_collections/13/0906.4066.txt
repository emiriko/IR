In this paper we report on the optical properties of site controlled InGaAs
dots with GaAs barriers grown in pyramidal recesses by metalorganic vapour
phase epitaxy. The inhomogeneous broadening of excitonic emission from an
ensemble of quantum dots is found to be unusually narrow, with a standard
deviation of 1.19 meV, and spectral purity of emission lines from individual
dots is found to be very high (18-30 ueV), in contrast with other
site-controlled systems.
