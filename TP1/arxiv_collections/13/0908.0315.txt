This brief review deals with recent interest in the prospects of observing a
Massive Metastable Charged Particle (MMCP) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC),
and measuring its properties there. We discuss the motivation for scenarios
with MMCPs in a phenomenological context, focusing on supersymmetric models
that allow us to explore the expected experimental signatures of MMCPs at the
LHC. We review current bounds and give estimates of the LHC reach in terms of
MMCP masses.
