The second MAGIC telescope, a clone of the first 17 m diameter MAGIC
telescope, has entered the final commissioning phase and will soon start to
take data, preferentially in the so-called stereo-mode. The control system for
both telescopes is assigned to a number of autonomous functional units called
subsystems. The control hardware and software components of the second
telescope subsystems have been modified with respect to their counterparts of
the first telescope. A new Central Control (CC) program has been developed to
communicate with all the subsystems of both telescopes and to coordinate their
functionality thus easing the stereo data taking procedure. We describe the
whole control system in detail: all the subsystems and their communication with
the Central Control, the CC graphic user interface that grants operators the
full control over the two telescopes, and the automatic checking procedures,
which guarantee the safety and 'health' of the apparatus.
