Applications of nanoparticles in biology require that the nanoparticles
remain stable in solutions containing high concentrations of proteins and
salts, as well as in cell culture media. In this work, we developed simple
protocols for the coating of sub-10 nm nanoparticles and evaluated the
colloidal stability of dispersions in various environments. Ligands (citric
acid), oligomers (phosphonate-terminated poly(ethylene oxide)) and polymers
(poly(acrylic acid)) were used as nanometer-thick adlayers for cerium (CeO2)
and iron (gamma-Fe2O3) oxide nanoparticles. The organic functionalities were
adsorbed on the particle surfaces via physical (electrostatic) forces.
Stability assays at high ionic strength and in cell culture media were
performed by static and dynamic light scattering. Among the three coating
examined, we found that only poly(acrylic acid) fully preserved the dispersion
stability on the long term (> weeks). The improved stability was explained by
the multi-point attachments of the chains onto the particle surface, and by the
adlayer-mediated electrosteric interactions. These results suggest that
anionically charged polymers represent an effective alternative to conventional
coating agents.
