The evolution model with parallel mutation-selection scheme is solved for the
case when selection is accompanied by base substitutions, insertions, and
deletions. The fitness is assumed to be either a single-peak function (i.e.,
having one finite discontinuity) or a smooth function of the Hamming distance
from the reference sequence.
  The mean fitness is exactly calculated in large-genome limit. In the case of
insertions and deletions the evolution characteristics depend on the choice of
reference sequence.
