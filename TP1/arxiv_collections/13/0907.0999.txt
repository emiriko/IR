Observations of interstellar scintillations at radio wavelengths reveal a
Kolmogorov-like scaling of the electron density spectrum with a spectral slope
of -5/3 over six decades in wavenumber space. A similar turbulent density
spectrum in the solar wind plasma has been reported. The energy transfer
process in the magnetized solar wind plasma over such extended length-scales
remains an unresolved paradox of modern turbulence theories raising the
especially intriguing question of how a compressible magnetized solar wind
exhibits a turbulent spectrum that is a characteristic of an incompressible
hydrodynamic fluid. To address these questions, we have undertaken
three-dimensional time dependent numerical simulations of a compressible
magnetohydrodynamic fluid describing super-Alfv\'enic, supersonic and strongly
magnetized plasma. It is shown that the observed Kolmogorov-like (-5/3)
spectrum can develop in the solar wind plasma by supersonic plasma motions that
dissipate into highly subsonic motion that passively convect density
fluctuations.
