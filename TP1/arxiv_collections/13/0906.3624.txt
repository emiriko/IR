We discuss the static and dynamic multicritical behavior of three-dimensional
systems of $O(n_\|)\oplus O(n_\perp)$ symmetry as it is explained by the field
theoretical renormalization group method. Whereas the static renormalization
group functions are currently know within high order expansions, we show that
an account of two loop contributions refined by an appropriate resummation
technique gives an accurate quantitative description of the multicritical
behavior. One of the essential features of the static multicritical behavior
obtained already in two loop order for the interesting case of an
antiferromagnet in a magnetic field ($n_\|=1$, $n_\perp=2$) are the stability
of the biconical fixed point and the neighborhood of the stability border lines
to the other fixed points leading to very small transient exponents. We further
pursue an analysis of dynamical multicritical behavior choosing different forms
of critical dynamics and calculating asymptotic and effective dynamical
exponents within the minimal subtraction scheme.
