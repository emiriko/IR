Ultra low frequency, kHz and MHz electromagnetic anomalies were recorded
prior to the L'Aquila catastrophic earthquake that occurred on April 6, 2009.
The main aims of this contribution are: (i) To suggest a procedure for the
designation of detected EM anomalies as seismogenic ones. We do not expect to
be possible to provide a succinct and solid definition of a pre-seismic EM
emission. Instead, we attempt, through a multidisciplinary analysis, to provide
elements of a definition. (ii) To link the detected MHz and kHz EM anomalies
with equivalent last stages of the L'Aquila earthquake preparation process.
(iii) To put forward physically meaningful arguments to support a way of
quantifying the time to global failure and the identification of distinguishing
features beyond which the evolution towards global failure becomes
irreversible. The whole effort is unfolded in two consecutive parts. We clarify
we try to specify not only whether or not a single EM anomaly is pre-seismic in
itself, but mainly whether a combination of kHz, MHz, and ULF EM anomalies can
be characterized as pre-seismic one.
