Heusler alloy Co2FeAl was employed as ferromagnetic layers in
Co2FeAl/Ru/Co2FeAl synthetic antiferromagnet structures. The experimental
results show that the structure with a Ru thickness of 0.45 nm takes on
strongly antiferromagnetic coupling, which maintains up to 150 oC annealing for
1 hour. The structure has a very low saturation magnetization Ms of 425 emu/cc,
a low switching field Hsw of 4.3 Oe and a high saturation field Hs of 5257 Oe
at room temperature, which are favorable for application in ultrahigh density
magnetic read heads or other magnetic memory devices. XRD study testifies that
the as-deposited Co2FeAl film is in B2 phase. Therefore Heusler alloys can be
used to fabricate SyAF and it is possible to make "all-Heusler" spin-valves or
magnetic tunneling junctions with better magnetic switching properties and high
magnetoresistance.
