Motivated by recent interest in low dimensional arrays of atoms, we
experimentally investigated the way cold collisional processes are affected by
the geometry of the considered atomic sample. More specifically, we studied the
case of photoassociative ionization (PAI) both in a storage ring where
collision is more unidirectional in character and in a trap with clear
undefinition of collision axis. First, creating a ring shaped trap (atomotron)
we investigated two-color PAI dependence with intensity and polarization of a
probing laser. The intensity dependence of the PAI rate was also measured in a
magneto-optical trap presenting equivalent temperature and density conditions.
Indeed, the results show that in the ring trap, the value of the PAI rate
constant is much lower and does not show evidences of saturation, unlike in the
case of the 3D-MOT. Cold atomic collisions in storage ring may represent new
possibilities for study.
