We have used Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis and Monte Carlo significance
tests to detect periodicities above the 3-sigma level in the Beta Cephei stars
V400 Car, V401 Car, V403 Car and V405 Car. These methods produce six previously
unreported periodicities in the expected frequency range of excited pulsations:
one in V400 Car, three in V401 Car, one in V403 Car and one in V405 Car. One of
these six frequencies is significant above the 4-sigma level. We provide
statistical significances for all of the periodicities found in these four
stars.
