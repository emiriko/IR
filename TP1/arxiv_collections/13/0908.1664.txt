This review is concerned with the gravitational self-force acting on a mass
particle in orbit around a large black hole. Renewed interest in this old
problem is driven by the prospects of detecting gravitational waves from
strongly gravitating binaries with extreme mass ratios. We begin here with a
summary of recent advances in the theory of gravitational self-interaction in
curved spacetime, and proceed to survey some of the ideas and computational
strategies devised for implementing this theory in the case of a particle
orbiting a Kerr black hole. We review in detail two of these methods: (i) the
standard mode-sum method, in which the metric perturbation is regularized
mode-by-mode in a multipole decomposition, and (ii) $m$-mode regularization,
whereby individual azimuthal modes of the metric perturbation are regularized
in 2+1 dimensions. We discuss several practical issues that arise, including
the choice of gauge, the numerical representation of the particle singularity,
and how high-frequency contributions near the particle are dealt with in
frequency-domain calculations. As an example of a full end-to-end
implementation of the mode-sum method, we discuss the computation of the
gravitational self-force for eccentric geodesic orbits in Schwarzschild, using
a direct integration of the Lorenz-gauge perturbation equations in the time
domain. With the computational framework now in place, researchers have
recently turned to explore the physical consequences of the gravitational self
force; we will describe some preliminary results in this area. An appendix to
this review presents, for the first time, a detailed derivation of the
regularization parameters necessary for implementing the mode-sum method in
Kerr spacetime.
