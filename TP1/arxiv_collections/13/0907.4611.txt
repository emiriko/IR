Kaon properties are studied within the framework of a fully covariant
transport approach. The kaon-nucleon potential is evaluated in two schemes, a
chiral perturbative approach and an effective One-Boson-Exchange model. Isospin
effects are explicitly accounted for in both models. The transport calculations
indicate a significant sensitivity of momentum distributions and total yields
of $K^{0,+}$ isospin states on the choice of the kaon-nucleon interaction.
Furthermore, isospin effects are rather moderate on absolute kaon yields, but
appear on strangeness ratios. This is an important issue in determining the
high density symmetry energy from studies of strangeness production in
heavy-ion collisions.
