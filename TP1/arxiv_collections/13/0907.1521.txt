We start with a new version of Newtonian cosmology by incorporating the fact
that the galaxies are losing mass due to emission of radiation. This yields
accelerated recession for the galaxies. We point out that in the presence of
accelerated expansion, the universe can be infinitely old and suggest that the
observable universe is only a speckle of the true universe. We argue that the
mean density of the universe must be zero and the cosmic fluid comprises
infinite number of such speckles separated by infinite distances. The Microwave
Background radiation is shown to be just the sum of redshifted thermal
radiation of Eternally Collapsing Objects (ECO), the so-called Black Hole
Candidates.The hot photosphere of the ECOs cooks light elements the same way
they are supposed to be produced in hot early universe. This universe with
nested infinities has zero baryon number as it contains equal number of matter
and antimatter atoms. The predicted microwave luminosity of the galactic centre
ECO (Sgr A) nicely matches with the corresponding WMAP estimate (abridged).
