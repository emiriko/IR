We present both analytically and numerically the consistent analysis from the
Affleck-Dine (AD) dynamics to the subsequent semiclassical evolution in both
gravity-mediated and gauge-mediated models. We obtain analytically the elliptic
motions in the AD dynamics as the analogy of the well-known Kepler-problem, and
by solving the equations of motion in a lattice, we find that the semiclassical
evolution goes through three distinct stages as a nonequilibrium process of
reheating the Universe: pre-thermalisation, bubble collisions and
thermalisation. We report that the second stage of our case lasts rather long
compared to the second stage of the reheating case, and the thermalisation
process is unique due to the presence of ``thermal Q-balls''.
