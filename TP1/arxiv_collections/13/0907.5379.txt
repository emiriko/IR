We present a comprehensive angle-resolved photoemission study of the
three-dimensional electronic structure of Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2. The wide range of
dopings covered by this study, x=0 to x=0.3, allows to extract systematic
features of the electronic structure. We show that there are three different
hole pockets around the G point, the two inner ones being nearly degenerate and
rather two dimensional, the outer one presenting a strong three dimensional
character. The structure of the electron pockets is clarified by studying high
doping contents, where they are enlarged. They are found to be essentially
circular and two dimensional. From the size of the pockets, we deduce the
number of holes and electrons present at the various dopings. We find that the
net number of carriers is in good agreement with the bulk stoichiometry, but
that the number of each species (holes and electrons) is smaller than predicted
by theory. Finally, we discuss the quality of nesting in the different regions
of the phase diagram. The presence of the third hole pocket significantly
weakens the nesting at x=0, so that it may not be a crucial ingredient in the
formation of the Spin Density Wave. On the other hand, superconductivity seems
to be favored by the coexistence of two-dimensional hole and electron pockets
of similar sizes.
