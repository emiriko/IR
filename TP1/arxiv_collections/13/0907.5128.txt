Cellular automata are one-dimensional arrays of interconnected interacting
finite automata. We investigate one of the weakest classes, the real-time
one-way cellular automata, and impose an additional restriction on their
inter-cell communication by bounding the number of allowed uses of the links
between cells. Moreover, we consider the devices as acceptors for bounded
languages in order to explore the borderline at which non-trivial decidability
problems of cellular automata classes become decidable. It is shown that even
devices with drastically reduced communication, that is, each two neighboring
cells may communicate only constantly often, accept bounded languages that are
not semilinear. If the number of communications is at least logarithmic in the
length of the input, several problems are undecidable. The same result is
obtained for classes where the total number of communications during a
computation is linearly bounded.
