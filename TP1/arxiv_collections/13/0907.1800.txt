We show that the pairing resonance in the Pauli-limited normal state of
ultra-thin superconducting Al films provides a spin-resolved probe of
conduction electron polarization in thin magnetic films. A
superconductor-insulator-ferromagnet tunneling junction is used to measure the
density of states in supercritical parallel magnetic fields that are well
beyond the Clogston-Chandresekhar limit, thus greatly extending the field range
of the tunneling density of states technique. The applicability and limitations
of using the pairing resonance as a spin probe are discussed.
