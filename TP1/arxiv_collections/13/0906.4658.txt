We consider finite frequency noise in a mesoscopic system with arbitrary
interactions, connected to many terminals kept at finite electrochemical
potentials. We show that the excess noise, obtained by subtracting the noise at
zero voltage from that at finite voltage, can be asymmetric with respect to
positive/negative frequencies if the system is non-linear. This explains a
recent experimental observation in Josephson junctions as well as strong
asymmetry obtained in typical non-linear and strongly correlated systems
described by the Luttinger liquid (LL): edge states in the fractional quantum
Hall effect, quantum wires and carbon nanotubes. Another important problem
where the LL model applies is that of a coherent conductor embedded in an ohmic
environment.
