Blazars, a class of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) characterized by a close
orientation of their relativistic outflows (jets) towards the line of sight,
are a well established extragalactic TeV $\gamma$-ray emitters. Since 2006,
three nearby and TeV bright blazars, Markarian (Mrk) 421, Mrk 501 and 1ES
1959+650, are regularly observed by the MAGIC telescope with single exposures
of 30 to 60 minutes. The sensitivity of MAGIC allows to establish a flux level
of 30% of the Crab flux for each such observation. In a case of Mrk 421 strong
flux variability in different time scales and a high correlation between
X-ray/TeV emissions have been observed. In addition, preliminary results on
measured light curves from Mrk 501 and 1ES1959+650 in 2007/8 are shown.
