We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the fully-frustrated XY model. At
equilibrium, this model undergoes two phase transitions at two very close
temperatures: a Kosterlitz-Thouless topological transition and a second-order
phase transition between a paramagnetic phase and a low-temperature phase where
the chiralities of the lattice plaquettes are anti-ferromagnetically ordered.
We compute by Monte Carlo simulations two-time spin-spin and
chirality-chirality autocorrelation and response functions. From the dynamics
of the spin waves in the low temperature phase, we extract the
temperature-dependent exponent $\eta$. We provide evidences for logarithmic
corrections above the Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature and interpret them as a
manifestation of free topological defects. Our estimates of the autocorrelation
exponent and the fluctuation-dissipation ratio differ from the XY values, while
$\eta(T_{\rm KT})$ lies at the boundary of the error bar. Indications for
logarithmic corrections at the second-order critical temperature are presented.
However, the coupling between angles and chiralities is still strong and
explains why autocorrelation exponent and fluctuation-dissipation ratio are far
from the Ising values and seems stable.
