A single confined spin interacting with a solid-state environment has emerged
as one of the fundamental paradigms of mesoscopic physics. In contrast to
standard quantum optical systems, decoherence that stems from these
interactions can in general not be treated using the Born-Markov approximation
at low temperatures. Here we study the non-equilibrium dynamics of a
single-spin in a semiconductor quantum dot adjacent to a fermionic reservoir
and show how the dynamics can be revealed in detail in an optical absorption
experiment. We show that the highly asymmetrical optical absorption lineshape
of the resulting Kondo exciton consists of three distinct frequency domains,
corresponding to short, intermediate and long times after the initial
excitation, which are in turn described by the three fixed points of the
single-impurity Anderson Hamiltonian. The zero-temperature power-law
singularity dominating the lineshape is linked to dynamically generated Kondo
correlations in the photo-excited state. We show that this power-law
singularity is tunable with gate voltage and magnetic field, and universal.
