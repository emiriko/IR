Using Chandra data taken on 2008 June, we detected pulsations at 2.59439(4) s
in the soft gamma-ray repeater SGR 1627-41. This is the second measurement of
the source spin period and allows us to derive for the first time a long-term
spin-down rate of (1.9 +/- 0.4)E-11 s/s. From this value we infer for SGR
1627-41 a characteristic age of 2.2 kyr, a spin-down luminosity of 4E+34 erg/s
(one of the highest among sources of the same class), and a surface dipole
magnetic field strength of 2E+14 G. These properties confirm the magnetar
nature of SGR 1627-41; however, they should be considered with caution since
they were derived on the basis of a period derivative measurement made using
two epochs only and magnetar spin-down rates are generally highly variable. The
pulse profile, double-peaked and with a pulsed fraction of (13 +/- 2)% in the
2-10 keV range, closely resembles that observed by XMM-Newton in 2008
September. Having for the first time a timing model for this SGR, we also
searched for a pulsed signal in archival radio data collected with the Parkes
radio telescope nine months after the previous X-ray outburst. No evidence for
radio pulsations was found, down to a luminosity level 10-20 times fainter (for
a 10% duty cycle and a distance of 11 kpc) than the peak luminosity shown by
the known radio magnetars.
