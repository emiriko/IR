The problem of three-dimensional combined magnetic and velocity shear driven
instabilities of a compressible magnetized jet modeled with a plane
neutral/current double vortex sheet in the framework of the resistive
magnetohydrodynamics is addressed. The resulting dynamics given by the
stream+current sheet interaction is analyzed and the effects of a variable
geometry of the basic fields are considered. Depending on the basic asymptotic
magnetic field configuration, a selection rule of the linear instability modes
can be obtained. Hence, the system follows a two-stage path developing either
through a fully three-dimensional dynamics with a rapid evolution of kink modes
leading to a final turbulent state, or rather through a driving two-dimensional
instability pattern that develops on parallel planes on which a
reconnection+coalescence process takes place.
