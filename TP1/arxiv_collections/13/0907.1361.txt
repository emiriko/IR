The electric-field dependence of the magnetic structure of multiferroic MnWO4
has been investigated using spherical neutron polarimetry as a function of
temperature. The application of an electric field drives the magnetic structure
to a single chiral domain. The magnitude of the field required to do this is
shown to increase with temperature. The link between the magnetic order and
electric polarization is further demonstrated.
