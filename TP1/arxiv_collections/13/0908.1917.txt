I review recent progress in finite temperature lattice calculations,
including calculations of Equation of State, fluctuations of conserved charges
and spatial correlation functions. I compare lattice results with the
predictions of hadron resonance gas model, resummed perturbation theory and
3-dimensional effective field theory. Comparison of the lattice results for
certain ratios with the prediction of AdS/CFT correspondence is also discussed.
