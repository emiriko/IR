The efficiency and the performance of anagement systems is becoming a hot
research topic within the networks and services management community. This
concern is due to the new challenges of large scale managed systems, where the
management plane is integrated within the functional plane and where management
activities have to carry accurate and up-to-date information. We defined a set
of primary and secondary metrics to measure the performance of a management
approach. Secondary metrics are derived from the primary ones and quantifies
mainly the efficiency, the scalability and the impact of management activities.
To validate our proposals, we have designed and developed a benchmarking
platform dedicated to the measurement of the performance of a JMX manager-agent
based management system. The second part of our work deals with the collection
of measurement data sets from our JMX benchmarking platform. We mainly studied
the effect of both load and the number of agents on the scalability, the impact
of management activities on the user perceived performance of a managed server
and the delays of JMX operations when carrying variables values. Our findings
show that most of these delays follow a Weibull statistical distribution. We
used this statistical model to study the behavior of a monitoring algorithm
proposed in the literature, under heavy tail delays distribution. In this case,
the view of the managed system on the manager side becomes noisy and out of
date.
