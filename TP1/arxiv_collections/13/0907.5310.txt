We study universality in the electroproduction of vector mesons using a
unified nonperturbative approach which has already proved to reproduce
extremely well the available experimental data. In this framework, after the
extraction of factors that are specific of each vector meson, we arrive at a
reduced integrated elastic cross section which is universal. Our calculations
suggest a finite infrared behavior for the strong coupling constant.
