We study the emergence of a yield stress in dense suspensions of non-Brownian
particles, by combining local velocity and concentration measurements using
Magnetic Resonance Imaging with macroscopic rheometric experiments. We show
that the competition between gravity and viscous stresses is at the origin of
the development of a yield stress in these systems at relatively low volume
fractions. Moreover, it is accompanied by a shear banding phenomenon that is
the signature of this competition. However, if the system is carefully density
matched, no yield stress is encountered until a volume fraction of 62.7 0.3%.
