Threshold effects related to fermion masses are considered for an all-order
beta-function based on a background field momentum subtraction scheme. Far away
from all thresholds, the suggested beta-function reduces to the conjectured
all-order form inspired by the Novikov-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov
beta-function of N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories with a fixed integer number
of fermion flavours. At (formally) infinite masses the corresponding pure
Yang--Mills beta-function is recovered. We discuss applications to the phase
diagram of non-Abelian field theories.
