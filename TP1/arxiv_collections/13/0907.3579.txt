Magnetic tunnel junctions for spin-transfer torque switching were prepared to
investigate the dielectric breakdown. The breakdown occurs typically at
voltages not much higher than the switching voltages, a bottleneck for the
implementation of spin-transfer torque Magnetic Random Access Memory. Intact
and broken tunnel junctions are characterized by transport measurements and
then prepared for transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray
spectrometry by focussed ion beam. The comparison to our previous model of the
electric breakdown for thicker MgO tunnel barriers reveals significant
differences arising from the high current densities.
