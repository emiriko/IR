Scalar-field dark energy models like tachyon are often regarded as an
effective description of an underlying theory of dark energy. In this Letter,
we implement the interacting agegraphic dark energy models with tachyon field.
We demonstrate that the interacting agegraphic evolution of the universe can be
described completely by a single tachyon scalar field. We thus reconstruct the
potential as well as the dynamics of the tachyon field according to the
evolutionary behavior of interacting agegraphic dark energy.
