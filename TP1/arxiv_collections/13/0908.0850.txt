A plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum is a very large cell visible by unaided
eye. The plasmodium is capable for distributed sensing, parallel information
processing, and decentralized optimization. It is an ideal substrate for future
and emerging bio-computing devices. We study space-time dynamics of plasmodium
reactiom to localised illumination, and provide analogies between propagating
plasmodium and travelling wave-fragments in excitable media. We show how
plasmodium-based computing devices can be precisely controlled and shaped by
planar domains of illumination.
