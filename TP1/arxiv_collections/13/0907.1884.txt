We compare several instances of pure-state Belavkin weighted square-root
measurements from the standpoint of minimum-error discrimination of quantum
states. The quadratically weighted measurement is proven superior to the
so-called "pretty good measurement" (PGM) in a number of respects: (1) Holevo's
quadratic weighting unconditionally outperforms the PGM in the case of
two-state ensembles, with equality only in trivial cases. (2) A converse of a
theorem of Holevo is proven, showing that a weighted measurement is
asymptotically optimal only if it is quadratically weighted. Counterexamples
for three states are constructed. The cube-weighted measurement of Ballester,
Wehner, and Winter is also considered. Sufficient optimality conditions for
various weights are compared.
