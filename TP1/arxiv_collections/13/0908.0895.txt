We present an in-depth analysis of the electronic and vibrational band
structure of uniaxially strained graphene by ab-initio calculations. Depending
on the direction and amount of strain, the Fermi crossing moves away from the
$K$-point. However, graphene remains semimetallic under small strains. The
deformation of the Dirac cone near the $K$-point gives rise to a broadening of
the 2D Raman mode. In spite of specific changes in the electronic and
vibrational band structure the strain-induced frequency shifts of the Raman
active E2g and 2D modes are independent of the direction of strain. Thus, the
amount of strain can be directly determined from a single Raman measurement.
