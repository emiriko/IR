In this work, we exploit the findings of the screening theory of the integer
quantized Hall effect (QHE) based on the formation of the incompressible strips
and its essential influence on the global resistances and propose certain
experimental conditions to observe the bulk to edge transition of the QHE in a
phenomenological model. We propose a Hall bar design on a cleaved edge
overgrown wafer, which allows us to manipulate the edge potential profile from
smooth to extremely sharp. For a particular sample design and by the help of a
side gate perpendicular to the two dimensional electron system (2DES), it is
shown that the plateau widths can be changed and even made to vanish when
changing the edge potential profile. Such a control of the edge potential
implies peculiar transport results when considering the screening theory, which
includes direct Coulomb interaction explicitly. We think that, these
experiments will shed new light on the understanding of the QHE.
