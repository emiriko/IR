The hadronization of $K^0$ particles was measured in semi-inclusive deep
inelastic scattering (SIDIS) kinematics for several nuclear targets using the
CLAS detector. Multiplicity ratios and $\Delta p_T^2$ values were extracted
from the data. These results may be compared with similar values for $\pi^+$
hadronization from CLAS (at the same kinematics) and $K^+$ hadronization from
HERMES (at higher energy transfer). The physics goal of these measurements is
to understand the space-time evolution as the struck quark becomes a full-blown
hadron as it propagates through nuclear matter.
