The Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino Experiment (KATRIN) aims to determine the
absolute mass of the electron antineutrino from a precise measurement of the
tritium beta-spectrum near its endpoint at 18.6 keV with a sensitivity of 0.2
eV. KATRIN uses an electrostatic retardation spectrometer of MAC-E filter type
for which it is crucial to monitor high voltages of up to 35 kV with a
precision and long-term stability at the ppm level. Since devices capable of
this precision are not commercially available, a new high voltage divider for
direct voltages of up to 35 kV has been designed, following the new concept of
the standard divider for direct voltages of up to 100 kV developed at the
Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB). The electrical and mechanical
design of the divider, the screening procedure for the selection of the
precision resistors, and the results of the investigation and calibration at
PTB are reported here. During the latter, uncertainties at the low ppm level
have been deduced for the new divider, thus qualifying it for the precision
measurements of the KATRIN experiment.
