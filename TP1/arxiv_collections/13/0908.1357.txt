We present the catalog of galaxy groups in the Local Supercluster. Our
algorithm bases on assumption that a total energy of physical pair of galaxies
must be negative. About 54% of the galaxies in our sample have been gathered in
1082 groups. The groups are characterized by velocity dispersion 74 km/s and
harmonic radius 204 kpc. These values are typical for small groups like Local
Group or M81.
