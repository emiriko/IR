We investigate the dynamics of a rotating Morse wave packet, appropriate for
a ro-vibrating diatomic molecule. The coupling between vibrational and
rotational degrees of freedom is explicated in real position space as well as
in phase space Wigner distribution of a SU(2) coherent state at various
dynamically evolved times. We choose the well studied $I_{2}$ molecule with the
parameter values in good agrement with experiments. A quantitative measure of
the angles of rotations for different angular momenta is also given.
