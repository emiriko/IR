We present the results of one and three-dimensional radiative transfer
calculations of polarized spectra emerging from snapshots of radiation
magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the local vertical structure of black hole
accretion disks. The simulations cover a wide range of physical regimes
relevant for the high/soft state of black hole X-ray binaries. We constrain the
uncertainties in theoretical spectral color correction factors due to the
presence of magnetic support of the disk surface layers and strong density
inhomogeneities. For the radiation dominated simulation, magnetic support
increases the color correction factor by about ten percent, but this is largely
compensated by a ten percent softening due to inhomogeneities. We also compute
the effects of inhomogeneities and Faraday rotation on the resulting
polarization. Magnetic fields in the simulations are just strong enough to
produce significant Faraday depolarization near the spectral peak of the
radiation field. X-ray polarimetry may therefore be a valuable diagnostic of
accretion disk magnetic fields, being able to directly test simulations of
magnetorotational turbulence.
