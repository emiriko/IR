The paper describes a unique phenomenon -- the possibility of establishing,
in certain space regions, the one-to-one correspondence between equations
related to absolutely different physical phenomena: (1) phenomena associated
with the Weyl degrees of freedom in plane space; (2) phenomena, which can be
described in terms of half-integer spin particles and observed quantities
corresponding to a full set of bispinors.
  The phenomenon established opens wide prospects for resolving in future the
``old'' disputable issue concerning the physical meaning of the Weyl vector.
The paper discusses, in particular, the possibility of identifying the Weyl
vector with the current density vector of bispinors constituting a bispinor
matrix included in the Dirac equation. Some other issues are also discussed.
