The 1/N_c expansion of QCD with N_c=3 has been successful in explaining a
wide variety of QCD phenomenology. Here I focus on the contracted spin-flavor
symmetry of baryons in the large-N_c limit and deviations from spin-flavor
symmetry due to corrections suppressed by powers of 1/N_c. Baryon masses
provide an important example of the 1/N_c expansion, and successful predictions
of masses of heavy-quark baryons continue to be tested by experiment. The
ground state charmed baryon masses have all been measured, and five of the
eight ground state bottom baryon masses have been found. Results of the 1/N_c
expansion can aid in the discovery of the remaining bottom baryons. The brand
new measurement of the \Omega_b^- mass by the CDF collaboration conflicts with
the original D0 discovery value and is in excellent agreement with the
prediction of the 1/N_c expansion.
