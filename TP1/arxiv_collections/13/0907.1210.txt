We argue that certain assumptions about the process of the emission of the
quanta by their (oscillating) emitter provide for their changing (oscillatory)
flux at any location. This mechanism underlying (such) wave phenomena is not
based, both, on the newtonian notion of force and the field concept (of
Faraday, Maxwell, Lorentz and Einstein). When applied to the case of thermal
radiation, this emission origin for the wave of quanta is shown here to be
consistent with the laws of the black body radiation. We conclude therefore
also that a conceptual framework, which is not rooted in the notion of force
and in the field concept, may provide a deterministic basis underlying the
probabilistic methods of the quantum theory.
