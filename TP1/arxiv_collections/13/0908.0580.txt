A description of the short time behavior of solutions of the Allen-Cahn
equation with a smoothened additive noise is presented. The key result is that
in the sharp interface limit solutions move according to motion by mean
curvature with an additional stochastic forcing. This extends a similar result
of Funaki in spatial dimension $n=2$ to arbitrary dimensions.
