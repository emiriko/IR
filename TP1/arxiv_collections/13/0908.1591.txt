We report techniques for the fabrication of multi-zone linear RF Paul traps
that exploit the machinability and electrical conductivity of degenerate
silicon. The approach was tested by trapping and laser cooling 24Mg+ ions in
two trap geometries: a single-zone two-layer trap and a multi-zone
surface-electrode trap. From the measured ion motional heating rate we
determine an electric field spectral density at the ion's position of
approximately 1E-10 (V/m)^2/Hz at a frequency of 1.125 MHz when the ion lies 40
micron above the trap surface. One application of these devices is controlled
manipulation of atomic ion qubits, the basis of one form of quantum information
processing.
