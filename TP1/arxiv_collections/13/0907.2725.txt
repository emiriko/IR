This document reviews several recent measurements at the Fermilab Tevatron,
including the cross sections of inclusive jet, dijet production, the cross
sections of electroweak boson (W or Z) production in association with inclusive
or heavy-flavor (b or c) jets, and b-jet shapes. In addition, searches for new
physics using the dijet angular distributions are discussed. These analyses are
based on integrated luminosities of 0.3--2.5/fb of p-pbar collisions at
\sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV, collected with the CDF and D0 detectors. The results
directly test the leading order and next-to leading order calculations of
perturbative quantum chromodynamics and provide constraints on the parton
distribution functions, gluon-splitting contribution, and physics beyond the
standard model.
