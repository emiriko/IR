The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is considered a key process for
driving efficient angular momentum transport in astrophysical disks.
Understanding its non-linear saturation constitutes a fundamental problem in
modern accretion disk theory. The large dynamical range in physical conditions
in accretion disks makes it challenging to address this problem only with
numerical simulations. We analyze the concept that (secondary) parasitic
instabilities are responsible for the saturation of the MRI. Our approach
enables us to explore dissipative regimes that are relevant to astrophysical
and laboratory conditions that lie beyond the regime accessible to current
numerical simulations. We calculate the spectrum and physical structure of
parasitic modes that feed off the fastest, exact (primary) MRI mode when its
amplitude is such that the fastest parasitic mode grows as fast as the MRI. We
argue that this "saturation" amplitude provides an estimate of the magnetic
field that can be generated by the MRI before the secondary instabilities
suppress its growth significantly. Recent works suggest that the saturation
amplitude of the MRI depends mainly on the magnetic Prandtl number. Our results
suggest that, as long as viscous effects do not dominate the fluid dynamics,
the saturation level of the MRI depends only on the Elsasser number
$\Lambda_\eta$. We calculate the ratio between the stress and the magnetic
energy density, $\alpha_{\rm sat}\beta_{\rm sat}$, associated with the primary
MRI mode. We find that for $\Lambda_\eta >1$ Kelvin-Helmholtz modes are
responsible for saturation and $\alpha_{\rm sat}\beta_{\rm sat} = 0.4$, while
for $\Lambda_\eta < 1$ tearing modes prevail and $\alpha_{\rm sat}\beta_{\rm
sat} \simeq 0.5 \, \Lambda_\eta$. Several features of MRI simulations in
accretion disks surrounding young stars and compact objects can be interpreted
in terms of our findings.
