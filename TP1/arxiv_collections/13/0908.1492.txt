We propose an algorithmic procedure i) to study the ``distance'' between an
integrable PDE and any discretization of it, in the small lattice spacing
epsilon regime, and, at the same time, ii) to test the (asymptotic)
integrability properties of such discretization. This method should provide, in
particular, useful and concrete informations on how good is any numerical
scheme used to integrate a given integrable PDE. The procedure, illustrated on
a fairly general 10-parameter family of discretizations of the nonlinear
Schroedinger equation, consists of the following three steps: i) the
construction of the continuous multiscale expansion of a generic solution of
the discrete system at all orders in epsilon, following the Degasperis -
Manakov - Santini procedure; ii) the application, to such expansion, of the
Degasperis - Procesi (DP) integrability test, to test the asymptotic
integrability properties of the discrete system and its ``distance'' from its
continuous limit; iii) the use of the main output of the DP test to construct
infinitely many approximate symmetries and constants of motion of the discrete
system, through novel and simple formulas.
