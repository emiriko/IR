The influence of the spin-dependent phase shifts (SDPS) associated to the
electronic reflection and transmission amplitudes acquired by electrons upon
scattering on the potential barrier on the Andreev reflection probability of
electron and hole excitations for a ferromagnet/isolator/d-wave superconductor
(FIS) contact and the charge conductance of the FIS contact is studied. Various
superconductor orientations are considered. It is found that SDPS can suppress
the zero-potential peak and restore finite-potential peaks in the charge
conductance of the F/I/d-wave superconductor contact for the (110) orientation
of the d-wave superconductor and, on the contrary, can restore the
zero-potential peak and suppress finite-potential peaks for the $\{100\}$
orientation of the d-wave superconductor.
