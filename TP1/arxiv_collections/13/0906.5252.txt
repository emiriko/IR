In this paper we derive a recursion for the zeta function of each function
field in the second Garcia-Stichtenoth tower when $q=2$. We obtain our
recursion by applying a theorem of Kani and Rosen that gives information about
the decomposition of the Jacobians. This enables us to compute the zeta
functions explicitly of the first six function fields.
