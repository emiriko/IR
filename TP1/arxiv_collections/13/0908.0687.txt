All available theoretical estimates of neutrino-induced coherent pion
production rely on the 'local approximation' for the Delta propagator. The
validity of this approximation is scrutinized. It is found that the local
approximation overestimates the neutrino-induced coherent pion production on
nuclei significantly, by up to 100%.
