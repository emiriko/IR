We propose a microscopic model of critical current noise in
Josephson-junctions based on individual trapping-centers in the tunnel barrier
hybridized with electrons in the superconducting leads. We calculate the noise
exactly in the limit of no on-site Coulomb repulsion. Our result reveals a
noise spectrum that is dramatically different from the usual Lorentzian assumed
in simple models. We show that the noise is dominated by sharp subgap
resonances associated to the formation of pairs of Andreev bound states, thus
providing a possible explanation for the spurious two-level systems
(microresonators) observed in Josephson junction qubits [R.W. Simmonds et al.,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 077003 (2004)]. Another implication of our model is that
each trapping-center will contribute a sharp dielectric resonance only in the
superconducting phase, providing an effective way to validate our results
experimentally. We derive an effective Hamiltonian for a qubit interacting with
Andreev bound states, establishing a direct connection between phenomenological
models and the microscopic parameters of a Fermionic bath.
