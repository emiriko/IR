The hadronic form factors in semileptonic decays of the tau and low-energy e+
e- scattering into hadrons can be described accounting for the following
fundamental features: the right chiral structure at low energies, the large-N_C
limit of QCD and the known asymptotic behaviour of the theory. All these
characteristics are implemented within our approach to the accuracy and within
the limits discussed below. Our results -improved with respect to those shown
in the talk (they correspond to the ones presented in the V Working Group on
Generators for Low-Energy Physics held in Frascati the 6th and 7th of April,
2009) are compared to data for tau to 3pi nu_tau. Our setup in the vector
current has been checked (using CVC) with e+e- to KKpi data. We predict the
hadronic spectra in all tau to KKpi nu_tau charge modes. Our hadronic matrix
elements are being included in the TAUOLA library and may be useful for the
experimental collaborations that are analysing tau decays (BaBar and Belle) and
to those that will join this effort in the future (BES, super-B factories, LHC
and future colliders).
