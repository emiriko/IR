We show that gravitinos produced by decays of a supersymmetry breaking scalar
field (the pseudo-moduli field) can naturally explain the observed abundance of
dark matter in a certain class of the gauge mediation models. We study the
decay processes as well as cosmological constraints on this scenario in detail,
particularly focusing on different behavior of the real and imaginary
components of the pseudo-moduli field. Cosmologically viable scenario emerges
when the gravitino and the pseudo-moduli masses are O(10-100) MeV and O(100)
GeV, respectively.
