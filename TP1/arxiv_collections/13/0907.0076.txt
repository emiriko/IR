Chemical abundances of 26 metal-poor dwarfs and giants are determined from
high-resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio spectra obtained with
Subaru/HDS. The sample is selected so that most of the objects have outer-halo
kinematics. Self-consistent atmospheric parameters were determined by an
iterative procedure based on spectroscopic analysis. Abundances of 13 elements,
including $\alpha$-elements (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti), odd-Z light elements (Na, Sc),
iron-peak elements (Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Zn) and neutron-capture elements (Y, Ba),
are determined by two independent data reduction and LTE analysis procedures,
confirming the consistency of the stellar parameters and abundances results. We
find a decreasing trend of [$\alpha$/Fe] with increasing [Fe/H] for the range
of $-3.5 <$ [Fe/H]$ < -1$, as found by Stephens and Boesgaard (2002). [Zn/Fe]
values of most objects in our sample are slightly lower than the bulk of halo
stars previously studied. These results are discussed as possible chemical
properties of the outer halo in the Galaxy.
