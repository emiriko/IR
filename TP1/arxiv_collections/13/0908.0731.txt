We identify a variety of coannihilation scenarios in a supersymmetric SU(4)_c
x SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R model with discrete left-right symmetry. Non-universal
gaugino masses, compatible with the gauge symmetry, play an essential role in
realizing gluino and bino-wino coannihilation regions that are consistent with
the WMAP dark matter constraints. We also explore regions of the parameter
space in which the little hierarchy problem is partially resolved. We present
several phenomenologically interesting benchmark points and the associated
sparticle and Higgs mass spectra.
