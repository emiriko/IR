The structure and evolution of grain boundaries underlies the nature of
polycrystalline materials. Here we describe an experimental apparatus and light
reflection technique for measuring disorder at grain boundaries in optically
clear material, in thermodynamic equilibrium. The approach is demonstrated on
ice bicrystals. Crystallographic orientation is measured for each ice sample.
The type and concentration of impurity in the liquid can be controlled and the
temperature can be continuously recorded and controlled over a range near the
melting point. The general methodology is appropriate for a wide variety of
materials.
