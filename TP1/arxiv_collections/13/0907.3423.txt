The extraction of the nuclear incompressibility from the isoscalar giant
monopole resonance (GMR) measurements is analysed. Both pairing and mutually
enhanced magicity (MEM) effects play a role in the shift of the GMR energy
between the doubly closed shell $^{208}$Pb nucleus and other Pb isotopes.
Pairing effects are microscopically predicted whereas the MEM effect is
phenomenologically evaluated. Accurate measurements of the GMR in open-shell Pb
isotopes are called for.
