We have studied the magnetic excitations in impurity doped
La$_{1.85}$Sr$_{0.15}$Cu$_{1-y}$A$_{y}$O$_{4}$ (A=Ni or Zn) by neutron
scattering. The dispersion for Zn:$y=0.017$ is similar to that for the impurity
free sample: incommensurate peaks with the incommensurability
$\delta=0.12\pm0.01$ (rlu) do not change their positions up to 21 meV. On the
other hand, for Ni:$y=0.029$, two incommensurate peaks observed at low energies
suddenly change into a broad commensurate peak at $E_\mathrm{cross}=15$ meV.
Compared to the impurity free sample with a similar Sr-concentration $x=0.16$,
[B. Vignolle {\it et al.} Nature Physics {\bf 3} (2007) 163],
$E_\mathrm{cross}$ for Ni:$y=0.029$ is decreased by nearly the same factor for
the reduction in $T_{c}$. This is very similar to the shift of the resonance
energy ($E_\mathrm{res}$) in Ni-doped YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7}$.[Y. Sidis {\it
et al.}: Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 84} (2000) 5900]. These common impurity effects
on the shift of $E_\mathrm{cross}$ and $E_\mathrm{res}$ suggest the same
magnetic origin for the resonance peak in YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{\delta}$ and
that for a crossing point of upward and downward dispersions in the
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$. We propose that the sudden change in the
dispersion is better described by a crossover from incommensurate spin
fluctuations to a gapped spin wave rather than a hourglass-like dispersion.
