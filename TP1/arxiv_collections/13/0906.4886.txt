We have investigated the magnetic behavior of the nano crystals, synthesized
by high-energy ball-milling, for a well-known geometrically frustrated
spin-chain system, Ca3CoRhO6, and compared its magnetic characteristics with
those of the bulk form by measuring ac and dc magnetization. The features
attributable to the onset of 'partially disordered antiferromagnetism'
(characterizing the bulk form) are not seen in the magnetization data of the
nano particles; the magnetic moment at high fields in the very low temperature
range in the magnetically ordered state gets relatively enhanced in the nano
particles. It appears that the ferromagnetic intrachain interaction, judged by
the sign of the paramagnetic Curie temperature, is preserved in the nano
particles. These trends are opposite to those seen in Ca3Co2O6. However, the
complex spin-dynamics as evidenced by large frequency dependence of ac
susceptibility is retained in the nano particles as well. Thus, there are some
similarities and dissimilarities between the properties of the nano particles
and those of the bulk. We believe that these findings would be useful to
understand correlation lengths deciding various properties of geometrical
frustration and/or spin-chain phenomena.
