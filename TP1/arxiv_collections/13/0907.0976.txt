We propose a method to synthesize the inverse Compton (IC) gamma-ray image of
a supernova remnant starting from the radio (or hard X-ray) map and using
results of the spatially resolved X-ray spectral analysis. The method is
successfully applied to SN 1006. We found that synthesized IC gamma-ray images
of SN 1006 show morphology in nice agreement with that reported by the H.E.S.S.
collaboration. The good correlation found between the observed very-high energy
gamma-ray and X-ray/radio appearance can be considered as an evidence that the
gamma-ray emission of SN 1006 observed by H.E.S.S. is leptonic in origin,
though the hadronic origin may not be excluded.
