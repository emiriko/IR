In this article we review the recently discovered asymptotic integrability in
the planar N = 4 SYM theory and discuss its breakdown beyond the asymptotic
region due to the wrapping interactions. We also discuss novel dynamical tests
of the AdS/CFT correspondence one can perform in the special cases when the
wrapping interactions may be neglected.
