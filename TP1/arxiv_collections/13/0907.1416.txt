We used observations from the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope to measure the
atomic hydrogen gas content of 324 galaxies around the galaxy cluster Abell 370
at a redshift of z = 0.37 (a look-back time of ~4 billion years). The HI 21-cm
emission from these galaxies was measured by coadding their signals using
precise optical redshifts obtained with the Anglo-Australian Telescope. The
average HI mass measured for all 324 galaxies is (6.6 +- 3.5)x10^9 solar
masses, while the average HI mass measured for the 105 optically blue galaxies
is (19.0 +- 6.5)x10^9 solar masses. The significant quantities of gas found
around Abell 370, suggest that there has been substantial evolution in the gas
content of galaxy clusters since redshift z = 0.37. The total amount of HI gas
found around Abell 370 is up to ~8 times more than that seen around the Coma
cluster, a nearby galaxy cluster of similar size. Despite this higher gas
content, Abell 370 shows the same trend as nearby clusters, that galaxies close
to the cluster core have lower HI gas content than galaxies further away. The
Abell 370 galaxies have HI mass to optical light ratios similar to local galaxy
samples and have the same correlation between their star formation rate and HI
mass as found in nearby galaxies. The average star formation rate derived from
[OII] emission and from de-redshifted 1.4 GHz radio continuum for the Abell 370
galaxies also follows the correlation found in the local universe. The large
amounts of HI gas found around the cluster can easily be consumed by the
observed star formation rate in the galaxies over the ~4 billion years (from z
= 0.37) to the present day.
