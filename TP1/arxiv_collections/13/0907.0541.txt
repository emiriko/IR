FERMI-LAT is performing an all-sky gamma-ray survey from 30 MeV to $>$300 GeV
with unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution. FERMI has detected
high-energy gamma rays from the Moon and Sun since the first weeks of data
taking. This emission is produced by interactions of cosmic rays with these
objects. Similarly, some gamma ray emission can be produced by interactions
with asteroids and planets. We have searched this emission looking major
planets during the first 6 months of data taking. We present here the status of
the search.
