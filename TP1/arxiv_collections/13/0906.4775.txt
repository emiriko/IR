JLab has been at the forefront of a program to measure the nucleon
spin-dependent structure functions over a wide kinematic range, and data of
unprecedented quality has been extracted in all three experimental halls.
Moments of these quantities have proven to be powerful tools to test QCD sum
rules and provide benchmark tests of Lattice QCD and Chiral Perturbation
Theory. Precision measurements of $g_{1,2}^n$ and $g_1^p$ have been performed
as part of the highly successful `extended GDH program', but data on the
$g_2^p$ structure function remain scarce. We discuss here JLab experiment
E08-027, which will measure quantity $g_2^p$ in the resonance region at low
$Q^2$. These data will be used to test the Burkhardt-Cottingham sum rule and to
extract the higher moments $\delta_{LT}^p(Q^2)$ and $\overline{d}_2^p(Q^2)$.
Data in the $Q^2$ range $0.02<Q^2<0.4$ GeV$^2$ will provide unambiguous
benchmark tests of $\chi$PT calculations on the lower end, while probing the
transition region at the high $Q^2$ end where parton-like behaviour begins to
emerge. This data will also have a significant impact on our theoretical
understanding of the hyperfine structure of the proton, and reduce the
systematic uncertainty of previous experiments which extracted the $g_1^p$
structure from purely longitudinal measurements.
