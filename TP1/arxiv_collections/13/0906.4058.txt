The nature of galaxy structures on large scales is a key observational
prediction for current models of galaxy formation. The SDSS and 2dF galaxy
surveys have revealed a number of structures on 40-150 h^-1 Mpc scales at low
redshifts, and some even larger ones. To constrain galaxy number densities,
luminosities, and stellar populations in large structures at higher redshift,
we have investigated two sheet-like structures of galaxies at z=0.8 and 1.3
spanning 150 h^-1 comoving Mpc embedded in large quasar groups extending over
at least 200 h^-1 Mpc. We present first results of an analysis of these
sheet--like structures using two contiguous 1deg GALEX fields (FUV and NUV)
cross-correlated with optical data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We
derive a sample of 462 Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG) candidates coincident with the
sheets. Using the GALEX and SDSS data, we show that the overall average
spectral energy distribution of a LBG galaxy at z~1 is flat (in f_lambda) in
the rest frame wavelength range from 1500A, to 4000A, implying evolved
populations of stars in the LBGs. From the luminosity functions we get
indications for overdensities in the two LQGs compared to their foreground
regions. Similar conclusions come from the calculation of the 2-point
correlation function, showing a 2sigma overdensity for the LBGs in the z~0.8
LQG on scales of 1.6 to 4.8 Mpc, indicating similar correlation scales for our
LBG sample as their z~3 counterparts.
