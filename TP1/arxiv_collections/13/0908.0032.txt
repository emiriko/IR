We evaluate the matrix elements $<r^{p}>$ for the $n$ -dimensional harmonic
oscillator in terms of the dual Hahn polynomials and derive a corresponding
three-term recurrence relation and a Pasternack-type reflection relation. A
short review of similar results for nonrelativistic hydrogen atom is also
given.
