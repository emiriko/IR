The general expression of the Stern-Gerlach force is deduced for a
relativistic spin-1/2 particle which travels inside a time varying magnetic
field. This result was obtained either by means of two Lorentz boosts or
starting from Dirac's equation. Then, the utilization of this interaction for
attaining the spin states separation is reconsidered in a new example using a
new radio-frequency arrangement.
