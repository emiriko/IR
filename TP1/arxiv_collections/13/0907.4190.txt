We develop the most probable wave functions for a single free quantum
particle given its momentum and energy by imposing its quantum probability
density to maximize Shannon information entropy. We show that there is a class
of solutions in which the quantum probability density is self-trapped with
finite-size spatial support, uniformly moving hence keeping its form unchanged.
