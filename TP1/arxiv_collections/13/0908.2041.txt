We study the efficiency, precision and accuracy of all-electron variational
and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo calculations using Slater basis sets.
Starting from wave functions generated by Hartree-Fock and density functional
theory, we describe an algorithm to enforce the electron-nucleus cusp condition
by linear projection. For the 55 molecules in the G2 set, the diffusion quantum
Monte Carlo calculations recovers an average of 95% of the correlation energy
and reproduces bond energies to a mean absolute deviation of 3.2 kcal/mol.
Comparing the individual total energies with essentially exact values, we
investigate the error cancellation in atomization and chemical reaction path
energies, giving additional insight into the sizes of nodal surface errors.
