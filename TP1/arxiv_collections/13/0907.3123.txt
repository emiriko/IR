ELAN is a powerful language and environment for specifying and prototyping
deduction systems in a language based on rewrite rules controlled by
strategies. Timed automata is a class of continuous real-time models of
reactive systems for which efficient model-checking algorithms have been
devised. In this paper, we show that these algorithms can very easily be
prototyped in the ELAN system. This paper argues through this example that
rewriting based systems relying on rules and strategies are a good framework to
prototype, study and test rather efficiently symbolic model-checking
algorithms, i.e. algorithms which involve combination of graph exploration
rules, deduction rules, constraint solving techniques and decision procedures.
