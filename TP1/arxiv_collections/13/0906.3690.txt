In this lecture we deal with the construction of surface densities for the
angular momentum of the sources of asymptotically flat vacuum stationary
axisymmetric spacetimes. These sources arise from the discontinuities of the
twist potential. The result will be applied to the Kerr metric to obtain an
integrable density which can be viewed as the regularized version of the
density obtained using other formalisms.
