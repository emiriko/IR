The dielectric susceptibility of most materials follows a fractional
power-law frequency dependence that is called the "universal" response. We
prove that in the time domain this dependence gives differential equations with
derivatives and integrals of noninteger order. We obtain equations that
describe "universal" Curie-von Schweidler and Gauss laws for such dielectric
materials. These laws are presented by fractional differential equations such
that the electromagnetic fields in the materials demonstrate "universal"
fractional damping. The suggested fractional equations are common (universal)
to a wide class of materials, regardless of the type of physical structure,
chemical composition or of the nature of the polarization.
