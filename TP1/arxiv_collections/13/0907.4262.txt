Il is argued that the generalisation of the mechanical principles to other
variables than localisation, velocity and momentum leads to the laws of
generalized dynamics under the condition of continuous and derivable space
time. However, when the fractality arises, the mechanics principles may no more
be extended especially because the time and space singularity appears on the
boundary and creates curvature. There is no more equilibrium state, but only a
horizon which might play a same role as equilibrium but does not close the
problem - especially the problem of the invariance of the energy - which
requires two complementary factors: a first one related to the closure in the
dimensional space, and the second to scan dissymmetry stemming from the default
of tilling the space time. A new discreet time arises from fractality. It leads
irreversible thermodynamic properties. Space and time singularities lead to the
relation between the above mentioned problematic and the Riemann zeta functions
as well as its zeros.
