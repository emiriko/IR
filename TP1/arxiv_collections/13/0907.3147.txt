We consider a number operator-annihilation operator uncertainty as a well
behaved alternative to the number-phase uncertainty relation, and examine its
properties. We find a formulation in which the bound on the product of
uncertainties depends on the expectation value of the particle number. Thus,
while the bound is not a constant, it is a quantity that can easily be
controlled in many systems. The uncertainty relation is approximately saturated
by number-phase intelligent states. This allows us to define amplitude
squeezing, connecting coherent states to Fock states, without a reference to a
phase operator. We propose several setups for an experimental verification.
