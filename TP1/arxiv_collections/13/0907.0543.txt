FERMI-LAT is performing an all-sky gamma-ray survey from 30 MeV to 300 GeV
with unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution. FERMI has detected
high-energy gamma rays from the Moon produced by interactions of cosmic rays
with the lunar surface. This radiation was previously observed by EGRET on CGRO
with significantly lower statistical significance. We present the lunar
analysis for the first six months of the Mission and showing images of the
lunar gamma-ray emission. We also compare the flux measurements with models the
earlier EGRET measurements.
