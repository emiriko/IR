Cosmology of self-interacting three-forms is investigated. The minimally
coupled canonical theory can naturally generate a variety of isotropic
background dynamics, including scaling, possibly transient acceleration and
phantom crossing. An intuitive picture of the cosmological dynamics is
presented employing an effective potential. Numerical solutions and analytical
approximations are provided for scenarios which are potentially important for
inflation or dark energy.
