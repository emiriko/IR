Let V be the 7-dimensional irreducible representation of the quantum group
U_q(g_2). For each n, there is a map from the braid group B_n to the
endomorphism algebra of the n-th tensor power of V, given by R-matrices. We can
extend this linearly to a map on the braid group algebra. Lehrer and Zhang
(MR2271576) prove this map is surjective, as a special case of a more general
result.
  Using Kuperberg's spider for G_2 from arXiv:math.QA/9201302, we give an
elementary diagrammatic proof of this result.
