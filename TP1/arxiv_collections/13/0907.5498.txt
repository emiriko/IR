Magneto Raman scattering study of the E$_{2g}$ optical phonons in multi-layer
epitaxial graphene grown on a carbon face of SiC are presented. At 4.2K in
magnetic field up to 33 T, we observe a series of well pronounced avoided
crossings each time the optically active inter Landau level transition is tuned
in resonance with the E$_{2g}$ phonon excitation (at 196 meV). The width of the
phonon Raman scattering response also shows pronounced variations and is
enhanced in conditions of resonance. The experimental results are well
reproduced by a model that gives directly the strength of the electron-phonon
interaction.
