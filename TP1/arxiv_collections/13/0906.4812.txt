We report a comprehensive light element (Li, C, N, O, Na, Mg, and Al)
abundance analysis of three solar-type main sequence (MS) dwarfs and three red
giant branch (RGB) clump stars in the Hyades open cluster using high-resolution
and high signal-to-noise spectroscopy. For each group (MS or RGB), the CNO
abundances are found to be in excellent star-to-star agreement. Our results
confirm that the giants have undergone the first dredge-up and that material
processed by the CN cycle has been mixed to the surface layers. The observed
abundances are compared to predictions of a standard stellar model based on the
Clemson-American University of Beirut (CAUB) stellar evolution code. The model
reproduces the observed evolution of the N and O abundances, as well as the
previously derived 12C/13C ratio, but it fails to predict by a factor of 1.5
the observed level of 12C depletion. Li abundances are derived to determine if
non-canonical extra mixing has occurred in the Hyades giants. The Li abundance
of the giant gamma Tau is in good accord with the predicted level of surface Li
dilution, but a ~0.35 dex spread in the giant Li abundances is found and cannot
be explained by the stellar model. Possible sources of the spread are
discussed; however, it is apparent that the differential mechanism responsible
for the Li dispersion must be unrelated to the uniformly low 12C abundances of
the giants. Na, Mg, and Al abundances are derived as an additional test of our
stellar model. All three elements are found to be overabundant by 0.2-0.5 dex
in the giants relative to the dwarfs. Such large enhancements of these elements
are not predicted by the stellar model, and non-LTE effects significantly
larger (and, in some cases, of opposite sign) than those implied by extant
literature calculations are the most likely cause.
