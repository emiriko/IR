This paper builds upon several recent works, where semigroup proofs of
Brascamp-Lieb inequalities are provided in various settings (Euclidean space,
spheres and symmetric groups). Our aim is twofold. Firstly, we provide a
general, unifying, framework based on Markov generators, in order to cover a
variety of examples of interest going beyond previous investigations. Secondly,
we put forward the combinatorial reasons for which unexpected exponents occur
in these inequalities.
