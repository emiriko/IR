The article presents results of discrete thermodynamics (DTD) basic
application to electrochemical systems. Consistent treatment of the
electrochemical system as comprising two interacting subsystems - the chemical
and the electrical (electrochemical) - leads to ln-logistic map of states of
the electrochemical system with non-unity coefficient of the electrical charge
transfer. This factor provides for a feedback and causes dynamic behavior of
electrochemical systems, including bifurcations and electrochemical
oscillations. The latter occur beyond bifurcation point at essential deviation
of the chemical subsystem from true thermodynamic equilibrium. If the charge
transfer coefficient takes on unity, the map turns into classical equation of
electrochemical equilibrium. Spectra of electrochemical oscillations, resulted
from the DTD formalism, are multifractals. Graphical solutions of this work are
qualitatively compared to some experimental results.
