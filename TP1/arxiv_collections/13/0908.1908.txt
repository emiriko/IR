Short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), typically lasting less than 2 s, are a special
class of GRBs of great interest. We report the detection by the AGILE satellite
of the short GRB 090510 which shows two clearly distinct emission phases: a
prompt phase lasting ~ 200 msec and a second phase lasting tens of seconds. The
prompt phase is relatively intense in the 0.3-10 MeV range with a spectrum
characterized by a large peak/cutoff energy near 3 MeV, in this phase, no
significant high-energy gamma-ray emission is detected. At the end of the
prompt phase, intense gamma-ray emission above 30 MeV is detected showing a
power-law time decay of the flux of the type t^-1.3 and a broad-band spectrum
remarkably different from that of the prompt phase. It extends from sub-MeV to
hundreds of MeV energies with a photon index alpha ~ 1.5. GRB 090510 provides
the first case of a short GRB with delayed gamma-ray emission. We present the
timing and spectral data of GRB 090510 and briefly discuss its remarkable
properties within the current models of gamma-ray emission of short GRBs.
