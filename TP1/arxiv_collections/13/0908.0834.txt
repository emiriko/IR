We have synthesized various samples of the $x=2/3$ phase of sodium cobaltate
Na$_{x}$CoO$_{2}$ and performed X-ray powder diffractions spectra to compare
the diffraction with the structure proposed previously from NMR/NQR experiments
[H. Alloul \emph{et al.}, EPL \textbf{85}, 47006 (2009)]. Rietveld analysis of
the data are found in perfect agreement with those, and confirm the
concentration x=2/3 obtained in the synthesis procedure. They even give
indications on the atomic displacements of Na inside the unit cell. The
detailed NQR data allow us to identify the NQR transitions and electric field
gradient (EFG) parameters for 4 cobalt sites and 3 Na sites. The spin-lattice
and spin-spin relaxation rates are found much smaller for the non-magnetic
Co$^{3+}$ sites than for the magnetic sites on which the holes are delocalized.
The atomic ordering of the Na layers is therefore at the source of this ordered
distribution of cobalt charges. The method used here to resolve the Na ordering
and the subsequent Co charge order can be used valuably for other
concentrations of Na.
