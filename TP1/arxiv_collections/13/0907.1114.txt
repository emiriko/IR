We explore procedures to detect entanglement of unknown mixed states, which
can be experimentally viable. The heart of the method is a hierarchy of simple
feasibility problems, which provides sufficient conditions to entanglement. Our
numerical investigations indicate that the entanglement is detected with a cost
which is much lower than full state tomography. The procedure is applicable to
both free and bound entanglement, and involves only single copy measurements.
