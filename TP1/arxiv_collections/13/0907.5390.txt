The neutrino masses and oscillation are closely related to how neutrino
propagates. In this paper, we first derive a new form of four-momentum
conservation that connects the four-momentum $(E_{\alpha},~p_{\alpha})$ of the
neutrino flavor eigenstate and the four momenta $(E_i,~p_i)$ of its mass
eigen-components. Then we use the assumption that the mass eigen-components
travel at equal velocity to derive the energy-momentum square difference (EMSD)
$E_{\alpha}^2-p_{\alpha}^2$ for the flavor eigenstate. It is shown that for the
equal velocity assumption, $E_{\alpha}^2-p_{\alpha}^2$ will be a fixed constant
in events with different $E_{\alpha}$ and/or $p_{\alpha}$. In contrast, for the
equal energy or equal momentum assumption, $E_{\alpha}^2-p_{\alpha}^2$ will
vary with $E_{\alpha}$ or $p_{\alpha}$ respectively. These EMSD can be checked
by ongoing and future neutrino experiments. The phase difference between two
neutrino mass eigen-components $|\nu_i\rangle$ and $|\nu_j\rangle$ is then
derived for the equal velocity assumption. For relativistic neutrinos, it is
shown that the phase difference depends linearly on the distance energy ratio
$L/E$, the mass difference $m_i-m_j$ and an effective mass, in contrary to the
linear dependance on $L/E$ and $m_i^2-m_j^2$ as the phase difference for equal
energy or equal momentum assumption dose. The new phase difference implies
different bounds on the neutrino masses or mass difference.
