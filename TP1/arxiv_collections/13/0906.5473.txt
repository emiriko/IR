We report the first experimental evidence for a strong electromechanical
coupling in the Mott insulator GaTa4Se8 allowing a highly reproducible
nano-writing with a Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM). The local electric
field across the STM junction is observed to have a threshold value above which
the clean (100) surface of GaTa4Se8 becomes mechanically instable: At voltage
biases V > 1.1V the surface suddenly inflates and comes in contact with the STM
tip, resulting in nanometer size craters. The formed pattern can be
indestructibly "read" by STM at lower voltage bias, thus allowing a 5
Tdots/inch2 dense writing/reading at room temperature. The discovery of the
electromechanical coupling in GaTa4Se8 might give new clues in the
understanding of the Electric Pulse Induced Resistive Switching recently
observed in this stoechiometric Mott insulator.
