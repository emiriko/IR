Evolutionary game dynamics describes the spreading of successful strategies
in a population of reproducing individuals. Typically, the microscopic
definition of strategy spreading is stochastic, such that the dynamics becomes
deterministic only in infinitely large populations. Here, we introduce a new
microscopic birth--death process that has a fully deterministic strong
selection limit in well--mixed populations of any size. Additionally, under
weak selection, from this new process the frequency dependent Moran process is
recovered. This makes it a natural extension of the usual evolutionary dynamics
under weak selection. We find simple expressions for the fixation probabilities
and average fixation times of the new process in evolutionary games with two
players and two strategies. For cyclic games with two players and three
strategies, we show that the resulting deterministic dynamics crucially depends
on the initial condition in a non--trivial way.
