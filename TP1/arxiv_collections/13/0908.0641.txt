This paper proposes a theoretical modelling of the simultaneous and non
invasive measurement of electrical resistivity and dielectric permittivity,
using a quadrupole probe on a subjacent medium. A mathematical-physical model
is applied on propagation of errors in the measurement of resistivity and
permittivity based on the sensitivity functions tool. The findings are also
compared to the results of the classical method of analysis in the frequency
domain, which is useful for determining the behaviour of zero and pole
frequencies in the linear time invariant (LTI) circuit of the quadrupole. The
paper underlines that average values of electrical resistivity and dielectric
permittivity may be used to estimate the complex impedance over various
terrains and concretes, especially when they are characterized by low levels of
water saturation (content) and analyzed within a bandwidth ranging only from
low (LF) to middle (MF) frequencies. In order to meet the design specifications
which ensure satisfactory performances of the probe (inaccuracy no more than
10%), the forecasts provided by the sensitivity functions approach are less
stringent than those foreseen by the transfer functions method (in terms of
both a larger band of frequency f and a wider measurable range of resistivity
or permittivity).
