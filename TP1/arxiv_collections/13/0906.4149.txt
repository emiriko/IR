Process Management Systems (PMSs) are currently more and more used as a
supporting tool for cooperative processes in pervasive and highly dynamic
situations, such as emergency situations, pervasive healthcare or domotics/home
automation. But in all such situations, designed processes can be easily
invalidated since the execution environment may change continuously due to
frequent unforeseeable events. This paper aims at illustrating the theoretical
framework and the concrete implementation of SmartPM, a PMS that features a set
of sound and complete techniques to automatically cope with unplanned
exceptions. PMS SmartPM is based on a general framework which adopts the
Situation Calculus and Indigolog.
