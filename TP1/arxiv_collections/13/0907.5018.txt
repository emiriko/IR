The study of shell-type supernova remnants is a key science focus for the
VERITAS TeV telescope array. Supernova remnants (SNRs) are widely considered to
be the strongest candidate for the source of cosmic rays below the knee around
10^15 eV. This presentation will highlight new VERITAS results including new
measurements of the spectra of Cas A and IC 443 and observations of the
"Forbidden Velocity Wing" FVW 190.2+1.1. These results and their implications
for the nature of the cosmic rays - hadronic or electronic - accelerated in the
remnants will be discussed.
