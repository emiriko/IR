We establish a theoretical understanding of the entanglement properties of a
physical system that mediates a quantum information splitting protocol. We
quantify the different ways in which an arbitrary $n$ qubit state can be split
among a set of $k$ participants using a $N$ qubit entangled channel, such that
the original information can be completely reconstructed only if all the
participants cooperate. Based on this quantification, we show how to design a
quantum protocol with minimal resources and define the splitting efficiency of
a quantum channel which provides a way of characterizing entangled states based
on their usefulness for such quantum networking protocols.
