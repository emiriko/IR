We describe an experimental study of spin-projection noise in a high
sensitivity alkali-metal magnetometer. We demonstrate a four-fold improvement
in the measurement bandwidth of the magnetometer using continuous quantum
non-demolition (QND) measurements. Operating in the scalar mode with a
measurement volume of 2 cm^3 we achieve magnetic field sensitivity of 22
fT/Hz^(1/2) and a bandwidth of 1.9 kHz with a spin polarization of only 1%. Our
experimental arrangement is naturally back-action evading and can be used to
realize sub-fT sensitivity with a highly polarized spin-squeezed atomic vapor.
