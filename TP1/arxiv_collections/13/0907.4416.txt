Metamaterials have paved the way to unprecedented control of the
electromagnetic field1,2. The conjunction with space coordinate transformation
has led to a novel "relativity inspired" approach for the control of light
propagation. "Invisibility cloak" is the most fascinating proposed devices3,4.
However, the realized structures up to now used a graded "metamagnetic" so as
to achieve the cloaking function11. Artificial magnetism is however still very
challenging to obtain in optics despite the currently promising building
blocks13-17, not suited for optical cloaking. We report here the first
experimental demonstration of non-magnetic cloak at microwave frequencies by
direct mapping of the magnetic field together with the first experimental
characterization of a cloak in free space configuration. The diameter of the
concealed region is as big as 4.4 in wavelength units, the biggest reported
experimentally so far. The principle can be scaled down to optical domain while
keeping the compatibility with current nanofabrication technologies.
