We study the thermodynamic efficiency of a nano-sized photo-electric device
and show that at maximum power output, the efficiency is bounded from above by
a result closely related to the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency. We find that this
upper bound can be attained in nano-sized devices displaying strong coupling
between the generated electron flux and the incoming photon flux from the sun.
