The D0 collaboration reports direct evidence for electroweak production of
single top quarks through the t-channel exchange of a virtual W boson. This is
the first analysis to isolate an individual single top quark production
channel. We select events containing an isolated electron or muon, missing
transverse energy, and two, three or four jets from 2.3 fb^-1 of ppbar
collisions at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. One or two of the jets are
identified as containing a b hadron. We combine three multivariate techniques
optimized for the t-channel process to measure the t- and s-channel cross
sections simultaneously. We measure cross sections of 3.14 +0.94 -0.80 pb for
the t-channel and 1.05 +-0.81 pb for the s-channel. The measured t-channel
result is found to have a significance of 4.8 standard deviations and is
consistent with the standard model prediction.
