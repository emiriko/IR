The formation of interface from an initial sharp interface in polydisperse
A/B blends is studied using the external potential dynamic method. The present
model is a nonlocal coupling model as we take into account the correlation
between segments in a single chain. The correlation is approximately expressed
by Debye function and the diffusion dynamics are based on the Rouse chain
model. The chain length distribution is described by the continuous Schulz
distribution. Our numerical calculation indicates that the broadening of
interface with respect to time obeys a power law at early times, and the power
law indexes are the same for both monodisperse and polydisperse blend. The
power law index is larger than that in the local coupling model. However there
is not a unified scaling form of the broadening of the interface width if only
the interfacial width at equilibrium is taken into account as the
characteristic length of the system, because the correlation makes an extra
characteristic length in the system, and the polydispersity is related to this
length.
