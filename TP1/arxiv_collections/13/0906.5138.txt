The quantum bouncer (QB) concept is a known QM textbook example of confined
particle, namely, a solution to the 1D Schroedinger equation for a linear
potential (the so-called Airy equation). It would be a great methodological
challenge to create such a QM object in laboratory. An attempt of observation
of the QB ``running'' in the horizontal direction was recently made by the
international team at the Laue-Langevin Institute, Grenoble. The experiment was
performed with ultra-cold neutrons. In this paper, the experiment is analyzed
in view of the authors' claim that ``neutron quantum states in Earth
gravitational field'' are observed. The experimental apparatus is designed for
measurements of horizontal flux of neutrons passing through an absorbing wave
guide with a variable height of absorber. From our analysis, it follows,
however, that in such a layout measured data are not sensitive to quantum
probability density in the vertical direction. The overall conclusion is made
that the experimental data do not contain sufficient information to justify the
claim.
