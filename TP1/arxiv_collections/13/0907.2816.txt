A summary of the heavy flavor results from the STAR experiment is presented.
Both open heavy flavor as well as quarkonia measurements are presented. A
strong suppression of heavy flavor non-photonic electrons is observed in
central Au+Au collisions at 200GeV. Relative contribution of bottom
contribution to non-photonic electron spectra in p+p collisions is extracted
from data. Nuclear modification factor of J/Psi mesons at high-pT is found to
be consistent with one in central Cu+Cu collisions at 200GeV. Strong signal of
Upsilon(1S+2S+3S) state is observed in d+Au collisions at 200GeV.
