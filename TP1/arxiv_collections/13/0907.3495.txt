We present a new class of high-order imaginary time propagators for
path-integral Monte Carlo simulations by subtracting lower order propagators.
By requiring all terms of the extrapolated propagator be sampled uniformly, the
subtraction only affects the potential part of the path integral. The
negligible violation of positivity of the resulting path integral at small time
steps has no discernable affect on the accuracy of our method. Thus in
principle arbitrarily high order algorithms can be devised for path-integral
Monte Carlo simulations. We verify this claim is by showing that fourth, sixth,
and eighth order convergence can indeed be achieved in solving for the ground
state of strongly interacting quantum many-body systems such as bulk liquid
$^4$He.
