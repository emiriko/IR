This paper introduces QuSAnn v1.2 and Multiplexor Expander v1.2, two Java
applications available for free. (Source code included in the distribution.)
QuSAnn is a "code generator" for quantum simulated annealing: after the user
inputs some parameters, it outputs a quantum circuit for performing simulated
annealing on a quantum computer. The quantum circuit implements the algorithm
of Wocjan et al. (arXiv:0804.4259), which improves on the original algorithm of
Somma et al. (arXiv:0712.1008). The quantum circuit generated by QuSAnn
includes some quantum multiplexors. The application Multiplexor Expander allows
the user to replace each of those multiplexors by a sequence of more elementary
gates such as multiply controlled NOTs and qubit rotations.
