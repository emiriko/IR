Software Project Management (SPM) and Software Quality Assurance (SQA) are
key components of undergraduate Computing programmes at educational
establishments in Pakistan. Because of the nature of these subjects, there are
a number of issues that need to be discussed and resolved so that the teaching
becomes more effective, students learning experience is more enjoyable and
their ability to be actively involved in SPM and SQA, after the completion of
their studies, becomes further improved. In this paper, we discuss experience
of teaching SPM and SQA at one particular institution in Islamabad Pakistan.
Using this as a case study, we underline the students perspective, highlight
the inherent issues and suggest ways to improve the delivery of these subjects.
Since, the issues are mainly generic, the aim is to provide discussion and
recommendations to benefit a wider computing community in academia.
