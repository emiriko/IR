A global nucleon-nucleus optical potential for elastic scattering has been
produced which replicates experimental data to high accuracy and compares well
with other recently formulated potentials. The calculation that has been
developed describes proton and neutron scattering from target nuclei ranging
from carbon to nickel and is applicable for projectile energies from 30 to 160
MeV. With these ranges it is suitable for calculations associated with
experiments performed by exotic beam accelerators. The potential is also
isospin dependent and has both real and imaginary isovector asymmetry terms to
better describe the dynamics of chains of isotopes and mirror nuclei. An
analysis of the validity and strength of the asymmetry term is included with
connections established to other optical potentials and charge-exchange
reaction data. An on-line observable calculator is available for this optical
potential.
