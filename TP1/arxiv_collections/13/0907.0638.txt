The Large Area Telescope (LAT) instrument on board the Fermi satellite
consists of a multi-layer silicon-strip tracker interleaved with tungsten
converters (TKR), followed by a CsI crystal hodoscopic calorimeter (CAL).
Sixteen TKR and CAL modules are assembled in a 4$\times$4 array. A segmented
anticoincidence plastic scintillator (ACD) surrounds the TKRs. The primary
cosmic-ray electron/positron energy spectrum has been measured from 20 GeV to 1
TeV using a dedicated event analysis that ensures efficient electron detection
and reduced hadron contamination. Results from detailed Monte Carlo simulations
have been used to reconstruct the observed energy spectrum to the primary
cosmic ray spectrum. We present here details of the analysis procedure and the
energy spectrum reconstruction.
