Using effective field theories dictated by the symmetry of the system, as
well as microscopic considerations, we map out the magnetic
coupling-temperature phase diagrams of spin-1 Bose gases in both two- and
three-dimensions. We also determine the nature of all phase boundaries, and
critical properties in the case of 2nd order phase transitions at both zero and
finite temperatures.
