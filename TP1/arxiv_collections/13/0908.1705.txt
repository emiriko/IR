We present refined parameters for the extrasolar planetary system HAT-P-2
(also known as HD 147506), based on new radial velocity and photometric data.
HAT-P-2b is a transiting extrasolar planet that exhibits an eccentric orbit. We
present a detailed analysis of the planetary and stellar parameters, yielding
consistent results for the mass and radius of the star, better constraints on
the orbital eccentricity, and refined planetary parameters. The improved
parameters for the host star are M_star = 1.36 +/- 0.04 M_sun and R_star = 1.64
+/- 0.08 R_sun, while the planet has a mass of M_p = 9.09 +/- 0.24 M_Jup and
radius of R_p = 1.16 +/- 0.08 R_Jup. The refined transit epoch and period for
the planet are E = 2,454,387.49375 +/- 0.00074 (BJD) and P = 5.6334729 +/-
0.0000061 (days), and the orbital eccentricity and argument of periastron are e
= 0.5171 +/- 0.0033 and omega = 185.22 +/- 0.95 degrees. These orbital elements
allow us to predict the timings of secondary eclipses with a reasonable
accuracy of ~15 minutes. We also discuss the effects of this significant
eccentricity including the characterization of the asymmetry in the transit
light curve. Simple formulae are presented for the above, and these, in turn,
can be used to constrain the orbital eccentricity using purely photometric
data. These will be particularly useful for very high precision, space-borne
observations of transiting planets.
