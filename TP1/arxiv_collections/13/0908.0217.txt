Recently, the use of Bessel beams in evaluating the possibility of using them
for a new generation of GPR (ground penetrating radar) systems has been
considered. Therefore, an analysis of the propagation of Bessel beam in
conducting media is worthwhile. We present here an analysis of this type.
Specifically, for normal incidence we analyze the propagation of a Bessel beam
coming from a perfect dielectric and impinging on a conducting medium, i.e. the
propagation of a Bessel beam generated by refracted inhomogeneous waves. The
remarkable and unexpected result is that the incident Bessel beam does not
change its shape even when propagating in the conducting medium.
