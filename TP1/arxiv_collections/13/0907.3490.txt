In this work we report on a cold, bright portion of an active region observed
by Hinode/EIS. The emitting plasma was very bright at transition region
temperatures, and the intensities of lines of ions formed between 10^5-10^6 K
were enhanced over normal values. The data set constitutes an excellent
laboratory where the emission of transition region ions can be tested. We first
determine the thermal structure of the observed plasma, and then we use it 1)
to develop a spectral atlas, and 2) to assess the quality of CHIANTI atomic
data by comparing predicted emissivities with observed intensities. We identify
several lines never observed before in solar spectra, and find an overall
excellent agreement between CHIANTI predicted emissivities and observations.
