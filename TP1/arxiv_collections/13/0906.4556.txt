For more than two decades we have known that galaxy morphological segregation
is present in the Local Universe. It is important to see how this relation
evolves with cosmic time. To investigate how galaxy assembly took place with
cosmic time, we explore the evolution of the morphology-density relation up to
redshift z~1 using about 10000 galaxies drawn from the zCOSMOS Galaxy Redshift
Survey. Taking advantage of accurate HST/ACS morphologies from the COSMOS
survey, of the well-characterised zCOSMOS 3D environment, and of a large sample
of galaxies with spectroscopic redshift, we want to study here the evolution of
the morphology-density relation up to z~1 and its dependence on galaxy
luminosity and stellar mass. The multi-wavelength coverage of the field also
allows a first study of the galaxy morphological segregation dependence on
colour. We further attempt to disentangle between processes that occurred early
in the history of the Universe or late in the life of galaxies. The zCOSMOS
field benefits of high-resolution imaging in the F814W filter from the Advanced
Camera for Survey (ACS). We use standard morphology classifiers, optimised for
being robust against band-shifting and surface brightness dimming, and a new,
objective, and automated method to convert morphological parameters into early,
spiral, and irregular types. We use about 10000 galaxies down to I_AB=22.5 with
a spectroscopic sampling rate of 33% to characterise the environment of
galaxies up to z~1 from the 100 kpc scales of galaxy groups up to the 100 Mpc
scales of the cosmic web. ABRIDGED
