On a fixed smooth compact Riemann surface with boundary $(M_0,g)$, we show
that for the Schr\"odinger operator $\Delta +V$ with potential $V\in
C^{1,\alpha}(M_0)$ for some $\alpha>0$, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map
$N|_{\Gamma}$ measured on an open set $\Gamma\subset \partial M_0$ determines
uniquely the potential $V$. We also discuss briefly the corresponding
consequences for potential scattering at 0 frequency on Riemann surfaces with
asymptotically Euclidean or asymptotically hyperbolic ends.
