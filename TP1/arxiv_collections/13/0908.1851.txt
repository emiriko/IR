A description of transitive actions of a semisimple algebraic group G on
toric varieties is obtained. Every toric variety admitting such an action lies
between a product of punctured affine spaces and a product of projective
spaces. The result is based on the Cox realization of a toric variety as a
quotient space of an open subset of a vector space V by a quasitorus action and
on investigation of the G-module structure of V.
