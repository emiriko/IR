For the preparation of the experimental search for charged Higgs bosons at
the LHC detailed studies have been made to determine the expected charged Higgs
boson production cross-sections and decay branching ratios at sqrts = 14 TeV.
In the mass regime below the t-quark mass the expected production
cross-sections are discussed using PYTHIA and FeynHiggs program packages based
on the decay t to H^+b. For higher masses Next-to-Leading-Order (NLO
calculations have been used, and particular attention has been given to the
intermediate-mass region. The decay branching ratios have been studied with the
program packages FeynHiggs and HDecay. Higher-order corrections (Delta_b
corrections) in the MSSM are consistently taken into account. Two benchmark
scenarios are considered, one of them the `mhmax'.
