We present evidence that the WASP-14 exoplanetary system has misaligned
orbital and stellar-rotational axes, with an angle lambda = 33.1 +/- 7.4 deg
between their sky projections. The evidence is based on spectroscopic
observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect as well as new photometric
observations. WASP-14 is now the third system known to have a significant
spin-orbit misalignment, and all three systems have "super-Jupiter" planets
(M_P > 3 Mjup) and eccentric orbits. This finding suggests that the migration
and subsequent orbital evolution of massive, eccentric exoplanets is somehow
different from that of less massive close-in Jupiters, the majority of which
have well-aligned orbits.
