In vacuum or constant density matter, the two flavor neutrino oscillation
formulae are insensitive to the presence of CP violating phases owing to the
fact that the CP phase can be gauged away. In sharp contrast to the above case,
we show that the CP violating phases can not be gauged away in presence of
adiabatically changing background density accompanied by varying CP phases. We
present a pure geometric visualization of this fact by exploiting
Pancharatnam's prescription of cyclic quantum projections. Consequently the
topological phase obtained in Phys. Rev. D 79, 096013 (2009) can become
geometric if CP violation occurs in a varying density medium.
