The Spitzer Space Telescope has advanced debris disk science tremendously
with a wealth of information on debris disks around nearby A, F, G, K and M
stars at 24 and 70 microns with the MIPS photometer and at 8-34 microns with
IRS. Here we present 160 micron observations of a small sub-set of these stars.
At this wavelength, the stellar photospheric emission is negligible and any
detected emission corresponds to cold dust in extended Kuiper belt analogs.
However, the Spitzer 160 micron observations are limited in sensitivity by the
large beam size which results in significant ''noise'' due to cirrus and
extragalactic confusion. In addition, the 160 micron measurements suffer from
the added complication of a light leak next to the star's position whose flux
is proportional to the near-infrared flux of the star. We are able to remove
the contamination from the leak and report 160 micron measurements or upper
limits for 24 stars. Three stars (HD 10647, HD 207129, and HD 115617) have
excesses at 160 micron that we use to constrain the properties of the debris
disks around them. A more detailed model of the spectral energy distribution of
HD 10647 reveals that the 70 and 160 micron emission could be due to small
water ice particles at a distance of 100 AU consistent with Hubble Space
Telescope optical imaging of circumstellar material in the system.
