We consider the statistical properties of photon detection with imperfect
detectors that exhibit dark counts and less than unit efficiency, in the
context of tomographic reconstruction. In this context, the detectors are used
to implement certain POVMs that would allow to reconstruct the quantum state or
quantum process under consideration. Here we look at the intermediate step of
inferring outcome probabilities from measured outcome frequencies, and show how
this inference can be performed in a statistically sound way in the presence of
detector imperfections. Merging outcome probabilities for different sets of
POVMs into a consistent quantum state picture has been treated elsewhere

pulsed measurements as well as continuous wave measurements are covered.
