Supernova explosions are among the most energetic phenomena in the known
universe. There are suggestions that cosmic rays up to EeV energies might be
accelerated in the young supernova shell on time scales of a few weeks to
years, which would lead to TeV neutrino radiation. The data taken with the
AMANDA neutrino telescope in the years 2000 to 2006 is analysed with a
likelihood approach in order to search for directional and temporal
coincidences between neutrino events and optically observed extra-galactic
supernovae. The supernovae were stacked in order to enhance the sensitivity. A
catalogue of relevant core-collapse supernovae has been created. This poster
presents the results from the analysis.
