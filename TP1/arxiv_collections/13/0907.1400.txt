The microstructure of a Cu/V nanocomposite wire processed by cold drawing was
investigated by high resolution transmission electron microscopy and atom probe
tomography. The experimental data clearly reveal some deformation induced
interfacial mixing where the vanadium filaments are nanoscaled. The mixed layer
is a 2nm wide vanadium gradient in the fcc Cu phase. This mechanical mixing
leads to the local fragmentation and dissolution of the filaments and to the
formation of vanadium super saturated solid solutions in fcc Cu.
