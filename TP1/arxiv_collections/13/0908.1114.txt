We present the results of models of the chemistry, including deuterium, in
the inner regions of protostellar disks. We find good agreement with recent gas
phase observations of several (non--deuterated) species. We also compare our
results with observations of comets and find that in the absence of other
processing e.g. in the accretion shock at the surface of the disk, or by mixing
in the disk, the calculated D/H ratios in ices are higher than measured and
reflect the D/H ratio set in the molecular cloud phase. Our models give quite
different abundances and molecular distributions to other inner disk models
because of the differences in physical conditions in the model disk. This
emphasizes how changes in the assumptions about the density and temperature
distribution can radically affect the results of chemical models.
