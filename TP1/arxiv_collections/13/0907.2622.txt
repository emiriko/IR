Optical binding interactions between laser-trapped spherical microparticles
are familiar in a wide range of trapping configurations. Recently it has been
demonstrated that these experiments can be accurately modeled using Mie
scattering or coupled dipole models. This can help confirm the physical
phenomena underlying the inter-particle interactions, but does not necessarily
develop a conceptual understanding of the effects that can lead to future
predictions. Here we interpret results from a Mie scattering model to obtain a
physical description which predict the behavior and trends for chains of
trapped particles in Gaussian beam traps. In particular, it describes the
non-uniform particle spacing and how it changes with the number of particles.
We go further than simply \emph{demonstrating} agreement, by showing that the
mechanisms ``hidden'' within a mathematically and computationally demanding Mie
scattering description can be explained in easily-understood terms.
