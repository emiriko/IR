A numerical renormalization-group study of the conductance through a quantum
wire side-coupled to a quantum dot is reported. The temperature and the
dot-energy dependence of the conductance are examined in the light of a
recently derived linear mapping between the Kondo-regime temperature-dependent
conductance and the universal function describing the conductance for the
symmetric Anderson model of a quantum wire with an embedded quantum dot. Two
conduction paths, one traversing the wire, the other a bypass through the
quantum dot, are identified. A gate potential applied to the quantum wire is
shown to control the flow through the bypass. When the potential favors
transport through the wire, the conductance in the Kondo regime rises from
nearly zero at low temperatures to nearly ballistic at high temperatures. When
it favors the dot, the pattern is reversed: the conductance decays from nearly
ballistic to nearly zero. When the fluxes through the two paths are comparable,
the conductance is nearly temperature-independent in the Kondo regime, and a
Fano antiresonance in the fixed-temperature plot of the conductance as a
function of the dot energy signals interference. Throughout the Kondo regime
and, at low temperatures, even in the mixed-valence regime, the numerical data
are in excellent agreement with the universal mapping.
