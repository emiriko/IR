In this thesis we initiate a systematic study of branes in
Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten models with Lie supergroup target space. We start by
showing that a branes' worldvolume is a twisted superconjugacy class and
construct the action of the boundary WZNW model. Then we consider symplectic
fermions and give a complete description of boundary states including twisted
sectors. Further we show that the GL(1|1) WZNW model is equivalent to
symplectic fermions plus two scalars. We then consider the GL(1|1) boundary
theory. Twisted and untwisted Cardy boundary states are constructed explicitly
and their amplitudes are computed. In the twisted case we find a perturbative
formulation of the model. For this purpose the introduction of an additional
fermionic boundary degree of freedom is necessary. We compute all bulk
one-point functions, bulk-boundary two-point functions and boundary three-point
functions. Logarithmic singularities appear in bulk-boundary as well as pure
boundary correlation functions.
  Finally we turn to world-sheet and target space supersymmetric models. There
is N=2 superconformal symmetry in many supercosets and also in certain
supergroups. In the supergroup case we find some branes that preserve the
topological A-twist and some that preserve the B-twist.
