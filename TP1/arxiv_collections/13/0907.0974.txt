We present here a detailed description of the model of ran-driven nuclear
transduction in living cells to be published elswere. The mathematical model
presented is the first to account for the active transport of molecules along
the cytoplasmic microtubules. All parameters entering the models are thoroughly
discussed. The simulations reproduce the behavior observed experimentally.
