We report detailed 51V NMR spectra in a single crystal of MnV2O4. The
vanadium spectrum reveals two peaks in the orbitally ordered state, which arise
from different internal hyperfine fields at two different V sublattices. These
internal fields evolve smoothly with externally applied field, and show no
change in structure that would suggest a change of the orbital ordering. The
result is consistent with the orbital ordering model recently proposed by
Sarkar et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 216405 (2009)] in which the same orbital
that is a mixture of t_2g orbitals rotates by about 45$^\circ$ alternately
within and between orbital chains in the I4_1/a tetragonal space group.
