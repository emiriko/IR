We perform a first global exploration of the Constrained
  Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model using Bayesian statistics. We
derive several global features of the model and find that, in some contrast to
initial expectations, they closely resemble the Constrained MSSM. This remains
true even away from the decoupling limit which is nevertheless strongly
preferred. We present ensuing implications for several key observables,
including collider signatures and predictions for direct detection of dark
matter.
