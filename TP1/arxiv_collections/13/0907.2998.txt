In this letter we present the three-loop virtual corrections to the Higgs
boson production in the gluon fusion channel where finite top quark mass
effects are taken into account. We perform an asymptotic expansion and manage
to evaluate five terms in the expansion parameter $M_H^2/M_t^2$. A good
convergence is observed almost until $M_H\approx 2M_t$.
