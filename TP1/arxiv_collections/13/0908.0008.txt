We study the phase diagram of QCD with the help of order parameters for
chiral symmetry breaking and quark confinement. We also introduce a new order
parameter for the confinement phase transition, which is related to the quark
density. It is easily accessible by different theoretical approaches, such as
functional approaches or lattice simulations. Its relation to the Polyakov loop
expectation value is discussed and the QCD phase diagram is analysed. Our
results suggest a close relation between the chiral and the confinement phase
transition.
