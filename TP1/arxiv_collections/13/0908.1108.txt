Disk fragmentation resulting from the gravitational instability has been
proposed as an efficient mechanism for forming giant planets. We use the planet
Fomalhaut b, the triple-planetary system HR 8799, and the potential protoplanet
associated with HL Tau to test the viability of this mechanism. We choose the
above systems since they harbor planets with masses and orbital characteristics
favored by the fragmentation mechanism. We do not claim that these planets must
have formed as the result of fragmentation, rather the reverse: if planets can
form from disk fragmentation, then these systems are consistent with what we
should expect to see. We use the orbital characteristics of these recently
discovered planets, along with a new technique to more accurately determine the
disk cooling times, to place both lower and upper limits on the disk surface
density--and thus mass--required to form these objects by disk fragmentation.
Our cooling times are over an order of magnitude shorter than those of Rafikov
(2005),which makes disk fragmentation more feasible for these objects. We find
that the required mass interior to the planet's orbital radius is ~0.1 Msun for
Fomalhaut b, the protoplanet orbiting HL Tau, and the outermost planet of HR
8799. The two inner planets of HR 8799 probably could not have formed in situ
by disk fragmentation.
