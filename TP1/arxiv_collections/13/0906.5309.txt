We propose an experiment at the LHC with leading neutron production.The
latter can be used to extract from it the total $\pi^+ p$ cross-sections. With
two leading neutrons we can get access to the total $\pi^+\pi^+$
cross-sections. In this note we give some estimates and discuss related
problems and prospects.
