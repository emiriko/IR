In this report, we reply to a recent comment by Carl M. Bender, Gregorio
Benincasa and Hugh F. Jones on our work 'New ansatz for metric operator
calculation in pseudo-Hermitian field theory (Phys. Rev. D. 79, 107702 (2009)).
In fact, they figured out that there exist sign errors in our work which leaded
to the conclusion of the invalidity of the ansatz introduced in our work. Here,
we show that, the ansatz is valid in d+1 space-time dimensions, which by itself
is a new and very important result. The importance of the work comes from the
fact that it is the first time to have a metric operator for a quantum field
theory which is local in the fields as well as valid in 3+1 space-time
dimensions. Moreover, it is composed of the operators in the Hamiltonian itself
which makes the Feynmann diagram calculations for the physical amplitudes go
the same way as in conventional theories.
