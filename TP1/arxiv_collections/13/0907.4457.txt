Previous results indicated that high $p_T$ particle suppression in Au+Au
interactions is a final state effect, since R$_{dA}$ ratios were compatible
with unity, albeit within large experimental errors. It is important to test
this conclusion to higher precision since the modification of structure
functions may be involved. Recent d+Au data taken in 2008 improve the
integrated luminosity by about a factor of thirty compared to the 2003 data. A
more precise measurement of both $\pi^0$ and $\gamma$ at higher $p_T$ will shed
new light on whether the initial state in the heavy nuclei is modified.
