We report near-infrared photometric measurements of 35 Herbig Ae/Be candidate
stars obtained with direct imaging and aperture photometry. Observations were
made through the broadband J, H, and K' filters, with each source imaged in at
least one of the wavebands. We achieved subarcsecond angular resolution for all
observations, providing us with the opportunity to search for close binary
candidates and extended structure. The imaging revealed five newly identified
binary candidates and one previously resolved T Tauri binary among the target
sources with separations of <~2.5". Separate photometry is provided for each of
the binary candidate stars. We detect one extended source that has been
identified as a protoplanetary nebula. Comparing our magnitudes to past
measurements yields significant differences for some sources, possibly
indicating photometric variability. H-band finding charts for all of our
sources are provided to aid follow-up high-resolution imaging.
