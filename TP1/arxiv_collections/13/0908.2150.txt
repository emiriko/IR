We report superconducting resistive transition characteristics for array(s)
of coupled 4-Angstrom single wall carbon nanotubes embedded in
aluminophosphate-five (AFI) zeolite. The transition was observed to initiate at
15K with a slow resistance decrease switching to a sharp, order of magnitude
drop between 7.5-6.0K. The transition has strong (anisotropic) magnetic field
dependence. Differential resistance versus current (voltage) measurements
indicate that the establishment of coherence proceeds in stages as the
temperature is lowered below 15K. In particular, the sharp resistance drop and
its attendant nonlinear IV characteristics are consistent with the
manifestations of a Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition that establishes quasi
long range order in the plane transverse to the c-axis of the nanotubes,
leading to an inhomogeneous system comprising 3D superconducting regions
connected by weak links. Global coherence is established at below 5K with the
appearance of a well-defined supercurrent gap at 2K.
