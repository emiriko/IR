In this paper we consider multiple constrained resource allocation problems,
where the constraints can be specified by formulating activity dependency
restrictions or by using game-theoretic models. All the problems are focused on
generic resources, with a few exceptions which consider financial resources in
particular. The problems consider low-risk circumstances and the values of the
uncertain variables which are used by the algorithms are the expected values of
the variables. For each of the considered problems we propose novel algorithmic
solutions for computing optimal resource allocation strategies. The presented
solutions are optimal or near-optimal from the perspective of their time
complexity. The considered problems have applications in a broad range of
domains, like workflow scheduling in industry (e.g. in the mining and
metallurgical industry) or the financial sector, motion planning, facility
location and data transfer or job scheduling and resource management in Grids,
clouds or other distributed systems.
