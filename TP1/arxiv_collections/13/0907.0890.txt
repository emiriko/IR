A formalism for the construction of some classes of Gazeau$-$Klauder squeezed
states, corresponding to arbitrary solvable quantum systems with a known
discrete spectrum, are introduced. As some physical applications, the proposed
structure is applied to a few known quantum systems and then statistical
properties as well as squeezing of the obtained squeezed states are studied.
Finally, numerical results are presented.
