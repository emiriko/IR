Given integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$, with $a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n \geq 1$, a
symmetrically constrained composition $\lambda_1 + lambda_2 + ... + lambda_n =
M$ of $M$ into $n$ nonnegative parts is one that satisfies each of the the $n!$
constraints
  ${\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \lambda_{\pi(i)} \geq 0 : \pi \in S_n}$. We show how to
compute the generating function of these compositions, combining methods from
partition theory, permutation statistics, and lattice-point enumeration.
