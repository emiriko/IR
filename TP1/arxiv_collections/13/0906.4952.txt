Processes undergoing quantum mechanics, exhibit quantum interference effects.
In this case quantum probabilities result to be different from classical
probabilities because they contain an additional main point that in fact is
called the quantum interference term. We use ambiguous figures to analyse if
during perception cognition of human subjects we have violation of the
classical probability field and quantum interference. The experiments,
conducted on a group of 256 subjects, evidence that we have such quantum
effect. Therefore, mental states, during perception cognition of ambiguous
figures, follow quantum mechanics
