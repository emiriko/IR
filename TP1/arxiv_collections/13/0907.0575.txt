Using the MSX mid-infrared observation, we reveal a 100 pc-scale superbubble
surrounding the giant HII region NGC3603. We suggest that the diffuse
surrounding infrared emission in bands A, C, and D is dominated by that of PAH
and the emission in band E is dominated by that of dust grains. The fitted dust
temperature is consistent with the heating by the central cluster's UV photons.
The derived gas-to-dust mass ratio for the bubble shell is of order 10^2.
