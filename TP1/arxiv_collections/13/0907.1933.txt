In this paper we propose a closed-system perspective to study decoherence.
  From this perspective we analyze the spin-bath model as presented in the
literature, and a natural generalization of that model. On the basis of the
results obtained from that analysis, we argue that decoherence may be
understood as a phenomenon relative to the partition of a closed system,
selected in each particular case. This viewpoint frees the decoherence program
from certain conceptual difficulties derived from its open-system perspective.
We also argue that the usual picture of decoherence in terms of energy
dissipation is misguided.
