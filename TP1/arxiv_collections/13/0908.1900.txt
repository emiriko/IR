We investigate the transport properties of high-quality single-layer
graphene, epitaxially grown on a 6H-SiC(0001) substrate. We have measured
transport properties, in particular charge carrier density, mobility,
conductivity and magnetoconductance of large samples as well as
submicrometer-sized Hall bars which are entirely lying on atomically flat
substrate terraces. The results display high mobilities, independent of sample
size and a Shubnikov-de Haas effect with a Landau level spectrum of
single-layer graphene. When gated close to the Dirac point, the mobility
increases substantially, and the graphene-like quantum Hall effect occurs. This
proves that epitaxial graphene is ruled by the same pseudo-relativistic physics
observed previously in exfoliated graphene.
