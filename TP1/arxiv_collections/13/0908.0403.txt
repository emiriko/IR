The large elliptic flow observed at RHIC is considered to be evidence for
almost perfect liquid behavior of the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma
produced in the collisions. In these proceedings we present a two parameter fit
for the centrality dependence of the elliptic flow scaled by the spatial
eccentricity. We show by comparing to viscous hydrodynamical calculations that
these two parameters are in good approximation proportional to the shear
viscosity over entropy ratio and the ideal hydro limit of the ratio v2/epsilon.
