Few major commercial or economic decisions are made today which are not
underpinned by analysis using spreadsheets. It is virtually impossible to avoid
making mistakes during their drafting and some of these errors remain, unseen
and uncorrected, until something turns the spotlight on them. By then it may be
too late. The challenge is to find a way of creating spreadsheets which will
preserve the benefit of their power and flexibility while making their creation
more transparent and safer. Full documentation and documented version and
quality control, section by section, of the eventual spreadsheet would be a
bonus. And if the whole process could be made quicker, too, that would be a
further bonus.
