We calculate proton and nuclear diffractive structure functions in the IPsat
(Kowalski-Teaney) dipole model. This parametrization has previously been shown
to provide good agreement with inclusive F_2 measurements and exclusive vector
meson measurements at HERA. We discuss how the impact parameter dependence
crucially affects our analysis, in particular for small beta.
