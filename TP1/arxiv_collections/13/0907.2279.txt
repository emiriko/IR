We compare the measurement of the gravitational mass of 38 high-redshift
galaxy clusters observed by Chandra using Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND)
and standard Newtonian gravity. Our analysis confirms earlier findings that
MOND cannot explain the difference between the baryonic mass and the total mass
inferred from the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. We also find that the
baryon fraction at $r_{2500}$ using MOND is consistent with the Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) value of $\Omega_{B}/\Omega_{M}$
