Monopolar charge disorder effects are studied in the context of
fluctuation-induced interactions between neutral dielectric slabs. It is shown
that quenched bulk charge disorder gives rise to an additive contribution to
the net interaction force which decays as the inverse distance between the
slabs and may thus completely mask the standard Casimir--van der Waals force at
large separations. By contrast, annealed (bulk or surface) charge disorder
leads to a net interaction force whose large-distance behavior coincides with
the universal Casimir force between perfect conductors, which scales as inverse
cubic distance, and the dielectric properties enter only in subleading
corrections.
