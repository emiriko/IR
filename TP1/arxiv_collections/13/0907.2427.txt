Many recent results suggest that quantum theory is about information, and
that quantum theory is best understood as arising from principles concerning
information and information processing. At the same time, by far the simplest
version of quantum mechanics, Bohmian mechanics, is concerned, not with
information but with the behavior of an objective microscopic reality given by
particles and their positions. What I would like to do here is to examine
whether, and to what extent, the importance of information, observation, and
the like in quantum theory can be understood from a Bohmian perspective. I
would like to explore the hypothesis that the idea that information plays a
special role in physics naturally emerges in a Bohmian universe.
