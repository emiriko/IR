We propose procedures for testing whether stock price processes are
martingales based on limit order type betting strategies. We first show that
the null hypothesis of martingale property of a stock price process can be
tested based on the capital process of a betting strategy. In particular with
high frequency Markov type strategies we find that martingale null hypotheses
are rejected for many stock price processes.
