We give an overview on current status of the theoretical research on
Thermoelectricity for correlated materials. We derive the theoretical formulas
which become exact at low and high temperature and discuss the intermediate
temperature results. In particular, we show that within Dynamical Mean Field
Theory the low temperature sign of the thermopower is not necessary the same as
in LDA, and that significant non-universality is expected due to strong
correlations.
