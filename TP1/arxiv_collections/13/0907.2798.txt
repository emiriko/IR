We study the thermodynamics of the universe containing perfect fluid with
equation of state $p=\omega\rho,\omega$ is variable. Here we choose $\omega$ to
be a function of the red shift variable $z$ and four different choices of
$\omega$ has been investigated. Also the laws of thermodynamics are examined
considering the universe bounded by the horizon (apparent) as a thermodynamical
system.
