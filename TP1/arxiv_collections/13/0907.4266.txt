For massive gravity in a de Sitter background one encounters problems of
stability when the curvature is larger than the graviton mass. I analyze this
situation from the path integral point of view and show that it is related to
the conformal factor problem of Euclidean quantum (massless) gravity. When a
constraint for massive gravity is incorporated and the proper treatment of the
path integral measure is taken into account one finds that, for particular
choices of the DeWitt metric on the space of metrics (in fact, the same choices
as in the massless case), one obtains the opposite bound on the graviton mass.
