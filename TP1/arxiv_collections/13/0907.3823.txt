Huge amount of information is present in the World Wide Web and a large
amount is being added to it frequently. A query-specific summary of multiple
documents is very helpful to the user in this context. Currently, few systems
have been proposed for query-specific, extractive multi-document summarization.
If a summary is available for a set of documents on a given query and if a new
document is added to the corpus, generating an updated summary from the scratch
is time consuming and many a times it is not practical/possible. In this paper
we propose a solution to this problem. This is especially useful in a scenario
where the source documents are not accessible. We cleverly embed the sentences
of the current summary into the new document and then perform query-specific
summary generation on that document. Our experimental results show that the
performance of the proposed approach is good in terms of both quality and
efficiency.
