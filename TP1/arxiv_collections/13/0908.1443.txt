Super-Kamiokande has reported the results for the lepton events in the
atmospheric neutrino experiment. These results have been presented for a 22.5kT
water fiducial mass on an exposure of 1489 days, and the events are divided
into sub-GeV, multi-GeV and PC events. We present a study of nuclear medium
effects in the sub-GeV energy region of atmospheric neutrino events for the
quasielastic scattering, incoherent and coherent pion production processes, as
they give the most dominant contribution to the lepton events in this energy
region. We have used the atmospheric neutrino flux given by Honda et al. These
calculations have been done in the local density approximation. We take into
account the effect of Pauli blocking, Fermi motion, Coulomb effect,
renormalization of weak transition strengths in the nuclear medium in the case
of the quasielastic reactions. The inelastic reactions leading to production of
leptons along with pions is calculated in a $\Delta $- dominance model by
taking into account the renormalization of $\Delta$ properties in the nuclear
medium and the final state interaction effects of the outgoing pions with the
residual nucleus. We present the results for the lepton events obtained in our
model with and without nuclear medium effects, and compare them with the Monte
Carlo predictions used in the simulation and the experimentally observed events
reported by the Super-Kamiokande collaboration.
