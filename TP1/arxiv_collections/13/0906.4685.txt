The perturbation method in supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSYQM) is used
to study the spheroidal wave functions' eigenvalue problem. Expanding the
super-potential in series of the parameter alpha, the first order term of
ground eigen-value and the eigen-function are gotten. In the paper, the very
excellent results are that all the first two terms approximation on
eigenfunctions obtained are in closed form. They give useful information for
the involved physical problems in application of spheroidal wave functions.
