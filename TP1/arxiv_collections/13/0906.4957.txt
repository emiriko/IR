Many of the astrophysical sources and violent phenomena observed in our
Universe are potential emitters of gravitational waves (GWs) and high-energy
neutrinos (HENs). A network of GW detectors such as LIGO and Virgo can
determine the direction/time of GW bursts while the IceCube and ANTARES
neutrino telescopes can also provide accurate directional information for HEN
events. Requiring the consistency between both, totally independent, detection
channels shall enable new searches for cosmic events arriving from potential
common sources, of which many extra-galactic objects.
