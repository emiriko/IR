The role of color-magnetic monopoles in a pure gauge plasma at high
temperature $T>2T_c$ is considered. In this temperature regime, monopoles can
be considered heavy, rare objects embedded into matter consisting mostly of the
usual "electric" quasiparticles, quarks and gluons. The gluon-monopole
scattering is found to hardly influence thermodynamic quantities, yet it
produces a large transport cross section, significantly exceeding that for pQCD
gluon-gluon scattering up to quite high $T$. This mechanism keeps viscosity
small enough for hydrodynamics to work at LHC.
