We study the stochastic parallel dynamics of Ising spin systems defined on
finitely connected directed random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions,
using generating functional analysis. For fully asymmetric graphs the dynamics
of the system can be completely solved, due to the asymptotic absence of loops.
For arbitrary graph symmetry, we solve the dynamics exactly for the first few
time steps, and we construct approximate stationary solutions.
