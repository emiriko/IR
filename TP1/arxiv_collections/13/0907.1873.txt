It is shown that the assumptions on macroscopic quantum tunneling and on
superposition of two macroscopically distinct quantum states of superconducting
loop, considered as flux qubit by many authors, contradict to the fundamental
law of angular momentum conservation and the universally recognized quantum
formalism.
