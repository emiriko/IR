Understanding the thermodynamic function of life may shed light on its
origin. Life, as are all irreversible processes, is contingent on entropy
production. Entropy production is a measure of the rate of the tendency of
Nature to explore available microstates. The most important irreversible
process generating entropy in the biosphere, and thus facilitating this
exploration, is the absorption and transformation of sunlight into heat. Here
we hypothesize that life began, and persists today, as a catalyst for the
absorption and dissipation of sunlight at the surface of shallow seas. The
resulting heat is then efficiently harvested by other irreversible processes
such as the water cycle, hurricanes, and ocean and wind currents. RNA and DNA
are the most efficient of all known molecules for absorbing the intense
ultraviolet light that could have penetrated the dense early atmosphere, and
are remarkably rapid in transforming this light into heat in the presence of
liquid water. From this perspective, the origin and evolution of life,
inseparable from water and the water cycle, can be understood as resulting from
the natural thermodynamic imperative of increasing the entropy production of
the Earth in its interaction with its solar environment. A mechanism is
proposed for the reproduction of RNA and DNA without the need for enzymes,
promoted instead through UV light dissipation and the ambient conditions of
prebiotic Earth.
