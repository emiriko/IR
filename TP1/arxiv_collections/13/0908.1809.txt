Magnetic critical scaling in URu2-xRexSi2 single crystals continuously
evolves as the ferromagnetic critical temperature is tuned towards zero via
chemical substitution. As the quantum phase transition is approached, the
critical exponents gamma and (delta-1) decrease to zero in tandem with the
critical temperature and ordered moment, while the exponent beta remains
constant. This novel trend distinguishes URu2-xRexSi2 from stoichiometric
quantum critical ferromagnets and appears to reflect an underlying competition
between Kondo and ferromagnetic interactions.
