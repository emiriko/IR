This paper presents the delay analysis for buffered Aloha networks with
K-Exponential Backoff. Mean access delay and mean queueing delay are derived
and demonstrated via the examples of Geometric Retransmission (K=1) and
Exponential Backoff (K=infinity). The comparison shows that higher delay is
incurred with Geometric Retransmission when the aggregate input rate is small,
and the delay gap is enlarged as the number of nodes n increases. With a high
traffic input rate, however, the delay performance with Exponential Backoff
severely deteriorates. The mean queueing delay will be unbounded if the
aggregate input rate exceeds 0.3.
  We also extend the analysis to the contention-window-based backoff model
which is widely adopted in practical MAC protocols. It will be revealed that
both the retransmission-probability-based and the contention-window-based
models exhibit the same stable region and achieve similar queueing performance
in most cases, which justifies the intuition that was taken but remained
unverified in previous studies: the retransmission-probability-based backoff
model can serve as a good approximation of the contention-window-based one.
