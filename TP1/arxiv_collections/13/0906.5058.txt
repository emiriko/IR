This is a kind of essay dedicated to Lev Borisovich Okun.
  I would like to ask some questions which I can not answer. However I suspect
I know how to answer them. Questions are as follows:
  1. Particle identity. 2. Information storage. 3. Information read-out at the
speed higher than that of light.
