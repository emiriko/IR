We study theoretically charge transport properties of normal metal (N) /
ferromagnet insulator (FI) / superconductor (S) junction and S/FI/S junction
formed on the surface of three-dimensional topological insulator (TI), where
chiral Majorana mode (CMM) exists at FI/S interface. We find that CMM generated
in N/FI/S and S/FI/S junctions are very sensitively controlled by the direction
of the magnetization ${\bm m}$ in FI region. Especially, the current-phase
relation of Josephson current in S/FI/S junctions has a phase shift neither 0
nor $\pi$, which can be tuned continuously by the component of ${\bm m}$
perpendicular to the interface.
