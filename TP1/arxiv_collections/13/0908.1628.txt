Within the framework of non-local quark model of Nambu--Jona-Lasinio type the
two-photon decay of radial excited state of $\pi_0$-meson -- $\pi_0'$ -- is
found to be $3.6\KeV$. The radial excitation of pion is described with the use
of polynomial formfactor of second order over $\vec q^2$ where $\vec q$ is the
transverse momentum, which corresponds to relative motion of quark-antiquark
pair within the energy range from 0 up to $1\GeV$.
  The probabilities of production of $\pi_0'$ and $(\pi_0'+\gamma)$ states in
the electron-positron colliders are estimated. The production of $\pi_0'$-meson
in the interaction of photon with electron or muon is as well considered
(Primakoff effect). The relevant total cross sections are 0.14 or $0.06\nb$.
