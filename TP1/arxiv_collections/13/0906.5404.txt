We combine data from two high precision NASA/JPL experiments: (i) the one-way
speed of light experiment using optical fibers: Krisher T.P., Maleki L., Lutes
G.F., Primas L.E., Logan R.T., Anderson J.D. and Will C.M., Phys. Rev. D, vol
42, 731-734, 1990, and (ii) the spacecraft earth-flyby doppler shift data:
Anderson J.D., Campbell J.K., Ekelund J.E., Ellis J. and Jordan J.F., Phys.
Rev. Lett., vol 100, 091102, 2008, to give the solar-system galactic 3-space
average speed of 486km/s in the direction RA=4.29hrs, Dec=-75.0deg. Turbulence
effects (gravitational waves) are also evident. Data also reveals the 30km/s
orbital speed of the earth and the sun inflow component at 1AU of 42km/s and
also 615km/s near the sun, and for the first time, experimental measurement of
the 3-space 11.2km/s inflow of the earth. The NASA/JPL data is in remarkable
agreement with that determined in other light speed anisotropy experiments,
such as Michelson-Morley (1887), Miller (1933), Torr and Kolen (1981), DeWitte
(1991), Cahill (2006), Munera (2007), Cahill and Stokes (2008) and Cahill
(2009).
