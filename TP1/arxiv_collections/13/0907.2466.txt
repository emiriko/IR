We present simulations within the framework of scalar-tensor theories, in the
Newtonian limit, to investigate the influence of massive scalar fields on the
dynamics of the collision of two equal spherical clouds. We employ a SPH code
modified to include the scalar field to simulate two initially non-rotating
protogalaxies that approach each other, and as a result of the tidal
interaction, intrinsic angular momentum is generated. We have obtained
sufficient large values of J/M to suggest that intrinsic angular momentum can
be the result of tidal interactions.
