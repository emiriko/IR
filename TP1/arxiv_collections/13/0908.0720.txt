(Ba0.6Sr0.4)(Zr0.3Ti0.7)O3 thin films were grown on IrO2 and Pt coated Si
substrates. Film on Pt electrode showed large dielectric dispersion at lower
frequency and on other hand film on IrO2 showed dielectric constant almost
independent with frequency up to 1 MHz. Tunability (Loss) on Pt and IrO2 at 1
MHz were 55% (0.159) and 45% (0.07), respectively. The FOM is also high for
film on IrO2 (620) compared on to the Pt (345). Very low leakage current
density also obtained on IrO2 (1.3 x 10-6 A/cm2) compared to Pt (6.14x10-3
A/cm2) coated Si substrates.
