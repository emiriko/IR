Stark broadened lines of the hydrogen Brackett series are computed for the
conditions of stellar atmospheres and circumstellar envelopes. The computation
is performed within the Model Microfield Method, which includes the ion dynamic
effects and makes the bridge between the impact limit at low density and the
static limit at high density and in the line wings. The computation gives the
area normalized line shape, from the line core up to the static line wings.
