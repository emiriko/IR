Recently [arXiv:0906.5417], we reported a quantum phase transition of 103mRh
excited by bremsstrahlung pumping. The long-lived Moessbauer excitation is
delocalized as a neutral quasiparticle carrying a spin current. This letter
gives a general theory for a nuclear spin-density wave propagating on crystals
consisting of identical nuclei with a multipolar transition.
