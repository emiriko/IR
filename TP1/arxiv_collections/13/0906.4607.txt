This paper proposes the design and development of MPEG 2 Video Decoder to
offer flexible and effective utilization of bandwidth services. The decoder is
capable of decoding the MPEG 2 bit stream on a single host machine. The present
decoder is designed to be simple, but yet effectively reconstruct the video
from MPEG 2 bit stream.
