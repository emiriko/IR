We discuss short-baseline and very-short-baseline electron neutrino
disappearance at a neutrino factory. We take into account geometric effects,
such as from averaging over the decay straights, and the uncertainties of the
cross sections. We follow an approach similar to reactor experiments with two
detectors: we use two sets of near detectors at different distances to cancel
systematics. We demonstrate that such a setup is very robust with respect to
systematics, and can have excellent sensitivities to the effective mixing angle
and squared-mass splitting. In addition, we allow for CPT invariance violation,
which can be tested (depending on the parameters) up to a 0.1% level.
