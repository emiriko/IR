We present results of computing the p6 order low energy constants in the
normal part of chiral Lagrangian both for two and three flavor pseudo-scalar
mesons. This is a generalization of our previous work on calculating the p4
order coefficients of the chiral Lagrangian in terms of the quark self energy
Sigma(p2) approximately from QCD. We show that most of our results are
consistent with those we can find in the literature.
