Our Milky Way galaxy is host to a number of companions. These companions are
gravitationally bound to the Milky Way and are stellar systems in their own
right. They include a population of some 30 dwarf satellite galaxies (DSGs) and
about 150 globular clusters (GCs). Here we discuss the relationship between GCs
and DSGs using an interactive 3D model of the Milky Way.
