We describe the design and operation of a system for xenon liquefaction in
which the condenser is separated from the liquid storage vessel. The condenser
is cooled by a pulse tube cryocooler, while the vessel is cooled only by the
liquid xenon itself. This arrangement facilitates liquid particle detector
research by allowing easy access to the upper and lower flanges of the vessel.
We find that an external xenon gas pump is useful for increasing the rate at
which cooling power is delivered to the vessel, and we present measurements of
the power and efficiency of the apparatus.
