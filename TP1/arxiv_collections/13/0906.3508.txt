We study the effect of time-odd components of the Skyrme energy density
functionals on the ground state of finite nuclei and in nuclear matter. The
spin-density dependent terms, which have been recently proposed as an extension
of the standard Skyrme interaction, are shown to change the total binding
energy of odd-nuclei by only few tenths of keV, while the time-odd components
of standard Skyrme interactions give an effect that is larger by one order of
magnitude. The HFB-17 mass formula based on a Skyrme parametrization is
adjusted including the new spin-density dependent terms. A comprehensive study
of binding energies in the whole mass table of 2149 nuclei gives a root mean
square (rms) deviation of 0.575 MeV between experimental data and the
calculated results, which is slightly better than the original HFB-17 mass
formula. From the analysis of the spin instabilities of nuclear matter,
restrictions on the parameters governing the spin-density dependent terms are
evaluated. We conclude that with the extended Skyrme interaction, the Landau
parameters $G_0$ and $G_0^\prime$ could be tuned with a large flexibility
without changing the ground-state properties in nuclei and in nuclear matter.
