In this paper we introduce "hybrid" Max 2-CSP formulas consisting of "simple
clauses", namely conjunctions and disjunctions of pairs of variables, and
general 2-variable clauses, which can be any integer-valued functions of pairs
of boolean variables. This allows an algorithm to use both efficient reductions
specific to AND and OR clauses, and other powerful reductions that require the
general CSP setting. We use new reductions introduced here, and recent
reductions such as "clause-learning" and "2-reductions" generalized to our
setting's mixture of simple and general clauses.
  Parametrizing an instance by the fraction p of non-simple clauses, we give an
exact (exponential-time) algorithm that is the fastest known polynomial-space
algorithm for p=0 (which includes the well-studied Max 2-Sat problem but also
instances with arbitrary mixtures of AND and OR clauses); the only efficient
algorithm for mixtures of AND, OR, and general integer-valued clauses; and tied
for fastest for general Max 2-CSP (p=1). Since a pure 2-Sat input instance may
be transformed to a general CSP instance in the course of being solved, the
algorithm's efficiency and generality go hand in hand.
  Our algorithm analysis and optimization are a variation on the familiar
measure-and-conquer approach, resulting in an optimizing mathematical program
that is convex not merely quasi-convex, and thus can be solved efficiently and
with a certificate of optimality. We produce a family of running-time
upper-bound formulas, each optimized for instances with a particular value of p
but valid for all instances.
