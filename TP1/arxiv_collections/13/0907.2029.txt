Equations describing the evolution of particles, solitons, or localized
structures, driven by a zero-average, periodic, external force, and invariant
under time reversal and a half-period time shift, exhibit a ratchet current
when the driving force breaks these symmetries. The bi-harmonic force
$f(t)=\epsilon_1\cos(q \omega t+\phi_1)+\epsilon_2\cos(p\omega t+\phi_2)$ does
it for almost any choice of $\phi_{1}$ and $\phi_{2}$, provided $p$ and $q$ are
two co-prime integers such that $p+q$ is odd. It has been widely observed, in
experiments in Josephson-junctions, photonic crystals, etc., as well as in
simulations, that the ratchet current induced by this force has the shape
$v\propto\epsilon_1^p\epsilon_2^q\cos(p \phi_{1} - q \phi_{2} + \theta_0)$ for
small amplitudes, where $\theta_0$ depends on the damping ($\theta_0=\pi/2$ if
there is no damping, and $\theta_0=0$ for overdamped systems). We rigorously
prove that this precise shape can be obtained solely from the broken symmetries
of the system and is independent of the details of the equation describing the
system.
