Experimental studies of nucleus-nucleus collisions in the whole SPS energy
range are reviewed. Selected topics such as statistical properties of the
hadronic phase, strangeness production, fluctuations and correlations are
discussed with regard to information on the onset of deconfinement and the
critical point of strongly interacting matter. In spite of the very interesting
results obtained in particular at the low SPS energies, additional data
including rare probes such as charmed particles and di-leptons are required for
a precise understanding of the underlying physics. An outlook about prospects
and capabilities of upcoming experiments in this interesting energy region at
RHIC, SPS, and in particular with CBM at FAIR, is given.
