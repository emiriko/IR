This paper describes low-cost techniques used to collect video data in two
different tutorial classrooms - one in which the recording equipment is
permanently installed and one in which it is temporary. The author explains
what to do before, during, and after class in these two situations, providing
general strategies and technical advice for researchers interested in
videotaping tutorials or similar classrooms.
