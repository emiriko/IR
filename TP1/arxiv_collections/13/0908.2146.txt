A quantum cryptographic protocol based in public key cryptography
combinations and private key cryptography is presented. Unlike the BB84
protocol [1] and its many variants [2,3] two quantum channels are used. The
present research does not make reconciliation mechanisms of information to
derive the key. A three related system of key distribution are described.
