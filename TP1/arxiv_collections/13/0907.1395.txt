The leading order strangeness S=-3 and -4 baryon-baryon interactions are
analyzed within chiral effective field theory. The chiral potentials consist of
contact terms without derivatives and of one-pseudoscalar-meson exchanges.
Assuming SU(3) flavor symmetry those contact terms and the couplings of the
pseudoscalar mesons to the baryons are related to the corresponding quantities
of the S=-1 hyperon-nucleon channels. Specifically, the values of the pertinent
five low-energy constants related to the contact terms are already fixed from
our preceeding study of the Lambda-N and Sigma-N systems and thus genuine
predictions for the Xi-Lambda, Xi-Sigma, and Xi-Xi interactions can be made.
Strong attraction is found in some of the S=-3 and -4 channels, suggesting the
possible existence of bound states.
