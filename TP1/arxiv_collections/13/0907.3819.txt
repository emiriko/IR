The evolution of the web server contents and the emergence of new kinds of
intrusions make necessary the adaptation of the intrusion detection systems
(IDS). Nowadays, the adaptation of the IDS requires manual -- tedious and
unreactive -- actions from system administrators. In this paper, we present a
self-adaptive intrusion detection system which relies on a set of local
model-based diagnosers. The redundancy of diagnoses is exploited, online, by a
meta-diagnoser to check the consistency of computed partial diagnoses, and to
trigger the adaptation of defective diagnoser models (or signatures) in case of
inconsistency. This system is applied to the intrusion detection from a stream
of HTTP requests. Our results show that our system 1) detects intrusion
occurrences sensitively and precisely, 2) accurately self-adapts diagnoser
model, thus improving its detection accuracy.
