Axelrod model describes the dissemination of a set of cultural traits in a
society constituted by individual agents. In a social context, nevertheless,
individual choices toward a specific attitude are also at the basis of the
formation of communities, groups, parties. The membership in a group changes
completely the behavior of single agents who start acting according to a social
identity. Groups act and interact among them as single entities, but still
conserve an internal dynamics. We show that, under certain conditions on social
dynamics, the introduction of group dynamics in a cultural dissemination
process avoids the flattening of the culture on a single thought and preserve
the multiplicity of cultural attitudes. We also considered an innovation
diffusion process on this dynamical background, showing under which conditions
innovative ideas can survive in a scenario where the groups choices determine
the social structure.
