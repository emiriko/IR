MAGIC comprises two 17m diameter IACTs to be operated in stereo mode.
Currently we are commissioning the second telescope, MAGIC II. The camera of
the second telescope has been equipped with 1039 pixels of 0.1-degree diameter.
Always seven pixels are grouped in a hexagonal configuration to form a cluster.
This modular design allows easier control and maintenance of the camera. The
pixel sensors are high quantum efficiency photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) from
Hamamatsu (superbialkali type, QE ~ 32% at the peak wavelength) that we operate
at rather low gain of 30 k. This allows us to also perform extended
observations under moderate moonlight. The system of two MAGIC telescopes will
at least double the sensitivity compared to MAGIC I and also will allow us to
lower the energy threshold.Here we will report the performances of the Camera
of the second MAGIC telescope.
