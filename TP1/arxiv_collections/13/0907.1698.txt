The soft breaking of gauge or other symmetries is the typical Quantum Field
Theory phenomenon. In many cases one can apply the Stuckelberg procedure, which
means introducing some additional field (or fields) and restore the gauge
symmetry. The original softly broken theory corresponds to a particular choice
of the gauge fixing condition. In this paper we use this scheme for performing
quantum calculations for fermion-torsion theory, softly broken by the torsion
mass in arbitrary curved spacetime.
