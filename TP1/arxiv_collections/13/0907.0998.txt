We compare entanglement with quantum nonlocality employing a geometric
structure of the state space of bipartite qudits. Central object is a regular
simplex spanned by generalized Bell states. The
Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu-Bell inequality is used to reveal states of
this set that cannot be described by local-realistic theories. Optimal
measurement settings necessary to ascertain nonlocality are determined by means
of a recently proposed parameterization of the unitary group U(d) combined with
robust numerical methods. The main results of this paper are descriptive
geometric illustrations of the state space that emphasize the difference
between entanglement and quantum nonlocality. Namely, it is found that the
shape of the boundaries of separability and Bell inequality violation are
essentially different. Moreover, it is shown that also for mixtures of states
sharing the same amount of entanglement, Bell inequality violations and
entanglement measures are non-monotonically related.
