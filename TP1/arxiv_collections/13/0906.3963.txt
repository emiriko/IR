The equation of state (EOS) for neutron star (NS) crusts is studied in the
Thomas-Fermi (TF) approximation using the EOS for uniform nuclear matter
obtained by the variational method with the realistic nuclear Hamiltonian. The
parameters associated with the nuclear three-body force, which are introduced
to describe the saturation properties, are finely adjusted so that the TF
calculations for isolated atomic nuclei reproduce the experimental data on
masses and charge distributions satisfactorily. The resulting root-mean-square
deviation of the masses from the experimental data for mass-measured nuclei is
about 3 MeV. With use of the nuclear EOS thus determined, the nuclei in the
crust of NS at zero temperature are calculated. The predicted proton numbers of
the nuclei in the crust of NS are close to the gross behavior of the results by
Negele and Vautherin, while they are larger than those for the EOS by Shen et
al. due to the difference in the symmetry energy. The density profile of NS is
calculated with the constructed EOS.
