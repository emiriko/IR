In this paper, we construct four binary linear codes closely connected with
certain exponential sums over the finite field F_q and F_q-{0,1}. Here q is a
power of two. Then we obtain four recursive formulas for the power moments of
Kloosterman sums in terms of the frequencies of weights in the codes. This is
done via Pless power moment identity and by utilizing the explicit expressions
of the exponential sums obtained earlier.
