We analyze variations in the transit lightcurves of CoRoT-2b, a massive hot
Jupiter orbiting a highly active G star. We use one transit lightcurve to
eclipse-map a photospheric spot occulted by the planet. In this case study we
determine the size and longitude of the eclipsed portion of the starspot and
systematically study the corresponding uncertainties. We determine a spot
radius between $4.5\degr$ and $10.5\degr$ on the stellar surface and the spot
longitude with a precision of about $\pm 1$ degree. Given the well-known
transit geometry of the CoRoT-2 system, this implies a reliable detection of
spots on latitudes typically covered by sunspots; also regarding its size the
modelled spot is comparable to large spot groups on the Sun. We discuss the
future potential of eclipse mapping by planetary transits for the
high-resolution analysis of stellar surface features.
