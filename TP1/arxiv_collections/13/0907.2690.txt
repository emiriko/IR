The precision of cosmological parameters derived from galaxy cluster surveys
is limited by uncertainty in relating observable signals to cluster mass. We
demonstrate that a small mass-calibration follow-up program can significantly
reduce this uncertainty and improve parameter constraints, particularly when
the follow-up targets are judiciously chosen. To this end, we apply a simulated
annealing algorithm to maximize the dark energy information at fixed
observational cost, and find that optimal follow-up strategies can reduce the
observational cost required to achieve a specified precision by up to an order
of magnitude. Considering clusters selected from optical imaging in the Dark
Energy Survey, we find that approximately 200 low-redshift X-ray clusters or
massive Sunyaev-Zel'dovich clusters can improve the dark energy figure of merit
by 50%, provided that the follow-up mass measurements involve no systematic
error. In practice, the actual improvement depends on (1) the uncertainty in
the systematic error in follow-up mass measurements, which needs to be
controlled at the 5% level to avoid severe degradation of the results; and (2)
the scatter in the optical richness-mass distribution, which needs to be made
as tight as possible to improve the efficacy of follow-up observations.
