The Type IIA superstring action on the AdS_4 x CP^3 background, obtainable by
the double dimensional reduction of the AdS_4 x S^7 supermembrane, is
considered in the kappa-symmetry light-cone gauge, in which the light-like
directions are chosen on the D=3 Minkowski boundary of AdS_4. Such choice of
the gauge condition relies on representing the AdS_4 x S^7 background isometry
superalgebra osp(4|8) (and correspondingly the osp(4|6) isometry superalgebra
of the AdS_4 x CP^3 background) as D=3 extended superconformal algebra. The
gauge-fixed action includes contributions up to the 4th power in the fermions.
