In Regge calculus space time is usually approximated by a triangulation with
flat simplices. We present a formulation using simplices with constant
sectional curvature adjusted to the presence of a cosmological constant. As we
will show such a formulation allows to replace the length variables by 3d or 4d
dihedral angles as basic variables. Moreover we will introduce a first order
formulation, which in contrast to using flat simplices, does not require any
constraints. These considerations could be useful for the construction of
quantum gravity models with a cosmological constant.
