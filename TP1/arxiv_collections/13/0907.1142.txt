This work deals with the new, relativistic direction in quantum econophysics,
within the bounds of which a change of the classical paradigms in mathematical
modelling of socio-economic system is offered. Classical physics proceeds from
the hypothesis that immediate values of all the physical quantities,
characterizing system's state, exist and can be accurately measured in
principle. Non-relativistic quantum mechanics does not reject the existence of
the immediate values of the classical physical quantities, nevertheless not
each of them can be simultaneously measured (the uncertainty principle).
Relativistic quantum mechanics rejects the existence of the immediate values of
any physical quantity in principle, and consequently the notion of the system
state, including the notion of the wave function, which becomes rigorously
nondefinable.
  The task of this work consists in econophysical analysis of the conceptual
fundamentals and mathematical apparatus of the classical physics, relativity
theory, non-relativistic and relativistic quantum mechanics, subject to the
historical, psychological and philosophical aspects and modern state of the
socio-economic modeling problem. We have shown that actually and, virtually, a
long time ago, new paradigms of modeling were accepted in the quantum theory,
within the bounds of which the notion of the physical quantity operator becomes
the primary fundamental conception, description of the system dynamics becomes
discrete and approximate in its essence, prediction of the future, even in the
rough, is actually impossible when setting aside the aftereffect i.e. the
memory.
