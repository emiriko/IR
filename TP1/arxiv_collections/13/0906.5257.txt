Some models of quantum gravity can predict observable effects on the
propagation of light: most notably an energy dependent dispersion, where the
speed of light is seen to vary with the energy of the photon. As quantum
gravity effects should appear at the Planck scale they will be very small and
so require very high energy photons to travel large distances before even
becoming noticeable. Precisely because this effect is greater for the most
energetic photons (dt ~ 10 s/TeV/Gpc), ground-based gamma-ray measurements of
large AGN flares are the ideal resource for performing such tests. The modest
photon flux combined with the fact that these experiments are capable of
recording the photon times with great resolution suggests the use of unbinned
algorithms as an optimal solution for testing models of quantum gravity. In
this paper we discuss the application of a non-parametric test to such
datasets, analysing its limitations and exploring the potential benefits.
