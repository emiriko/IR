The time resolution for several single gap (2 mm) prototype Resistive Plate
Chambers (RPC) made of high resistive (bulk resistivity ~ 10^10 - 10^12 ohm
cm), 2 mm thick matt finished bakelite paper laminates with silicone coating on
the inner surfaces, has been measured. The time resolution for all the modules
has been found to be ~ 2 ns at the plateau region.
