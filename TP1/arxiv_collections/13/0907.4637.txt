The adsorption of hydrogen on the polar Zn-ended ZnO(0001) surface has been
investigated by density functional {\it ab-initio} calculations. An on top
H(1x1) ordered overlayer with genuine H-Zn chemical bonds is shown to be
energetically favorable. The H covered surface is metallic and spin-polarized,
with a noticeable magnetic moment at the surface region. Lower hydrogen
coverages lead to strengthening of the H-Zn bonds, corrugation of the surface
layer and to an insulating surface. Our results explain experimental
observations of hydrogen adsorption on this surface, and not only predict a
metal-insulator transition, but primarily provide a method to reversible switch
surface magnetism by varying the hydrogen density on the surface.
