The Fermi Large Area Telescope has provided the measurement of the high
energy (20 GeV to 1 TeV) cosmic ray electrons and positrons spectrum with
unprecedented accuracy. This measurement represents a unique probe for studying
the origin and diffusive propagation of cosmic rays as well as for looking for
possible evidences of Dark Matter. In this contribution we focus mainly on
astrophysical sources of cosmic ray electrons and positrons which include the
standard primary and secondary diffuse galactic contribution, as well as nearby
point-sources which are expected to contribute more significantly to higher
energies. In this framework, we discuss possible interpretations of Fermi
results in relation with other recent experimental data on energetic electrons
and positrons (specifically the most recent ones reported by PAMELA, ATIC,
PPB-BETS and H.E.S.S.).
