Expounded are the parameter measurement for narrow resonance and
determination of corresponding luminosity at e+e- collider. The detailed
theoretical formulas are compiled and the crucial experimental effects on
observed cross section are taken into account. For luminosity determination,
the iteration method is put forth which is mainly used to separate the
interference effect between resonance and non-resonance decays.
