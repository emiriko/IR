We will show that the same type of estimates known for the fundamental
solutions for scalar parabolic equations with smooth enough coefficients hold
for the first order derivatives of fundamental solution with respect to space
variables of scalar parabolic equations of divergence form with discontinuous
coefficients. The estimate is very important for many applications. For
example, it is important for the inverse problem identifying inclusions inside
a heat conductive medium from boundary measurements.
