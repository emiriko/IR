The unexpected features of the two-stream instability in electrostatic
quantum plasmas are interpreted in terms of the coupling of approximate fast
and slow waves. This is accomplished thanks to the factorization of the
dispersion relation into different sectors carrying positive or negative
energy. The concept of negative and positive energy waves, therefore, is useful
not only for classical, but for quantum plasmas as well.
