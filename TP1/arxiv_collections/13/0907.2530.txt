The structural and dynamical properties of four silicate liquids (silica,
rhyolite, a model basalt and enstatite) are evaluated by ab initio molecular
dynamics simulation using the density functional theory and are compared with
classical simulations using a simple empirical force field. For a given
composition, the structural parameters of the simulated melt vary little
between the two calculations (ab initio versus empirical) and are in
satisfactory agreement with structure data available in the literature. In
contrast, ionic diffusivities and atomic vibration motions are found to be more
sensitive to the details of the interactions. Furthermore, it is pointed out
that the electronic polarization, as evaluated by the ab initio calculation,
contributes significantly to the intensity of the infrared absorption spectra
of molten silicates, a spectral feature which cannot be reproduced using
nonpolarizable force field. However the vibration modes of TO4 species and some
structural details are not accurately reproduced by our ab initio calculation,
shortcomings which need to be improved in the future.
