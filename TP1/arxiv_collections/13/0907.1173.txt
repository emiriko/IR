An accurate MonteCarlo simulation of the deficit of primary cosmic rays in
the direction of the Moon has been developed to interpret the observations
reported in the TeV energy region until now. Primary particles are propagated
trough the geomagnetic field in the Earth-Moon system. The algorithm is
described and the contributions of the detector resolution and of the
geomagnetic field are disentangled.
