At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) it will become possible for the first time
to investigate experimentally the forward region in hadron-hadron collisions
via high-$p_T$ processes. In the LHC forward kinematics QCD logarithmic
corrections in the hard transverse momentum and in the large rapidity interval
may both be quantitatively significant. We analyze the hadroproduction of
forward jets in the framework of QCD high-energy factorization, which allows
one to resum consistently both kinds of corrections to higher orders in QCD
perturbation theory. We compute the short-distance matrix elements needed to
evaluate the factorization formula at fully exclusive level. We discuss
numerically dynamical features of multi-gluon emission at large angle encoded
in the factorizing high-energy amplitudes.
