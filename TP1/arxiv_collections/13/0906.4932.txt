The addendum updates the results presented in the paper `Fake Projective
Plane, Invent Math 168, 321-370 (2007)' and makes some additions and
corrections. The fake projective planes are classified into twenty six classes.
Together with a recent work of Donald Cartwright and Tim Steger, there is now a
complete list of fake projective planes. There are precisely one hundred fake
projective planes as complex surfaces classified up to biholomorphism.
