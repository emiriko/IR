Most of the research related to Non Functional Requirements (NFRs) have
presented NFRs frameworks by integrating non functional requirements with
functional requirements while we proposed that measurement of NFRs is possible
e.g. cost and performance and NFR like usability can be scaled. Our novel
hybrid approach integrates three things rather than two i.e. Functional
Requirements (FRs), Measurable NFRs (M-NFRs) and Scalable NFRs (S-NFRs). We
have also found the use of Fuzzy Logic and Likert Scale effective for handling
of discretely measurable as well as scalable NFRs as these techniques can
provide a simple way to arrive at a discrete or scalable NFR in contrast to
vague, ambiguous, imprecise, noisy or missing NFR. Our approach can act as
baseline for new NFR and aspect oriented frameworks by using all types of UML
diagrams.
