This paper considers the problem of efficiently transmitting quantum states
through a network. It has been known for some time that without additional
assumptions it is impossible to achieve this task perfectly in general --
indeed, it is impossible even for the simple butterfly network. As additional
resource we allow free classical communication between any pair of network
nodes. It is shown that perfect quantum network coding is achievable in this
model whenever classical network coding is possible over the same network when
replacing all quantum capacities by classical capacities. More precisely, it is
proved that perfect quantum network coding using free classical communication
is possible over a network with $k$ source-target pairs if there exists a
classical linear (or even vector linear) coding scheme over a finite ring. Our
proof is constructive in that we give explicit quantum coding operations for
each network node. This paper also gives an upper bound on the number of
classical communication required in terms of $k$, the maximal fan-in of any
network node, and the size of the network.
