The galaxy NGC 6946 contains a gas-star complex of 700 pc in diameter which
appears populated by tens of young stellar clusters, and a Super Star Cluster
(SSC) as massive as 10$^6$ M$\odot$. The ionized gas, as drawn by the H$\alpha$
emission, delineates an almost circular shape which we show here to be in
expansion. Previous studies have analyzed the stellar component of the complex,
as well as the structure of the atomic and ionized gas; these analyses were
restricted to the blueshifted component along the whole extent of the bubble or
to a smaller inner region where both sides of an expanding bubble were seen. In
this work we present a complete spectroscopic study of this object for two
position angles crossing each other close to the young massive SSC. We have
obtained new data with a spectral resolution six times better than previous
spectroscopic studies, taken under atmospheric conditions better than those
previously reported, allowing us to detect the approaching and receding walls
of one the largest bubbles in external galaxies ever studied in detail.
  The kinematical analysis shows a large expanding bubble, whose walls appear
to be highly structured with superposed smaller shells, likely originated as
the result of star forming events occurring at the edges of the larger scale
shell, a la Huygens. We also study some diagnostic diagrams of the ionized gas
and conclude that most of the observed ionization is originated by photons from
hot stars, but with clear evidence that some of the gas is shock ionized.
  This peculiar complex is an excellent laboratory for the analysis of the
interaction and feedback between the gas where the stars were formed and the
young and massive generation of new born stars.
