The broad emission features in the Fe-Kalpha region of X-ray binary spectra
represent an invaluable probe to constrain the geometry and the physics of
these systems. Several Low Mass X-ray binary systems (LMXBs) containing a
neutron star (NS) show broad emission features between 6 and 7 keV and most of
them are nowi nterpreted as reflection features from the inner part of an
accretion disk in analogy to those observed in the spectra of X-ray binary
systems containing a Black Hole candidate. The NS LMXB GX 349+2 was observed by
the XMM-Newton satellite which allows, thanks to its high effective area and
good spectral resolution between 6 and 7 keV, a detailed spectroscopic study of
the Fe-Kalpha region. We study the XMM data in the 0.7-10 keV energy band. The
continuum emission is modelled by a blackbody component plus a multicolored
disk blackbody. A very intense emission line at 1 keV, three broad emission
features at 2.63, 3.32, 3.9 keV and a broader emission feature in the Fe-Kalpha
region are present in the residuals. The broad emission features above 2 keV
can be equivalently well fitted with Gaussian profiles or relativistic smeared
lines (diskline in XSPEC). The Fe-Kalpha feature is better fitted using a
diskline component at 6.76 keV or two diskline components at 6.7 and 6.97 keV,
respectively. The emission features are interpreted as resonant transitions of
S xvi, Ar xviii, Ca xix, and highly ionized iron. Modelling the line profiles
with relativistic smeared lines, we find that the reflecting plasma is located
at less than 40 km from the NS, a value compatible with the inner radius of the
accretion disk inferred from the multicolored disk blackbody component ($24 \pm
7$ km). The inclination angle of GX 349+2 is between 40 and 47 deg.
