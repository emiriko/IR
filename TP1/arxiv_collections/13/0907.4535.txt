Entangled photon-pair sources based on spontaneous parametric processes are
widely used in photonic quantum information experiments. In this paper, we
clarify the relationship between average photon-pair number and the visibility
of two-photon interference (TPI) using those entanglement sources. We consider
sources that generate distinguishable and indistinguishable entangled photon
pairs, assuming coincidence measurements that use threshold detectors. We
present formulas for the TPI visibility of a polarization entanglement that
take account of all the high-order multi-pair emission events. Moreover, we
show that the formulas can be approximated with simple functions of the average
pair number when the photon collection efficiency is small. As a result, we
reveal that an indistinguishable entangled pair provides better visibility than
a distinguishable one.
