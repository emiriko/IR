We study the speed of fluctuation of a quantum system around its
thermodynamic equilibrium state, and show that the speed will be extremely
small for almost all times in typical thermodynamic cases. The setting
considered here is that of a quantum system couples to a bath, both jointly
described as a closed system. This setting, is the same as the one considered
in [N. Linden et al., Phys. Rev. E 79:061103 (2009)] and the ``thermodynamic
equilibrium state'' refers to a situation that includes the usual thermodynamic
equilibrium case, as well as far more general situations.
