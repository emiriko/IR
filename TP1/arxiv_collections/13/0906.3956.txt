With the evolution of the Internet, multicast communications seem
particularly well adapted for large scale commercial distribution applications,
for example, the pay TV channels and secure videoconferencing. Key management
for multicast remains an open topic in secure Communications today. Key
management mainly has to do with the distribution and update of keying material
during the group life. Several key tree based approach has been proposed by
various authors to create and distribute the multicast group key in effective
manner. There are different key management algorithms that facilitate efficient
distribution and rekeying of the group key. These protocols normally add
communication overhead as well as computation overhead at the group key
controller and at the group members. This paper explores the various algorithms
along with the performances and derives an improved method.
