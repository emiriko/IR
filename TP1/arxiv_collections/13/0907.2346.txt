This presentation briefly addresses three basic issues of low-energy QCD:
first, whether the Nambu-Goldstone scenario of spontaneous chiral symmetry
breaking is well established; secondly, whether there is a dynamical
entanglement of the chiral and deconfinement crossover transitions in QCD; and
thirdly, what is the status of knowledge about the phase diagram of QCD at low
temperature and non-zero baryon density. These three topics were injected as
key words into a panel discussion at the Schladming school on Challenges in
QCD. The following exposition reflects the style and character of the
discussions, with no claim of completeness.
