Free fermions with a finite Fermi surface are known to exhibit an anomalously
large entanglement entropy. The leading contribution to the entanglement
entropy of a region of linear size $L$ in $d$ spatial dimensions is $S\sim
L^{d-1} \log{L}$, a result that should be contrasted with the usual boundary
law $S \sim L^{d-1}$. This term depends only on the geometry of the Fermi
surface and on the boundary of the region in question. I give an intuitive
account of this anomalous scaling based on a low energy description of the
Fermi surface as a collection of one dimensional gapless modes. Using this
picture, I predict a violation of the boundary law in a number of other
strongly correlated systems.
