The main objective of this paper is to provide an optimized solution and
algorithm for the execution of a workflow process by ensuring the data
consistency, correctness, completeness among various tasks involved. The
solution proposed provides a synchronized and failure free flow of execution
among various tasks involved in a workflow process. A synchronizing agent is
bound at a very low level, i.e. with the workflow activity or task to get the
desired goals to be done and an algorithm is provided to show the execution of
workflow process completely.
