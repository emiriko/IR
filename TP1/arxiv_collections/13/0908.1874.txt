We examine emission from a young protostellar object (YPO) with
three-dimensional ideal MHD simulations and three-dimensional non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) line transfer calculations, and show the
first results. To calculate the emission field, we employed a snapshot result
of an MHD simulation having young bipolar outflows and a dense protostellar
disk (a young circumstellar disk) embedded in an infalling envelope.
Synthesized line emission of two molecular species (CO and SiO) show that
subthermally excited SiO lines as a high density tracer can provide a better
probe of the complex velocity field of a YPO, compared to fully thermalized CO
lines. In a YPO at the earliest stage when the outflows are still embedded in
the collapsing envelope, infall, rotation and outflow motions have similar
speeds. We find that the combined velocity field of these components introduces
a great complexity in the line emissions through varying optical thickness and
emissivity, such as asymmetric double-horn profiles. We show that the rotation
of the outflows, one of the features that characterizes an outflow driven by
magneto-centrifugal forces, appears clearly in velocity channel maps and
intensity-weighted mean velocity (first moment of velocity) maps. The somewhat
irregular morphology of the line emission at this youngest stage is dissimilar
to a more evolved object such as young Class 0. High angular resolution
observation by e.g., the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)
telescope can reveal these features.
