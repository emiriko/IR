We discuss inhomogeneous ground states of the Nambu-Jona-Lasino (NJL) and
quark-meson (QM) model within mean-field approximation and their possible
existence in the respective phase diagrams. For this purpose we focus on lower
dimensional modulations and point out that known solutions in the 2+1 and 1+1
dimensional (chiral) Gross-Neveu (GN) model can be lifted to the to the 3+1
dimensional NJL model. This is worked out in detail for one-dimensional
modulations and numerical results for the phase diagrams are presented. Focus
is put on the critical point and on vanishing temperatures. As an interesting
result the first order transition line in the phase diagram of homogeneous
phases gets replaced by an inhomogeneous phase which is bordered by two second
order transition lines.
