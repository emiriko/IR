The article continues the author's publication in [Mech. Tverd. Tela, No. 34,
2004], in which the generalizations of the Appelrot classes of the Kowalevski
top motions are found for the case of the double force field. We consider the
analogue of the 4th Appelrot class. The trajectories of this family fill the
surface which is four-dimensional in the neighborhood of its generic points.
The complete system of two integrals is pointed out. For these integrals the
bifurcation diagram is established and the admissible region for the
corresponding constants is found.
