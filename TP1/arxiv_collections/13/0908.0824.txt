A study of inclusive production of single hadrons with finite transverse
momentum in neutral current deep-inelastic scattering has been carried out.
Cross sections have been calculated using perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics
at next-to-leading order and compared to HERA data. Predictions for light
charged hadron production data were also calculated for large values of Q^2 to
show the possible effects of the Z-boson exchange.
