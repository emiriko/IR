The ground-state energy of a quantum impurity model can be calculated using
the numerical renormalization group with a modified discretization scheme, with
sufficient accuracy to reliably extract physical information about the system.
The approach is applied to study binding of magnetic adsorbates modeled by the
Anderson-Newns model for chemisorption on metal surfaces. The correlation
energy is largest in the valence-fluctuation regime; in the strong-coupling
(Kondo) regime the Kondo-singlet formation energy is found to be only a minor
contribution. As an application of the method to more difficult surface-science
problems, we study the binding energy of a magnetic atom adsorbed near a step
edge on a surface with a strongly modulated surface-state electron density. The
zero-temperature magnetic susceptibility is determined from the field
dependence of the binding energy, thereby providing an independent result for
the Kondo temperature TK, which agrees very well with the TK extracted from a
thermodynamic calculation.
