We present measurements of the branching fraction B and the longitudinal
polarization fraction fL for B0 -> a1(1260)+ a1(1260)- decays, with a1(1260)+/-
-> \pi- \pi+ \pi+/-. The data sample, collected with the detector BaBar at the
SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, represents 465 10^6 produced BBbar pairs.
We measure B(B0 -> a1(1260)+ a1(1260)-) x [B(a1(1260)+ -> \pi- \pi+ \pi+)]^2 =
(11.8 \pm 2.6 \pm 1.6) 10^{-6} and fL = 0.31 \pm 0.22 \pm 0.10, where the first
uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. The decay mode is
measured with a significance of 5.0 standard deviations including systematic
uncertainties.
