We conjecture an explicit construction of integral operators intertwining
various quantum Toda chains. Compositions of the intertwining operators provide
recursive and Q-operators for quantum Toda chains. In particular we propose a
generalization of our previous results for Toda chains corresponding to
classical Lie algebra to the generic BC_n and Inozemtsev Toda chains. We also
conjecture explicit form of Q-operators for closed Toda chains corresponding to
Lie algebras B_{\infty}, C_{\infty}, D_{\infty}, affine Lie algebras B^{(1)}_n,
C^{(1)}_n, D^{(1)}_n, D^{(2)}_n, A^{(2)}_{2n-1}, A^{(2)}_{2n} and the affine
analogs of BC_n and Inozemtsev Toda chains.
