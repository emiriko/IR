We extend the classical Damour-Ruffini method and discuss Hawking radiation
in Kerr-Newman-de Sitter(KNdS) black hole. Under the condition that the total
energy, angular momentum and charge of spacetime are conserved, taking the
reaction of the radiation of the particle to the spacetime and the relation
between the black hole event horizon and the cosmological horizon into
consideration, we derive the black hole radiation spectrum. The radiation
spectrum is no longer a pure thermal one. It is related to the change of the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy corresponding the black hole event horizon and the
cosmological horizon. It is consistent with an underlying unitary theory.
