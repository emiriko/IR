Trapped atomic ions have proven to be one of the most promising candidates
for the realization of quantum computation due to their long trapping times,
excellent coherence properties, and exquisite control of the internal atomic
states. Integrating ions (quantum memory) with photons (distance link) offers a
unique path to large-scale quantum computation and long-distance quantum
communication. In this article, we present a detailed review of the
experimental implementation of a heralded photon-mediated quantum gate between
remote ions, and the employment of this gate to perform a teleportation
protocol between two ions separated by a distance of about one meter.
