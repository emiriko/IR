We demonstrate that for a broad class of physical systems that can be
described using classical field theory, automated runtime translation of the
physical equations to parallelized finite-element numerical simulation code is
feasible. This allows the implementation of multiphysics extension modules to
popular scripting languages (such as Python) that handle the complete
specification of the physical system at script level. We discuss two example
applications that utilize this framework: the micromagnetic simulation package
"Nmag" as well as a short Python script to study morphogenesis in a
reaction-diffusion model.
