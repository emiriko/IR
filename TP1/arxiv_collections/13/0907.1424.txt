We report Raman scattering data of single crystals of magnetite (Fe3O4) with
Verwey transition temperatures (Tv) of 123 and 117K, respectively. Both single
crystals reveal broad electronic background extending up to 900 wavenumbers
(~110 meV). Redistribution of this background is observed when samples are
cooled below Tv. In particular, spectra of the low temperature phase show
diminished background below 300 wavenumbers followed by an enhancement of the
electronic background between 300 and 400 wavenumbers. To enhance the effect of
this background redistribution we divide the spectra just below the transition
by the spectra just above the transition. A resultant broad peak-like feature
is observed, centered at 370 wavenumbers (45 meV). The peak position of this
feature does not scale with the transition temperature. We discuss two
alternative assignments of this feature to a spin or charge gap in magnetite.
