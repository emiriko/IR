The 21 cm emission and absorption from gaseous halos around the first
generation of star depend on the Wouthuysen-Field (W-F) coupling, which relates
the spin temperature with the kinetic temperature of hydrogen gas via the
resonant scattering between Lyman alpha photons and neutral hydrogen. Although
the center object generally is a strong source of these photons, the transfer
of these photons in the 21 cm region is inefficient, as the optical depth of
the photons is large. Consequently, these photons from the source may not be
able to transfer to the entire 21 cm region timely to provide the W-F coupling.
This problem is important because the lifetime of first stars generally is
short. The problem is investigated with numerical solution of the
integro-differential equation, which describes the kinetics of these resonant
photons in both physical and frequency spaces. We show that the photon transfer
process in the physical space is actually coupled to that in the frequency
space. Firstly diffusion in the frequency space provides a shortcut for the
diffusion in the physical space. It makes the mean time for the escape of the
resonant photon in optical depth \tau media roughly proportional to the optical
depth \tau, not \tau^2. Secondly the resonant scattering is effective in
bouncing photons with a frequency which is not equal to initial frequency back
to the initial frequency. This process can restore initial frequency photons
and establish the local Boltzmann distribution of the photon spectrum around
the initial frequency. Therefore, the mechanism of 'escape via shortcut' plus
'bounce back' enables W-F coupling to be properly realized in the 21 cm region
around first stars. This mechanism also works for photons injected into the 21
cm region by redshift.
