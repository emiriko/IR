We consider divergence form uniformly parabolic SPDEs with bounded and
measurable leading coefficients and possibly growing lower-order coefficients
in the deterministic part of the equations. We look for solutions which are
summable to the second power with respect to the usual Lebesgue measure along
with their first derivatives with respect to the spatial variable.
