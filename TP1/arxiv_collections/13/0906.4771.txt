We show that the only irreducible three-manifold with positive first Betti
number and Heegaard Floer homology of rank two is homeomorphic to zero-framed
surgery on the trefoil. We classify links whose branched double cover gives
rise to this manifold. Together with a spectral sequence from Khovanov homology
to the Floer homology of the branched double cover, our results show that
Khovanov homology detects the unknot if and only if it detects the two
component unlink.
