This paper examines an averaging technique in which the nonlinear flux term
is expanded and the convective velocities are passed through a low-pass filter.
It is the intent that this modification to the nonlinear flux terms will result
in an inviscid regularization of the homentropic Euler equations and Euler
equations. The physical motivation for this technique is presented and a
general method is derived, which is then applied to the homentropic Euler
equations and Euler equations. These modified equations are then examined,
discovering that they share the conservative properties and traveling wave
solutions with the original equations. As the averaging is diminished it is
proven that the solutions converge to weak solutions of the original equations.
Finally, numerical simulations are conducted finding that the regularized
equations appear smooth and capture the relevant behavior in shock tube
simulations.
