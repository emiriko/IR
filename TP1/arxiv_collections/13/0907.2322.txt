We associate a noncommutative curve to a periodic, bipartite, planar dimer
model with polygonal boundary. It determines the inverse Kasteleyn matrix and
hence all correlations. It may be seen as a quantization of the limit shape
construction of Kenyon and the author in arXiv:math-ph/0507007. We also discuss
various directions in which this correspondence may be generalized.
