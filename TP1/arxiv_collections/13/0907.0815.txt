Reported are UBV and uvbybeta observations of 15 candidates for Kepler
primary astero- seismic targets and 14 other stars in the Kepler field, carried
out at the M.G. Fracastoro station of the Catania Astrophysical Observatory.
These data serve to plot the 29 stars in two-parameter diagrams with the
photometric indices (such as B-V or delta m1 and the atmospheric parameters
(such as the MK type or [Fe/H]) as coordinates. The two-parameter diagrams show
no evidence of interstellar reddening. The photometric indices B-V and beta are
then used to derive photometric effective temperatures, Teff(B-V) and
Teff(beta). For Teff(B-V) > 6400 K, the photometric effective temperatures turn
out to be systematically higher than spectroscopic effective temperatures by
311 +/- 34 K and 346 +/- 91 K for Teff(B-V) and Teff(beta), respectively. For
T_eff(B-V) < 6250 K, the agreement between Teff(B-V) and the spectroscopic
effective temperatures is very good. The photometric surface gravities, derived
from c_1 and beta, show a range of about a factor of two greater than their
spectroscopic counterparts do.
