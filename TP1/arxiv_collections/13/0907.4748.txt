We review the compelling case for establishing a capability to accelerate
positrons at Jefferson Lab. The potential appplications range from the study of
two-photon exchange and deeply-virtual Compton scattering to exploiting the
charge current weak interaction to probe the flavor structure of hadrons and
nuclei. There are also fascinating ideas for using such a capability to
discover new physics beyond the Standard Model of nuclear and particle physics.
