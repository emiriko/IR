We investigate a magnetization-dependent voltage that appears at the
interface between garnets and various metals. The voltage is even in the
applied magnetic field and is dependent on the surface roughness and the
pressure holding the surfaces together. Large variations in the size, sign and
magnetic dependence are observed between different metal surfaces. Some
patterns have been identified in the measured voltages and a simple model is
described that can accommodate the gross features. The bulk magnetoelectric
response of one of our polycrystalline YIG samples is measured and is found to
be consistent with a term in the free energy that is quadratic in both the
electric and magnetic fields. However, the presence of such a term does not
fully explain the complex magnetization dependence of the measured voltages.
