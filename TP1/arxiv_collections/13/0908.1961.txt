We utilize the novel non-Markovian quantum jump (NMQJ) approach to
stochastically simulate exciton dynamics derived from a time-convolutionless
master equation. For relevant parameters and time scales, the time-dependent,
oscillatory decoherence rates can have negative regions, a signature of
non-Markovian behavior and of the revival of coherences. This can lead to
non-Markovian population beatings for a dimer system at room temperature. We
show that strong exciton-phonon coupling to low frequency modes can
considerably modify transport properties. We observe increased exciton
transport, which can be seen as an extension of recent environment-assisted
quantum transport (ENAQT) concepts to the non-Markovian regime. Within the NMQJ
method, the Fenna-Matthew-Olson protein is investigated as a prototype for
larger photosynthetic complexes.
