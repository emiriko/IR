We investigate the scaling relations between the supermassive black holes
mass (M_bh) and the host bulge mass in elliptical galaxies, classical bulges,
and pseudo-bulges. We use two-dimensional image analysis software BUDDA to
obtain the structural parameters of 57 galaxies with dynamical M_bh
measurement, and determine the bulge K-band luminosities (L_bul,K), stellar
masses (M_s), and dynamical masses (M_d). The updated M_bh-L_bul,K, M_bh-M_s,
and M_bh-M_d correlations for elliptical galaxies and classical bulges give
M_bh~0.006M_s or 0.003M_d. The most tight relationship is log(M_bh/M_sun)=a+b
log(M_d/10^11 M_sun), with a=8.46+/-0.05, b=0.90+/-0.06, and intrinsic scatter
0.27 dex. The pseudo-bulges follow their own relations, they harbor an order of
magnitude smaller black holes than those in the same massive classical bulges,
i.e. M_bh~0.0003M_s or 0.0002M_d. Besides the M_bh-\sigma (bulge stellar
velocity dispersion) relation, these bulge type dependent M_bh-M_bul scaling
relations provide information for the growth and coevolution histories of SMBHs
and their host bulges. We also find the core elliptical galaxies obey the same
M_bh-M_d relation with other normal elliptical galaxies, that is expected in
the dissipationless merger scenario.
