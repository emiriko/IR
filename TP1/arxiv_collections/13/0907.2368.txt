We propose an energy relaxation mechanism whereby strongly correlated spin
systems decay into their ground states. The relaxation is driven by cavity
quantum electrodynamics interaction and the decay of cavity photons. It is
shown that by applying broadband driving fields, strongly correlated systems
can be cooled regardless of the specific details of their energy level profile.
The scheme would also have significant implications in other contexts, such as
adiabatic quantum computation and steady-state entanglement in dissipative
systems.
