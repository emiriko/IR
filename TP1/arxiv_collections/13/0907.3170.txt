Wide classes of nonlinear mathematical physics equations are described that
admit order reduction through the use of the Crocco transformation, with a
first-order partial derivative taken as a new independent variable and a
second-order partial derivative taken as the new dependent variable. Associated
Backlund transformations are constructed for evolution equations of general
form (special cases of which are Burgers, Korteweg-de Vries, and many other
nonlinear equations of mathematical physics). The results obtained are used for
order reduction and constructing exact solutions of hydrodynamics equations
(Navier-Stokes, Euler, and boundary layer). A number of new integrable
nonlinear equations, inclusive of the generalized Calogero equation, are
considered.
