Novel criteria for global asymptotic stability of nonlinear uncertain
finite-dimensional systems are presented. The results are obtained by a
combination of the "discretization approach" and the ideas contained in the
proof of the original Matrosov's result. The results can be used for the proof
of global asymptotic stability by using continuously differentiable, positive
definite functions which do not have a negative semi-definite derivative.
Illustrating examples are provided.
