The ground state of the spin-Peierls system TiOCl was probed using
synchrotron x-ray diffraction on a single-crystal sample at T = 6 K. We tracked
the evolution of the structural superlattice peaks associated with the
dimerized ground state as a function of pressure. The dimerization along the b
axis is rapidly suppressed in the vicinity of a first-order structural phase
transition at Pc = 13.1(1) GPa. The high-pressure phase is characterized by an
incommensurate charge density wave perpendicular to the original spin chain
direction. These results show that the electronic ground state undergoes a
fundamental change in symmetry, indicating a significant change in the
principal interactions.
