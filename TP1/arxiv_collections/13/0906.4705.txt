Modern experiments with heavy ion-leptons collisions open the possibility to
measure the deviation of cross section of small angles electron(positron)-ion
elastic scattering from the Rutherford formula due to multiple virtual photons
exchange. The charge asymmetry and the polarization of the scattered leptons
are calculated and numerical predictions are given. A generalization to elastic
proton-nucleus scattering is discussed.
