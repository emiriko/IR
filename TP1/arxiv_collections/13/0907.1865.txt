Large-scale quantum information processors must be able to transport and
maintain quantum information, and repeatedly perform logical operations. Here
we demonstrate a combination of all the fundamental elements required to
perform scalable quantum computing using qubits stored in the internal states
of trapped atomic ions. We quantify the repeatability of a multi-qubit
operation, observing no loss of performance despite qubit transport over
macroscopic distances. Key to these results is the use of different pairs of
beryllium ion hyperfine states for robust qubit storage, readout and gates, and
simultaneous trapping of magnesium re-cooling ions along with the qubit ions.
