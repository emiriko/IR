This is a supplementary material of our recent paper\cite{yangPRB}, where a
class of exactly solvable S=1 quantum Ising spin models were studied based on
the hole decomposition scheme. Here we provide some details for the Green
functions, the spin-spin correlation functions, as well as the spin
susceptibility in the presence of dimerization.
