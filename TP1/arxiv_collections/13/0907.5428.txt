A novel organometallic compound 2Dioxane.CuCl2.2H2O has been synthesized and
structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography. Magnetic susceptibility
and zero-field inelastic neutron scattering have also been used to study its
magnetic properties. It turns out that this material is a weakly coupled
one-dimensional S=1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain system with chain
direction along the crystallographic c axis and the nearest-neighbor
intra-chain exchange constant J=0.85(4) meV. The next-nearest-neighbor
inter-chain exchange constant J' is also estimated to be 0.05 meV. The observed
magnetic excitation spectrum from inelastic neutron scattering is in excellent
agreement with numerical calculations based on the Muller ansatz.
