High-dispersion spectra centered on the Li 6708 A line have been obtained for
70 potential members of the open cluster NGC 3680, with an emphasis on stars in
the turnoff region. A measurable Li abundance has been derived for 53 stars, 39
of which have radial velocities and proper motions consistent with cluster
membership. After being transferred to common temperature and abundance scales,
previous Li estimates have been combined to generate a sample of 49 members, 40
of which bracket the cluster Li-dip. Spectroscopic elemental analysis of 8
giants and 5 turnoff stars produces [Fe/H] = -0.17 +/- 0.07 (sd) and -0.07 +/-
0.02 (sd), respectively. We also report measurements of Ca, Si and Ni which are
consistent with scaled-solar ratios within the errors. Adopting [Fe/H] = -0.08
(Sect. 3.6), Y^2 isochrone comparisons lead to an age of 1.75 +/- 0.10 Gyr and
an apparent modulus of (m-M) = 10.30 +/- 0.15 for the cluster, placing the
center of the Li-dip at 1.35 +/- 0.03 solar masses. Among the giants, 5 of 9
cluster members are now known to have measurable Li with A(Li) near 1.0. A
combined sample of dwarfs in the Hyades and Praesepe is used to delineate the
Li-dip profile at 0.7 Gyr and [Fe/H] = +0.15, establishing its center at 1.42
+/- 0.02 solar masses and noting the possible existence of secondary dip on its
red boundary. When evolved to the typical age of the clusters NGC 752, IC 4651
and NGC 3680, the Hyades/Praesepe Li-dip profile reproduces the observed
morphology of the combined Li-dip within the CMD's of the intermediate-age
clusters while implying a metallicity dependence for the central mass of the
Li-dip given by Mass = (1.38 +/-0.04) + (0.4 +/- 0.2)[Fe/H]. The implications
of the similarity of the Li-dichotomy among giants in NGC 752 and IC 4651 and
the disagreement with the pattern among NGC 3680 giants are discussed.
