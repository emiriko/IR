The first two authors have shown [KK99,KK00] that the sum the exponent (and
thus the number) of maximal repetitions of exponent at least 2 (also called
runs) is linear in the length of the word. The exponent 2 in the definition of
a run may seem arbitrary. In this paper, we consider maximal repetitions of
exponent strictly greater than 1.
