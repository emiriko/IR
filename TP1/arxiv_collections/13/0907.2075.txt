Medical image registration is a difficult problem. Not only a registration
algorithm needs to capture both large and small scale image deformations, it
also has to deal with global and local image intensity variations. In this
paper we describe a new multiresolution elastic image registration method that
challenges these difficulties in image registration. To capture large and small
scale image deformations, we use both global and local affine transformation
algorithms. To address global and local image intensity variations, we apply an
image intensity standardization algorithm to correct image intensity
variations. This transforms image intensities into a standard intensity scale,
which allows highly accurate registration of medical images.
