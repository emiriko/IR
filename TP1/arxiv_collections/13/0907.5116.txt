Geometric phases arise in a number of physical situations and often lead to
systematic shifts in frequencies or phases measured in precision experiments.
We describe, by working through some simple examples, a method to calculate
geometric phases that relies only on standard quantum mechanical calculations
of energy level shifts. This connection between geometric phases and
off-resonant energy shifts simplifies calculation of the effect in certain
situations. More generally, it also provides a way to understand and calculate
geometric phases without recourse to topology.
