We describe a 4.85 GHz survey of bright, flat-spectrum radio sources
conducted with the Effelsberg 100 m telescope in an attempt to improve the
completeness of existing surveys, such as CRATES. We report the results of
these observations and of follow-up 8.4 GHz observations with the VLA of a
subset of the sample. We comment on the connection to the WMAP point source
catalog and on the survey's effectiveness at supplementing the CRATES sky
coverage.
