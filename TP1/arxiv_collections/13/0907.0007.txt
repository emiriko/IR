This paper reviews the basic technical characteristics of the ground-based
photometric searches for transiting planets, and discusses a possible
observational selection effect. I suggest that additional photometric
observations of the already observed fields might discover new transiting
planets with periods around 4-6 days. The set of known transiting planets
support the intriguing correlation between the planetary mass and the orbital
period suggested already in 2005.
