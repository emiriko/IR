A parameter estimation problem is considered for a linear stochastic
hyperbolic equation driven by additive space-time Gaussian white noise. The
damping/amplification operator is allowed to be unbounded.
  The estimator is of spectral type and utilizes a finite number of the spatial
Fourier coefficients of the solution. The asymptotic properties of the
estimator are studied as the number of the Fourier coefficients increases,
while the observation time and the noise intensity are fixed.
