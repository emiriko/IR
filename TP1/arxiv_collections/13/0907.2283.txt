NGC 4636, an X-ray bright elliptical galaxy, was observed for 70 ks with
Suzaku. The low background and good energy resolution of the XIS enable us to
estimate the foreground Galactic emission accurately and hence measure, for the
first time, the O, Mg, Si and Fe abundances out to a radius of ~28 arcmin
($\simeq$ 140 kpc). These metal abundances are as high as $>$1 solar within the
central 4' and decrease by ~50% towards the outer regions. Further, the O to Fe
abundance ratio is about 0.60--1.0 solar in all regions analyzed, indicating
that the products of both SNe II and SNe Ia have mixed and diffused to the
outer regions of the galaxy. The O and Fe metal mass-to-light-ratios (MLR) of
NGC 4636 are 2--3 times larger than those of NGC 1399 implying that metal
distributions in NGC 4636 are less extended than those in NGC 1399, possibly
due to environmental factors, such as frequency of galaxy interaction. We also
found that the MLRs of NGC 4636 at 0.1 $r_{180}$ are $\sim$5 times smaller than
those of clusters of galaxies, possibly consistent with the correlation between
temperature and MLR of other spherically symmetric groups of galaxies. We also
confirmed a resonant scattering signature in the Fe$_{XV II}}$ line in the
central region, as previously reported using the XMM-Newton RGS.
