Decay-frame Kinematics (DK) has previously been introduced as a technique to
reconstruct neutralino masses from their three-body decays to leptons. This
work is an extension to the case of two-body decays through on-shell sleptons,
with Monte Carlo simulation of LHC collisions demonstrating reconstruction of
neutralino masses for the SPS1a benchmark point.
