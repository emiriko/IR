We propose an unified model of dark matter and baryon asymmetry in a
lepto-philic world above the electroweak scale. We provide an example where the
inflaton decay products subsequently generate a lepton asymmetry and a dark
matter abundance with an unique coupling in the early universe, while the
present day decay of the dark matter through the same coupling gives rise the
observed cosmic ray anomalies at PAMELA and Fermi Large Area Telescope.
