The VERITAS array of 12-m atmospheric-Cherenkov telescopes in southern
Arizona is currently the world's most-sensitive detector of astrophysical very
high energy (VHE; E>100 GeV) gamma rays. Approximately 25 blazars are known to
emit VHE photons, and observations of blazars are one of the VERITAS
collaboration's key science projects (KSP). More than 50 of these objects have
been observed with the array, in most cases with the deepest-ever VHE exposure.
This contribution summarizes the VERITAS blazar KSP, with a focus on the upper
limits measured in the blazar discovery program. VERITAS blazar detections are
presented in detail elsewhere in these proceedings.
