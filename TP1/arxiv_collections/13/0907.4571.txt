Direct photon-hadron correlations greatly improve our ability to perform jet
tomography in heavy-ion collisions because the momentum of the direct photon
can be used to constrain the initial momentum of the opposing jet. By comparing
the spectrum of away-side hadrons observed in heavy ion collisions to the
spectrum seen in nucleon collisions we can quantify the medium modification to
the fragmentation function due to energy loss of the away-side parton.
  High $p_{T}$ direct photon-hadron correlations have been measured with the
PHENIX detector using a statistical subtraction method to remove the photon
contribution from meson decays. The increased integrated luminosity in the most
recent Au+Au RHIC run at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV provides substantially
improved statistical precision and enhances the kinematic reach. These
measurements are compared to PHENIX p+p results and several theoretical models
of energy loss. In addition, we compare direct photon-hadron and
$\pi^{0}$-hadron correlations.
