We report on a recent chiral extrapolation, based on an SU(3) framework, of
octet baryon masses calculated in 2+1-flavour lattice QCD. Here we further
clarify the form of the extrapolation, the estimation of the infinite-volume
limit, the extracted low-energy constants and the corrections in the
strange-quark mass.
