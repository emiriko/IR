We report on double-differential inclusive cross-sections of the production
of secondary protons, charged pions, and deuterons, in the interactions with a
5% nuclear interaction length thick stationary copper target, of proton and
pion beams with momentum from +/-3 GeV/c to +/-15 GeV/c. Results are given for
secondary particles with production angles between 20 and 125 degrees.
