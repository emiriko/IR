A good computer network is hard to disrupt. It is desired that the computer
communication network remains connected even when some of the links or nodes
fail. Since the communication links are expensive, one wants to achieve these
goals with fewer links. The computer communication network is fault tolerant if
it has alternative paths between vertices, the more disjoint paths, the better
is the survivability. This paper presents a method for generating k-connected
computer communication network with optimal number of links using bipartite
graph concept.
