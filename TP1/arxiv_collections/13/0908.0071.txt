We calculate the shot noise power in ballistic graphene using the kinetic
equation approach based on the Keldysh technique. We find that the local energy
distribution function obeys Poisson's equation, indicating a mapping into a
diffusive metal system. We derive the conductance and noise including the long
range Coulomb interaction to first order. We find that the shot noise increases
due to interaction, leading to a frequency dependence. Furthermore, we find
that the Fano factor at degeneracy is 1/3, the same as without the Coulomb
interaction.
