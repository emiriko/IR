We exhibit a mapping identifying Kitaev's quantum double lattice models
explicitly as a subclass of Levin and Wen's string net models via a completion
of the local Hilbert spaces with auxiliary degrees of freedom. This
identification allows to carry over to these string net models the
representation-theoretic classification of the excitations in quantum double
models, as well as define them in arbitrary lattices, and provides an
illustration of the abstract notion of Morita equivalence. The possibility of
generalising the map to broader classes of string nets is considered.
