We present an alternative to the Kohn-Sham formulation of density functional
theory for the ground-state properties of strongly interacting electronic
systems. The idea is to start from the limit of zero kinetic energy and
systematically expand the universal energy functional of the density in powers
of a "coupling constant" that controls the magnitude of the kinetic energy. The
problem of minimizing the energy is reduced to the solution of a strictly
correlated electron problem in the presence of an effective potential, which
plays in our theory the same role that the Kohn-Sham potential plays in the
traditional formulation. We discuss several schemes for approximating the
energy functional, and report preliminary results for low-density quantum dots.
