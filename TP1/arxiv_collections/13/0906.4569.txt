We report Raman scattering spectra of iron-pnictide superconductor
Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ single crystals with varying cobalt $x$ content.
Upon cooling through the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic transition, we observe a
large splitting of the E$_g$ in-plane phonon modes involving Fe and As
displacements. The splitting of the in-plane phonons at the transition is
strongly reduced upon doping and disappears for $x=0.06$ qualitatively
following the trend displayed by the Fe magnetic moment. The origin of the
splitting is discussed in terms of magnetic frustration inherent to
iron-pnictide systems and we argue that such enhanced splitting may be linked
to strong spin-phonon coupling.
