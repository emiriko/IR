We report on the successful implementation of a new approach to locking the
frequencies of an OPO-based squeezed-vacuum source and its driving laser. The
technique allows the simultaneous measurement of the phase-shifts induced by a
cavity, which may be used for the purposes of frequency-locking, as well as the
simultaneous measurement of the sub-quantum-noise-limited (sub-QNL) phase
quadrature output of the OPO. The homodyne locking technique is cheap, easy to
implement and has the distinct advantage that subsequent homodyne measurements
are automatically phase-locked. The homodyne locking technique is also unique
in that it is a sub-QNL frequency discriminator.
