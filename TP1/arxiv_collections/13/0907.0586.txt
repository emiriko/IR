Wide classes of nonlinear mathematical physics equations are described that
admit order reduction through the use of the von Mises transformation, with the
unknown function taken as the new independent variable and an appropriate
partial derivative taken as the new dependent variable. RF-pairs and associated
B\"acklund transformations are constructed for evolution equations of general
form (special cases of which are Burgers, Korteweg--de Vries, and Harry Dym
type equations as well as many other nonlinear equations of mathematical
physics). The results obtained are used for order reduction and constructing
exact solutions of hydrodynamics equations. A generalized Calogero equation and
a number of other new integrable nonlinear equations are considered.
