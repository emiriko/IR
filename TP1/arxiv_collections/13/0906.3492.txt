The celebrated upper bound theorem of McMullen determines the maximal number
of extreme points of a polyhedron in terms of its dimension and the number of
constraints which define it, showing that the maximum is attained by the polar
of the cyclic polytope. We show that the same bound is valid in the tropical
setting, up to a trivial modification. Then, we study the natural candidates to
be the maximizing polyhedra, which are the polars of a family of cyclic
polytopes equipped with a sign pattern. We construct bijections between the
extreme points of these polars and lattice paths depending on the sign pattern,
from which we deduce explicit bounds for the number of extreme points, showing
in particular that the upper bound is asymptotically tight as the dimension
tends to infinity, keeping the number of constraints fixed. When transposed to
the classical case, the previous constructions yield some lattice path
generalizations of Gale's evenness criterion.
