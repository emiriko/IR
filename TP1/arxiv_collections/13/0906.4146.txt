Recently Sagawa and Ueda [Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 080403 (2008)] derived a
bound on the work that can be extracted from a quantum system with the use of
feedback control. They left open the question of whether this bound could be
achieved for every measurement that could be made by the controller. We show
that it can, and that this follows straightforwardly from recent work on
Maxwell's demon by Alicki et al. [Open Syst. Inform. Dynam. 11, 205 (2004)],
for both discrete and continuous feedback control. Our analysis also shows that
bare, efficient measurements always do non-negative work on a system in
equilibrium, but do not add heat.
