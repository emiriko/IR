This work reports a study of the nonlinear Hall Effect (HE) in the
semimetallic ferromagnet EuB6. A distinct switch in its Hall resistivity slope
is observed in the paramagnetic phase, which occurs at a single critical
magnetization over a wide temperature range. The observation is interpreted as
the point of percolation for entities of a more conducting and magnetically
ordered phase in a less ordered background. With an increasing applied magnetic
field, the conducting regions either increase in number or expand beyond the
percolation limit, hence increasing the global conductivity and effective
carrier density. An empirical two-component model expression provides excellent
scaling and a quantitative fit to the HE data and may be applicable to other
correlated electron systems.
