We show that single-component fermionic polar molecules confined to a 2D
geometry and dressed by a microwave field, may acquire an attractive $1/r^3$
dipole-dipole interaction leading to superfluid p-wave pairing at sufficiently
low temperatures even in the BCS regime. The emerging state is the topological
$p_x+ip_y$ phase promising for topologically protected quantum information
processing. The main decay channel is via collisional transitions to dressed
states with lower energies and is rather slow, setting a lifetime of the order
of seconds at 2D densities $\sim 10^8$ cm$^{-2}$.
