The issue of duplicate publications has received a lot of attention in the
medical literature, but much less in the information science community. This
paper aims at analyzing the prevalence and scientific impact of duplicate
publications across all fields of research between 1980 and 2007, using a
definition of duplicate papers based on their metadata. It shows that in all
fields combined, the prevalence of duplicates is one out of two-thousand
papers, but is higher in the natural and medical sciences than in the social
sciences and humanities. A very high proportion (>85%) of these papers are
published the same year or one year apart, which suggest that most duplicate
papers were submitted simultaneously. Furthermore, duplicate papers are
generally published in journals with impact factors below the average of their
field and obtain a lower number of citations. This paper provides clear
evidence that the prevalence of duplicate papers is low and, more importantly,
that the scientific impact of such papers is below average.
