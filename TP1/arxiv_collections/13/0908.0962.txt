The purpose of this work is to image solar far-side active regions using
acoustic signals with three skips and improve the quality of existing images.
The mapping of far-side active regions was first made possible using the
helioseismic holography technique by use of four-skip acoustic signals. The
quality of far-side images was later improved with the combination of four- and
five-skip signals using the time-distance helioseismology technique. In this
work, we explore the possibility of making three-skip far-side images of active
regions, and improving the image quality by combining the three-skip images
with the images obtained from existing techniques. A new method of combining
images is proposed that increases the signal-to-noise ratio and reduces the
appearance of spurious features.
