We report on the results of spectral fits made to data obtained from a 168
ksec Suzaku observation of the Seyfert-1 galaxy Fairall 9. The source is
clearly detected out to 30 keV. The observed spectrum is fairly simple; it is
well-described by a power-law with a soft excess and disk reflection. A broad
iron line is detected, and easily separated from distinct narrow components
owing to the resolution of the CCDs in the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS).
The broad line is revealed to be asymmetric, consistent with a disk origin. We
fit the XIS and Hard X-ray Detector (HXD) spectra with relativistically-blurred
disk reflection models. With the assumption that the inner disk extends to the
innermost stable circular orbit, the best-fit model implies a black hole spin
parameter of a = 0.60(7) and excludes extremal values at a high level of
confidence. We discuss this result in the context of Seyfert observations and
models of the cosmic distribution of black hole spin.
