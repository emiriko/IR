We present wide-field imaging and polarimetry at 20GHz of seven of the most
extended, bright (Stot >= 0.50 Jy), high-frequency selected radio sources in
the southern sky with declinations < -30 deg. Accompanying the data are brief
reviews of the literature for each source, The results presented here aid in
the statistical completeness of the Australia Telescope 20GHz Survey's bright
source sample. The data are of crucial interest for future cosmic microwave
background missions as a collection of information about candidate calibrator
sources. We are able to obtain data for seven of the nine sources identified by
our selection criteria. We report that Pictor A is thus far the best
extragalactic calibrator candidate for the Low Frequency Instrument of the
Planck European Space Agency mission due to its high level of integrated
polarized flux density (0.50+/-0.06 Jy) on a scale of 10 arcmin. Six of the
seven sources have a clearly detected compact radio core, with either a null or
less than two percent detection of polarized emission from the nucleus. Most
sources with detected jets have magnetic field alignments running in a
longitudinal configuration, however PKS1333-33 exhibits transverse fields and
an orthogonal change in field geometry from nucleus to jets.
