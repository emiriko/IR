Recent measurements of nucleon resonance transition form factors with CLAS at
Jefferson Lab are discussed. The new data confirm the assertion of the
symmetric constituent quark model of the Roper as the first radial excitation
of the nucleon. For the first time, the longitudinal transition amplitude to
the S11(1535) was extracted from the data. New results on the transition
amplitudes for the D13(1520) resonance are presented showing a rapid transition
from helicity 3/2 dominance seen at the real photon point to helicity 1/2
dominance at higher Q2. I also discuss aspects of the JLab program to search
for new excited nucleon states predicted by quark models.
