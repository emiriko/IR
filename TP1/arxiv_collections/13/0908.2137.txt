A distance is found for the W UMa type binary U Pegasi, with a newly modified
version of the Wilson-Devinney program (W-D) that makes use of the direct
distance estimation (DDE) algorithm. The reported distance of d = 123.6pc is an
average based on solutions for B and V data and a primary star temperature of
5800K. Standardized light curves (not differential), radial velocities, and a
spectroscopic primary star temperature are input to the pro- gram. Differential
corrections were performed for each light curve band along with the velocities
for two primary temperatures that span 100K. Log10d is a model parameter like
many others that are adjustable in W-D. The eclipsing binary distance agrees
with the Hipparcos parallax distance and is more precise.
