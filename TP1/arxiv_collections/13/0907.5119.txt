Improving the previously known best bound, we show that any recursively
enumerable language can be generated with a non-returning parallel
communicating (PC) grammar system having six context-free components. We also
present a non-returning universal PC grammar system generating unary languages,
that is, a system where not only the number of components, but also the number
of productions and the number of nonterminals are limited by certain constants,
and these size parameters do not depend on the generated language.
