In this paper we investigate the quantum phase properties for the coherent
superposition states (Schr\"odinger-cat states) for two-mode multiphoton
Jaynes-Cummings model in the framework of the Pegg-Barnett formalism. We also
demonstrate the behavior of the Wigner ($W$) function at the phase space
origin. We obtain many interesting results such as there is a clear
relationship between the revival-collapse phenomenon occurring in the atomic
inversion (as well as in the evolution of the $W$ function) and the behavior of
the phase distribution of both the single-mode and two-mode cases. Furthermore,
we find that the phase variances of the single-mode case can exhibit
revival-collapse phenomenon about the long-time behavior. We show that such
behavior occurs for interaction time several times smaller than that of the
single-mode Jaynes-Cummings model.
