We present a theoretical framework for formal study of systematic effects in
Supernovae Type Ia (SN Ia) that utilizes 2-d simulations to implement a form of
the deflagration-detonation transition (DDT) explosion scenario. The framework
is developed from a randomized initial condition that leads to a sample of
simulated SN Ia whose Ni56 masses have a similar average and range to those
observed, and have many other modestly realistic features such as the velocity
extent of intermediate mass elements. The intended purpose is to enable
statistically well-defined studies of both physical and theoretical parameters
of the SN Ia explosion simulation. We present here a thorough description of
the outcome of the SN Ia explosions produced by our current simulations. A
first application of this framework is utilized to study the dependence of the
SN Ia on the Ne22 content, which is known to be directly influenced by the
progenitor stellar population's metallicity. Our study is very specifically
tailored to measure how the Ne22 content influences the competition between the
rise of plumes of burned material and the expansion of the star before these
plumes reach DDT conditions. This competition controls the amount of material
in nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE) and therefore Ni56 produced by setting
the density at which nucleosynthesis takes place during the detonation phase of
the explosion. Although the outcome following from any particular ignition
condition can change dramatically with Ne22 content, with a sample of 20
ignition conditions we find that the systematic change in the expansion of the
star prior to detonation is not large enough to compete with the dependence on
initial neutron excess discussed by Timmes, Brown & Truran (2003). (Abridged)
