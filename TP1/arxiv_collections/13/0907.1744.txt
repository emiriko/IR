Two-phase superconductor tapes were produced by blending high purity
magnesium diboride powder with a liquid ethylcellulose-based polymeric binder.
This procedure produced a material which is easily formable with a high
superconducting transition temperature (38K). We show that the bulk
superconducting properties are not affected by the presence of the binder, nor
is there any evidence of a chemical reaction between the superconducting
particles and the binder. However, the transport properties of the material are
strongly affected by the presence of the binder, which leads to a seven order
of magnitude increase of the normal state resistance along with a seven order
of magnitude decrease of the transport critical current density. This new
material is shown to be equivalent to a system of coupled Josephson junctions.
