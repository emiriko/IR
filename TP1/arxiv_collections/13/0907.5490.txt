We have developed a contact-free 2-dimensional laser sensor with which the
position of wires can be measured in 3 dimensions with an accuracy of better
than 10 micrometer and with which the tension of the wires can be determined
with an accuracy of 0.04 N. These measurements can be made from a distance of
15 cm. The sensor consists of commercially available laser pointers, lenses,
color filters and photodiodes. In our application we have used this laser
sensor together with an automated 3 dimensional coordinate table. For a single
position measurement, the laser sensor is moved by the 3-dimensional coordinate
table in a plane and determines the coordinates at which the wires intersect
with this plane. The position of the plane itself (the third coordinate) is
given by the third axis of the measurement table which is perpendicular to this
plane. The control and readout of the table and the readout of the laser sensor
were realized with LabVIEW. The precision of the position measurement in the
plane was determined with wires of 0.2 mm and 0.3 mm diameter. We use the
sensor for the quality assurance of the wire electrode modules for the KATRIN
neutrino mass experiment. We expect that the precision is at least comparable
or better if the wires are thinner. Such a device could be well suited for the
measurement of wire chamber geometries even with more than one wire layer.
