We have observed optical birefringence in liquids induced by single-cycle THz
pulses with field strengths exceeding 100 kV/cm. The induced change in
polarization is proportional to the square of the THz electric field. The
time-dependent THz Kerr signal is composed of a fast electronic response that
follows the individual cycles of the electric field and a slow exponential
response associated with molecular orientation.
