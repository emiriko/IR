We calculate the conductance of tubular-shaped nanowires having many
potential scatterers at random positions. Our approach is based on the
scattering matrix formalism and our results analyzed within the scaling theory
of disordered conductors. When increasing the energy the conductance for a big
enough number of impurities in the tube manifests a systematic evolution from
the localized to the metallic regimes. Nevertheless, a conspicuous drop in
conductance is predicted whenever a new transverse channel is open. Comparison
with the semiclassical calculation leading to purely ohmic behavior is made.
