Kantor and Trishin described the algebra of polynomial invariants of the
adjoint representation of the Lie supergalgebra $gl(m|n)$ and a related algebra
$A_s$ of what they called pseudosymmetric polynomials over an algebraically
closed field $K$ of characteristic zero. The algebra $A_s$ was investigated
earlier by Stembridge who called the elements of $A_s$ supersymmetric
polynomials and determined generators of $A_s$. The case of positive
characteristic $p$ has been recently investigated by La Scala and Zubkov. They
formulated two conjectures describing generators of polynomial invariants of
the adjoint action of the general linear supergroup $GL(m|n)$ and generators of
$A_s$, respectively. In the present paper we prove both conjectures.
