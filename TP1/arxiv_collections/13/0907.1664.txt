Stratum corneum, the outermost layer of skin, consists of keratin filled
rigid non-viable corneocyte cells surrounded by multilayers of lipids. The
lipid layer is responsible for the barrier properties of the skin. We calculate
the excess chemical potential and diffusivity of water as a function of depth
in lipid bilayers with compositions representative of the stratum corneum using
atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. The maximum in the excess free energy
of water inside the lipid bilayers is found to be twice that of water in
phospholipid bilayers at the same temperature. Permeability, which decreases
exponentially with the free energy barrier, is reduced by several orders of
magnitude as compared to with phospholipid bilayers. The average time it takes
for a water molecule to cross the bilayer is calculated by solving the
Smoluchowski equation in presence of the free energy barrier. For a bilayer
composed of a 2:2:1 molar ratio of ceramide NS 24:0, cholesterol and free fatty
acid 24:0 at 300K, we estimate the permeability P=3.7e-9 cm/s and the average
crossing time \tau_{av}=0.69 ms. The permeability is about 30 times smaller
than existing experimental results on mammalian skin sections.
