X-ray monitoring observations were performed with the Swift observatory of
the ultraluminous X-ray sources Holmberg IX X-1, NGC 5408 X-1, and NGC 4395 X-2
and also of the nuclear X-ray source in NGC 4395. Holmberg IX X-1 remains in
the hard X-ray spectral state as its flux varies by a factor of 7 up to an
(isotropic) luminosity of 2.8E40 erg/s. This behavior may suggest an unusually
massive compact object. We find excess power at periods near 60 days and 28
days in the X-ray emission from Holmberg IX X-1. Additional monitoring is
required to test the significance of these signals. NGC 5408 X-1 and NGC 4395
X-2 appear to remain in the soft spectral state found by Chandra and XMM with
little variation in spectral hardness even as the luminosity changes by a
factor of 9. We found an outburst from the nuclear source in NGC 4395 reaching
an X-ray luminosity of 9E40 erg/s, several times higher than any previously
reported.
