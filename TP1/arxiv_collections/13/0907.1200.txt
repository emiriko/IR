We propose to probe the quantum ground state of a spin-1 Bose-Einstein
condensate with the transmission spectra of an optical cavity. By choosing a
circularly polarized cavity mode with an appropriate frequency, we can realize
coupling between the cavity mode and the magnetization of the condensate. The
cavity transmission spectra then contain information of the magnetization
statistics of the condensate and thus can be used to distinguish the
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic quantum ground states. This technique may
also be useful for continuous observation of the spin dynamics of a spinor
Bose-Einstein condensate.
