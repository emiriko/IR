The periodic events occurring in Eta Carinae have been widely monitored
during the last three 5.5-year cycles. The last one recently occurred in
January 2009 and more exhaustive observations have been made at different
wavelength ranges. If these events are produced when the binary components
approach periastron, the timing and sampling of the photometric features can
provide more information about the geometry and physics of the system. Thus, we
continued with our ground-based optical photometric campaign started in 2003 to
record the behaviour of the 2009.0 event in detail. This time the observation
program included a new telescope to obtain information from other photometric
bands. The daily monitoring consists of the acquisition of CCD images through
standard UBVRI filters and a narrow Halpha passband. The subsequent
differential photometry includes the central region of the object and the whole
Homunculus nebula. The results of our relative UBVRIHalpha photometry,
performed from November 2008 up to the end of March 2009, are presented in this
work, which comprises the totality of the event. The initial rising branch, the
maximum, the dip to the minimum and the recovering rising phase strongly
resemble a kind of eclipse. All these features happened on time - according to
that predicted - although there are some photometric differences in comparison
with the previous event. We made a new determination of 2022.8 days for the
period value using the present and previous "eclipse-like" event data. These
results strongly support the binarity hypothesis for Eta Car. In this paper,
the complete dataset with the photometry of the 2009.0 event is provided to
make it readily available for further analysis.
