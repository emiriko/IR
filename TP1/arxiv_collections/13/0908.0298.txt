We present the conformally 1+3 Hubble-normalized field equations together
with the general total source equations, and then specialize to a source that
consists of perfect fluids with general barotropic equations of state.
Motivating, formulating, and assuming certain conjectures, we derive results
about how the properties of fluids (equations of state, momenta, angular
momenta) and generic spacelike singularities affect each other.
