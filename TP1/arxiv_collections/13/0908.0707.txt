Using density matrix equations of motion, we predict a femtosecond collective
spin tilt triggered by nonlinear, near--ultraviolet ($\sim$3eV), coherent
photoexcitation of (Ga,Mn)As ferromagnetic semiconductors with linearly
polarized light. This dynamics results from carrier coherences and nonthermal
populations excited in the \{111\} equivalent directions of the Brillouin zone
and triggers a subsequent uniform precession. We predict nonthermal
magnetization control by tuning the laser frequency and polarization direction.
Our mechanism explains recent ultrafast pump--probe experiments.
