A new and more comprehensive model of charge-exchange induced X-ray emission,
due to ions precipitating into the Jovian atmosphere near the poles, has been
used to analyze spectral observations made by the Chandra X-ray Observatory.
The model includes for the first time carbon ions, in addition to the oxygen
and sulfur ions previously considered, in order to account for possible ion
origins from both the solar wind and the Jovian magnetosphere. By comparing the
model spectra with newly reprocessed Chandra observations, we conclude that
carbon ion emission provides a negligible contribution, suggesting that solar
wind ions are not responsible for the observed polar X-rays. In addition,
results of the model fits to observations support the previously estimated
seeding kinetic energies of the precipitating ions (~0.7-2 MeV/u), but infer a
different relative sulfur to oxygen abundance ratio for these Chandra
observations.
