Precise measurements of the microwave background anisotropy have confirmed
the inflationary picture of approximately scale invariant, Gaussian primordial
adiabatic density perturbations. However, there are some anomalies that suggest
a small violation of rotational and/or translational invariance in the
mechanism that generates the primordial density fluctuations. Motivated by this
we study the two point correlation of a massless scalar (the inflaton) when the
stress tensor contains the energy density from an infinitely long straight
cosmic string in addition to a cosmological constant.
