The measurement of the beta asymmetry parameter in nuclear beta decay is a
potentially very sensitive tool to search for non V-A components in the
charge-changing weak interaction. To reach the required precision (percent
level) all effects that modify the emission pattern of the beta radiation, i.e.
the geometry of the setup, the effect of the magnetic field on the trajectories
of beta particles as well as (back)scattering in the source, on the sample
holder and on the detector, have to be correctly taken into account in the
analysis of the data. A thorough study of these effects and a new method based
on detailed GEANT4 Monte-Carlo simulations that was developed for this purpose
is presented here. The code was developed for beta asymmetry measurements by
means of the Low Temperature Nuclear Orientation (LTNO) method, but can in
principle be generalized to other experimental setups using other polarization
techniques.
