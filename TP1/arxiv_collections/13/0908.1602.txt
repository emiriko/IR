1. A recent unpublished manuscript whose conclusions were widely circulated
in the electronic media (Zinman, 2009) claimed that Oregon 2007 payday loan
(PL) rate-limiting regulations (hereafter, "Cap") have hurt borrowers.
  2. The report's main conclusion, phrased in cause-and-effect language in the
abstract - "...restricting access caused deterioration in the overall financial
condition of the Oregon households..." - relies on a single, small-sample
survey funded by the payday-lending industry (PLI). The survey is fraught with
methodological flaws.
  3. Moreover, survey results do not support the claim that Oregon borrowers
fared worse than Washington borrowers, on any variable that can be plausibly
attributed to the Cap.
  4. In fact, Oregon respondents fared better than Washington respondents on
two key variables: on-time bill payment rate and avoiding phone-line
disconnects. On all other relevant variables they fared similarly to Washington
respondents. In short, the reported claim is baseless.
