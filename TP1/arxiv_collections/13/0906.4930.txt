Long periodic orbits of hyperbolic dynamics do not exist as independent
individuals but rather come in closely packed bunches. Under weak resolution a
bunch looks like a single orbit in configuration space, but close inspection
reveals topological orbit-to-orbit differences. The construction principle of
bunches involves close self-"encounters" of an orbit wherein two or more
stretches stay close. A certain duality of encounters and the intervening
"links" reveals an infinite hierarchical structure of orbit bunches. -- The
orbit-to-orbit action differences $\Delta S$ within a bunch can be arbitrarily
small. Bunches with $\Delta S$ of the order of Planck's constant have
constructively interfering Feynman amplitudes for quantum observables, and this
is why the classical bunching phenomenon could yield the semiclassical
explanation of universal fluctuations in quantum spectra and transport.
