We present a detailed study of the non-Markovian two-state system dynamics
for the regime of incoherent quantum tunneling. Using perturbation theory in
the system tunneling amplitude $\Delta$, and in the limit of strong system-bath
coupling, we determine the short time evolution of the reduced density matrix
and thereby find a general equation of motion for the non-Markovian evolution
at longer times. We relate the nonlocality in time due to the non-Markovian
effects with the environment characteristic response time. In addition, we
study the incoherent evolution of a system with a double-well potential, where
each well consists several quantized energy levels. We determine the crossover
temperature to a regime where many energy levels in the wells participate in
the tunneling process, and observe that the required temperature can be much
smaller than the one associated with the system plasma frequency. We also
discuss experimental implications of our theoretical analysis.
