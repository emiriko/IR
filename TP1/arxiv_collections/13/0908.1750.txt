It is suggested that the Higgs boson may have a branching ratio into the $c
\bar{c}$ mode suppressed by several orders of magnitude compared with
conventional predictions and in addition some small but detectable
flavour-violating modes such as $b \bar{s}$ and $\tau \bar{\mu}$. The
suggestion is based on a scheme proposed and tested earlier for explaining the
mixing pattern and mass hierarchy of fermions in terms of a rotating mass
matrix. If confirmed, the effects would cast new light on the geometric origin
of fermion generations and of the Higgs field itself.
