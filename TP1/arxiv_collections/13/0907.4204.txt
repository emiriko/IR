We calculate the cross section of an ultra relativistic nucleus scattering on
a qq^(bar) pair at large coupling in N=4 SUSY gauge theory. We study the
problem in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The nucleus is modeled as
a gravitational shockwave in an AdS_5 background moving along the light cone.
The dipole qq^(bar) is represented by a Wilson loop moving in the opposite
direction. Due to the correspondence, calculating the scattering amplitude of
the Wilson loop with the nucleus reduces to calculating the extreme value of
the Nambu-Goto action for an open string. Its two end points are attached to
the qq^(bar) respectively and it hangs in an AdS_5 shockwave spacetime. Six
solutions are found two of which are physically meaningful. Both solutions
predict that the saturation scale Q_s at high enough energies becomes energy
independent; in particular it behaves as Q_s A^{1/3} where A is the atomic
number. One solution predicts pomeron intercept alpha_p=2. However, there is a
parameter window of r (dipole size) and s (c.m. energy) where it violates the
black disk limit. On the other hand, the other solution respects this limit and
corresponds to pomeron intercept alpha_p=1.5. We conjecture that this is the
right value for gauge theories at strong coupling.
