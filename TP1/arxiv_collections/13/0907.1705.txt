We report measurements of differential cross sections and decay asymmetries
of incoherent $\phi$-meson photoproduction from the deuteron at forward angles
using linearly polarized photons at \Eg=1.5-2.4 GeV. The nuclear transparency
ratio for the deuteron shows a large suppression, and is consistent with the
A-dependence of the ratio observed in a previous measurement with nuclear
targets. The reduction for the deuteron cannot be adequately explained in term
of isospin asymmetry. The present results suggest the need of refining our
understanding of the $\phi$-N interaction within a nucleus.
