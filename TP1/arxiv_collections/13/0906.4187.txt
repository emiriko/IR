In the context of the Oppenheim-Horodecki paradigm of nonclassical
correlation, a bipartite quantum state is (properly) classically correlated if
and only if it is represented by a density matrix having a product eigenbasis.
On the basis of this paradigm, we propose a measure of nonclassical correlation
by using truncations of a density matrix down to individual eigenspaces. It is
computable within polynomial time in the dimension of the Hilbert space albeit
imperfect in the detection range. This is in contrast to the measures
conventionally used for the paradigm. The computational complexity and
mathematical properties of the proposed measure are investigated in detail and
the physical picture of its definition is discussed.
