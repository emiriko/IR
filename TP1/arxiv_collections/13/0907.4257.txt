ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is the dedicated heavy ion experiment
at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The main tracking device of ALICE is a
large volume TPC.
  The milestones of the TPC commissioning as well as the current status of the
detector calibration are presented. The obtained resolutions in transverse
momentum, position as well as in specific energy loss (dE/dx) are presented and
results from noise and electron drift velocity measurements are addressed.
