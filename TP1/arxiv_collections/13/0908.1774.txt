We consider a single source transmitting data to one or more receivers/users
over a shared wireless channel. Due to random fading, the wireless channel
conditions vary with time and from user to user. Each user has a buffer to
store received packets before they are drained. At each time step, the source
determines how much power to use for transmission to each user. The source's
objective is to allocate power in a manner that minimizes an expected cost
measure, while satisfying strict buffer underflow constraints and a total power
constraint in each slot. The expected cost measure is composed of costs
associated with power consumption from transmission and packet holding costs.
The primary application motivating this problem is wireless media streaming.
For this application, the buffer underflow constraints prevent the user buffers
from emptying, so as to maintain playout quality. In the case of a single user
with linear power-rate curves, we show that a modified base-stock policy is
optimal under the finite horizon, infinite horizon discounted, and infinite
horizon average expected cost criteria. For a single user with piecewise-linear
convex power-rate curves, we show that a finite generalized base-stock policy
is optimal under all three expected cost criteria. We also present the
sequences of critical numbers that complete the characterization of the optimal
control laws in each of these cases when some additional technical conditions
are satisfied. We then analyze the structure of the optimal policy for the case
of two users. We conclude with a discussion of methods to identify
implementable near-optimal policies for the most general case of M users.
