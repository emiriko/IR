We study two and three meson decays of the tau lepton within the framework of
the Resonance Chiral Theory, that is based on the following properties of QCD:
its chiral symmetry in the massless case, its large-N_C limit, and the
asymptotic behaviour it demands to the relevant form factors. Most of the
couplings in the Lagrangian are determined this way rendering the theory
predictive. Our outcomes can be tested thanks to the combination of a very good
experimental effort (current and forthcoming, at B- and tau-charm-factories)
and the very accurate devoted Monte Carlo generators.
