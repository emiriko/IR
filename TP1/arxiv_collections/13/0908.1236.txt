In this work, we revisit the all-sky Galactic diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission
taking into account the new measurements of cosmic ray electron/positron
spectrum by PAMELA, ATIC and Fermi, which show excesses of cosmic
electrons/positrons beyond the expected fluxes in the conventional model. Since
the origins of the extra electrons/positrons are not clear, we consider three
different scenarios to account for the excesses: the astrophysical sources such
as the Galactic pulsars, dark matter decay and annihilation. Further, new
results from Fermi-LAT of the (extra-)Galactic diffuse $\gamma$-ray are
adopted.
  The background cosmic rays without the new sources give lower diffuse
$\gamma$ rays compared to Fermi-LAT observation, which is consistent with
previous analysis. The scenario with astrophysical sources predicts diffuse
$\gamma$-rays with little difference with the background. The dark matter
annihilation models with $\tau^{\pm}$ final state are disfavored by the Fermi
diffuse $\gamma$-ray data, while there are only few constraints on the decaying
dark matter scenario. Furthermore, these is always a bump at higher energies
($\sim$ TeV) of the diffuse $\gamma$-ray spectra for the dark matter scenarios
due to final state radiation. Finally we find that the Fermi-LAT diffuse
$\gamma$-ray data can be explained by simply enlarging the normalization of the
electron spectrum without introduce any new sources, which may indicate that
the current constraints on the dark matter models can be much stronger given a
precise background estimate.
