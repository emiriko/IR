We have introduced a separable pairing force, which was adjusted to reproduce
the pairing properties of the Gogny force in nuclear matter. This separable
pairing force is able to describe in relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (RHB)
calculations the pairing properties in the ground state of finite nuclei on
almost the same footing as the original Gogny interaction. In this work we
investigate excited states using the Relativistic Quasiparticle Random Phase
Approximation (RQRPA) with the same separable pairing force. For consistency
the Goldstone modes and the convergence with various cutoff parameters in this
version of RQRPA are studied. The first excited $2^+$ states for the chain of
Sn-isotopes with Z=50 and the chain of isotones with N=82 isotones are
calculated in RQRPA together with the $3^-$ states of Sn-isotopes. Comparing
with experimental data and with the results of original Gogny force we find
that this simple separable pairing interaction is very successful in depicting
the pairing properties of vibrational excitations.
