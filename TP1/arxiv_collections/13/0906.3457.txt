I study variations of the standard leptogenesis scenario that can arise if an
additional mass scale related to the breaking of some new symmetry is present
below the mass $M_{N_1}$ of the lightest right-handed Majorana neutrino. I
present a particular realization of this scheme that allows for leptogenesis at
the TeV scale. In this realization the baryon asymmetry is exclusively due to
flavor effects.
