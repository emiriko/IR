We propose monolayer epitaxial graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as
ultimate thickness covalent spacers for magnetoresistive junctions. Using a
first-principles approach, we investigate the structural, magnetic and spin
transport properties of such junctions based on structurally well defined
interfaces with (111) fcc or (0001) hcp ferromagnetic transition metals. We
find low resistance area products, strong exchange couplings across the
interface, and magnetoresistance ratios exceeding 100% for certain chemical
compositions. These properties can be fine tuned, making the proposed junctions
attractive for nanoscale spintronics applications.
