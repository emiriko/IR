In equilibrium, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) expresses the
response of an observable to a small perturbation by a correlation function of
this variable with another one that is conjugate to the perturbation with
respect to \emph{energy}. For a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS), the
corresponding FDT is shown to involve in the correlation function a variable
that is conjugate with respect to \emph{entropy}. By splitting up entropy
production into one of the system and one of the medium, it is shown that for
systems with a genuine equilibrium state the FDT of the NESS differs from its
equilibrium form by an additive term involving \emph{total} entropy production.
A related variant of the FDT not requiring explicit knowledge of the stationary
state is particularly useful for coupled Langevin systems. The \emph{a priori}
surprising freedom apparently involved in different forms of the FDT in a NESS
is clarified.
