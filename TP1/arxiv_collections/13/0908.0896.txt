Experiments have shown that the internal vibrational state of a molecule can
affect the intensity of high harmonic light generated from that molecule. This
paper presents a model which explains this modulation in terms of interference
between different vibrational states occurring during the high harmonic
process. In addition, a semiclassical model of the continuum electron
propagation is developed which connects with rigorous treatments of the
electron-ion scattering.
