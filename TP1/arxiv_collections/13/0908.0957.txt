We present a new interpretation of the terms superposition, entanglement, and
measurement that appear in quantum mechanics. We hypothesize that the structure
of the wave function for a quantum system at the sub-Planck scale has a
deterministic cyclic structure. Each cycle comprises a sequential succession of
the eigenstates that comprise a given wave function. Between unitary operations
or measurements on the wave function, the sequential arrangement of the current
eigenstates chosen by the system is immaterial, but once chosen it remains
fixed until another unitary operation or measurement changes the wave function.
The probabilistic aspect of quantum mechanics is interpreted by hypothesizing a
measurement mechanism which acts instantaneously but the instant of measurement
is chosen randomly by the classical measuring apparatus over a small but finite
interval from the time the measurement apparatus is activated. At the instant
the measurement is made, the wave function irrevocably collapses to a new state
(erasing some of the past quantum information) and continues from thereon in
that state till changed by a unitary operation or a new measurement.
