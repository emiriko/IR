A zero index metamaterial (ZIM) can be utilized to block wave
(super-reflection) or conceal objects completely (cloaking). The
"super-reflection" device is realized by a ZIM with a perfect electric
(magnetic) conductor inclusion of arbitrary shape and size for a transverse
electric (magnetic) incident wave. In contrast, a ZIM with a perfect magnetic
(electric) conductor inclusion for a transverse electric (magnetic) incident
wave can be used to conceal objects of arbitrary shape. The underlying physics
here is determined by the intrinsic properties of the ZIM.
