Several experimental and theoretical studies indicate the existence of a
critical point separating the underdoped and overdoped regions of the high-T_c
cuprates' phase diagram. There are at least two distinct proposals on the
critical concentration and its physical origin. First one is associated with
the pseudogap formation for p<p*, with p~0.2. Another one relies on the Hall
effect measurements and suggests that the critical point and the quantum phase
transition (QPT) take place at optimal doping, p_{opt}~0.16. Here we have
performed a precise density of states calculation and found that there are two
QPTs and the corresponding critical concentrations associated with the change
of the Fermi surface topology upon doping.
