The mechanisms for explaining how a stable asymmetric chemical system can be
formed from a symmetric chemical system, in the absence of any asymmetric
influence other than statistical fluctuations, have been developed during the
last decades, focusing on the non-linear kinetic aspects. Besides the absolute
necessity of self-amplification processes, the importance of energetic aspects
is often underestimated. Going down to the most fundamental aspects, the
distinction between a single object -- that can be intrinsically asymmetric --
and a collection of objects -- whose racemic state is the more stable one --
must be emphasized. A system of strongly interacting objects can be described
as one single object retaining its individuality and a single asymmetry; weakly
or non-interacting objects keep their own individuality, and are prone to
racemize towards the equilibrium state. In the presence of energy fluxes,
systems can be maintained in an asymmetric non-equilibrium steady-state. Such
dynamical systems can retain their asymmetry for times longer than their
racemization time.
