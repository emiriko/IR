We present follow-up time-series photometric observations that confirm and
extend the results of the significant discovery made by Barlow et al.(2008)
that the Hot DQ white dwarfs SDSS J220029.08-074121.5 and SDSS
J234843.30-094245.3 are luminosity variable. These are the second and third
known members of a new class of pulsating white dwarfs, after the prototype
SDSS J142625.71+575218.3 (Montgomery et al. 2008). We find that the light curve
of SDSS J220029.08-074121.5 is dominated by an oscillation at 654.397+-0.056 s,
and that the light pulse folded on that period is highly nonlinear due to the
presence of the first and second harmonic of the main pulsation. We also
present evidence for the possible detection of two additional pulsation modes
with low amplitudes and periods of 577.576+-0.226 s and 254.732+-0.048 s in
that star. Likewise, we find that the light curve of SDSS J234843.30-094245.3
is dominated by a pulsation with a period of 1044.168+-0.012 s, but with no
sign of harmonic components. A new oscillation, with a low amplitude and a
period of 416.919+-0.004 s, is also probably detected in that second star. We
argue, on the basis of the very different folded pulse shapes, that SDSS
J220029.08-074121.5 is likely magnetic, while SDSS J234843.30-094245.3 is
probably not.
