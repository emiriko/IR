In this Letter, we present a new self-consistent theory for the production of
the relativistic outflows observed from radio-loud black hole candidates and
active galaxies as a result of particle acceleration in hot, viscous accretion
disks containing standing, centrifugally-supported isothermal shocks. This is
the first work to obtain the structure of such disks for a relatively large
value of the Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter ($\alpha=0.1$), and to
consider the implications of the shock for the acceleration of relativistic
particles in viscous disks. In our approach, the hydrodynamics and the particle
acceleration are coupled and the solutions are obtained self-consistently based
on a rigorous mathematical method. We find that particle acceleration in the
vicinity of the shock can provide enough energy to power the observed
relativistic jet in M87.
