The Lorentz integral transform method is briefly reviewed. The issue of the
inversion of the transform, and in particular its ill-posedness, is addressed.
It is pointed out that the mathematical term ill-posed is misleading and merely
due to a historical misconception. In this connection standard regularization
procedures for the solution of the integral transform problem are presented. In
particular a recent one is considered in detail and critical comments on it are
provided. In addition a general remark concerning the concept of the Lorentz
integral transform as a method with a controlled resolution is made.
