We are conducting a long-term photometric survey of the nearby galaxy M33 to
discover Cepheids, eclipsing binaries, and long-period variables. The dataset
combines previously-obtained optical images from the DIRECT project with new
observations acquired at the WIYN 3.5m telescope. The entire data set spans
over 7 years with excellent synoptic coverage which will enable the discovery
and characterization of stars displaying variability over a wide range of
timescales (days, weeks, months, years). In this preliminary work we show
representative light curves of different variables we found so far in two
fields, color-magnitude diagrams, and optical Cepheid Period-Luminosity
relations for M33. The ultimate goal of the project is to provide an absolute
calibration of the Cepheid Period-Luminosity relation, and to study its
metallicity dependence at optical wavelengths.
