A mechanism of a pinning of the quantized matter wave vortices by optical
vortices in a specially arranged optical dipole traps is discussed. The
vortex-antivortex optical arrays of rectangular symmetry are shown to transfer
angular orbital momentum and form the "antiferromagnet"-like matter waves. The
separable Hamiltonian for matter waves in pancake trapping geometry is proposed
and 3D-wavefunction is factorized in a product of wavefunctions of the 1D
harmonic oscillator and 2D vortex-antivortex quantum state. The 2D
wavefunction's phase gradient field associated via Madelung transform with the
field of classical velocities forms labyrinth-like structure. The macroscopic
quantum state composed of periodically spaced counter-rotating BEC superfluid
vortices has zero angular momentum and nonzero rotational energy.
