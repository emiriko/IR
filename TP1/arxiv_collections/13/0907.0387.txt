Designed to be a successor of the previous flown space based gamma ray
detectors, the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) is also an electron detector.
Taking advantage of its capability to separate electromagnetic and hadronic
signals it is possible to accurately measure the Cosmic Ray electron spectrum.
The spectra of primary cosmic ray electrons below 20 GeV is influenced by many
local effects such as solar modulation and the geomagnetic cutoff. For energies
below a few GeV it is possible to observe the albedo population of electrons
which are controlled by the local magnetic field. In this paper we present the
LAT electron analysis in particular event selection and validation as well as
the first results on the measurement of the electron spectrum below 20 GeV.
