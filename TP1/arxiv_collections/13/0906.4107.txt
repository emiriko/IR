By developing a simple scaling theory for the effect of Hund's interactions
on the Kondo effect, we show how an exponential narrowing of the Kondo
resonance develops in magnetic ions with large Hund's interaction. Our theory
predicts an exponential reduction of the Kondo temperature with spin S of the
Hund's coupled moment, a little-known effect first observed in d-electron
alloys in the 1960's, and more recently encountered in numerical calculations
on multi-band Hubbard models with Hund's interactions. We discuss the
consequences of Kondo resonance narrowing for the Mott transition in d-band
materials, particularly iron pnictides, and the narrow ESR linewidth recently
observed in ferromagnetically correlated f-electron materials.
