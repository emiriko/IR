We investigate the entanglement in a two-qubit Heisenberg XYZ system with
different Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya(DM) interaction and inhomogeneous magnetic
field. It is found that the control parameters ($D_{x}$, $B_{x}$ and $b_{x}$)
are remarkably different with the common control parameters ($D_{z}$,$B_{z}$
and $b_{z}$) in the entanglement and the critical temperature, and these
x-component parameters can increase the entanglement and the critical
temperature more efficiently. Furthermore, we show the properties of these
x-component parameters for the control of entanglement. In the ground state,
increasing $D_{x}$ (spin-orbit coupling parameter) can decrease the critical
value $b_{xc}$ and increase the entanglement in the revival region, and
adjusting some parameters (increasing $b_{x}$ and $J$, decreasing $B_{x}$ and
$\Delta$) can decrease the critical value $D_{xc}$ to enlarge the revival
region. In the thermal state, increasing $D_{x}$ can increase the revival
region and the entanglement in the revival region (for $T$ or $b_{x}$), and
enhance the critical value $B_{xc}$ to make the region of high entanglement
larger. Also, the entanglement and the revival region will increase with the
decrease of $B_{x}$ (uniform magnetic field). In addition, small $b_{x}$
(nonuniform magnetic field) has some similar properties to $D_{x}$, and with
the increase of $b_{x}$ the entanglement also has a revival phenomenon, so that
the entanglement can exist at higher temperature for larger $b_{x}$.
