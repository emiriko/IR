We consider Thurston maps, i.e., branched covering maps $f\colon S^2\to S^2$
that are postcritically finite. In addition, we assume that $f$ is expanding in
a suitable sense. It is shown that each sufficiently high iterate $F=f^n$ of
$f$ is semi-conjugate to $z^d\colon S^1\to S^1$, where $d$ is equal to the
degree of $F$. More precisely, for such an $F$ we construct a Peano curve
$\gamma\colon S^1\to S^2$ (onto), such that $F\circ \gamma(z) = \gamma(z^d)$
(for all $z\in S^1$).
