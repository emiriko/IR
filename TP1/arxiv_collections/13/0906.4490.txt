HERA, the only ep collider, operated in the years 1992-2007 at centre-of-mass
energies of 300-320 GeV in Hamburg, Germany. Deep inelastic neutral and charged
current scattering at HERA provides the possibility to study the structure of
the proton, the dynamics of strong interactions and test quantum chromodynamics
(QCD) over a huge kinematic range. Both, neutral and charged current
interactions provide complementary information on the QCD and electroweak parts
of the Standard Model. In addition, HERA data allow for indirect searches for
new phenomena originating at large scales, however, no evidence for the new
physics has been found. The full statistics of data collected at HERA have been
used for most of the measurements performed by H1 and ZEUS which are presented
in this document.
