Bootstrap percolation transition may be first order or second order, or it
may have a mixed character where a first order drop in the order parameter is
preceded by critical fluctuations. Recent studies have indicated that the mixed
transition is characterized by power law avalanches, while the continuous
transition is characterized by truncated avalanches in a related sequential
bootstrap process. We explain this behavior on the basis of a through
analytical and numerical study of the avalanche distributions on a Bethe
lattice.
