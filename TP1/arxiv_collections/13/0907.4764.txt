Every graph has a canonical finite abelian group attached to it. This group
has appeared in the literature under a variety of names including the sandpile
group, critical group, Jacobian group, and Picard group. The construction of
this group closely mirrors the construction of the Jacobian variety of an
algebraic curve. Motivated by this analogy, it was recently suggested by Norman
Biggs that the critical group of a finite graph is a good candidate for doing
discrete logarithm based cryptography. In this paper, we study a bilinear
pairing on this group and show how to compute it. Then we use this pairing to
find the discrete logarithm efficiently, thus showing that the associated
cryptographic schemes are not secure. Our approach resembles the MOV attack on
elliptic curves.
