We present a novel laser based ion acceleration scheme, where a petawatt
circularly polarized laser pulse is shot on an ultra-thin (nano-scale)
double-layer target. Our scheme allows the production of high-quality light ion
beams with both energy and angular dispersion controllable by the target
properties. We show that extraction of all electrons from the target by
radiation pressure can lead to a very effective two step acceleration process
for light ions if the target is designed correctly. Relativistic protons should
be obtainable with pulse powers of a few petawatt. Careful analytical modeling
yields estimates for characteristic beam parameters and requirements on the
laser pulse quality, in excellent agreement with one and two-dimensional
Particle-in Cell simulations.
