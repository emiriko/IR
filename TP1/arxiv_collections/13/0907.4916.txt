The calculation of the strangeness content of the nucleon and its
experimental verification is a fundamental step in establishing
non-perturbative QCD as the correct theory describing the structure of hadrons.
It holds a role in QCD analogous to the correct calculation of the Lamb shift
in QED. We review the latest developments in the vector and scalar matrix
elements of the strange quarks in the proton, where there has recently been
considerable progress.
