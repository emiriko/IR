We propose a test based on the theory of algorithmic complexity and an
experimental evaluation of Levin's universal distribution to identify evidence
in support of or in contravention of the claim that the world is algorithmic in
nature. To this end we have undertaken a statistical comparison of the
frequency distributions of data from physical sources on the one
hand--repositories of information such as images, data stored in a hard drive,
computer programs and DNA sequences--and the frequency distributions generated
by purely algorithmic means on the other--by running abstract computing devices
such as Turing machines, cellular automata and Post Tag systems. Statistical
correlations were found and their significance measured.
