This paper addresses the problem of separating spectral sources which are
linearly mixed with unknown proportions. The main difficulty of the problem is
to ensure the full additivity (sum-to-one) of the mixing coefficients and
non-negativity of sources and mixing coefficients. A Bayesian estimation
approach based on Gamma priors was recently proposed to handle the
non-negativity constraints in a linear mixture model. However, incorporating
the full additivity constraint requires further developments. This paper
studies a new hierarchical Bayesian model appropriate to the non-negativity and
sum-to-one constraints associated to the regressors and regression coefficients
of linear mixtures. The estimation of the unknown parameters of this model is
performed using samples generated using an appropriate Gibbs sampler. The
performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through simulation results
conducted on synthetic mixture models. The proposed approach is also applied to
the processing of multicomponent chemical mixtures resulting from Raman
spectroscopy.
