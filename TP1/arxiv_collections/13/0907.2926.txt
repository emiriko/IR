We present new extensions to a method for constructing several families of
solvable one-dimensional time-homogeneous diffusions whose transition densities
are obtainable in analytically closed-form. Our approach is based on a dual
application of the so-called diffusion canonical transformation method that
combines smooth monotonic mappings and measure changes via Doob-h transforms.
This gives rise to new multi-parameter solvable diffusions that are generally
divided into two main classes; the first is specified by having affine (linear)
drift with various resulting nonlinear diffusion coefficient functions, while
the second class allows for several specifications of a (generally nonlinear)
diffusion coefficient with resulting nonlinear drift function. The theory is
applicable to diffusions with either singular and/or non-singular endpoints. As
part of the results in this paper, we also present a complete boundary
classification and martingale characterization of the newly developed diffusion
families.
