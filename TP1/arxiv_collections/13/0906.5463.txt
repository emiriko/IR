It has recently been established that hadronisation corrections to QCD jets
vary as $1/R$, at small $R$, for jets of radius $R$. Here we demonstrate, using
jets in the $k_t$ algorithm, that the magnitude of these $1/R$ corrections are
unambiguously linked to the magnitude of $1/Q$ corrections to commonly studied
event shapes in $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation.
