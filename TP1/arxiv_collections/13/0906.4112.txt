We study scale invariant but not necessarily conformal invariant deformations
of non-relativistic conformal field theories from the dual gravity viewpoint.
We present the corresponding metric that solves the Einstein equation coupled
with a massive vector field. We find that, within the class of metric we study,
when we assume the Galilean invariance, the scale invariant deformation always
preserves the non-relativistic conformal invariance. We discuss applications to
scaling regime of Reggeon field theory and non-linear quantum finance. These
theories possess scale invariance but may or may not break the conformal
invariance, depending on the underlying symmetry assumptions.
