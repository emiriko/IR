A realistic pseudopotential model is introduced to investigate the
phonon-induced spin relaxation of conduction electrons in bulk silicon. We find
a surprisingly subtle interference of the Elliott and Yafet processes affecting
the spin relaxation over a wide temperature range, suppressing the significance
of the intravalley spin-flip scattering, previously considered dominant, above
roughly 120 K. The calculated spin relaxation times $T_1$ agree with the spin
resonance and spin injection data, following a $T^{-3}$ temperature dependence.
The valley anisotropy of $T_1$ and the spin relaxation rates for hot electrons
are predicted.
