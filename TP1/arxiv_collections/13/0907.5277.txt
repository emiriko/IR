I review the dynamical symmetry breaking (DSB) approach to the Origin of
Mass, which is traced back to the original (2008 Nobel prize) work of Nambu
based on the BCS analogue of superconductor where mass of nucleon (then
elementary particle) arises due to Cooper paring and pions are provided as
massless Nambu-Goldstone (NG) bosons, being composite as in Fermi-Yang/Sakata
model. In this talk I will focus on the modern version of DSB or composite
Higgs models: Walking/Conformal Technicolor, Hidden Local Symmetry (HLS) or
Moose, and Top Quark Condensate, with the their extra dimension versions
closely related with HLS. Particular emphasis will be placed on the large
anomalous dimension and conformal symmetry at the conformal fixed points,
developed along the line of the pioneering work of Maskawa and Nakajima. Due to
(approximate) conformal symmetry these models do have composite Higgs particle
("Techni-dilaton", "Top-sigma" etc.). Weakly coupled composite gauge boson is
realized at "Vector Manifestation" formulated at conformal fixed point, which
may be applied to the composite W/Z boson models. They will be tested in the
upcoming LHC experiments.
