We study a natural construction of a general class of inhomogeneous quantum
walks (namely walks whose transition probabilities depend on position). Within
the class we analyze walks that are periodic in position and show that,
depending on the period, such walks can be bounded or unbounded in time; in the
latter case we analyze the asymptotic speed. We compare the construction to
others in the existing literature. As an example we give a quantum version of a
non-irreducible classical walk: the Polya Urn.
