We have fabricated hybrid magnetic complexes from V atoms and
tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) ligands via atomic manipulation with a cryogenic
scanning tunneling microscope. Using tunneling spectroscopy we observe
spin-polarized molecular orbitals as well as Kondo behavior. For complexes
having two V atoms, the Kondo behavior can be quenched for different molecular
arrangements, even as the spin-polarized orbitals remain unchanged. This is
explained by variable spin-spin (i.e., V-V) ferromagnetic coupling through a
single TCNE molecule, as supported by density functional calculations.
