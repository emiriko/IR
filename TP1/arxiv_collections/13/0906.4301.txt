A computer code for quasiparticle random phase approximation-QRPA and
projected quasiparticle random phase approximation-PQRPA models of nuclear
structure is explained in details. An important application of the code
consists in evaluating nuclear matrix elements involved in neutrino-nucleus
reactions. As an example, cross section for 56Fe and 12C are calculated and the
code output is explained. The application to other nuclei and the description
of other nuclear and weak decay processes is also discussed.
