It has been hypothesized that large fluxes of neutrinos may be created in
astrophysical "cosmic accelerators." The primary background for a search for
astrophysical neutrinos comes from atmospheric neutrinos, which do not exhibit
the pointlike directional clustering that characterizes a distant astrophysical
signal. We perform a search for neutrino point sources using the upward-going
muon data from three phases of operation (SK-I, SK-II, and SK-III) spanning
2623 days of live time taken from April 1, 1996 to August 11, 2007. The search
looks for signals from suspected galactic and extragalactic sources, transient
sources, and unexpected sources. We find interesting signatures from two
objects--RX J1713.7-3946 (97.5% CL) and GRB 991004D (95.3% CL)--but the
signatures lack compelling statistical significance given trial factors. We set
limits on the flux and fluence of neutrino point sources above energies of 1.6
GeV.
