It is known that with restrictions on the type of the constitutive equations,
Maxwell's equations in non-uniform media can sometimes be reduced to two 2nd
order differential equations for 2 scalar quantities only. These results have
previously been obtained in two quite different ways. Either by a
``scalarization of the sources'', where the relevant scalar quantities are
essentially vector potential components and where the derivation was limited to
isotropic media; or alternatively by using the ``scalar Hertz potentials'', and
this method has been applied to more general media. In this paper it is shown
that both methods are equivalent for gyrotropic media. We show that the
scalarization can be obtained by a combination of transformations between
electric and magnetic sources and gauge transformations. It is shown that the
method based on the vector potential, which previously used a non-traditional
definition of the vector potentials, can also be obtained using the traditional
definition provided a proper gauge condition is applied and this method is then
extended from isotropic to gyrotropic media. It is shown that the 2 basic
scalar Hertz potentials occurring in the second method are invariant under the
source scalarization transformations of the first method and therefore are the
natural potentials for obtaining scalarization. Finally it is shown that both
methods are also equivalent with a much older third method based on Hertz
vectors.
