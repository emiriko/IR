In this article we study closed inflationary universe models using the
Gauss-Bonnet Brane. We determine and characterize the existence of a universe
with $\Omega > 1$, with an appropriate period of inflation. We have found that
this model is less restrictive in comparison with the standard approach where a
scalar field is considered. We use recent astronomical observations to
constrain the parameters appearing in the model.
