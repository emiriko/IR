In an earlier paper we provided an alternative to the standard gauge concept
for deriving the classical electromagnetic wave equations. This alternative
involves recognition of two previously overlooked basic equations and
represents a simplification of the formalism and a clarification of some basic
physics that is obscured in the standard method. It also removes
inconsistencies inherent in the gauge approach. The present paper relates to
the Coulomb gauge and addresses another example of a major inconsistency that
derives directly from the gauge concept
