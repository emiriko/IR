The article reviews recent progress in the theoretical understanding of
near-field surface electromagnetic phenomena in pristine and atomically doped
carbon nanotubes. The phenomena involving strong coupling effects are outlined.
They are the optical absorption by single-walled carbon nanotubes doped with
single atoms or ions in the frequency range close to the atomic transition
frequency, the entanglement of the pair of atomic qubits strongly coupled to a
common high-finesse surface photonic mode of the nanotube, and the optical
response of the strongly coupled surface exciton-plasmon excitations in
pristine semiconducting carbon nanotubes. The phenomena reviewed have a great
potential to be exploited for the future development of the nanotube based
tunable optoelectronic device applications in areas such as nanophotonics,
nanoplasmonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics, and quantum information
science.
