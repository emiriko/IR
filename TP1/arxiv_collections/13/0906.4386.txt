We study a three-dimensional Anderson-Hubbard model under the coexistence of
short-range interaction and diagonal disorder within the Hartree-Fock
approximation. We show that the density of states at the Fermi energy is
suppressed in the metallic phases near the metal-insulator transition as a
proximity effect of the soft Hubbard gap in the insulating phases. The
transition to the insulator is characterized by a vanishing DOS in contrast to
formation of a quasiparticle peak at the Fermi energy obtained by the dynamical
mean field theory in pure systems. Furthermore, we show that there exist frozen
spin moments in the paramagnetic metal.
