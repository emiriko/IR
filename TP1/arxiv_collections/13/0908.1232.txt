One presented some lattice models, while the theoretic derivation has not
been found, and the importance of correlation effects has to be emphasized. On
the basis of the non-relativistic Hamiltonian from the Dirac equation, we
derive in detail a tight binding model. We find that both ferromagnetism and
ferroelectricity are from the correlation effect between electrons, and
magnetic and electric orders are strongly coupled due to the spin-orbit
interaction.
