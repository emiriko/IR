Kramers-Moyal coefficients provide a simple and easily visualized method with
which to analyze stochastic time series, particularly nonlinear ones. One
mechanism that can affect the estimation of the coefficients is geometric
projection effects. For some biologically-inspired examples, these effects are
predicted and explored with a non-stochastic projection operator method, and
compared with direct numerical simulation of the systems' Langevin equations.
General features and characteristics are identified, and the utility of the
Kramers-Moyal method discussed. Projections of a system are in general
non-Markovian, but here the Kramers-Moyal method remains useful, and in any
case the primary examples considered are found to be close to Markovian.
