The interaction between localized magnetic moments and the electrons of a
one-dimensional conductor can lead to an ordered phase in which the magnetic
moments and the electrons are tightly bound to each other. We show here that
this occurs when a lattice of nuclear spins is embedded in a Luttinger liquid.
Experimentally available examples of such a system are single wall carbon
nanotubes grown entirely from 13C and GaAs-based quantum wires. In these
systems the hyperfine interaction between the nuclear spin and the conduction
electron spin is very weak, yet it triggers a strong feedback reaction that
results in an ordered phase consisting of a nuclear helimagnet that is
inseparably bound to an electronic density wave combining charge and spin
degrees of freedom. This effect can be interpreted as a strong renormalization
of the nuclear Overhauser field and is a unique signature of Luttinger liquid
physics. Through the feedback the order persists up into the millikelvin range.
A particular signature is the reduction of the electric conductance by the
universal factor 2.
