We present a uniform X-ray spectral analysis of eight type-1 active galactic
nuclei (AGN) that have been previously observed with relativistically broadened
iron emission lines. Utilizing data from the XMM-Newton European Photon Imaging
Camera (EPIC-pn) we carefully model the spectral continuum, taking complex
intrinsic absorption and emission into account. We then proceed to model the
broad Fe K feature in each source with two different accretion disk emission
line codes, as well as a self-consistent, ionized accretion disk spectrum
convolved with relativistic smearing from the inner disk. Comparing the
results, we show that relativistic blurring of the disk emission is required to
explain the spectrum in most sources, even when one models the full reflection
spectrum from the photoionized disk.
