We present a new method for modeling the hadronic recoil in W->lnu events
produced at hadron colliders. The recoil is chosen from a library of recoils in
Z->ll data events and overlaid on a simulated W->lnu event. Implementation of
this method requires that the data recoil library describe the properties of
the measured recoil as a function of the true, rather than the measured,
transverse momentum of the boson. We address this issue using a
multidimensional Bayesian unfolding technique. We estimate the statistical and
systematic uncertainties from this method for the W boson mass and width
measurements assuming 1 fb-1 of data from the Fermilab Tevatron. The
uncertainties are found to be small and comparable to those of a more
traditional parameterized recoil model. For the high precision measurements
that will be possible with data from Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron and from
the CERN LHC, the method presented in this paper may be advantageous, since it
does not require an understanding of the measured recoil from first principles.
