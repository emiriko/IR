In this paper we propose to interpret the large discretization artifacts
affecting the neutral pion mass in maximally twisted lattice QCD simulations as
O(a^2) effects whose magnitude is roughly proportional to the modulus square of
the (continuum) matrix element of the pseudoscalar density operator between
vacuum and one-pion state. The numerical size of this quantity is determined by
the dynamical mechanism of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and turns out
to be substantially larger than its natural magnitude set by the value of
Lambda_QCD.
