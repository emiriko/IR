The Casimir effect for a three-parallel-plate system at finite temperature
within the frame of five-dimensional Randall-Sundrum models is studied. In the
case of Randall-Sundrum model involving two branes we find that the Casimir
force depends on the plates distance and temperature after one outer plate has
been moved to the distant place. Further we discover that the sign of the
reduced force is negative as the plate and piston locate very close, but the
reduced force nature becomes repulsive when the plates distance is not very
tiny and finally the repulsive force vanishes with extremely large plates
separation. The thermal influence causes the repulsive Casimir force greater.
Within the frame of one-brane scenario the reduced Casimir force between the
piston and one plate left keeps attractive no matter how high the temperature
is. It is interesting that the thermal effect leads the attractive Casimir
force greater instead of changing the force nature.
