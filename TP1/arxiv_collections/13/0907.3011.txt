Within the framework of supersymmetry, the particle content is extended in a
way that each Higgs doublet is in a full generation. Namely in addition to
ordinary three generations, there is an extra vector-like generation, and it is
the extra slepton SU(2)_L doublets that are taken to be the two Higgs doublets.
R-parity violating interactions contain ordinary Yukawa interactions. Breaking
of supersymmetry and gauge symmetry are analyzed. Fermion and boson spectra are
calculated. Phenomenological constraints and relevant new physics at Large
Hadron Collider are discussed.
