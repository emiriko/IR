I propose that pattern recognition, memorization and processing are key
concepts that can be a principle set for the theoretical modeling of the mind
function. Most of the questions about the mind functioning can be answered by a
descriptive modeling and definitions from these principles. An understandable
consciousness definition can be drawn based on the assumption that a pattern
recognition system can recognize its own patterns of activity. The principles,
descriptive modeling and definitions can be a basis for theoretical and applied
research on cognitive sciences, particularly at artificial intelligence
studies.
