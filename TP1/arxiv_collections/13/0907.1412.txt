In order to estimate the possibility to observe exotic physics in a neutrino
telescope, it is essential to first understand the flux of atmospheric
neutrinos, muons and dimuons. We study the production of these leptons by
high-energy cosmic rays. We identify three main sources of muons of energy E >
10^6 GeV: the weak decay of charm and bottom mesons and the electromagnetic
decay of unflavored mesons. Contrary to the standard assumption, we find that
eta mesons, not the prompt decay of charm hadrons, are the dominant source of
atmospheric muons at these energies. We show that, as a consequence, the ratio
between the neutrino and muon fluxes is significantly reduced. For dimuons,
which may be a background for long-lived staus produced near a neutrino
telescope, we find that pairs of E ~ 10^7 GeV forming an angle above 10^-6 rad
are produced through D (80%) or B (10%) meson decay and through Drell-Yan
proceses (10%). The frequency of all these processes has been evaluated using
the jet code PYTHIA.
