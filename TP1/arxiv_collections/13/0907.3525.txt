We report on the discovery of a planetary system with a close-in transiting
hot Jupiter on a near circular orbit and a massive outer planet on a highly
eccentric orbit. The inner planet, HAT-P-13b, transits the bright V=10.622 G4
dwarf star GSC 3416-00543 every P = 2.916260 \pm 0.000010 days, with transit
epoch Tc = 2454779.92979 \pm 0.00038 (BJD) and duration 0.1345 \pm 0.0017 d.
The outer planet, HAT-P-13c orbits the star with P2 = 428.5 \pm 3.0 days and
nominal transit center (assuming zero impact parameter) of T2c = 2454870.4 \pm
1.8 (BJD) or time of periastron passage T2,peri= 2454890.05 \pm 0.48 (BJD).
Transits of the outer planet have not been observed, and may not be present.
The host star has a mass of 1.22 \pm ^0.05_0.10 Msun, radius of 1.56 \pm 0.08
Rsun, effective temperature 5653 \pm 90 K, and is rather metal rich with [Fe=H]
= +0.41 \pm 0.08. The inner planetary companion has a mass of 0.853\pm
^0.029_-0.046MJup, and radius of 1.281 \pm 0.079 RJup yielding a mean density
of 0.498\pm +0.103_-0.069 gcm^-3. The outer companion has m2 sini2 = 15.2 \pm
1.0 MJup, and orbits on a highly eccentric orbit of e2 = 0.691 \pm 0.018. While
we have not detected significant transit timing variations of HAT-P-13b, due to
gravitational and light-travel time effects, future observations will constrain
the orbital inclination of HAT-P-13c, along with its mutual inclination to
HAT-P-13b. The HAT-P-13 (b,c) double-planet system may prove extremely valuable
for theoretical studies of the formation and dynamics of planetary systems.
