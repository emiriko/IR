Based on renormalization group concepts and explicit mean field calculations
we study the universal contribution to the effective force and torque acting on
an ellipsoidal colloidal particle which is dissolved in a critical fluid and is
close to a homogeneous planar substrate. At the same closest distance between
the substrate and the surface of the particle, the ellipsoidal particle prefers
an orientation parallel to the substrate and the magnitude of the fluctuation
induced force is larger than if the orientation of the particle is
perpendicular to the substrate. The sign of the critical torque acting on the
ellipsoidal particle depends on the type of boundary conditions for the order
parameter at the particle and substrate surfaces, and on the pivot with respect
to which the particle rotates.
