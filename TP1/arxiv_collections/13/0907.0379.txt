We present the partial branching fraction for inclusive charmless
semileptonic B decays and the corresponding value of the CKM matrix element
|Vub|, using a multivariate analysis method to access ~90% of the B -> Xu l nu
phase space. This approach dramatically reduces the theoretical uncertainties
from the b-quark mass and non-perturbative QCD compared to all previous
inclusive measurements. The results are based on a sample of 657 million B
-Bbar pairs collected with the Belle detector. We find that Delta BR(B -> Xu l
nu; p^*B_l>1.0 GeV/c=1.963 x (1 +/- 0.088(stat.) +/- 0.081(sys.)) x 10^-3.
Corresponding values of |Vub| are extracted using several theoretical
calculations.
