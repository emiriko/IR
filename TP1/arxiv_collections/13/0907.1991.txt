In this paper we present some conditions for the (strong) stabilizability of
an n-D Quantum MIMO system P(X). It contains two parts. The first part is to
introduce the n-D Quantum MIMO systems where the coefficients vary in the
algebra of Q-meromorphic functions. Then we introduce some conditions for the
stabilizability of these systems. The second part is to show that this Quantum
system has the n-D system as its quantum limit and the results for the
SISO,SIMO,MISO,MIMO are obtained again as special cases.
