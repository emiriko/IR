We examine the possible trajectories of a classical particle, trapped in a
two-dimensional infinite rectangular well, using the Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
We observe that three types of trajectories are possible: periodic orbits, open
orbits and some special trajectories when the particle gets pocketed.
