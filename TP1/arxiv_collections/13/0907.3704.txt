Uncertainty relations play a central role in quantum mechanics. Entropic
uncertainty relations in particular have gained significant importance within
quantum information, providing the foundation for the security of many quantum
cryptographic protocols. Yet, rather little is known about entropic uncertainty
relations with more than two measurement settings. In this note we review known
results and open questions.
