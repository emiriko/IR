We investigate the dependence of the optical conductivity of bilayer graphene
(BLG) on the intra- and inter-layer interactions using the most complete model
to date. We show that the next nearest-neighbor intralayer coupling introduces
new features in the low-energy spectrum that are highly sensitive to sample
doping, changing significantly the ``universal'' conductance. Further, its
interplay with interlayer couplings leads to an anisotropy in conductance in
the ultraviolet range. We propose that experimental measurement of the optical
conductivity of intrinsic and doped BLG will provide a good benchmark for the
relative importance of intra- and inter-layer couplings at different doping
levels.
