We consider how the principles of causality and equivalence restrict the
background in which matter field theories are defined; those constraints
develop in restrictions for these matter field theories: the simplest matter
field theory aside, all other less simple matter field theories are too complex
therefore resulting to be inconsistent in general instances.
