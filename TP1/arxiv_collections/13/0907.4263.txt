We propose an EPR inequality based on an entropic uncertainty relation for
complementary continuous variable observables. This inequality is more
sensitive than the previously established EPR inequality based on inferred
variances, and opens up the possibility of EPR tests of quantum nonlocality in
a wider variety of quantum states. We experimentally test the inequality using
spatially entangled photons. For a particular quantum state, our experimental
results show a violation of the entropic EPR inequality, while the variance EPR
inequality is not violated.
