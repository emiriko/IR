Binary evolution predicts a population of helium core (M < 0.5 Msol) white
dwarfs (WDs) that are slowly accreting hydrogen-rich material from low mass
main sequence or brown dwarf donors with orbital periods less than four hours.
Four binaries are presently known in the Milky Way that will reach such a
mass-transferring state in a few Gyr. Despite these predictions and
observations of progenitor binaries, there are still no secure cases of helium
core WDs among the mass-transferring cataclysmic variables (CVs). This led us
to calculate the fate of He WDs once accretion begins at a rate Mdot < 1e-10
Msol/yr set by angular momentum losses. We show here that the cold He core
temperatures (T_c < 1e7 K) and low Mdot result in ~ 1e-3 Msol of accumulated
H-rich material at the onset of the thermonuclear runaway. Shara and
collaborators noted that these large accumulated masses may lead to
exceptionally long classical nova (CN) events. For a typical donor star of 0.2
Msol, such binaries will only yield a few hundred CNe, making these events rare
amongst all CNe. We calculate the reheating of the accreting WD, allowing a
comparison to the measured WD effective temperatures in quiescent dwarf novae
and raising the possibility that WD seismology may be the best way to confirm
the presence of a He WD. We also find that a very long (> 1000 yr) stable
burning phase occurs after the CN outburst, potentially explaining enigmatic
short orbital period supersoft sources like RX J0537-7034 (P_orb = 3.5 hr) and
1E 0035.4-7230 (P_orb = 4.1 hr).
