The DAMA/Libra experiment has recently confirmed the annual modulation signal
obtained in the earlier DAMA/NaI experiment, providing strong evidence that
they have actually detected dark matter. We examine the implications of this
experiment for the mirror dark matter candidate. We show that mirror dark
matter successfully explains the latest DAMA/Libra data, whilst also being
consistent with the null results of other direct detection experiments.
