We analyze flavor-changing-neutral-current (FCNC) effects in the $b\to s$
transitions that are induced by family non-universal $U(1)'$ gauge symmetries.
After systematically developing the necessary formalism, we present a
correlated analysis for the $\Delta B =1, 2$ processes. We adopt a
model-independent approach in which we only require family-universal charges
for the first and second generations and small fermion mixing angles. We
analyze the constraints on the resulting parameter space from $B_s - \bar B_s$
mixing and the time-dependent CP asymmetries of the penguin-dominated $B_d \to
(\pi, \phi, \eta', \rho, \omega, f_0)K_S$ decays. Our results indicate that the
currently observed discrepancies in some of these modes with respect to the
Standard Model predictions can be consistently accommodated within this general
class of models.
