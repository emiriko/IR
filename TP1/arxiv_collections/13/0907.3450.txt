A C++ class was written for the calculation of frequentist confidence
intervals using the profile likelihood method. Seven combinations of Binomial,
Gaussian, Poissonian and Binomial uncertainties are implemented. The package
provides routines for the calculation of upper and lower limits, sensitivity
and related properties. It also supports hypothesis tests which take
uncertainties into account. It can be used in compiled C++ code, in Python or
interactively via the ROOT analysis framework.
