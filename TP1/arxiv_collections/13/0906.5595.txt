The standard model Higgs boson can serve as the inflaton field of slow roll
inflationary models provided it exhibits a large non-minimal coupling with the
gravitational scalar curvature. The Higgs boson self interactions and its
couplings with a standard model singlet scalar serving as the source of dark
matter are then subject to cosmological constraints. These bounds, which can be
more stringent than those arising from vacuum stability and perturbative
triviality alone, still allow values for the Higgs boson mass which should be
accessible at the LHC. As the Higgs boson coupling to the dark matter
strengthens, lower values of the Higgs boson mass consistent with the
cosmological data are allowed.
