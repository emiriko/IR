Colbeck and Renner [arXiv:0801.2218] analyzed a class of combined models for
entanglements in which local and non-local hidden variables cooperate for
producing the measurement results. They came to the conclusion that the
measurement results are fully independent of the local components of the hidden
variables. Their conclusion is based mainly on an assumption on the local
hidden variables, assumption similar to the non-signaling property of
probabilities of observables' values. In the present text it is proved that
hidden variables are not observables, so their distributions of probabilities
do not necessarily possess the non-signaling property. Also, a counter-example
is brought to the Colbeck and Renner assumption, showing that their type of
models and conclusion are not general. The question whether hidden variables,
local or non-local, exist or not, remains open.
