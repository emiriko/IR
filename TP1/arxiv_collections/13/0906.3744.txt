We have rereduced Spitzer IRS spectra and reanalyzed the SED's of three
nearby debris disks: lambda Boo, HD 139664, and HR 8799. We find that that the
thermal emission from these objects is well modeled using two single
temperature black body components. For HR 8799 -- with no silicate emission
features despite a relatively hot inner dust component (Tgr = 150 K) -- we
infer the presence of an asteroid belt interior to and a Kuiper Belt exterior
to the recently discovered orbiting planets. For HD 139664, which has been
imaged in scattered light, we infer the presence of strongly forward scattering
grains, consistent with porous grains, if the cold, outer disk component
generates both the observed scattered light and thermal emission. Finally,
careful analysis of the lambda Boo SED suggests that this system possesses a
central clearing, indicating that selective accretion of solids onto the
central star does not occur from a dusty disk.
