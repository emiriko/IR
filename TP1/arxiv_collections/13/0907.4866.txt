In this article we study (possibly degenerate) stochastic differential
equations (SDE) with irregular (or discontiuous) coefficients, and prove that
under certain conditions on the coefficients, there exists a unique almost
everywhere stochastic (invertible) flow associated with the SDE in the sense of
Lebesgue measure. In the case of constant diffusions and BV drifts, we obtain
such a result by studying the related stochastic transport equation. In the
case of non-constant diffusions and Sobolev drifts, we use a direct method. In
particular, we extend the recent results on ODEs with non-smooth vector fields
to SDEs. Moreover, we also give a criterion for the existence of invariant
measures for the associated transition semigroup.
