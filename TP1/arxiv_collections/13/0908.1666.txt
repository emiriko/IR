In this paper, we study the category $\mathscr{H}^{(\rho)}$ of semi-stable
coherent sheaves of a fixed slope $\rho$ over a weighted projective curve. This
category has nice properties: it is a hereditary abelian finitary length
category. We will define the Ringel-Hall algebra of $\mathscr{H}^{(\rho)}$ and
relate it to generalized Kac-Moody Lie algebras. Finally we obtain the Kac type
theorem to describe the indecomposable objects in this category, i.e. the
indecomposable semi-stable sheaves.
