Mark 4 and LASCO C2, C3 coronagraph data analysis shows that, up to the
distance $R\sim$ 5 R$_\odot$ from the center of the Sun, the thickness of a
CME-generated shock front may be of order of the proton mean free path. This
means that the energy dissipation mechanism in a shock front at these distances
is collisional.
