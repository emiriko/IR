We show that charge ordered rare-earth nickelates of the type RNiO3 (R= Ho,
Lu, Pr and Nd) are multiferroic with very large magnetically induced
ferroelectric (FE) polarizations. This we determine from first principles
electronic structure calculations. The emerging FE polarization is directly
tied to the long-standing puzzle of which kind of magnetic ordering is present
in this class of materials: its direction and size indicate the type of
ground-state spin configuration that is realized. Vice versa, the small energy
differences between the different magnetic orderings suggest that a chosen
magnetic ordering can be stabilized by cooling the system in presence of an
electric field.
