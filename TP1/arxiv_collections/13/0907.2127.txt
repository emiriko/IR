Despite the observational evidence that the Universe appears hierarchically
structured up to a distance of at least 30 Mpc/h (and possibly up to 100
Mpc/h), the fractal paradigm has not yet been recognized by the majority of
cosmologists today. In this work we provide a brief overview of the recent
observational and theoretical advances relevant to the question of the global
cosmic structure and present some simple calculations which indicate how the
hierarchical structure may pass over to the homogeneous Universe at very large
scale. We show that the fractal structure may be derived from the moderately
nonuniform matter distribution. We address a number of epistemological
questions relevant to a general outlook of the Cosmos at large too.
