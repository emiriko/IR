Gamma-ray telescopes are capable of measuring radioactive trace isotopes from
cosmic nucleosynthesis events. Such measurements address new isotope production
rather directly for a few key isotopes such as 44Ti, 26Al, 60Fe, and 56Ni, as
well as positrons from the beta^+-decay variety. Experiments of the past
decades have now established an astronomy with gamma-ray lines, which is an
important part of the study of nucleosynthesis environments in cosmic sources.
For massive stars and supernovae, important constraints have been set: Co
isotope decays in SN1987A directly demonstrated the synthesis of new isotopes
in core-collapse supernovae, 44Ti from the 340-year old Cas A supernova
supports the concept of alpha-rich freeze-out, but results in interesting
puzzles pursued by theoretical studies and future experiments. 26Al and 60Fe
has been measured from superimposed nucleosynthesis within our Galaxy, and sets
constraints on massive-star interior structure through its intensity ratio of
~15%. The 26Al gamma-ray line is now seen to trace current star formation and
even the kinematics of interstellar medium throughout the Galaxy. Positron
annihilation emission from nucleosynthesis throughout the plane of our Galaxy
appears to be mainly from 26Al and other supernova radioactivity, but the
striking brightness of the Galaxy's bulge region in positron annihilation
gamma-rays presents a puzzle involving several astrophysics issues beyond
nuclear astrophysics. This paper focuses mainly on a discussion of 26Al and
60Fe from massive star nucleosynthesis.
