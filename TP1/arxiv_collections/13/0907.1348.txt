Motivated by recent experimental results reporting giant coercive fields in
Co(II)-based molecular magnets we present a theory of hysteresis phenomena
based on the Glauber stochastic dynamics. Unusual form of hysteresis loops is
similar to those of found in Co-based quasi-one-dimensional ferrimagnet CoPhOMe
at low temperatures. Temperature dependence of the coercive field has a
characteristic form with an inflection that may serve as an indicator of the
Glauber dynamics in real compounds. A relevance of the model for other Co-based
molecular magnets is discussed.
