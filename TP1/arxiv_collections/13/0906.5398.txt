We study analytically a model of a two dimensional, partially directed,
flexible or semiflexible polymer, attached to an attractive wall which is
perpendicular to the preferred direction. In addition, the polymer is stretched
by an externally applied force. We find that the wall has a dramatic effect on
the polymer. For wall attraction smaller than the non-sequential nearest
neighbor attraction, the fraction of monomers at the wall is zero and the model
is the same as that of a polymer without a wall. However, for greater than, the
fraction of monomers at the wall undergoes a first order transition from unity
at low temperature and small force, to zero at higher temperatures and forces.
We present phase diagram for this transition. Our results are confirmed by
Monte-Carlo simulations.
