This paper analyzes performance aspects of Soft Input Decryption and L
values. Soft Input Decryption is a novel method which uses L values (soft
output) of a SISO channel decoder for the correction of input of Soft Input
Decryption (SID blocks) which have been modified during the transmission over a
noisy channel. The method is based on the combination of cryptography and
channel coding improving characteristics of both of them. The algorithm,
strategies and scenarios of Soft Input Decryption are described.
