We study the propagation of sound in a homogeneous dipolar gas at zero
temperature, known as zero sound. We find that undamped sound propagation is
possible only in a range of solid angles around the direction of polarization
of the dipoles. Above a critical dipole moment, we find an unstable mode, by
which the gas collapses locally perpendicular to the dipoles' direction.
