We study 10D super Yang-Mills theory with the gauge groups $E_6$, $E_7$ and
$E_8$. We consider the torus/orbifold compacfitication with magnetic fluxes and
Wilson lines. They lead to 4D interesting models with three families of quarks
and leptons, whose profiles in extra dimensions are quasi-localized because of
magnetic fluxes.
