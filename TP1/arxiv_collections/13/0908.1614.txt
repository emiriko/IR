An emergent Fermi surface in a Mott insulator, an exotic quantum spin liquid
state, was suggested by Anderson in 1987. After a quick support for its
existence in spin-half Heisenberg model in a square lattice in a RVB mean field
theory, pseudo Fermi surface was found only recently in an exactly solvable
spin-3/2 model by Yao, Zhang and Kivelson. We show that a minimal spin-half
Kitaev model on a decorated square lattice exhibits a Fermi surface. Volume and
shape of the Fermi surface change with exchange couplings or on addition of a 3
spin interaction terms.
