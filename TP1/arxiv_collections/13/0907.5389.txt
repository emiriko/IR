Superfluid 3He-B belongs to the important special class of time-reversal
invariant topological superfluids. It has Majorana fermions as edge states on
the surface of bulk 3He-B. On the rough wall these fermion zero modes have
finite density of states at E=0. It is possible that Lancaster experiments with
a wire vibrating in 3He-B have already probed Majorana fermions living on the
surface of the wire.
