We describe repumping and spectroscopy of laser-cooled strontium (Sr) atoms
using the (5s5p)3P2 - (5s4d)3D2 transition. Atom number in a magneto-optical
trap is enhanced by driving this transition because Sr atoms that have decayed
into the (5s5p)3P2 dark state are repumped back into the (5s2)1S0 ground state.
Spectroscopy of 84Sr, 86Sr, 87Sr, and 88Sr improves the value of the (5s5p)3P2
- (5s4d)3D2 transition frequency for 88Sr and determines the isotope shifts for
the transition.
