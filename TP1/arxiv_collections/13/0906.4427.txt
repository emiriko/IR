A general orbit-averaged guiding-center Fokker-Planck operator suitable for
the numerical analysis of transport processes in axisymmetric magnetized
plasmas is presented. The orbit-averaged guiding-center operator describes
transport processes in a three-dimensional guiding-center invariant space: the
orbit-averaged magnetic-flux invariant $\ov{\psi}$, the minimum-B pitch-angle
coordinate $\xi_{0}$, and the momentum magnitude $p$.
