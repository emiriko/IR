As a step towards the classification of supergravity backgrounds with flux,
we study the (back-reacted) geometry created by a BPS M2-brane when it wraps a
cycle in a Calabi-Yau manifold. If it is to preserve supersymmetry, the
membrane background must obey certain conditions. These conditions are
expressed as geometrical constraints on differential forms and as such, can be
interpreted as calibrations. Knowing the complete set of calibrations is the
same as satisfying all conditions needed for supersymmetry preservation. While
a purely geometric background is completely specified through standard
calibrations, in order to fully describe a flux background, we must also state
its generalized calibrations. These can be found by probing the background with
BPS branes. The logic is simple. Since a BPS probe is guaranteed to be stable,
we require that its volume be given by a calibrated form. This applies equally
to both charged and uncharged probes; the former are stabilized by flux whereas
the latter achieve stability by minimizing their volumes. Volume-forms of
charged probes correspond to generalized calibrations and those of uncharged
probes, to standard calibrations. Previously geometries were probed only by
uncharged branes. The calibrations that were found had then to be supplemented
by additional conditions in order to guarantee supersymmetry preservation in
backgrounds with flux. Once the scope is broadened to include charged branes,
the 'missing conditions' (generalized calibrations) can also be recovered using
the probe analysis. We use this method to classify the backgrounds of wrapped
M2-branes embedded in Calabi-Yau manifolds by specifying their calibrations.
