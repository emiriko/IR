The $(\beta ^{+}\beta ^{+})_{0\nu}$ and $(\varepsilon \beta ^{+})_{0\nu}$
modes of $^{96}$Ru, $^{102}$Pd, $^{106}$Cd, $^{124}$Xe, $^{130}$Ba and
$^{156}$Dy isotopes are studied in the Projected Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov
framework for the $0^{+}\to 0^{+}$ transition. The reliability of the intrinsic
wave functions required to study these decay modes has been established in our
earlier works by obtaining an overall agreement between the theoretically
calculated spectroscopic properties, namely yrast spectra, reduced
$B(E2$:$0^{+}\to 2^{+})$ transition probabilities, quadrupole moments
$Q(2^{+})$ and gyromagnetic factors $g(2^{+})$ and the available experimental
data in the parent and daugther even-even nuclei. In the present work, the
required nuclear transition matrix elements are calculated in the Majorana
neutrino mass mechanism using the same set of intrinsic wave functions as used
to study the two neutrino positron double-$\beta $ decay modes. Limits on
effective light neutrino mass $< m_{\nu} >$ and effective heavy neutrino mass
$< M_{N} >$ are extracted from the observed limits on half-lives
$T_{1/2}^{0\nu}(0^{+}\to 0^{+})$ of $(\beta ^{+}\beta ^{+})_{0\nu}$ and
$(\varepsilon \beta ^{+})_{0\nu}$ modes. We also investigate the effect of
quadrupolar correlations vis-a-vis deformation on NTMEs required to study the
$(\beta ^{+}\beta ^{+})_{0\nu}$ and $(\varepsilon \beta ^{+})_{0\nu}$ modes.
