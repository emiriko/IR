We summarise recent neutrino and antineutrino measurements near 1 GeV by the
K2K, MiniBooNE and SciBooNE collaborations. We focus on experimental methods
and note discrepancies between the most commonly used models for
neutrino-nucleus interactions and recent high statistics observations of
charged-current quasi-elastic scattering as well as charged and neutral current
pion production on carbon and oxygen. We discuss possible directions for future
measurements.
