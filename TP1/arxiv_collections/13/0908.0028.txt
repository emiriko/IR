Developing expertise in physics entails learning to use mathematics
effectively and efficiently as applied to the context of physical situations.
Doing so involves coordinating a variety of concepts and skills including
mathematical processing, computation, blending ancillary information with the
math, and reading out physical implications from the math and vice versa. From
videotaped observations of intermediate level students solving problems in
groups, we note that students often "get stuck" using a limited group of skills
or reasoning and fail to notice that a different set of tools (which they
possess and know how to use effectively) could quickly and easily solve their
problem. We refer to a student's perception/judgment of the kind of knowledge
that is appropriate to bring to bear in a particular situation as
epistemological framing. Although epistemological framing is often unstated
(and even unconscious), in group problem solving situations students sometimes
get into disagreements about how to progress. During these disagreements, they
bring forth explicit reasons or warrants in support of their point of view. For
the context of mathematics use in physics problem solving, we present a system
for classifying physics students' warrants. This warrant analysis offers
tangible evidence of their epistemological framing.
