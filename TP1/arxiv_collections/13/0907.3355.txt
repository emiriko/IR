In the context of surveillance of health problems, the research carried out
by the French national occupational disease surveillance and prevention network
(R\'eseau National de Vigilance et de Pr\'evention des Pathologies
Professionnelles, RNV3P) aims to develop, among other approaches, methods of
surveillance, statistical analysis and modeling in order to study the structure
and change over time of relationships between disease and exposure, and to
detect emerging disease-exposure associations. In this perspective, this paper
aims to present the concept of the "exposome" and to explain on what bases it
is constructed. The exposome is defined as a network of relationships between
occupational health problems that have in common one or several elements of
occupational exposure (exposures, occupation and/or activity sector). The paper
also aims to outline its potential for the study and programmed surveillance of
composite disease-occupational exposure associations. We illustrate this
approach by applying it to a sample from the RNV3P data, taking malignant
tumours and focusing on the subgroup of non-Hodgkin lymphomas.
