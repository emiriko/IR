This paper is concerned with mathematical modeling of intelligent systems,
such as human crowds and animal groups. In particular, the focus is on the
emergence of different self-organized patterns from non-locality and anisotropy
of the interactions among individuals. A mathematical technique by
time-evolving measures is introduced to deal with both macroscopic and
microscopic scales within a unified modeling framework. Then self-organization
issues are investigated and numerically reproduced at the proper scale,
according to the kind of agents under consideration.
