We study spontaneously generated entanglement (SGE) between two identical
multilevel atoms in free space via vacuum-induced radiative coupling. We show
that the SGE in two-atom systems may initially increase with time but
eventually vanishes in the time scale determined by the excited state lifetime
and radiative coupling strength between the two atoms. We demonstrate that a
steady-state SGE can be established by incoherently pumping the excited states
of the two-atom system. We have shown that an appropriate rate of incoherent
pump can help producing optimal SGE. The multilevel systems offer us more
chanel to establish entanglement. The system under consideration could be
realized in a tight trap or atoms/ions doped in a solid substrate.
