We analyze the decays to muons of a light dilaton produced via vector boson
fusion at the LHC. We investigate models in which the electroweak symmetry
breaking is triggered by a spontaneously broken, approximately conformal
sector. Taking into account the possibility of shifts in the dilaton Yukawa
couplings to muons, we find a rather promising scenario for the conformal model
search in the channel, with the possibility for a dilaton discovery at a
delivered luminosity of 100 fb-1 at the LHC or, alternatively, for an extension
of the exclusion zone in the model parameter space, until now fixed by the
Tevatron.
