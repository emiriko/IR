These are the transcriptions of "a talk describing the theoretical insights
of those honored (and the one who wasn't) and how this has led to all the
physics we have been doing over the last couple of decades." After prologue, we
first deal with Nambu's insight on Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking, which is
rooted in an analogy with the BCS theory of superconductivity. The insight
resonates to this day, as we await the LHC era to dawn. The second half starts
from Gell-Mann--L\'evy--Cabibbo theory, through the GIM mechanism that
completed the $2\times 2$ rotations, to the insight of Kobayashi and Maskawa
that CP violation could arise from the charged currents, if there exists a 3rd
generation of quarks. The richness that followed defines this (FPCP)
conference. We end with a perspective on a (possible) redux with a 4th
generation of quarks.
