We consider the high probability state transfers and entanglements between
different nodes of the spin-1/2 chains governed by the XXZ-Hamiltonian using
the inhomogeneous stationary external magnetic field. Examples of three-,
four-, ten- and twenty-node chains are represented. A variant of realization of
the proper inhomogeneous magnetic field is discussed.
