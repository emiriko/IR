Using a collection of twelve semiconducting carbon nanotube samples, each
highly enriched in a single chirality, we study the chirality dependence of the
$K$-momentum dark singlet exciton using phonon sideband optical spectroscopy.
Measurements of bright absorptive and emissive sidebands of this finite
momentum exciton identify its energy as 20 - 38 meV above the bright singlet
exciton, a separation that exhibits systematic dependencies on tube diameter,
$2n+m$ family, and semiconducting type. We present calculations that explain
how chiral angle dependence in this energy separation relates to the Coulomb
exchange interaction, and elaborate the dominance of the $K_{A_1'}$ phonon
sidebands over the zone-center phonon sidebands over a wide range of
chiralities. The Kataura plot arising from these data is qualitatively well
described by theory, but the energy separation between the sidebands shows a
larger chiral dependence than predicted. This latter observation may indicate a
larger dispersion for the associated phonon near the $K$ point than expected
from finite distance force modeling.
