We study actions of discrete groups on Hilbert $C^*$-modules induced from
topological actions on compact Hausdorff spaces. We show non-amenability of
actions of non-amenable and non-a-T-menable groups, provided there exists a
quasi-invariant probability measure which is sufficiently close to being
invariant.
