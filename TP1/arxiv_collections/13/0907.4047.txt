The HLS Model, equipped with a mechanism providing the breaking of U(3)/SU(3)
symmetry and an isospin symmetry breaking leading naturally to vector meson
mixing, has been recently shown to successfully account for $e^+ e^- \ra
\pi^+\pi^-$ cross section and for the dipion spectrum in $\tau$ decay. The
present study shows that the full anomalous sector of the HLS model can be
considered and is validated by the experimental data. Indeed, this extended
model provides a successful simultaneous fit to the $e^+ e^- \ra \pi^+\pi^-$
data together with the available data on $e^+ e^- \ra \pi^0\gamma$, $e^+ e^-
\ra \eta\gamma$ and $e^+ e^- \ra \pi^0 \pi^+\pi^-$ cross sections. It is shown
that the fit of these data sets also predicts an accurate description of the
$\eta/\eta^\prime \ra \pi^+ \pi^- \gamma$ decays fully consistent with the
reported information on their branching fractions and spectra. Finally, one
also derives from our global fits products of widths of the form $\Gamma (V \ra
f_1)\Gamma(V \ra e^+ e^-) $ and ratios of the form $\Gamma (V \ra f_1)/\Gamma
(V \ra f_2)$ describing decays of vector mesons to several non--leptonic final
states.
