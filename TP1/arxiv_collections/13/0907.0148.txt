In this article, we give an explicit calculation of the partial Fourier
transform of the $\Box_b$-heat equation on quadric submanifolds of $M\subset
C^n\times C^m$. As a consequence, we can also compute the heat kernel
associated to the weighted dbar-equation in $C^n$ when the weight is given by
$\exp(-\phi(z,z)\cdot\lambda)$ where $\phi: C^n\times C^n\to C^m$ is a
quadratic, sesquilinear form and $\lambda\in R^m$. Our method involves the
representation theory of the Lie group $M$ and the group Fourier transform.
