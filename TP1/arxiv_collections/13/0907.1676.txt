The goal of this work is to present an approach to the homogeneous Boltzmann
equation for Maxwellian molecules with a physical collision kernel which allows
us to construct unique solutions to the initial value problem in a space of
probability measures defined via the Fourier transform. In that space, the
second moment of a measure is not assumed to be finite, so infinite energy
solutions are not {\it a priori} excluded from our considerations. Moreover, we
study the large time asymptotics of solutions and, in a particular case, we
give an elementary proof of the asymptotic stability of self-similar solutions
