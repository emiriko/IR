We present briefly the Nondeterministic Waiting Time algorithm. Our technique
for the simulation of biochemical reaction networks has the ability to mimic
the Gillespie Algorithm for some networks and solutions to ordinary
differential equations for other networks, depending on the rules of the
system, the kinetic rates and numbers of molecules. We provide a full
description of the algorithm as well as specifics on its implementation. Some
results for two well-known models are reported. We have used the algorithm to
explore Fas-mediated apoptosis models in cancerous and HIV-1 infected T cells.
