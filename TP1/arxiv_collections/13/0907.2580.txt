We present the full evaluation of a cold atom gyroscope based on atom
interferometry. We have performed extensive studies to determine the systematic
errors, scale factor and sensitivity. We demonstrate that the acceleration
noise can be efficiently removed from the rotation signal allowing to reach the
fundamental limit of the quantum projection noise for short term measurements.
The technical limits to the long term sensitivity and accuracy have been
identified, clearing the way for the next generations of ultra-sensitive atom
gyroscopes.
