Single crystal ZnO nanowires doped with indium are synthesized via the
laser-assisted chemical vapor deposition method. The conductivity of the
nanowires is measured at low temperatures in magnetic fields both perpendicular
and parallel to the wire axes. A quantitative fit of our data is obtained,
consistent with the theory of a quasi-one-dimensional metallic system with
quantum corrections due to weak localization and electron-electron
interactions. The anisotropy of the magneto-conductivity agrees with theory.
The two quantum corrections are of approximately equal magnitude with
respective temperature dependences of T^-1/3 and T^-1/2. The alternative model
of quasi-two-dimensional surface conductivity is excluded by the absence of
oscillations in the magneto-conductivity in parallel magnetic fields.
