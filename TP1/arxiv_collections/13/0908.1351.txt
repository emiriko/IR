Phase variation, or stochastic switching between alternative states of gene
expression, is common among microbes, and may be important in coping with
changing environments. We use a theoretical model to assess whether such
switching is a good strategy for growth in environments with occasional
catastrophic events. We find that switching can be advantageous, but only when
the environment is responsive to the microbial population. In our model,
microbes switch randomly between two phenotypic states, with different growth
rates. The environment undergoes sudden "catastrophes", the probability of
which depends on the composition of the population. We derive a simple
analytical result for the population growth rate. For a responsive environment,
two alternative strategies emerge. In the "no switching" strategy, the
population maximises its instantaneous growth rate, regardless of catastrophes.
In the "switching" strategy, the microbial switching rate is tuned to minimise
the environmental response. Which of these strategies is most favourable
depends on the parameters of the model. Previous studies have shown that
microbial switching can be favourable when the environment changes in an
unresponsive fashion between several states. Here, we demonstrate an
alternative role for phase variation in allowing microbes to maximise their
growth in catastrophic responsive environments.
