The MAGIC telescope has detected for the first time pulsed gamma-rays from
the Crab pulsar in the VHE domain. The observations were performed with a newly
developed trigger system that allows us to lower the energy threshold of the
telescope from 55 GeV to 25 GeV. We present a comparison of light curves
measured by our experiment with the one measured by space detectors. A strong
energy dependent decrease of the first peak with respect to the second peak
P1/P2 could be observed. Finally, fitting our measured data and previous
measurements from EGRET we determine a turnover of the energy spectrum at 17.7
+- 2.8 (stat.) +- 5.0 (syst.) GeV, assuming an exponential cutoff. This rules
out the scenario in which the gamma rays are produced in vicinity of the polar
caps of the neutron star.
