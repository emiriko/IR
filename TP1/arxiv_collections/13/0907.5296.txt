An experimental investigation is made of sub-recoil cooling by velocity
selective coherent population trapping in a two-level system in Sr. The
experiment is carried out using the narrow linewidth intercombination line at
689 nm. Here, the ratio between the recoil shift and the linewidth is as high
as 0.64. We show that, on top of a broader momentum profile, subrecoil features
develop, whose amplitude is strongly dependent on the detuning from resonance.
We attribute this structure to a velocity selective coherent population
trapping mechanism. We also show that the population trapping phenomenon leads
to complex momentum profiles in the case of highly saturated transitions,
displaying a multitude of subrecoil features at integer multiples of the recoil
momentum.
