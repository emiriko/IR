The phenomenological theory for "topological" Hall effect (THE) is proposed.
The theory can be used for qualitative analysis of THE in the medium with
arbitrary magnetization distribution. In the paper the cylindrical particle
with "vortex" magnetization is considered. The hysteresis loop of THE is
qualitatively different comparing to abnormal Hall effect. The estimation of
THE magnitude in the "vortex" particle is made. For Co particle with 100 nm
diameter the THE exceeds normal and abnormal Hall effects until an external
magnetic field less than 200 Oe.
