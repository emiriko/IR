We present a study of ten B-meson decays to a D(*), a proton-antiproton pair,
and a system of up to two pions using BaBar's data set of 455x10^6 BBbar pairs.
Four of the modes (B0bar -> D0 p anti-p, B0bar -> D*0 p anti-p, B0bar -> D+ p
anti-p pi-, B0bar -> D*+ p anti-p pi-) are studied with improved statistics
compared to previous measurements; six of the modes (B- -> D0 p anti-p pi-, B-
-> D*0 p anti-p pi-, B0bar -> D0 p anti-p pi- pi+, B0bar -> D*0 p anti-p pi-
pi+, B- -> D+ p anti-p pi- pi-, B- -> D*+ p anti-p pi- pi-) are first
observations. The branching fractions for 3- and 5-body decays are suppressed
compared to 4-body decays. Kinematic distributions for 3-body decays show
non-overlapping threshold enhancements in m(p anti-p) and m(D(*)0 p) in the
Dalitz plots. For 4-body decays, m(p pi-) mass projections show a narrow peak
with mass and full width of (1497.4 +- 3.0 +- 0.9) MeV/c2, and (47 +- 12 +- 4)
MeV/c2, respectively, where the first (second) errors are statistical
(systematic). For 5-body decays, mass projections are similar to phase space
expectations. All results are preliminary.
