We introduce a 3D hybrid model for streamer discharges that follows the
dynamics of single electrons in the region with strong field enhancement at the
streamer tip while approximating the many electrons in the streamer interior as
densities. We explain the method and present first results for negative
streamers in nitrogen. We focus on the high electron energies observed in the
simulation.
