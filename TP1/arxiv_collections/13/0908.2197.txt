Exclusive $\pi^0$ electroproduction from nucleons at large $Q^2$ can be
described by Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs), particularly the chiral
odd subset related to transversity. These GPDs can be accessed experimentally
from various cross sections and asymmetries. We calculate these GPDs in a
spectator model, constrained by boundary functions. Alternatively, in a
hadronic picture the meson production amplitudes correspond to C-odd Regge
exchanges with final state interactions. The helicity structure provides
relations between the partonic and the hadronic, Regge description of C-odd,
chiral-odd processes. Calculations show how the tensor charge and other
transversity parameters can be
