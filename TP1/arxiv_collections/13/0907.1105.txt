We present a first precision analysis of the transverse-momentum spectrum of
gaugino pairs produced at the Tevatron and the LHC with center-of-mass energies
of 1.96 and 10 or 14 TeV, respectively. Our calculation is based on a universal
resummation formalism at next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy, which is
consistently matched to the perturbative prediction at ${\cal O}(\alpha_s)$.
Numerical results are given for the "gold-plated" associated production of
neutralinos and charginos decaying into three charged leptons with missing
transverse energy as well as for the pair production of neutralinos and
charginos at two typical benchmark points in the constrained Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model. We show that the matched resummation results
differ considerably from the Monte Carlo predictions employed traditionally in
experimental analyses and discuss the impact on the determination of
supersymmetric mass parameters from derived transverse-mass spectra. We also
investigate in detail the theoretical uncertainties coming from scale and
parton-density function variations and non-perturbative effects.
