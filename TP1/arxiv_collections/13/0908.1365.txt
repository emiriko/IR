We investigate the tachyonic nature of the de Broglie matter waves associated
with a free quantum object to show that granting reality to them would lend
completeness to the quantum description of reality. Basing on the robustness of
the well known Einstein-de Broglie reciprocal relation between the phase and
the particle velocities, we extend the concept of complementarity to them and
thereby propose a complementary relation between a bradyon and its
corresponding tachyon (i.e. the associated matter wave) to endow the tachyons
with a degree of reality, at least on par with the bradyons, within the current
framework of quantum physics and extended relativity. The duality is used to
argue that because of the observed localised nature of bradyons, tachyons
should always be pervasive or global in character and thus, there can be no
point-like tachyons. A common misconception regarding the nonrelativistic limit
of the Einstein-de Broglie relation is pointed out and the consequent error of
long standing is remedied.
