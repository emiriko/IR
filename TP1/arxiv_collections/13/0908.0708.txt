In three spatial dimensions, particles are limited to either bosonic or
fermionic statistics. Two-dimensional systems, on the other hand, can support
anyonic quasiparticles exhibiting richer statistical behaviours. An exciting
proposal for quantum computation is to employ anyonic statistics to manipulate
information. Since such statistical evolutions depend only on topological
characteristics, the resulting computation is intrinsically resilient to
errors. So-called non-Abelian anyons are most promising for quantum
computation, but their physical realization may prove to be complex. Abelian
anyons, however, are easier to understand theoretically and realize
experimentally. Here we show that complex topological memories inspired by
non-Abelian anyons can be engineered in Abelian models. We explicitly
demonstrate the control procedures for the encoding and manipulation of quantum
information in specific lattice models that can be implemented in the
laboratory. This bridges the gap between requirements for anyonic quantum
computation and the potential of state-of-the-art technology.
