Fine particles of some of the extensively studied 'enhanced' Pauli
paramagnets - LuCo2, ScCo2, ZrCo2 and CeRu2Si2, have been prepared by
high-energy ball-milling and investigated for their magnetic behavior. In the
case of Co systems, these particles show ferromagnetic features even at room
temperature. In the case of CeRu2Si2, a well-known Kondo lattice which is
non-magnetic in the bulk form, features attributable to the onset of magnetic
order below about 8 K could be seen in the fine particles. The magnitudes of
the magnetic moment of these small particles at high fields are sufficiently
large to conclude that the observed magnetic ordering is not just a surface
effect. This transformation to magnetic ordering in small particles could be
widespread among enhanced Pauli paramagnets.
