The orbitally degenerate A-site spinel compound FeSc2S4 has been
experimentally identified as a ``spin-orbital liquid'', with strong
fluctuations of both spins and orbitals. Assuming that the second neighbor spin
exchange J2 is the dominant one, we argued in a recent theoretical study [Chen
et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 096406 (2009)] that FeSc2S4 is in a local
``spin-orbital singlet'' state driven by spin orbit coupling, close to a
quantum critical point, which separates the ``spin-orbital singlet'' phase from
a magnetically and orbitally ordered phase. In this paper, we refine further
and develop this theory of FeSc2S4 . First, we show that inclusion of a small
first neighbor exchange J1 induces a narrow region of incommensurate phase near
the quantum critical point. Next, we derive the phase diagram in the presence
of an external magnetic field B, and show that the latter suppresses the
ordered phase. Lastly, we compute the field dependent dynamical magnetic
susceptibility $\chi(k, \omega; B)$, from which we extract a variety of
physical quantities. Comparison with and suggestions for experiment are
discussed.
