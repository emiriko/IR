The Nice model of Gomes et al. (2005) suggests that the migration of the
giant planets caused a planetesimal clearing event which led to the Late Heavy
Bombardment (LHB) at 880 Myr. Here we investigate the IR emission from the
Kuiper belt during the history of the Solar System as described by the Nice
model. We describe a method for easily converting the results of n-body
planetesimal simulations into observational properties (assuming black-body
grains and a single size distribution) and further modify this method to
improve its realism (using realistic grain properties and a three-phase size
distribution). We compare our results with observed debris discs and evaluate
the plausibility of detecting an LHB-like process in extrasolar systems. Recent
surveys have shown that 4% of stars exhibit 24 um excess and 16% exhibit 70 um
excess. We show that the Solar System would have been amongst the brightest of
these systems before the LHB at both 24 and 70 um. We find a significant
increase in 24 um emission during the LHB, which rapidly drops off and becomes
undetectable within 30 Myr, whereas the 70 um emission remains detectable until
360 Myr after the LHB. Comparison with the statistics of debris disc evolution
shows that such depletion events must be rare occurring around less than 12% of
Sun-like stars and with this level of incidence we would expect approximately 1
of the 413 Sun-like, field stars so far detected to have a 24 um excess to be
currently going through an LHB. We also find that collisional processes are
important in the Solar System before the LHB and that parameters for weak
Kuiper belt objects are inconsistent with the Nice model interpretation of the
LHB.
