Combining multiple ultrafast spin torque impulses with a 5 nanosecond
duration pulse for damping reduction, we observe time-domain precession which
evolves from an initial 1 ns duration transient with changing precessional
amplitude to constant amplitude oscillations persisting for over 2 ns. These
results are consistent with relaxation of the transient trajectories to a
stable orbit with nearly zero damping. We find that in order to observe
complete damping cancellation and the transient behavior in a time domain
sampling measurement, a short duration, fast rise-time pulse is required to
cancel damping without significant trajectory dephasing.
