There is a certain consensus that the very fast growth of the relaxation time
$\tau$ occurring in glass-forming liquids on lowering the temperature must be
due to the thermally activated rearrangement of correlated regions of growing
size. Even though measuring the size of these regions has defied scientists for
a while, there is indeed recent evidence of a growing correlation length $\xi$
in glass-formers. If we use Arrhenius law and make the mild assumption that the
free-energy barrier to rearrangement scales as some power $\psi$ of the size of
the correlated regions, we obtain a relationship between time and length,
$T\log\tau \sim \xi^\psi$. According to both the Adam-Gibbs and the Random
First Order theory the correlation length grows as $\xi \sim
(T-T_k)^{-1/(d-\theta)}$, even though the two theories disagree on the value of
$\theta$. Therefore, the super-Arrhenius growth of the relaxation time with the
temperature is regulated by the two exponents $\psi$ and $\theta$ through the
relationship $T\log\tau \sim (T-T_k)^{-\psi/(d-\theta)}$. Despite a few
theoretical speculations, up to now there has been no experimental
determination of these two exponents. Here we measure them numerically in a
model glass-former, finding $\psi=1$ and $\theta=2$. Surprisingly, even though
the values we found disagree with most previous theoretical suggestions, they
give back the well-known VFT law for the relaxation time, $T\log\tau \sim
(T-T_k)^{-1}$.
