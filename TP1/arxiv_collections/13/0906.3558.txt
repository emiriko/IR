We report a method for estimating people's achievement based on their fame.
Earlier we discovered (cond-mat/0310049) that fame of fighter pilot aces
(measured as number of Google hits) grows exponentially with their achievement
(number of victories). We hypothesize that the same functional relation between
achievement and fame holds for other professions. This allows us to estimate
achievement for professions where an unquestionable and universally accepted
measure of achievement does not exist. We apply the method to Nobel Prize
winners in Physics. For example, we obtain that Paul Dirac, who is hundred
times less famous than Einstein contributed to physics only two times less. We
compare our results with Landau's ranking.
