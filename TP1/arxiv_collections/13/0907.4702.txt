The NA60 experiment at the CERN SPS studied phi meson production in In-In
collisions at 158 A GeV via muon and kaon decay channels. Results in the
hadronic channel are presented for the first time. These are discussed in the
framework of the so-called phi puzzle through the comparison with the previous
NA60 measurements in the muon channel. The yield and inverse m_T slopes
observed in the two channels are compatible within errors, showing that the
large discrepancies seen in Pb-Pb collisions between NA50 (muon pairs) and NA49
(kaon pairs) are not seen in the NA60 In-In data.
