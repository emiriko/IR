Two quantized charge pumps are operated in parallel. The total current
generated is shown to be far more accurate than the current produced with just
one pump operating at a higher frequency. With the application of a
perpendicular magnetic field the accuracy of quantization is shown to be $< $20
ppm for a current of $108.9 $pA. The scheme for parallel pumping presented in
this work has applications in quantum information processing, the generation of
single photons in pairs and bunches, neural networking and the development of a
quantum standard for electrical current. All these applications will benefit
greatly from the increase in output current without the characteristic decrease
in accuracy as a result of high-frequency operation.
