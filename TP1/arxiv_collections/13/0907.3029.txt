The radiation reaction problem for an electric charge moving in flat
space-time of three dimensions is discussed. The divergences stemming from the
pointness of the particle are studied. A consistent regularization procedure is
proposed, which exploits the Poincar\'e invariance of the theory. Effective
equation of motion of radiating charge in an external electromagnetic field is
obtained via the consideration of energy-momentum and angular momentum
conservation. This equation includes the effect of the particle's own field.
The radiation reaction is determined by the Lorentz force of point-like charge
acting upon itself plus a non-local term which provides finiteness of the
self-action.
