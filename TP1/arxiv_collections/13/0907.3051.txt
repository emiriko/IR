A detailed analysis of the remainder obtained by truncating the Euler series
up to the $n$th-order term is presented. In particular, by using an approach
recently proposed by Weniger, asymptotic expansions of the remainder, both in
inverse powers and in inverse rising factorials of $n$, are obtained. It is
found that the corresponding expanding coefficients are expressed, in closed
form, in terms of exponential polynomials, well known in combinatorics, and in
terms of associated Laguerre polynomials, respectively. A study of the
divergence and/or of the convergence of the above expansions is also carried
out for positive values of the Euler series argument.
