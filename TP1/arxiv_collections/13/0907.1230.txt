The frustrated magnet clinoatacamite, $\gamma$-Cu$_2$(OH)$_3$Cl, is
attracting a lot of interest after suggestions that at low temperature it forms
an exotic quantum state termed a Valence Bond Solid (VBS) made from dimerised
Cu$^{2+}$ ($S=1/2$) spins.\cite{Lee_clinoatacamite} Key to the arguments
surrounding this proposal were suggestions that the kagom\'e planes in the
magnetic pyrochlore lattice of clinoatacamite are only weakly coupled, causing
the system to behave as a quasi-2-dimensional magnet. This was reasoned from
the near 95$^\circ$ angles made at the bridging oxygens that mediate exchange
between the Cu ions that link the kagom\'e planes.
  Recent work pointed out that this exchange model is inappropriate for
$\gamma$-Cu$_2$(OH)$_3$Cl, where the oxygen is present as a
$\mu_3$-OH.\cite{Wills_JPC} Further, it used symmetry calculations and neutron
powder diffraction to show that the low temperature magnetic structure ($T<6$
K) was canted and involved significant spin ordering on all the Cu$^{2+}$
spins, which is incompatible with the interpretation of simultaneous VBS and
N\'eel ordering. Correspondingly, clinoatacamite is best considered a distorted
pyrochlore magnet. In this report we show detailed inelastic neutron scattering
spectra and revisit the responses of this frustrated quantum magnet.
