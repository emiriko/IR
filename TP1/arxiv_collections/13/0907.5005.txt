The jet of the radio galaxy M87 is misaligned, resulting in a Doppler factor
delta~1 for emission of plasma moving parallel to the jet. This makes the
observed fast TeV flares on timescales of t_v~5R_g/c harder to understand as
emission from the jet. In previous work, we have proposed a jets-in-a-jet model
for the ultra-fast TeV flares with t_v<<R_g/c seen in Mrk 501 and PKS 2155-304.
Here, we show that about half of the minijets beam their emission outside the
jet cone. Minijets emitting off the jet axis result in rapidly evolving TeV
(and maybe lower energy) flares that can be observed in nearby radio galaxies.
The TeV flaring from M87 fits well into this picture, if M87 is a misaligned
blazar.
