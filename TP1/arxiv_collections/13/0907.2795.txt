The purpose of this work is to test the ability of a new class of passive
electromagnetic device to increase the penetration depth of phased arrays of
surface coils for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging systems. This new device is
based on the emerging technology of metamaterials and behaves like a lens for
the radiofrequency magnetic fields. The presented device was tested in several
1.5-T MR systems from different companies in combination with different phased
arrays. One of the authors was enrolled as volunteer for the experiments. In
these experiments his knees were imaged by using a dual phased array. The
device was placed between the knees to check that the penetration depth of the
coils was improved by this passive device. In all the experiments the presented
device was successfully tested and it was checked that the knees of the
volunteer can be imaged at deeper distances and that the signal-to-noise-ratio
(SNR) in the obtained MR images was improved by the presence of the lens. The
presented device has proven to increase the penetration depth of MR phased
arrays of surface coils. The lens was tested by means of the MR imaging of the
knees but it can be used to image any pair of joints simultaneously by placing
it between the joints. The positive results suggest the possibility of using
the lens to image the female breast. This would make it possible to increase
the SNR without higher fields, thus fulfilling the safety regulations governing
the standard absorption rate (SAR).
