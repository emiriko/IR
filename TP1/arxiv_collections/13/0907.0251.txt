Neutrinos emitted from a core-collapse supernova can experience collective
flavor transformation because of high neutrino fluxes. As a result, neutrinos
of different flavors can have their energy spectra (partially) swapped, a
phenomenon known as the (stepwise) spectral swapping or spectral split. We give
a brief review of a simple model that explains this phenomenon.
