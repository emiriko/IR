Weyl's law approximates the number of states in a quantum system by
partitioning the energetically accessible phase-space volume into Planck cells.
Here we show that typical resonances in generic open quantum systems follow a
modified, fractal Weyl law, even though their classical dynamics is not
globally chaotic but also contains domains of regular motion. Besides the
obvious ramifications for quantum decay, this delivers detailed insight into
quantum-to-classical correspondence, a phenomenon which is poorly understood
for generic quantum-dynamical systems.
