Multi-qudit systems are studied in tomographic probability representations of
quantum qudit states. Results of calculations for Bell-type numbers within the
framework of classical probability theory and in quantum tomography are
compared. Violation of Bell-type inequalities are shown explicitly using the
method of averaging in tomographic picture of quantum states.
