The standard model of particle physics is generalized so as to be furnished
with a horizontal symmetry generated by an intermediary algebra between simple
Lie algebras $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ and $\mathfrak{su}(3)$. Above a certain high
energy scale $\breve{\Lambda}$, the horizontal gauge symmetry is postulated to
hold so that the basic fermions, quarks and leptons, form its fundamental
triplets, and a triplet and singlet of the horizontal gauge fields distinguish
generational degrees of freedom. A horizontal scalar triplet is introduced to
make the gauge fields super-massive by breaking the horizontal symmetry at
$\breve{\Lambda}$. From this scalar triplet, there emerge real scalar fields
which do not interact with fermions except for neutrino species and may give
substantial influence on evolution of the universe. Another horizontal scalar
triplet which breaks the electroweak symmetry at a low energy scale
$\Lambda\simeq 2\times 10^2$GeV reproduces all of the results of the
Weinberg-Salam theory, produces hierarchical mass matrices with less numbers of
unknown parameters in a unified way and predicts six massive scalar particles,
some of which might be observed by the future LHC experiment.
