In a liberal evolutionary scenario, mass can escape from a binary during eras
of fast mass transfer. We calculate the mass lost by binaries with a B-type
primary at birth where mass transfer starts during hydrogen core burning of the
donor. We simulate the distribution of mass-ratios and orbital periods for
those interacting binaries. The amount of time the binary shows Algol
characteristics within different values of mass-ratio and orbital period has
been fixed from conservative and liberal evolutionary calculations. We use
these data to simulate the distribution of mass-ratios and orbital periods of
Algols with the conservative as well as the liberal model. We compare
mass-ratios and orbital periods of Algols obtained by conservative evolution
with those obtained by our liberal model. Since binaries with a late B-type
primary evolve almost conservatively, the overall distribution of mass-ratios
will only yield a few Algols more with high mass-ratios than conservative
calculations do. Whereas the simulated distribution of orbital periods of
Algols fits the observations well, the simulated distribution of mass-ratios
produces always too few systems with large values.
