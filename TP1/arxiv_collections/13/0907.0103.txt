The present study gives an overview and emphasizes principal moments of the
applications of the turbulence-resolving modeling with large-eddy simulation
(LES) numerical technique to planetary boundary layer (PBL) research and
climate studies. LES proved to be very useful in understanding of the
atmospheric and ocean turbulent exchange and ultimately in parameterization
improvement in traditional meteorological models. LES have played a key role in
recognizing the importance of previously ignored self-organized structures in
the geophysical turbulence. LES assisted theoreticians and weather/climate
modelers with reliable information about the averaged vertical structure of the
PBL in convection and shear regimes as well as with better estimations of key
PBL parameters, e.g. an entrainment rate, for model calibrations. At present,
LES are an essential, indispensible part of geosciences, while the mainstream
of the LES research still deals with idealized case studies with rather simple
micro-physics.
