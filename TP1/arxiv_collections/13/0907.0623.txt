Subjecting a solution of 228Th to ultrasound (20 kHz, 100W), Cardone et al.
[Phys. Lett. A 373 (2009) 1956] claim to observe an increase in the
transformation or decay rate of 228Th by a factor of 104. The evidence provided
seems however far from conclusive and in part contradictory to the claims made.
In fact, looking at the presented data we find it cannot be taken as
justification to discard the null hypothesis, namely, that the data from
exposed and non exposed samples are drawn from the same distribution. We
suggest a number of additional tests that should be made in order to improve
the quality of the study and test the hypothesis of so-called piezonuclear
reactions.
