In this paper, by introducing a new user similarity index base on the
diffusion process, we propose a modified collaborative filtering (MCF)
algorithm, which has remarkably higher accuracy than the standard collaborative
filtering. In the proposed algorithm, the degree correlation between users and
objects is taken into account and embedded into the similarity index by a
tunable parameter. The numerical simulation on a benchmark data set shows that
the algorithmic accuracy of the MCF, measured by the average ranking score, is
further improved by 18.19% in the optimal case. In addition, two significant
criteria of algorithmic performance, diversity and popularity, are also taken
into account. Numerical results show that the presented algorithm can provide
more diverse and less popular recommendations, for example, when the
recommendation list contains 10 objects, the diversity, measured by the hamming
distance, is improved by 21.90%.
