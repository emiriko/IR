Metastability is observed when a physical system is close to a first order
phase transition. In this paper the metastable behavior of a two state
reversible probabilistic cellular automaton with self-interaction is discussed.
Depending on the self-interaction, competing metastable states arise and a
behavior very similar to that of the three state Blume-Capel spin model is
found.
