Flavour changing neutral currents arise in the $SU(3)_c\otimes SU(4)_L\otimes
U(1)_X$ extension of the standard model because anomaly cancellation among the
fermion families requires one generation of quarks to transform differently
from the other two under the gauge group. In the weak basis the distinction
between quark families is meaningless. However, in the mass eigenstates basis,
the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing matrix motivates us to classify
left-handed quarks in families. In this sense there are, in principle, three
different assignments of quark weak eigenstates into mass eigenstates. In this
work, by using measurements at the Z-pole, atomic parity violation data and
experimental input from neutral meson mixing, we examine two different models
without exotic electric charges based on the 3-4-1 symmetry, and address the
effects of quark family nonuniversality on the bounds on the mixing angle
between two of the neutral currents present in the models and on the mass
scales $M_{Z_2}$ and $M_{Z_3}$ of the new neutral gauge bosons predicted by the
theory. The heaviest family of quarks must transform differently in order to
keep lower bounds on $M_{Z_2}$ and $M_{Z_3}$ as low as possible without
violating experimental constraints.
