A number of recent experiments with nearly pure atomic Bose-Einstein
condensates have confirmed the predicted dark soliton oscillations when under
harmonic trapping. However, a dark soliton propagating in an inhomogeneous
condensate has also been predicted to be unstable to the emission of sound
waves. Although harmonic trapping supports an equilibrium between the
co-existing soliton and sound, we show that the ensuing dynamics are sensitive
to trap anharmonicities. Such anharmonicities can break the soliton-sound
equilibrium and lead to the net decay of the soliton on a considerably shorter
timescale than other dissipation mechanisms. Thus, we propose how small
realistic modifications to existing experimental set-ups could enable the
experimental observation of this decay channel.
