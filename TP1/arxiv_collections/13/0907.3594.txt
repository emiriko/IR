We present a precise measurement of the ratio
  R_K=B(K\to e\nu(\gamma))/B(K\to \mu\nu(\gamma)) and a study of the radiative
process $K\to e\nu\gamma$, performed with the KLOE detector. The results are
based on data collected at the Frascati $e^+e^-$ collider DAFNE for an
integrated luminosity of 2.2 fb$^{-1}$. We find R_K =
(2.493\pm0.025\pm0.019)x10^{-5}$, in agreement with the Standard Model
expectation. This result is used to improve constraints on parameters of the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with lepton flavor violation. We also
measured the differential decay rate $d\Gamma(K\to e\nu\gamma)/dE_\gamma$ for
photon energies $10<E_\gamma<250$ MeV. Results are compared with predictions
from theory.
