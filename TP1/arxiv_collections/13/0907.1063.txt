CP violation in supersymmetry can give rise to rate asymmetries in the decays
of supersymmetric particles. In this work we compute the rate asymmetries for
the three-body chargino decays \tilde\chi^\pm_2 \to \tilde\chi^\pm_1 HH,
\tilde\chi^\pm_2 \to \tilde\chi^\pm_1 ZZ, \tilde\chi^\pm_2 \to \tilde\chi^\pm_1
W^+ W^- and \tilde\chi^\pm_2 \to tilde\chi^\pm_1 ZH. Each of the decays
contains contributions mediated by neutral Higgs bosons that can possibly go on
shell. Such contributions receive a resonant enhancement; furthermore, the
strong phases required for the CP asymmetries come from the widths of the
exchanged Higgs bosons. Our results indicate that the rate asymmetries can be
relatively large in some cases, while still respecting a number of important
low-energy bounds such as those coming from B meson observables and electric
dipole moments. For the parameters that we consider, rate asymmetries of order
10% are possible in some cases.
