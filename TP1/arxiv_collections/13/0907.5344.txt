The solar corona, anomalously hot outer atmosphere of the Sun, is
traditionally described by magnetohydrodynamic, fluid-like approach. Here we
review some recent developments when, instead, a full kinetic description is
used. It is shown that some of the main unsolved problems of solar physics,
such as coronal heating and solar flare particle acceleration can be viewed in
a new light when the small-scale, kinetic plasma description methods are used.
