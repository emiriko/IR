We present spectroscopic confirmation of the "Pisces Overdensity", also known
as "Structure J", a photometric overdensity of RR Lyrae stars discovered by the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) at an estimated photometric distance of ~85kpc.
We measure radial velocities for 8 RR Lyrae stars within Pisces. We find that 5
of the 8 stars have heliocentric radial velocities within a narrow range of -87
km/s < v < -67 km/s, suggesting that the photometric overdensity is mainly due
to a physically associated system, probably a dwarf galaxy or a disrupted
galaxy. Two of the remaining 3 stars differ from one another by only 9 km/s,
but it would be premature to identify them as a second system.
