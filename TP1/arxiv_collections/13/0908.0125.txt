Treating an exactly rung-dimerized spin ladder as a reference model we study
perturbatively zero temperature quantum fluctuations in spin ladders with
slightly destroyed rung-dimerization. Analytic expressions are obtained for the
gas parameter (density of rung-triplets) and the ground state energy per rung.
At a strong diagonal frustration as well as at a rather strong
antiferromagnetic rung coupling these results well agree with the previous
numerical calculations.
