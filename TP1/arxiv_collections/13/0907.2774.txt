The dynamics of vibrational wave packets in triplet states of rubidium dimers
(Rb2) formed on helium nanodroplets are studied using femtosecond pump-probe
photoionization spectroscopy. Due to fast desorption of the excited Rb2
molecules off the droplets and due to their low internal temperature, wave
packet oscillations can be followed up to very long pump-probe delay times
>1.5ns. In the first excited triplet state (1)^3\Sigma_g^+, full and fractional
revivals are observed with high contrast. Fourier analysis provides
high-resolution vibrational spectra which are in excellent agreement with ab
initio calculations.
