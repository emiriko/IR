This paper tackles important aspects of comets dynamics from a statistical
point of view. Existing methodology uses numerical integration for computing
planetary perturbations for simulating such dynamics. This operation is highly
computational. It is reasonable to wonder whenever statistical simulation of
the perturbations can be much more easy to handle. The first step for answering
such a question is to provide a statistical study of these perturbations in
order to catch their main features. The statistical tools used are order
statistics and heavy tail distributions. The study carried out indicated a
general pattern exhibited by the perturbations around the orbits of the
important planet. These characteristics were validated through statistical
testing and a theoretical study based on Opik theory.
