Single trapped ions are ideal systems in which to test atomic physics at high
precision: they are effectively isolated atoms held at rest and largely free
from perturbing interactions. This thesis describes several projects developed
to study the structure of singly-ionized barium and more fundamental physics.
  First, we describe a spin-dependent "electron-shelving" scheme that allows us
to perform single ion electron spin resonance experiments in both the ground
6S_{1/2} and metastable 5D_{3/2} states at precision levels of 10^{-5}. We
employ this technique to measure the ratio of off-resonant light shifts (or
ac-Stark effect) in these states to a precision of 10^{-3} at two different
wavelengths. These results constitute a new high precision test of heavy-atom
atomic theory. Such experimental tests in Ba+ are in high demand since
knowledge of key dipole matrix elements is currently limited to about 5%. Ba+
has recently been the subject of theoretical interest towards a test of atomic
parity violation for which knowledge of dipole matrix elements is an important
prerequisite. We summarize this parity violation experimental concept and
describe new ideas. (continued...)
