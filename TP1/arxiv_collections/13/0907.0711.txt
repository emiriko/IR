We investigate inflation driven by $N$ dynamical five-branes in Heterotic
M-theory using the scalar potential derived from the open membrane instanton
sector. At leading order the resulting theory can be mapped to power law
inflation, however more generally one may expect higher order corrections to be
important. We consider a simple class of such corrections, which imposes tight
bounds on the number of branes required for inflation.
