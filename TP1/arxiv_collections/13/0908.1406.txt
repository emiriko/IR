Using a novel technique, which combines previously determined rotation
periods with new spectroscopic determinations of projected rotation velocity,
we have determined radii for fast rotating, low-mass (0.2-0.7 Msun) M-dwarfs in
the young, solar-metallicity open cluster, NGC 2516. The mean radii are larger
than model predictions at a given absolute I or K magnitude and also larger
than the measured radii of magnetically inactive M-dwarfs; the difference
increases from a few per cent, to 50 per cent for the lowest luminosity stars
in our sample. We show that a simple two-temperature starspot model is broadly
capable of explaining these observations, but requires spot coverage fractions
of about 50 per cent in rapidly rotating M-dwarfs.
