IceCube-DeepCore is a compact Cherenkov detector located in the clear ice of
the bottom center of the IceCube Neutrino Telescope. Its purpose is to enhance
the sensitivity of IceCube for low neutrino energies (< 1 TeV) and to lower the
detection threshold of IceCube by about an order of magnitude to below 10 GeV.
The detector is formed by 6 additional strings of 360 high quantum efficiency
phototubes together with the 7 central IceCube strings. The improved
sensitivity will provide an enhanced sensitivity to probe a range of parameters
of dark matter models not covered by direct experiments. It opens a new window
for atmospheric neutrino oscillation measurements of muon neutrino
disappearance or tau neutrino appearance in an energy region not well tested by
previous experiments, and enlarges the field of view of IceCube to a full sky
observation when searching for potential neutrino sources. The first string was
succesfully installed in January 2009, commissioning of the full detector is
planned early 2010.
