We present numerical solutions of the collapse of prestellar cores that lead
to the formation and evolution of circumstellar disks. The disk evolution is
then followed for up to three million years. A variety of models of different
initial masses and rotation rates allows us to study disk accretion around
brown dwarfs and low-mass T Tauri stars, with central object mass $M_st < 0.2
Msun$, as well as intermediate and upper-mass T Tauri stars (0.2 Msun < M_st <
3.0 Msun). Our models include self-gravity and allow for nonaxisymmetric
motions. In addition to the self-consistently generated gravitational torques,
we introduce an effective turbulent \alpha-viscosity with \alpha = 0.01, which
allows us particularly to model accretion in the low-mass regime where disk
self-gravity is diminishing. A range of models with observationally-motivated
values of the initial ratio of rotational to gravitational energy yields a
correlation between mass accretion rate \dot{M} and M_st that is relatively
steep, as observed. Additionally, our modeling reveals evidence for a
bimodality in the \dot{M}--M_st correlation, with a steeper slope at lower
masses and a shallower slope at intermediate and upper masses, as also implied
by observations. We show that the neglect of disk self-gravity leads to a much
steeper \dot{M}--M_st relation for intermediate and upper-mass T Tauri stars.
This demonstrates that an accurate treatment of global self-gravity is
essential to understanding observations of circumstellar disks.
