We investigate perturbations of the Schwarzschild geometry using a
linearization of the Einstein vacuum equations within a Bondi-Sachs, or null
cone, formalism. We develop a numerical method to calculate the quasi-normal
modes, and present results for the case $\ell=2$. The values obtained are
different to those of a Schwarzschild black hole, and we interpret them as
quasi-normal modes of a Schwarzschild white hole.
