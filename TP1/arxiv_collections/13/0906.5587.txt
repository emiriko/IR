We demonstrate and theoretically analyze the dressing of several proximate
Feshbach resonances in Rb-87 using radio-frequency (rf) radiation. We present
accurate measurements and characterizations of the resonances, and the dramatic
changes in scattering properties that can arise through the rf dressing. Our
scattering theory analysis yields quantitative agreement with the experimental
data. We also present a simple interpretation of our results in terms of
rf-coupled bound states interacting with the collision threshold.
