In the context of the dynamical evolution in a non-stationary thermal bath,
we construct a family of fluctuation relations for the entropy production that
are not verified by the work performed on the system. We exhibit fluctuation
relations which are global versions either of the generalized
Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem around a non-equilibrium diffusion or of the
usual Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem for energy resulting from a pulse of
temperature.
