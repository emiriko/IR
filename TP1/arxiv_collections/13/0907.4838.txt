The differential migration of two planets due to planet-disk interaction can
result in capture into the 2:1 eccentricity-type mean-motion resonances. Both
the sequence of 2:1 eccentricity resonances that the system is driven through
by continued migration and the possibility of a subsequent capture into the 4:2
inclination resonances are sensitive to the migration rate within the range
expected for type II migration. If the migration rate is fast, the resonant
pair can evolve into a family of 2:1 eccentricity resonances different from
those found by Lee (2004). This new family has outer orbital eccentricity e_2 >
0.4-0.5, asymmetric librations of both eccentricity resonance variables, and
orbits that intersect if they are exactly coplanar. Although this family exists
for an inner-to-outer planet mass ratio m_1/m_2 > 0.2, it is possible to evolve
into this family by fast migration only for m_1/m_2 > 2. Thommes and Lissauer
(2003) have found that a capture into the 4:2 inclination resonances is
possible only for m_1/m_2 < 2. We show that this capture is also possible for
m_1/m_2 > 2 if the migration rate is slightly slower than that adopted by
Thommes and Lissauer. There is significant theoretical uncertainty in both the
sign and the magnitude of the net effect of planet-disk interaction on the
orbital eccentricity of a planet. If the eccentricity is damped on a timescale
comparable to or shorter than the migration timescale, e_2 may not be able to
reach the values needed to enter either the new 2:1 eccentricity resonances or
the 4:2 inclination resonances. Thus, if future observations of extrasolar
planetary systems were to reveal certain combinations of mass ratio and
resonant configuration, they would place a constraint on the strength of
eccentricity damping during migration, as well as on the migration rate itself.
