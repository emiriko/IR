The high field magnetization and magneto transport measurements are carried
out to determine the critical superconducting parameters of MgB2-xCx system.
The synthesized samples are pure phase and the lattice parameters evaluation is
carried out using the Rietveld refinement. The R-T(H) measurements are done up
to a field of 140 kOe. The upper critical field values, Hc2 are obtained from
this data based upon the criterion of 90% of normal resistivity i.e. Hc2=H at
which Rho=90%Rho; where RhoN is the normal resistivity i.e., resistivity at
about 40 K in our case. The Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) prediction of
Hc(0) underestimates the critical field value even below than the field up to
which measurement is carried out. After this the model, the Ginzburg Landau
theory (GL equation) is applied to the R-T(H) data which not only calculates
the Hc2(0) value but also determines the dependence of Hc2 on temperature in
the low temperature high field region. The estimated Hc(0)=157.2 kOe for pure
MgB2 is profoundly enhanced to 297.5 kOe for the x=0.15 sample in MgB2-xCx
series. Magnetization measurements are done up to 120 kOe at different
temperatures and the other parameters like irreversibility field, Hirr and
critical current density Jc(H) are also calculated. The nano carbon doping
results in substantial enhancement of critical parameters like Hc2, Hirr and
Jc(H) in comparison to the pure MgB2 sample.
