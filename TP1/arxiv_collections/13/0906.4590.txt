Based on the concept of the cloak generating function, we propose a numerical
method to compute the invisibility performance of various quadratic spherical
cloaks and obtain optimal invisibility results. A non-ideal discrete model is
used to calculate and optimize the total scattering cross-sections of different
profiles of the generating function. A bell-shaped quadratic spherical cloak is
found to be the best candidate, which is further optimized by controlling
design parameters involved. Such improved invisibility is steady even when the
model is highly discretized.
