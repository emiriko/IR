We present a class of models in which the dark matter stabilization symmetry
is generated by spontaneous symmetry breaking. These models naturally correlate
the dark and electroweak symmetry breaking scales. The result is a generic
mechanism linking the annihilation cross section for thermally populated dark
matter with the weak scale. The thermal relic abundance, sensitivity to major
precision electroweak observables and additional LHC signatures are also
presented.
