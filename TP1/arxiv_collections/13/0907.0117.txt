We analyse the breaking of U-spin on a group theoretical basis. Due to the
simple behaviour of the weak effective hamiltonian under U-spin and the unique
structure of the breaking terms such a group theoretical analysis leads to a
manageable number of parameters. Several applications are discussed, including
the decays B -> J/psi K and B -> D K.
