It is shown that the limiting transition from the geometrical configuration
"plate -plate" to configuration "small particle -plate" being frequently used
in the theory of Lifshitz -Pitaevskii, is not continually true. On the other
hand, the known solution to the problem in the last configuration can be used
to verify the generalizations of the theory being worked out in the former
configuration.
