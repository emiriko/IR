We select galaxies in UV rest-frame at z=0, z~0.7 and z~1 together with a
sample of LBGs at z~1, the samples are built in order to sample the same range
of luminosity at any redshift. The evolution of the IR and UV luminosities with
z is analysed for individual galaxies as well as in terms of luminosity
functions. The L_IR/L_UV ratio is used to measure dust attenuation. This ratio
does not exhibit a strong evolution with z for the bulk of our sample galaxies
but some trends are found for galaxies with a strong dust attenuation and for
UV luminous sources: galaxies with L_IR/L_UV>10 are more frequent at z>0 than
at z=0 and the largest values of L_IR/L_UV are found for UV faint objects;
conversely the most luminous galaxies of our samples (L_UV> 2 10^{10} L_sun$),
detected at z=1, exhibit a lower dust attenuation than the fainter ones.
L_IR/L_UV increases with the K rest-frame luminosity of the galaxies at all the
redshifts considered and shows a residual anti-correlation with L_UV. The most
massive and UV luminous galaxies exhibit quite large specific star formation
rates. LBGs exhibit systematically lower dust attenuation than UV selected
galaxies of same luminosity but similar specific star formation rates. The
analysis of the UV+IR luminosity functions leads to the conclusion that up to z
= 1 most of the star formation activity of UV selected galaxies is emitted in
IR. Whereas we are able to retrieve all the star formation from our UV
selection at z=0.7, at z = 1 we miss a large fraction of galaxies more luminous
than ~ 10^{11} L_sun. The effect is found larger for Lyman Break Galaxies.
