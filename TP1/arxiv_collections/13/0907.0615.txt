An infinite word is S-automatic if, for all n>=0, its (n + 1)st letter is the
output of a deterministic automaton fed with the representation of n in the
considered numeration system S. In this extended abstract, we consider an
analogous definition in a multidimensional setting and present the connection
to the shape-symmetric infinite words introduced by Arnaud Maes. More
precisely, for d>=2, we state that a multidimensional infinite word x : N^d \to
\Sigma over a finite alphabet \Sigma is S-automatic for some abstract
numeration system S built on a regular language containing the empty word if
and only if x is the image by a coding of a shape-symmetric infinite word.
