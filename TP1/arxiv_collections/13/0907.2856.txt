We observe that any connected proper Lie groupoid whose orbits have
codimension at most two admits a globally effective representation on a smooth
vector bundle, i.e., one whose kernel consists only of ineffective arrows. As
an application, we deduce that any such groupoid can up to Morita equivalence
be presented as an extension of some action groupoid G n X with G compact by
some bundle of compact Lie groups.
