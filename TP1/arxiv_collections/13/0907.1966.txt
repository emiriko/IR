The instability of current-driven ion-acoustic waves in the collisionless
magnetic-field-free space plasma is investigated by using a nonextensive
approach. The ions and the electrons are thought of in the power-law
distributions that can be described by the generalized q-Maxwellian velocity
distribution and are considered with the different nonextensive q-parameters.
The generalized q-wave frequency and the generalized instability q-growth rate
for the ion-acoustic waves are derived. The numerical results show that the
nonextensive effects on the ion-acoustic waves are not apparent when the
electron temperature is much more than the ion temperature, but they are
salient when the electron temperature is not much more than the ion
temperature. As compared with the electrons, the ions play a dominant role in
the nonextensive effects.
