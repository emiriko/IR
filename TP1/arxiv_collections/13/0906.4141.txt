We apply scintillation theory to stellar signal fluctuations in the
high-resolution, high signal/noise, dual-wavelength data from the MMT
observation of the 2007 March 18 occultation of P445.3 by Pluto. A well-defined
high wavenumber cutoff in the fluctuations is consistent with viscous-thermal
dissipation of buoyancy waves (internal gravity waves) in Pluto's high
atmosphere, and provides strong evidence that the underlying density
fluctuations are governed by the gravity-wave dispersion relation.
