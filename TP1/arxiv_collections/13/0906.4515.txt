In this paper, we present new spectropolarimetric observations of the
planet-hosting star Tau Bootis, using ESPaDOnS and Narval spectropolarimeters
at Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) and Telescope Bernard Lyot (TBL),
respectively. We detected the magnetic field of the star at three epochs in
2008. It is a weak magnetic field of only a few Gauss, oscillating between a
predominant toroidal component in January and a dominant poloidal component in
June and July. A magnetic polarity reversal was observed relative to the
magnetic topology in June 2007. This is the second such reversal observed in
two years on this star, suggesting that Tau Boo has a magnetic cycle of about 2
years. This is the first detection of a magnetic cycle for a star other than
the Sun. The role of the close-in massive planet in the short activity cycle of
the star is questioned.
  Tau Boo has strong differential rotation, a common trend for stars with
shallow convective envelope. At latitude 40 deg., the surface layer of the star
rotates in 3.31 d, equal to the orbital period. Synchronization suggests that
the tidal effects induced by the planet may be strong enough to force at least
the thin convective envelope into corotation. Tau Boo shows variability in the
Ca H & K and Halpha throughout the night and on a night to night time scale. We
do not detect enhancement in the activity of the star that may be related to
the conjunction of the planet. Further data is needed to conclude about the
activity enhancement due to the planet.
