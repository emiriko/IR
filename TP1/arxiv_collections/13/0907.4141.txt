The appearance of superconductivity at ambient pressures in the undoped iron
pnictide parent compound SrFe2As2 is studied experimentally using several
techniques and approaches to aid in understanding the nature of this phase. Low
temperature magnetization measurements of single crystals of SrFe2As2 reveal
diamagnetic screening due to the onset of superconductivity below 21 K, with
volume fraction estimates varying between 0 and 15 percent. The effects of heat
treatment and cold-working via severe mechanical deformation on the
superconducting phase found are studied, showing that superconductivity can be
suppressed via modest annealing and reinstated by cold-working.
