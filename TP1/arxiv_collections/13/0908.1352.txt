More than a decade ago we identified a class of VSGRB (T90 < 100 ms) as
having unusual properties: (1) galactic position asymmetry, (2) very hard gamma
spectrum, (3) possible evidence for galactic origin of these events. We now
study the recent Swift data and show that a VSGRB enhancement consistent BATSE
and KONUS exists. We estimate that this is now a total 4.5sigma observation. We
then study the VSB for evidence of the time structure expected for PBH
evaporation. Several of the events show the general time structure expected for
PBH evaporation. If correct, then PBH must exist in this galaxy. Since even
large detectors like BATSE record only a few VSB per year the density of PBH
can still be very small and it is hard to predict a rate for the Fermi
spacecraft LAT.
