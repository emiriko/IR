The present work represents a step to deal with stellar structure using a
pure geometric approach. A geometric field theory is used to construct a model
for a spherically symmetric configuration. The model obtained can be considered
as a pure geometric one in the sense that the tensor describing the material
distributions is not a phenomenological object, but a part of the geometric
structure used. A general equation of state is obtained from, and not imposed
on, the model. The solution obtained shows that there are different zones
characterizing the configuration: a central radiation dominant zone, a probable
convection zone as a physical interpretation of the singularity of the model
and a corona like zone. The model may represent a type of main sequence stars.
The present work shows that Einstein's geometerization scheme can be extended
to gain more physical information within material distribution, with some
advantages.
