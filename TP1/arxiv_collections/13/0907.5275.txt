Future detection of Extensive Air Showers (EAS) produced by Ultra High Energy
Cosmic Particles (UHECP) by means of space based fluorescence telescopes will
open a new window on the universe and allow cosmic ray and neutrino astronomy
at a level that is virtually impossible for ground based detectors. In this
paper we summarize the results obtained in the context of the EUSO project by
means of a detailed Monte Carlo simulation of all the physical processes
involved in the fluorescence technique, from the Extensive Air Shower
development to the instrument response. Particular emphasis is given to
modeling the light propagation in the atmosphere and the effect of clouds. Main
results on energy threshold and resolution, direction resolution and Xmax
determination are reported. Results are based on EUSO telescope design, but are
also extended to larger and more sensitive detectors.
