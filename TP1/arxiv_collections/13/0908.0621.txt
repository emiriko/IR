We report the propagation dynamics of Airy light beams under non-paraxial
conditions. It is studied using the general approach which deals with Fourier
expansion of the beam. We show the transformation of the beam from the Airy
form as the paraxiality parameter decreases. The role of evanescent waves in
non-paraxial regime is discussed.
