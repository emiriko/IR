The redshifts of the gamma ray burst (GRB) GRB 011211 has been determined as
2.14 from several absorption lines seen in the spectrum of its optical
afterglow. The spectrum of its X-ray afterglow exhibited several emission
lines,and their identification led to a mean redshift 1.862. A supernova model
has been proposed based on the redshift of the GRB as 2.141. It is shown here
that the redshift interpretation cannot explain the observed spectra, as some
serious inconsistencies exist in the process of redshift determinations in
spectra of both optical and X-ray afterglows. In view of that, an alternative
interpretation of the spectra is presented in terms of blueshifts. Ejection
mechanism is proposed as a possible scenario to explain the blueshifted
spectrum.
