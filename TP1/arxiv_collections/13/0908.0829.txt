In this paper we consider a system consisting of a two-level atom, initially
prepared in a coherent superposition of upper and lower levels, interacting
with a radiation field prepared in generalized quantum states in the framework
of multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings model. For this system we show that there is a
class of states for which the fluctuation factors can exhibit revival-collapse
phenomenon (RCP) similar to that exhibited in the corresponding atomic
inversion. This is shown not only for normal fluctuations but also for
amplitude-squared fluctuations. Furthermore, apart from this class of states we
generally demonstrate that the fluctuation factors associated with three-photon
transition can provide RCP similar to that occurring in the atomic inversion of
the one-photon transition. These are novel results and their consequence is
that RCP occurred in the atomic inversion can be measured via a homodyne
detector. Furthermore, we discuss the influence of the atomic relative phases
on such phenomenon.
