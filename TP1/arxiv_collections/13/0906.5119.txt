Martin and Osswald \cite{Martin07} have recently proposed many
generalizations of combination rules on quantitative beliefs in order to manage
the conflict and to consider the specificity of the responses of the experts.
Since the experts express themselves usually in natural language with
linguistic labels, Smarandache and Dezert \cite{Li07} have introduced a
mathematical framework for dealing directly also with qualitative beliefs. In
this paper we recall some element of our previous works and propose the new
combination rules, developed for the fusion of both qualitative or quantitative
beliefs.
