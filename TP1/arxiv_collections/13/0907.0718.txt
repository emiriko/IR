We present a randomized parallel algorithm that computes the greatest common
divisor of two integers of n bits in length with probability 1-o(1) that takes
O(n loglog n / log n) expected time using n^{6+\epsilon} processors on the EREW
PRAM parallel model of computation. We believe this to be the first randomized
sublinear time algorithm on the EREW PRAM for this problem.
