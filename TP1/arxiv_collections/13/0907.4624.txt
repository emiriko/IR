We present lattice results for baryon number, strangeness and electric charge
fluctuations as well as their correlations at finite temperature and vanishing
chemical potentials, i.e. under conditions relevant for RHIC and LHC. We find
that the fluctuations change rapidly at the transition temperature $T_c$ and
approach the ideal quark gas limit already at approximately $1.5T_c$. This
indicates that quarks are the relevant degrees of freedom that carry the
quantum numbers of conserved charges at $T\geq 1.5T_c$. At low temperature,
qualitative features of the lattice results are well described by a hadron
resonance gas model.
