From the study of X-ray light curve and color-color diagram of the low mass
X-ray binary GRS 1915+105, observed by on board proportional counter array
(PCA) of Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE), we discover a new class of
variability, which we name $\epsilon$ class. We have studied observations
between MJD 51200 and 51450. The class shows unusual periodic-like variation in
count rate during rise time of two x-ray bursts. The class take place when the
source is in radio quiet state. The huge expansion in color-intensity diagram
indicates the class to be an adjusting stage of increasing accretion rate.
Spectral analysis shows that during lower count rate, the spectrum is hard
power-law dominating, indicating similarity towards hard intermediate state,
and during higher count rate, the spectrum is thermal disk blackbody component
dominating, indicating similarity towards high soft state. Hence, this class is
important in understanding the way of state transition leads to change in
accretion rate. No signature of any low frequency quasi periodic oscillation
was seen in this class. We also find that when the class was showing higher
counts, the average RMS amplitude is significantly high for high energy band
(14-60 keV) compared to low energy band (2-8 keV).
