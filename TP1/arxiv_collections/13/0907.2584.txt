As a first step towards a theory of differential equations involving
para-Grassmann variables the linear equations with constant coefficients are
discussed and solutions for equations of low order are given explicitly. A
connection to n-generalized Fibonacci numbers is established. Several other
classes of differential equations (systems of first order, equations with
variable coefficients, nonlinear equations) are also considered and the
analogies or differences to the usual (''bosonic'') differential equations
discussed.
