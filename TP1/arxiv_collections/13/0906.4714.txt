Given a time symmetric initial data set for the vacuum Einstein field
equations which is conformally flat near infinity, it is shown that the
solutions to the regular finite initial value problem at spatial infinity
extend smoothly through the critical sets where null infinity touches spatial
infinity if and only if the initial data coincides with Schwarzschild data near
infinity.
