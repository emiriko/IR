We investigate flavor violation mediated by Higgs bosons and supersymmetric
particles in a predictive class of models based on the non-Abelian flavor
symmetry Q_6. These models, which aim to reduce the number of parameters of the
fermion sector and to solve the flavor changing problems of generic SUSY setup,
assume three families of Higgs bosons and spontaneous/soft violation of CP
symmetry. Tree-level contributions to meson-antimeson mixings mediated by Higgs
bosons are shown to be within experimental limits for Higgs masses in the (1-5)
TeV range. Calculable flavor violation induced by SUSY loops are analyzed for
meson mixing and lepton decays and found to be consistent with data.
Significant new SUSY contributions arise in B_s- \bar{B}_s mixing, but
non-standard CP violation is suppressed. A simple solution to the SUSY CP
problem is found, which requires light Higgsinos.
