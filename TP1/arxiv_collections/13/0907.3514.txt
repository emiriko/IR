We report unexpected behaviour in a family of Cu spin- 1/2 systems, in which
an apparent gap in the low energy magneto-optical absorption spectrum opens at
low temperature. This previously unreported collective phenomenon arises at
temperatures where the energy of the dominant exchange interaction exceeds the
thermal energy. Simulations of the observed shifts in electron paramagnetic
resonance spectral weight, which include spin anisotropy, reproduce this
behavior yielding the magnitude of the spin anisotropy in these compounds.
