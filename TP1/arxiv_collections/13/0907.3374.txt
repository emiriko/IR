Twist-2 components of the real and virtual photon distribution amplitudes are
evaluated in several chiral quark models. The results, obtained at the quark
model scale, are then evolved to higher scales, probed in experiments or in
lattice QCD. We also analyze the related form factors and coupling constants.
Our results are a genuine dynamical prediction, following from the chiral
dynamics.
