This document outlines major directions in theoretical support for the
measurement of nucleon resonance transition form factors at the JLab 12 GeV
upgrade with the CLAS12 detector. Using single and double meson production,
prominent resonances in the mass range up to 2 GeV will be studied in the range
of photon virtuality $Q^2$ up to 12 GeV$^2$ where quark degrees of freedom are
expected to dominate. High level theoretical analysis of these data will open
up opportunities to understand how the interactions of dressed quarks create
the ground and excited nucleon states and how these interactions emerge from
QCD. The paper reviews the current status and the prospects of QCD based model
approaches that relate phenomenological information on transition form factors
to the non-perturbative strong interaction mechanisms, that are responsible for
resonance formation.
