In a previous paper, we showed that the decay rate of a muon is only slightly
affected by the presence of a circularly polarized laser and we gave an
analytic expression for the correction. In this paper, we present the
analytical result for the case of a linearly polarized laser. Again the effect
of the laser is small.
