On the basis of frequentist analyses of experimental constraints from
electroweak precision data, g-2, B physics and cosmological data, we
investigate the parameters of the constrained MSSM (CMSSM) with universal soft
supersymmetry-breaking mass parameters, and a model with common non-universal
Higgs masses (NUHM1). We present chi^2 likelihood functions for the masses of
supersymmetric particles and Higgs bosons, as well as b to s gamma, b to mu mu
and the spin-independent dark matter scattering cross section. In the CMSSM we
find preferences for sparticle masses that are relatively light. In the NUHM1
the best-fit values for many sparticle masses are even slightly smaller, but
with greater uncertainties. The likelihood functions for most sparticle masses
are cut off sharply at small masses, in particular by the LEP Higgs mass
constraint. Both in the CMSSM and the NUHM1, the coannihilation region is
favoured over the focus-point region at about the 3-sigma level, largely but
not exclusively because of g-2. Many sparticle masses are highly correlated in
both the CMSSM and NUHM1, and most of the regions preferred at the 95% C.L. are
accessible to early LHC running. Some slepton and chargino/neutralino masses
should be in reach at the ILC. The masses of the heavier Higgs bosons should be
accessible at the LHC and the ILC in portions of the preferred regions in the
(M_A, tan beta) plane. In the CMSSM, the likelihood function for b to mu mu is
peaked close to the Standard Model value, but much larger values are possible
in the NUHM1. We find that values of the DM cross section > 10^{-10} pb are
preferred in both the CMSSM and the NUHM1. We study the effects of dropping the
g-2, b to s gamma, relic density and M_h constraints.
