Dependence of magnetic field generation on the rotation rate is explored by
direct numerical simulation of magnetohydrodynamic convective attractors in a
plane layer of conducting fluid with square periodicity cells for the Taylor
number varied from zero to 2000, for which the convective fluid motion halts
(other parameters of the system are fixed). We observe 5 types of hydrodynamic
(amagnetic) attractors: two families of two-dimensional (i.e. depending on two
spatial variables) rolls parallel to sides of periodicity boxes of different
widths and parallel to the diagonal, travelling waves and three-dimensional
"wavy" rolls. All types of attractors, except for one family of rolls, are
capable of kinematic magnetic field generation. We have found 21 distinct
nonlinear convective MHD attractors (13 steady states and 8 periodic regimes)
and identified bifurcations in which they emerge. In addition, we have observed
a family of periodic, two-frequency quasiperiodic and chaotic regimes, as well
as an incomplete Feigenbaum period doubling sequence of bifurcations of a torus
followed by a chaotic regime and subsequently by a torus with 1/3 of the
cascade frequency. The system is highly symmetric. We have found two novel
global bifurcations reminiscent of the SNIC bifurcation, which are only
possible in the presence of symmetries. The universally accepted paradigm,
whereby an increase of the rotation rate below a certain level is beneficial
for magnetic field generation, while a further increase inhibits it (and halts
the motion of fluid on continuing the increase) remains unaltered, but we
demonstrate that this "large-scale" picture lacks many significant details.
