We report the discovery from WASP-South of a new Jupiter-like extrasolar
planet, WASP-16b, which transits its solar analog host star every 3.12 days.
Analysis of the transit photometry and radial velocity spectroscopic data leads
to a planet with R_p = 1.008+-0.071 R_Jup and M_p =0.855+-0.059 M_Jup, orbiting
a host star with R_* = 0.946+-0.054 R_sun and M_* = 1.022+-0.101 M_sun.
Comparison of the high resolution stellar spectrum with synthetic spectra and
stellar evolution models indicates the host star is a near-solar metallicity
([Fe/H]= 0.01+-0.10) solar analog (Teff = 5700+-150 K, log g= 4.5+-0.2) of
intermediate age (Tau = 2.3+5.8-2.2 Gyr).
