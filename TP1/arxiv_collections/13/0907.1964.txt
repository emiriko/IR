We consider the measuring procedure that in principle allows to avoid the
homodyne detection for the simultaneous selection of both quadrature components
in the far-field. The scheme is based on the use of the coherent sources of the
non-classical light. The possibilities of the procedure are illustrated on the
basis of the use of pixellised sources, where the phase-locked sub-Poissonian
lasers or the degenerate optical parametric oscillator generating above
threshold are chosen as the pixels. The theory of the pixellised source of the
spatio-temporal squeezed light is elaborated as a part of this investigation.
