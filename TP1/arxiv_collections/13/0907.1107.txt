Integrable equations with second order Lax pair like KdV and Camassa-Holm
(CH) exhibit interesting conformal properties and can be written in terms of
the so-called conformal invariants (Schwarz form). These properties for the CH
hierarchy are discussed in this contribution.
  The squared eigenfunctions of the spectral problem, associated to the
Camassa-Holm equation represent a complete basis of functions, which helps to
describe the Inverse Scattering Transform (IST) for the Camassa-Holm hierarchy
as a Generalised Fourier Transform (GFT). Using GFT we describe explicitly some
members of the CH hierarchy, including integrable deformations for the CH
equation. Also we show that solutions of some 2+1-dimensional generalizations
of CH can be constructed via the IST for the CH hierarchy.
