We give an approach to open quantum systems based on formal deformation
quantization. It is shown that classical open systems of a certain type can be
systematically quantized into quantum open systems preserving the complete
positivity of the open time evolution. The usual example of linearly coupled
harmonic oscillators is discussed.
