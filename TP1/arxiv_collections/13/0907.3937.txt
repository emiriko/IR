We present preliminary STAR results of azimuthal correlations between
non-photonic electrons and hadrons in AuAu, CuCu and pp at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$
GeV. Comparison of the e-h correlations from these colliding systems allows one
to study the system-size dependence of heavy quark jet-medium interactions. We
also report on the relative charm and bottom contributions to non-photonic
electrons extracted from correlations measured in pp collisions. Our results,
when combined with $R_{AA}$ measurements of non-photonic electrons, constrain
the charm and bottom energy loss in the dense medium.
