A two-component jet model is proposed to explain the unusual afterglow of GRB
070419A. Regarding the optical light curve, a wide "jet" with an opening angle
of > 30-40 degrees is assumed to produce the late shallow decay, while the
three early power-law segments must be caused by a narrow jet with an opening
angle of about 2-4 degrees. Additional energy injections to both components are
required. Late X-ray emission may come from either the wide jet or the narrow
one. If the latter is correct, the jets may run into an ISM environment and the
temporal index of the late energy injection q may be about 0.65.
