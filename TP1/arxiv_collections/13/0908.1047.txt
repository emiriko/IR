I present three relations, striking in their simplicity and fundamental
appearance. The first one connects the Compton wavelength of a pion and the
dark energy density of the Universe; the second one connects Compton wavelength
of a pion and the mass distribution of non-baryonic dark matter in a Galaxy;
the third one relates mass of a pion to fundamental physical constants and
cosmological parameters. All these relations are in excellent numerical
agreement with observations.
