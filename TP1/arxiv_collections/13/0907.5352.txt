We present here a detailed derivation of an explicit spin-dependent
expression for the bending angle of light as it traverses in the equatorial
plane of a spinning black hole. We show that the deflection produced in the
presence of the black hole angular momentum explicitly depends on whether the
motion of the light ray is in the direction, or opposite to the spin. Compared
to the zero-spin Schwarzschild case, the bending angle is greater for direct
orbits, and {\em smaller} for retrograde orbits, confirming our physical
intuition about the loss of left-right symmetry from a lensing perspective. In
addition, we show that for higher spins, the effect is more pronounced
resulting in tighter winding of direct orbits with respect to the axis of
rotation, and a higher degree of unwinding of retro orbits. A direct
consequence of this effect is a shift in image positions in strong
gravitational lensing.
