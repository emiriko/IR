We find new mechanism of superconductivity beyond the spin-fluctuation
theory, the standard model for unconventional superconductivity in the weak
coupling approach, where Kondo fluctuations result in multi-gap
superconductivity around an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point of the
slave-fermion theory. Fingerprints of the hybridization mechanism are two kinds
of resonance modes in not only spin but also charge fluctuations, originating
from $d-wave$ pairing of conduction electrons and spinless holons,
respectively, thus differentiated from the spin-fluctuation mechanism. We show
that the ratio between each superconducting gap for conduction electrons
$\Delta_{c}$ and holons $\Delta_{f}$ and the transition temperature $T_{c}$ is
$2\Delta_{c} / T_{c} \sim 9$ and $2\Delta_{f} / T_{c} \sim
\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$, remarkably consistent with $CeCoIn_{5}$.
