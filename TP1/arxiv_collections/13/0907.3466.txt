I discuss historical material about the beginning of the ideas of spontaneous
symmetry breaking and particularly the role of the Guralnik, Hagen Kibble paper
in this development. I do so adding a touch of some more modern ideas about the
extended solution-space of quantum field theory resulting from the intrinsic
nonlinearity of non-trivial interactions.
