Recent developments in the theory of integrable models have provided the
means of calculating dynamical correlation functions of some important
observables in systems such as Heisenberg spin chains and one-dimensional
atomic gases. This article explicitly describes how such calculations are
generally implemented in the ABACUS C++ library, emphasizing the universality
in treatment of different cases coming as a consequence of unifying features
within the Bethe Ansatz.
