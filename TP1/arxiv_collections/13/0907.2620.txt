Effect of biased noise fluctuations on the degree of squeezing as well as the
intensity of a radiation generated by a one-photon coherent beat laser is
presented. It turns out that the radiation exhibits squeezing inside and
outside the cavity under certain conditions. The degree of squeezing is
enhanced by the biased noise input significantly in both regions. Despite the
presence of the biased environment modes outside the cavity, the degree of
squeezing outside the cavity can be greater than or equal to or even less than
the cavity radiation depending on the initial preparation of the atomic
superposition and amplitude of the external driving radiation. But the
intensity of the radiation is found to be lesser outside the cavity regardless
of these parameters.
