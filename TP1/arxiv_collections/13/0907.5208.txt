We show that if the evolution of cosmic ray sources follows that of active
galactic nuclei, the upper limit on the diffuse flux of tau neutrinos from the
Pierre Auger Observatory marginally constrains the proton fraction at the end
of the energy spectrum. We also discuss prospects to uncover new physics
leptophobic interactions using future Auger data.
