I discuss the subject of powerlike asymptotic behavior of hadronic form
factors in pre-QCD analyses of soft (Feynman/Drell-Yan) and hard (West)
mechanisms, and also recent derivation of $1/Q^2$ asymptotics of meson form
factors in AdS/QCD. At the end, I briefly comment on "light-front holography"
ansatz.
