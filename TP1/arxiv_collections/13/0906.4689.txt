The development of instruments for remote sensing applications (active or
passive) requires in situ validation measurements. The equipments (radar or
radiometer) must be tested on real geological profiles. We must have accurate
information on the profiles studied (permittivity, humidity, thickness of
layers ...). Sensors (humidity), samples (thickness) or laboratory measurements
(permittivity) provide local data about the profile while the remote sensing
equipment is performing global measurements on a geological structure. The
present work describes an in situ characterization bench test, based on two
horn antennas, associated with an identification profiles software we developed
to obtain comprehensive and instantaneous information on the geological
profiles.
