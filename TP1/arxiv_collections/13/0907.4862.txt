We present long-term observations of several VHE (E > 100 GeV) blazars with
VERITAS, together with contemporaneous Swift and RXTE X-ray data. The observed
targets include Mrk 421, Mrk 501, 1ES 2344+514. Strong flux and spectral
variability is seen in Mrk 421 on nightly time-scales between January and June
2008, revealing a highly correlated X-ray to GeV/TeV connection. Modest X-ray
variability is evident in Mrk 501. Observations of 1ES 2344+514 in December
2007 show VHE gamma-ray and X-ray flux doubling on nightly time-scales.
