This paper investigates point-to-multipoint (PTM) transmission supporting
adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) as well as retransmissions based on
incremental redundancy. In contrast to the classical PTM transmission which was
introduced by the Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS), the
adaptiveness requires user individual feedback channels that allow the
receivers to report their radio conditions and send positive or negative
acknowledgments (ACK/NACK) for a Layer 1 transport block to the eNodeB. In this
work, an adaptive PTM scheme based on feedback from multiple users is presented
and evaluated. Furthermore, a simple NACK-oriented feedback mechanism is
introduced to relieve the feedback channel that is used in the uplink. Finally,
the performance of different single-cell MBMS transmission modes is evaluated
by dynamic radio network simulations. It is shown that adaptive PTM
transmission outperforms the conventional MBMS configurations in terms of radio
resource consumption and user satisfaction rate.
