Context. We compare solar differential rotation of subphotospheric layers
derived from local helioseismology analysis of GONG++ dopplergrams and the one
derived from tracing small bright coronal structures (SBCS) using EIT/SOHO
images for the period August 2001 - December 2006, which correspond to the
declining phase of solar cycle 23. Aims. The study aims to find a relationship
between the rotation of the SBCS and the subphotospheric angular velocity. The
northsouth asymmetries of both rotation velocity measurements are also
investigated. Methods. Subphotospheric differential rotation was derived using
ring-diagram analysis of GONG++ full-disk dopplergrams of 1 min cadence. The
coronal rotation was derived by using an automatic method to identify and track
the small bright coronal structures in EIT full-disk images of 6 hours cadence.
Results. We find that the SBCS rotate faster than the considered upper
subphotospheric layer (3Mm) by about 0.5 deg/day at the equator. This result
joins the results of several other magnetic features (sunspots, plages,
faculae, etc.) with a higher rotation than the solar plasma. The rotation rate
latitudinal gradients of the SBCS and the subphotospheric layers are very
similar. The SBCS motion shows an acceleration of about 0.005 deg/day/month
during the declining phase of solar cycle 23, whereas the angular velocity of
subsurface layers does not display any evident variation with time, except for
the well known torsional oscillation pattern. Finally, both subphotospheric and
coronal rotations of the southern hemisphere are predominantly larger than
those of the northern hemisphere. At latitudes where the north-south asymmetry
of the angular velocity increases (decreases) with activity for the SBCS, it
decreases (increases) for subphotospheric layers.
