We present experimental coherent two-dimensional Fourier transform spectra of
the exciton resonances in semiconductor quantum wells for a pulse sequence that
isolates two-quantum coherences. By measuring the real part of the spectra, we
can determine that the spectra are dominated by two quantum coherences due to
many-body interactions, not bound biexcitons. Simulations performed using
dynamics controlled truncation agree well with the experiments.
