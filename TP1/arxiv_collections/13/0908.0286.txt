In this paper, we elaborate the problem of energy-momentum in general
relativity by energy-momentum prescriptions theory. Our aim is to calculate
energy and momentum densities for the general form of gravitational waves. In
this connection, we have extended the previous works by using the prescriptions
of Bergmann and Tolman. It is shown that they are finite and reasonable. In
addition, using Tolman prescription, exactly, leads to same results that have
been obtained by Einstein and Papapetrou prescriptions.
