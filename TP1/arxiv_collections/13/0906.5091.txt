We start with a mean field Hamiltonian in momentum space for NCCO to
investigate the magnetic quantum oscillations (MQO) exhibited by this system in
the normal state. We first obtain an expression for the entropy of the system
which is useful to explain the Nernst effect. We next derive the density of
states at Fermi energy and the longitudinal electrical conductivity expression
to explore the possibility of MQO. We find that the slow (1/B)-oscillations,
with frequency nearly 330 T, arise from the hole pockets at the optimal doping.
The faster oscillations at slightly higher doping level is found to have the
frequency nearly equal to 900 T.
