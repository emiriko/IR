In the framework of the simplest little Higgs model (SLHM), we study the
production of a pair of neutral CP-even Higgs bosons at the LHC. First, we
examine the production rate and find that it can be significantly larger than
the SM prediction. Then we investigate the decays of the Higgs-pair and find
that for a low Higgs mass their dominant decay mode is hh->\eta\eta\eta\eta
(\eta is a CP-odd scalar) while hh->b\bar{b}\eta\eta and hh->\eta\eta WW may
also have sizable ratios. Finally, we comparatively study the rates of pp-> hh
-> b\bar{b}\tau^+ \tau^-, pp->hh->b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma, and pp->hh->WWWW in the
SLHM and the littlest Higgs models (LHT). We find that for a light Higgs,
compared with the SM predictions, all the three rates can be sizably enhanced
in the LHT but severely suppressed in the SLHM; while for an intermediately
heavy Higgs, both the LHT and SLHM can enhance sizably the SM predictions.
