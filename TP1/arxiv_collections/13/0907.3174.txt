We represent the sums $\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}{n \choose k}^{-2}$,
$\sum_{k=0}^m{m\choose k}^{-1}{a\choose n-k}^{-1}$,
$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{q^{-k(k-1)}}{{\genfrac{[}{]}{0pt}{}{n}{k}}_q}$, and the
sum of the reciprocals of the summands in Dixon's identity, each as a product
of an {\it indefinite hypergeometric sum} times a (closed form) {\it
hypergeometric sequence}
