Correlated materials are extremely sensitive to external stimuli, such as
temperature or pressure. Describing the electronic properties of such systems
often requires applying many-body techniques to effective low energy problems
in the spirit of the Hubbard model, or extensions thereof. While the effect of
pressure on structures and bands has been investigated extensively within
density-functional based methods, the pressure dependence of electron-electron
interactions has so far received little attention. As a step toward ab initio
pressure studies for realistic systems within a setup of maximally localized
Wannier functions and the constrained random phase approximation, we examine in
this paper the paradigmatic pressure dependence of Coulomb interactions. While
compression commonly causes the "extension" of Wannier functions, and thus
transfer elements, to grow, we find the -- seemingly counter-intuitive --
tendency that the bare Coulomb interaction increases under compression as well.
We reconcile these behaviors by appealing to a semi-analytical tight-binding
model. We moreover argue that, for this model, the requirement of maximal
Wannier localization is equivalent to maximizing the Coulomb interaction matrix
elements. We then apply the above first principles techniques to fcc hydrogen
under pressure. While we find our comprehension of the bare Coulomb interaction
confirmed, the induced changes in screening strengths lead to an effective one
band model with a Hubbard interaction that is non-monotonous under pressure.
