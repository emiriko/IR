The dissociation of molecules, even the most simple hydrogen molecule, cannot
be described accurately within density functional theory because none of the
currently available functionals accounts for strong on-site correlation. This
problem has led to a discussion of properties that the local Kohn-Sham
potential has to satisfy in order to correctly describe strongly correlated
systems. We derive an analytic expression for this potential at the
dissociation limit and show that the numerical calculations for a
one-dimensional two electron model system indeed approach and reach this limit.
It is shown that the functional form of the potential is universal, i.e.
independent of the details of the system.
