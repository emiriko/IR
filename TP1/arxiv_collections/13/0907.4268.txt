We study the influence of the centrifugally driven curvature drift
instability (CDI) on the dynamics of relativistic electrons in the
magnetospheres of active galactic nuclei (AGN). We generalize our previous work
by considering relativistic particles with different initial phases.
Considering the Euler, continuity, and induction equations, by taking into
account the resonant conditions, we derive the growth rate of the CDI. We show
that due to the centrifugal effects, the rotational energy is efficiently
pumped directly into the drift modes, that leads to the generation of a
toroidal component of the magnetic field. As a result, the magnetic field lines
transform into such a configuration when particles do not experience any forces
and since the instability is centrifugally driven, at this stage the CDI is
suspended.
