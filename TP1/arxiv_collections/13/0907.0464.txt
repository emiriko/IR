To enhance our knowledge of the characteristics and distribution of the
circumstellar dust associated with the individual components of the young
hierarchical triple system T Tau, observations in the N-band with MIDI at the
VLTI were performed. Our study is based on both the interferometric and the
spectrophotometric measurements and is supplemented by new visual and infrared
photometry. Also, the phases were investigated to determine the dominating
mid-infrared source in the close southern binary. The data were fit with the
help of a sophisticated physical disc model. This model utilises the radiative
transfer code MC3D that is based on the Monte-Carlo method. Extended
mid-infrared emission is found around all three components of the system.
Simultaneous fits to the photometric and interferometric data confirm the
picture of an almost face-on circumstellar disc around T Tau N. Towards this
star, the silicate band is seen in emission. This emission feature is used to
model the dust content of the circumstellar disc. Clear signs of dust
processing are found. Towards T Tau S, the silicate band is seen in absorption.
This absorption is strongly pronounced towards the infrared companion T Tau Sa
as can be seen from the first individual N-band spectra for the two southern
components. Our fits support the previous suggestion that an almost edge-on
disc is present around T Tau Sa. This disc is thus misaligned with respect to
the circumstellar disc around T Tau N. The interferometric data indicate that
the disc around T Tau Sa is oriented in the north-south direction, which
favours this source as launching site for the east-western jet. We further
determine from the interferometric data the relative positions of the
components of the southern binary.
