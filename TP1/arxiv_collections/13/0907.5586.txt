We present a robust and fast laser cooling scheme suitable for trapped atoms
and ions. Based on quantum interference, generated by a special laser
configuration, it is able to rapidly cool the system such that the final phonon
occupation vanishes to zeroth order in the Lamb-Dicke parameter in contrast to
existing cooling schemes. Furthermore, it is robust under conditions of
fluctuating laser intensity and frequency, thus making it a viable candidate
for experimental applications.
