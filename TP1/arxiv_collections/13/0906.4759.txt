We present observations of O VI 1032 emission around the helium white dwarf
KPD 0005+5106 obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer.
Previously published data, reprocessed with an updated version of the
calibration pipeline, are included along with new observations. The recent
upward revision of the white dwarf's effective temperature to 200,000 K has
motivated us to re-analyze all the data. We compare observations with
photoionization models and find that the density of the O VI nebula is about 10
cm^-3, and that the stellar flux must be attenuated by about 90% by the time it
impinges on the inner face of the nebula. We infer that this attenuation is due
to circumstellar material ejected by KPD 0005+5106 earlier in its evolution.
