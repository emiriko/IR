In this work we consider the Peter principle and anti-Peter principle as the
discrete logistic and discrete inverse logistic equation. Especially we discuss
imprecisely estimated (by hierarchical control mechanism) carrying capacity,
i.e. boundary (in)competence level of a hierarchy member. It implies that Peter
principle holds two sub-principles. In the first one objective boundary
competence level is increased for estimation error. In the second one objective
boundary competence level is decreased for estimation error. Similarly,
anti-Peter principle holds two sub-principles too. All this implies that
paradoxical situations that follow from Peter and anti-Peter principle can be
simply removed by decrease of the error of hierarchical (social) control. Also
we discuss cases by Peter principle when error of the boundary competence level
by estimation grows up. (Then, in fact, there is no estimation error but
stimulation of the boundary level by control mechanism.) By first Peter
sub-principle it implies anarchy in the social structure or, correspondingly,
cancer in the biology and medicine, schizophrenia in the psychology and
inflation in the economy. By second Peter sub-principle it implies a totalitary
social structure (dictature or caste regime) or multiplex sclerosis and other
autoimmune diseases in biology and medicine, servile mentality or low value
complex in psychology and depression by hyperactive political influences in
economy. Finally, monotonus changes of the stimulated part of boundary level
cause corresponding phase transitions discussed on the example of the
introspection in the psychology.
