UV-transmitting (UVT) acrylic is a commonly used light-propagating material
in neutrino and dark matter detectors as it has low intrinsic radioactivity and
exhibits low absorption in the detectors' light producing regions, from 350 nm
to 500 nm. Degradation of optical transmittance in this region lowers light
yields in the detector, which can affect energy reconstruction, resolution, and
experimental sensitivities. We examine transmittance loss as a result of short-
and long-term UV exposure for a variety of UVT acrylic samples from a number of
acrylic manufacturers. Significant degradation peaking at 343 nm was observed
in some UVT acrylics with as little as three hours of direct sunlight, while
others exhibited softer degradation peaking at 310 nm over many days of
exposure to sunlight. Based on their measured degradation results, safe time
limits for indoor and outdoor UV exposure of UVT acrylic are formulated.
