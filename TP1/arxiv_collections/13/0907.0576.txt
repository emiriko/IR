We show that a pair of quantized cavity modes interacting with a spectrally
broadened ensemble of Lambda-type atoms is analogous to an ensemble of two
level systems coupled to a bosonic reservoir. This provides the possibility for
an irreversible photon transfer between photon modes. The density of states as
well as the quantum state of the reservoir can be engineered allowing the
observation of effects such as the quantum Zeno- and anti-Zeno effect, the
destructive interference of decay channels and the decay in a squeezed vacuum.
As a particular application we discuss a photon diode, i.e. a device which
directs a single photon from anyone of two input ports to a common output port.
