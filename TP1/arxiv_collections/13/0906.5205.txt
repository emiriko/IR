The extrinsic quantum mechanical arrow of time is understood to be a
consequence of the interaction between quantum systems and their environment. A
choice of boundary conditions for the Schr\"odinger equation results in a
different time asymmetry intrinsic to quantum mechanical dynamics and
independent of environmental interactions. Correct application of the
intrinsically asymmetric dynamics, however, leads unavoidably to predictions of
the experimental signatures of the extrinsic arrow of time. We are led to a
new, model-independent mechanism for quantum decoherence. We need not invoke a
master equation or a phase-destroying, non-Hermitian Hamiltonian operator. As
an application, we calculate predictive probabilities for the decoherence
measured in Rabi oscillations experiments. We can also show that a previously
puzzling experimental result, unexplained within the formalism of the quantum
master equation, is in fact expected and is the measurable consequence of the
indistinguishability of separate, uncontrolled interactions between systems and
their environment.
