We present the details of a deconstructed model that incorporates both
Higgsless and top-color mechanisms. The model alleviates the tension between
obtaining the correct top quark mass and keeping Delta rho small that exists in
many Higgsless models. It does so by singling out the top quark mass generation
as arising from a Yukawa coupling to an effective top-Higgs which develops a
small vacuum expectation value, while electroweak symmetry breaking results
largely from a Higgsless mechanism. As a result, the heavy partners of the
standard model fermions can be light enough to be seen at the LHC. After
presenting the model, we detail the phenomenology, showing that for a broad
range of masses, these heavy fermions are discoverable at the LHC.
