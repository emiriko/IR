The authors demonstrate readout of electrically detected magnetic resonance
at radio frequencies by means of an LCR tank circuit. Applied to a silicon
field-effect transistor at milli-kelvin temperatures, this method shows a
25-fold increased signal-to-noise ratio of the conduction band electron spin
resonance and a higher operational bandwidth of > 300 kHz compared to the kHz
bandwidth of conventional readout techniques. This increase in temporal
resolution provides a method for future direct observations of spin dynamics in
the electrical device characteristics.
