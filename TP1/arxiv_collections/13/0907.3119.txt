I will present physics measurements which are achievable in the ALICE
experiment at the LHC through the inclusion of a new electromagnetic
calorimeter. I will focus on jet measurements in proton proton and heavy ion
collisions. Detailed simulations have been performed on jet reconstruction, jet
triggering, heavy flavor jet reconstruction through electron identification,
gamma-jet reconstruction and the measurements of identified hadrons and
resonances in jets. I will show the physics capabilities which are made
possible through the combination of calorimeter information with the other
detector components in ALICE.
