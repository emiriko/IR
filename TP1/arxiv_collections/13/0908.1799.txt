We present an experimental study of full jet reconstruction in the high
multiplicity environment of heavy ion collisions, utilizing 200 GeV p+p and
central Au+Au data measured by STAR. Inclusive differential jet production
cross sections and ratios are reported, as well as high-pT hadron-jet
coincidences.
