In this paper I present several algorithmic techniques for improving the
decision process of multiple types of agents behaving in environments where
their interests are in conflict. The interactions between the agents are
modelled by using several types of two-player games, where the agents have
identical roles and compete for the same resources, or where they have
different roles, like in query-response games. The described situations have
applications in modelling behavior in many types of environments, like
distributed systems, learning environments, resource negotiation environments,
and many others. The mentioned models are applicable in a wide range of
domains, like computer science or the industrial (e.g. metallurgical), economic
or financial sector.
