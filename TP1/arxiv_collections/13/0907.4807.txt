We apply a simple model system of patchy particles to study monodisperse
self-assembly, using the Platonic solids as target structures. We find marked
differences between the assembly behaviours of the different systems.
Tetrahedra, octahedra and icosahedra assemble easily, while cubes are more
challenging and dodecahedra do not assemble. We relate these differences to the
kinetics and thermodynamics of assembly, with the formation of large disordered
aggregates a particular important competitor to correct assembly. In
particular, the free energy landscapes of those targets that are easy to
assemble are funnel-like, whereas for the dodecahedral system the landscape is
relatively flat with little driving force to facilitate escape from disordered
aggregates.
