In a recent contribution [arXiv:0904:4151] entanglement renormalization was
generalized to fermionic lattice systems in two spatial dimensions.
Entanglement renormalization is a real-space coarse-graining transformation for
lattice systems that produces a variational ansatz, the multi-scale
entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), for the ground states of local
Hamiltonians. In this paper we describe in detail the fermionic version of the
MERA formalism and algorithm. Starting from the bosonic MERA, which can be
regarded both as a quantum circuit or in relation to a coarse-graining
transformation, we indicate how the scheme needs to be modified to simulate
fermions. To confirm the validity of the approach, we present benchmark results
for free and interacting fermions on a square lattice with sizes between $6
\times 6$ and $162\times 162$ and with periodic boundary conditions. The
present formulation of the approach applies to generic tensor network
algorithms.
