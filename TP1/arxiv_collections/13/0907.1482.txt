We investigate the degree of discontinuity of several solution concepts from
non-cooperative game theory. While the consideration of Nash equilibria forms
the core of our work, also pure and correlated equilibria are dealt with.
Formally, we restrict the treatment to two player games, but results and proofs
extend to the n-player case. As a side result, the degree of discontinuity of
solving systems of linear inequalities is settled.
