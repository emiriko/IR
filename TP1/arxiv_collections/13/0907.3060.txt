A self-action problem for a pointlike charged particle arbitrarily moving in
flat spacetime of three dimensions is considered. Outgoing waves carry
energy-momentum and angular momentum; the radiation removes energy and angular
momentum from the source which then undergoes a radiation reaction. We
decompose Noether quantities carried by electromagnetic field into bound and
radiative components. The bound terms are absorbed by individual particle's
characteristics within the renormalization procedure. Radiative terms together
with already renormalized 3-momentum and angular momentum of pointlike charge
constitute the total conserved quantities of our particle plus field system.
Their differential consequences yield the effective equation of motion of
radiating charge in an external electromagnetic field. In this
integrodifferential equation the radiation reaction is determined by Lorentz
force of pointlike charge acting upon itself plus nonlocal term which provides
finiteness of the self-action.
