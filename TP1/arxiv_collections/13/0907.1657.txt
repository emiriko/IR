Following Feynman and as elaborated on by Lloyd, a universal quantum
simulator (QS) is a controlled quantum device which reproduces the dynamics of
any other many particle quantum system with short range interactions. This
dynamics can refer to both coherent Hamiltonian and dissipative open system
evolution. We investigate how laser excited Rydberg atoms in large spacing
optical or magnetic lattices can provide an efficient implementation of a
universal QS for spin models involving (high order) n-body interactions. This
includes the simulation of Hamiltonians of exotic spin models involving
n-particle constraints such as the Kitaev toric code, color code, and lattice
gauge theories with spin liquid phases. In addition, it provides the
ingredients for dissipative preparation of entangled states based on
engineering n-particle reservoir couplings. The key basic building blocks of
our architecture are efficient and high-fidelity n-qubit entangling gates via
auxiliary Rydberg atoms, including a possible dissipative time step via optical
pumping. This allows to mimic the time evolution of the system by a sequence of
fast, parallel and high-fidelity n-particle coherent and dissipative Rydberg
gates.
