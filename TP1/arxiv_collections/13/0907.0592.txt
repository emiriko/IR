In this paper, a new method for assigning credit to search operators is
presented. Starting with the principle of optimizing search bias, search
operators are selected based on an ability to create solutions that are
historically linked to future generations. Using a novel framework for defining
performance measurements, distributing credit for performance, and the
statistical interpretation of this credit, a new adaptive method is developed
and shown to outperform a variety of adaptive and non-adaptive competitors.
