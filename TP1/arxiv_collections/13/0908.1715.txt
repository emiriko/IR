We present unambiguous evidence for a parsec scale wind in the Broad-Line
Radio Galaxy (BLRG) 3C 382, the first radio-loud AGN, with $R_{\rm L} =
\log_{10}(f_{\rm 5GHz}/f_{4400})>1$, whereby an outflow has been measured with
X-ray grating spectroscopy. A 118 ks Chandra grating (HETG) observation of 3C
382 has revealed the presence of several high ionization absorption lines in
the soft X-ray band, from Fe, Ne, Mg and Si. The absorption lines are
blue-shifted with respect to the systemic velocity of 3C 382 by -840\pm60 km/s
and are resolved by Chandra with a velocity width of 340\pm70 km/s. The outflow
appears to originate from a single zone of gas of column density $N_{\rm H} =
1.3 \times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ and ionization parameter $\log \xi = 2.45$. From
the above measurements we calculate that the outflow is observed on parsec
scales, within the likely range from 10-1000 pc, i.e., consistent with an
origin in the Narrow Line Region.
