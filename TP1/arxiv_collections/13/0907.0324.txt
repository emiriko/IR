This current work is an extension to work previously done by the authors. The
dynamics of a baby skyrmion configuration, in a model Landau-Lifshitz equation,
was studied in the presence of various potential obstructions. The baby
skyrmion configuration was constructed from two Q=1 hedgehog solutions to the
new baby Skyrme model in $(2+1)$ dimensions.
  The potential obstructions were created by introducing a new term into the
Lagrangian which resulted in a localised inhomogeneity in the potential term's
coefficient. In the barrier system the normal circular path was deformed as the
skyrmions traversed the barrier, after which the skyrmions orbited the boundary
of the system. For critical values of the barrier height and width the
skyrmions were no longer bound although the unbound behaviour is not clearly
distinct from the bound. In the case of a potential hole the dynamics of baby
skyrmions is dependent upon the binding energy of the system. Depending upon
its value, the skyrmions' behaviour varies. The angular momentum must be
modified to ensure overall conservation. We show that there exists a link
between the oscillation in the skyrmion's energy density and the periods of
non-conservation of the angular momentum in Landau-Lifshitz models.
