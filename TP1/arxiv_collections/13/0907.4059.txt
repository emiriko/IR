We first observe that the (co)domains of the q-deformed functions are some
subsets of the (co)domains of their ordinary counterparts, thereby deeming the
deformed functions to be incomplete. In order to obtain a complete definition
of $q$-generalized functions, we calculate the dual mapping function, which is
found equal to the otherwise \textit{ad hoc} duality relation between the
ordinary and escort stationary distributions. Motivated by this fact, we show
that the maximization of the Tsallis entropy with the complete $q$-logarithm
and $q$-exponential implies the use of the ordinary probability distributions
instead of escort distributions. Moreover, we demonstrate that even the escort
stationary distributions can be obtained through the use of the ordinary
averaging procedure if the argument of the $q$-exponential lies in (-$\infty$,
0].
