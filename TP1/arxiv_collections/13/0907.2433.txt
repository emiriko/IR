We study the survival of ultrahigh energy nuclei injected in clusters of
galaxies, as well as their secondary neutrino and photon emissions, using a
complete numerical propagation method and a realistic modeling of the magnetic,
baryonic and photonic backgrounds. It is found that the survival of heavy
nuclei highly depends on the injection position and on the profile of the
magnetic field. Taking into account the limited lifetime of the central source
could also lead in some cases to the detection of a cosmic ray afterglow,
temporally decorrelated from neutrino and gamma ray emissions.
  We calculate that the diffusive neutrino flux around 1 PeV coming from
clusters of galaxies may have a chance to be detected by current instruments.
The observation of single sources in neutrinos and in gamma rays produced by
ultrahigh energy cosmic rays will be more difficult. Signals coming from lower
energy cosmic rays (E < 1 PeV), if they exist, might however be detected by
Fermi, for reasonable sets of parameters.
