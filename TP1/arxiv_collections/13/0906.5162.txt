We discuss a theoretical interpretation of the experiment by Fletcher, Zhang,
and Rolston [PRL, 96, 105003 (2006)], who revealed a number of subharmonics of
the electron emission under external irradiation of the freely-expanding clouds
of ultracold plasmas. The original interpretation of these subharmonics as
standing waves of plasma oscillations (the so-called Tonks-Dattner resonances)
encounters a number of problems, such as the lack of adequate boundary
conditions and incorrect dependence on the plasma temperature and the degree of
neutrality. It is the aim of the present comment to mention that a more
promising interpretation may be based on the peaks in the efficiency of
ionization of the secondary Rydberg atoms, formed during the plasma cloud
expansion and cooling. The presence of the last-mentioned peaks is well
supported by the independent experiment by Maeda and Gallagher [PRL, 93, 193002
(2004)].
