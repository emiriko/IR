A new dynamic state characterized by $(2m_l+1)\pi$ static phase kink with
integers $\{m_l\}$ is proposed recently in a stack of inductively coupled
Josephson junctions. In the present paper, the stability of the phase kink
state is investigated against many perturbations and it is shown that the kink
state is stable. It is also discussed that the suppression of the amplitude of
superconducting order parameter caused by the kink is weak.
