By combining the results from a self-consistent 2D dusty plasma fluid model
and a 3D N-body code, the equilibrium position and crystal structure were
determined for dust particles levitated in the sheath in a modified Gaseous
Electronics Conference (GEC) reference cell, in which the lower electrode was
heated or cooled. The Debye length, charge and electric field were
reconstructed on a sub-millimeter scale by applying a previously developed,
independent method. However, this method seems to overestimate the charge, and
hence underestimate the electric field. Even corrected for this fact, the
results show that the dust is levitated on the plasma side of the Bohm point.
