The internal disorder of a D-dimensional hydrogenic system, which is strongly
associated to the non-uniformity of the quantum-mechanical density of its
physical states, is investigated by means of the shape complexity in the two
reciprocal spaces. This quantity, which is the product of the disequilibrium
and the Shannon entropic power, is mathematically expressed for both ground and
excited stationary states in terms of certain entropic functionals of Laguerre
and Gegenbauer (or ultraspherical) polynomials. Emphasis is made in the ground
and circular states.
