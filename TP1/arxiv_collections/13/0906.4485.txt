Computational astrophysics has undergone unprecedented development over the
last decade, becoming a field of its own. The challenge ahead of us will
involve increasingly complex multi-scale simulations. These will bridge the gap
between areas of astrophysics such as star and planet formation, or star
formation and galaxy formation, that have evolved separately until today. A
global knowledge of the physics and modeling techniques of astrophysical
simulations is thus an important asset for the next generation of modelers.
With the aim at fostering such a global approach, we present the Special Issue
on Computational Astrophysics for the Advanced Science Letters
(http://www.aspbs.com/science.htm). The Advanced Science Letters (ASL) is a new
multi-disciplinary scientific journal which will cover extensively
computational astrophysics and cosmology, and will act as a forum for the
presentation and discussion of novel work attempting to connect different
research areas. This Special Issue collects 9 reviews on 9 key topics of modern
astrophysics and cosmology in which simulations have had a pivotal
contribution. From asteroid collisions to the formation of stars, from the
physics and origin of galaxy clusters to large-scale phenomena such as the
reionization of the Universe, it is a showcase of state-of-the-art numerical
work in a diverse range of topics. The 9 reviews are available on today's
listing of the astro-ph archive (arXiv id numbers are provided in this
foreword).
