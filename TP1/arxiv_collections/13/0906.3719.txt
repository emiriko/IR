We formulate a simple model for a gas of extended hadrons at zero chemical
potential by taking inspiration from the compressible bag model. We show that a
crossover transition qualitatively similar to lattice QCD can be reproduced by
such a system by including some appropriate additional dynamics. Under certain
conditions, at high temperature, the system consists of a finite number of
infinitely extended bags, which occupy the entire space. In this situation the
system behaves as an ideal gas of quarks and gluons.
