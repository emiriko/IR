After an introduction emphasizing the importance of the gravitomag- netic
effect in general relativity, with a resume of some space-based appli- cations,
we discuss the so-called magnetic components of gravitational waves (GWs),
which have to be taken into account in the context of the total response
functions of interferometers for GWs propagating from ar- bitrary directions.
