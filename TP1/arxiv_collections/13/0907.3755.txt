We define cusp-decomposable manifolds and prove smooth rigidity within this
class of manifolds. These manifolds generally do not admit a nonpositively
curved metric but can be decomposed into pieces that are diffeomorphic to
finite volume, locally symmetric, negatively curved manifolds with cusps. We
prove that the group of outer automorphisms of the fundamental group of such a
manifold is an extension of an abelian group by a finite group. Elements of the
abelian group are induced by diffeomorphisms that are analogous to Dehn twists
in surface topology. We also prove that the outer automophism group can be
realized by a group of diffeomorphisms of the manifold.
