We employ Faraday and Kerr effect spectroscopy in the infrared range to
investigate the electronic structure of Ga1-xMnxAs near the Fermi energy. The
band structure of this archetypical dilute-moment ferromagnetic semiconductor
has been a matter of controversy, fueled partly by previous measurements of the
unpolarized infrared absorption and their phenomenological impurity-band
interpretation. The infrared magneto-optical effects we study arise directly
from the spin-splitting of the carrier bands and their chiral asymmetry due to
spin-orbit coupling. Unlike the unpolarized absorption, they are intimately
related to ferromagnetism and their interpretation is much more microscopically
constrained in terms of the orbital character of the relevant band states. We
show that the conventional theory of the disordered valence band with dominant
As p-orbital character and coupled by kinetic-exchange to Mn local moments
accounts semi-quantitatively for the overall characteristics of the measured
infrared magneto-optical spectra.
