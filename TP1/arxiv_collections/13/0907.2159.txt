Entanglement distillation is an essential ingredient for long distance
quantum communications. In the continuous variable setting, Gaussian states
play major roles in quantum teleportation, quantum cloning and quantum
cryptography. However, entanglement distillation from Gaussian states has not
yet been demonstrated. It is made difficult by the no-go theorem stating that
no Gaussian operation can distill Gaussian states. Here we demonstrate the
entanglement distillation from Gaussian states by using measurement-induced
non-Gaussian operations, circumventing the fundamental restriction of the no-go
theorem. We observed a gain of entanglement as a result of conditional local
subtraction of a single photon or two photons from a two-mode Gaussian state.
Furthermore we confirmed that two-photon subtraction also improves
Gaussian-like entanglement as specified by the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)
correlation. This distilled entanglement can be further employed to downstream
applications such as high fidelity quantum teleportation and a loophole-free
Bell test.
