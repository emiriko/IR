This note suggests nomenclature for dealing with the units of various
astronomical quantities that are used with the relativistic time scales TT,
TDB, TCB and TCG. It is suggested to avoid wordings like "TDB units" and "TT
units" and avoid contrasting them to "SI units". The quantities intended for
use with TCG, TCB, TT or TDB should be called "TCG-compatible",
"TCB-compatible", "TT-compatible" or "TDB-compatible", respectively. The names
of the units second and meter for numerical values of all these quantities
should be used with out any adjectives. This suggestion comes from a special
discussion forum created within IAU Commission 52 "Relativity in Fundamental
Astronomy".
