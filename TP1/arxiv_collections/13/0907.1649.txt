We investigate theoretically shot noise in an artificial Single Molecule
Magnet based upon a CdTe quantum dot doped with a single S=5/2 Mn spin and
gated in the hole sector. Mn-hole exchange anisotropy is shown to lead to
profound consequences on noise, like super-Poissonian behaviour. We report on a
novel effect, similar to the Dicke effect in Quantum Optics, that allows to
separately extract the hole and Mn spin relaxation times using
frequency-resolved shot noise measurements. We expect that our findings may
have further relevance to experiments in other S>1/2 systems including
transport through Mn(12) molecules and STM spectroscopy of magnetic atoms.
