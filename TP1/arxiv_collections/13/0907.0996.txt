On January 2, the MAGIC-I Telescope observed GRB090102 (z=1.55) under
particularly good observation conditions. Using the recently upgraded MAGIC-1
sum trigger system, upper limits down to below 50 GeV have been obtained. This
is the first time that the new trigger system was fully exploited for a
Gamma-ray Burst (GRB) observation and shows the capabilities of the MAGIC
observatory for future follow-up observations.
