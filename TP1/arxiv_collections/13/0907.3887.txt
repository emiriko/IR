The visibility of the quantum interference "dip" seen in the Hong-Ou-Mandel
experiment is optimized when a symmetric 50/50 beamsplitter is used in the
interferometer. Here we show that the reduction in visibility caused by an
asymmetric beamsplitter can be compensated by manipulating the polarization
states of the two input photons. We experimentally demonstrate this by using a
highly asymmetric 10/90 beamsplitter, and converting an initial dip visibility
of 22% to a compensated value of 99%.
