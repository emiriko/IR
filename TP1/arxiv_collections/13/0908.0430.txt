The origin of Titan's atmospheric methane is a key issue for understanding
the origin of the Saturnian satellite system. It has been proposed that
serpentinization reactions in Titan's interior could lead to the formation of
the observed methane. Meanwhile, alternative scenarios suggest that methane was
incorporated in Titan's planetesimals before its formation. Here, we point out
that serpentinization reactions in Titan's interior are not able to reproduce
the deuterium over hydrogen (D/H) ratio observed at present in methane in its
atmosphere, and would require a maximum D/H ratio in Titan's water ice 30%
lower than the value likely acquired by the satellite during its formation,
based on Cassini observations at Enceladus. Alternatively, production of
methane in Titan's interior via radiolytic reactions with water can be
envisaged but the associated production rates remain uncertain. On the other
hand, a mechanism that easily explains the presence of large amounts of methane
trapped in Titan in a way consistent with its measured atmospheric D/H ratio is
its direct capture in the satellite's planetesimals at the time of their
formation in the solar nebula. In this case, the mass of methane trapped in
Titan's interior can be up to 1,300 times the current mass of atmospheric
methane.
