We study the dynamical stability of the macroscopic quantum oscillations
characterizing a system of three coupled Bose-Einstein condensates arranged
into an open-chain geometry. The boson interaction, the hopping amplitude and
the central-well relative depth are regarded as adjustable parameters. After
deriving the stability diagrams of the system, we identify three mechanisms to
realize the transition from an unstable to stable behavior and analyze specific
configurations that, by suitably tuning the model parameters, give rise to
macroscopic effects which are expected to be accessible to experimental
observation. Also, we pinpoint a system regime that realizes a
Josephson-junction-like effect. In this regime the system configuration do not
depend on the model interaction parameters, and the population oscillation
amplitude is related to the condensate-phase difference. This fact makes
possible estimating the latter quantity, since the measure of the oscillating
amplitudes is experimentally accessible.
