Single strain-induced quantum dots are isolated for optical experiments by
selective removal of the inducing InP islands from the sample surface.
Unpolarized emission of single, bi- and triexciton transitions are identified
by power-dependent photoluminescence spectroscopy. Employing time-resolved
experiments performed at different excitation powers we find a pronounced shift
of the rise and decay times of these different transitions as expected from
cascaded emission. Good agreement is found for a rate equation model for a
three step cascade.
