This paper is about a new way for programming distributed applications: the
service-oriented one. It is a concept paper based upon our experience in
developing a theory and a language for programming services. Both the
theoretical formalization and the language interpreter showed us the evidence
that a new programming paradigm exists. In this paper we illustrate the basic
features it is characterized by.
