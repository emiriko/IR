We argue that deeply virtual Compton scattering will display Regge behavior
nu^alpha_R(t) at high energy at fixed-t, even at high photon virtuality, not
necessarily conventional scaling. A way to see this is to track the Reggeon
contributions to quark-nucleon scattering and notice that the resulting
Generalized Parton Distributions would have divergent behavior at the
break-points. In addition, we show that the direct two-photon to quark coupling
will be accessible at large $t$ where it dominates the DVCS amplitude for large
energies. This contribution, the J=0 fixed-pole, should be part of the future
DVCS experimental programs at Jlab or LHeC.
