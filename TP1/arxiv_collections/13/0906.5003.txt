While it is well known that most massive stars are found to be part of binary
or multiple systems, an accurate characterization of the statistical properties
of these multiple objects is still lacking. In the present talk, we will review
the current status of the field, emphasizing the need of using complementarity
techniques to cover the large parameter space. We will also describe what we
think is the place of interferometry in this context.
