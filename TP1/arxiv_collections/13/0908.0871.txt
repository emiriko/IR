We propose a model addressing the coupling mechanism between two spatially
modulated monolayers. We obtain the mean-field phase diagrams of coupled
bilayers when the two monolayers have the same preferred modulation wavelength.
Various combinations of the monolayer modulated phases are obtained and their
relative stability is calculated. Due to the coupling, a spatial modulation in
one of the monolayers induces a similar periodic structure in the second one.
We have also performed numerical simulations for the case when the two
monolayers have different modulation wavelengths. Complex patterns may arise
from the frustration between the two incommensurate but annealed structures.
