First three sections of this overview paper cover classical topics of
deformation theory of associative algebras and necessary background material.
We then analyze algebraic structures of the Hochschild cohomology and describe
the relation between deformations and solutions of the corresponding
Maurer-Cartan equation. In Section 6 we generalize the Maurer-Cartan equation
to strongly homotopy Lie algebras and prove the homotopy invariance of the
moduli space of solutions of this equation. In the last section we indicate the
main ideas of Kontsevich's proof of the existence of deformation quantization
of Poisson manifolds.
