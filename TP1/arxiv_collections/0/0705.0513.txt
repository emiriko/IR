Lunar laser ranging analysis, as regularly performed in the solar system
barycentric frame, requires the presence of the gravitomagnetic term in the
equation of motion at the strength predicted by general relativity. The same
term is responsible for the Lense Thirring effect. Any attempt to modify the
strength of the gravitomagnetic interaction would have to do so in a way that
does not destroy the fit to lunar ranging data and other observations.
