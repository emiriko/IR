We present perturbative charged rotating 5D Einstein-Maxwell black holes with
spherical horizon topology. The electric charge Q is the perturbative
parameter, the perturbations being performed up to 4th order. The expressions
for the relevant physical properties of these black holes are given. The
gyromagnetic ratio g, in particular, is explicitly shown to be non-constant in
higher order, and thus to deviate from its lowest order value, g=3. Comparison
of the perturbative analytical solutions with their non-perturbative numerical
counterparts shows remarkable agreement.
