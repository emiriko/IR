We study the critical behavior of magnetic thin films as a function of the
film thickness. We use the ferromagnetic Ising model with the high-resolution
multiple histogram Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. We show that though the 2D
behavior remains dominant at small thicknesses, there is a systematic
continuous deviation of the critical exponents from their 2D values. We observe
that in the same range of varying thickness the deviation of the exponent $\nu$
is very small from its 2D value, while exponent $\beta$ suffers a larger
deviation. Moreover, as long as the film thickness is fixed, i. e. no finite
size scaling is done in the $z$ direction perpendicular to the film, the 3D
values of the critical exponents cannot be attained even with very large (but
fixed) thickness. The crossover to 3D universality class cannot therefore take
place without finite size scaling applied in the $z$ direction, in the limit of
numerically accessible thicknesses. From values of exponent $\alpha$ obtained
by MC, we estimate the effective dimension of the system. We conclude that with
regard to the critical behavior, thin films behave as systems with effective
dimension between 2 and 3.
