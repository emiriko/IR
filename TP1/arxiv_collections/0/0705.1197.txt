We cool the fundamental mode of a miniature cantilever by capacitively
coupling it to a driven rf resonant circuit. Cooling results from the rf
capacitive force, which is phase shifted relative to the cantilever motion. We
demonstrate the technique by cooling a 7 kHz cantilever from room temperature
to 45 K, obtaining reasonable agreement with a model for the cooling, damping,
and frequency shift. Extending the method to higher frequencies in a cryogenic
system could enable ground state cooling and may prove simpler than related
optical experiments in a low temperature apparatus.
