In this paper, we consider a leader-following consensus problem of a group of
autonomous agents with time-varying coupling delays. Two different cases of
coupling topologies are investigated. At first, a necessary and sufficient
condition is proved in the case when the interconnection topology is fixed and
directed. Then a sufficient condition is proposed in the case when the coupling
topology is switched and balanced. Numerical examples are also given to
illustrate our results.
