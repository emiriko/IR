The first order perturbations of the energy levels of a hydrogen atom in
central internal gravitational field are investigated. The internal
gravitational field is produced by the mass of the atomic nucleus. The energy
shifts are calculated for the relativistic 1S, 2S, 2P, 3S, 3P, 3D, 4S and 4P
levels with Schwarzschild metric. The calculated results show that the
gravitational corrections are sensitive to the total angular momentum quantum
number.
