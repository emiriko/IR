In this paper, it is shown that the cosmological model that was introduced in
a sequence of three earlier papers under the title, A Dust Universe Solution to
the Dark Energy Problem can be used to analyse and solve the Cosmological
Coincidence Problem. The generic coincidence problem that appears in the
original Einstein universe model is shown to arise from a misunderstanding
about the magnitude of dark energy density and the epoch time governing the
appearance of the integer relation between dark energy and normal energy
density. The solution to the generic case then clearly points to the source of
the time coincidence integer problem in the Friedman dust universe model. It is
then possible to eliminate this coincidence by removing a degeneracy between
different measurement epoch times. In this paper's first appendix, a
fundamental time dependent relation between dark mass and dark energy is
derived with suggestions how this relation could explain cosmological voids and
the clumping of dark mass to become visible matter. In this paper's second
appendix, it is shown that that dark energy is a conserved with time substance
that is everywhere and for all time permeable to the dark mass and visible mass
of which the contracting or expanding universe is composed. The last two
appendices involve detailed studies of cosmology, quantum dark energy related
issues. There are more detailed abstracts given with all four appendices.
