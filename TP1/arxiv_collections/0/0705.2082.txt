We study plasma effects in a micromachined high-electron mobility transistor
(HEMT) with the microcantilever serving as the gate using the developed a
model. The model accounts for mechanical motion of the microcantilever and
spatio-temporal variations (plasma effects) of the two-dimensional electron
gas(2DEG) system in the transistor channel. The microcantilever mechanical
motion is described in the point-mass approximation. The hydrodynamic electron
transport model is used to describe distributed electron plasma phenomena in
the 2DEG system. Using the developed model, we calculated the response function
characterizing the amplitude microcantilever oscillations and the output
electric signal as functions of the signal frequency and the bias voltage for
the devices with different parameters. We find the voltage dependences of the
frequency of the mechanical resonance and its damping. In particular, it is
demonstrated that the amplitudes of the mechanical oscillations and output
electric signal exhibit pronounced maxima at the bias voltages close to the
voltage of the 2DEG channel depletion followed by a steep drop with further
increase in the bias voltage.
