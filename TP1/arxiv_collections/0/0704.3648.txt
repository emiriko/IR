In this paper, we investigate the linear perturbations of the spherically
symmetric spacetimes with kinematic self-similarity of the second kind. The
massless scalar field equations are solved which yield the background and an
exact solutions for the perturbed equations. We discuss the boundary conditions
of the resulting perturbed solutions. The possible perturbation modes turn out
to be stable as well as unstable. The analysis leads to the conclusion that
there does not exist any critical solution.
