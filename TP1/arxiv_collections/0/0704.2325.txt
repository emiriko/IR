The process of annealing of a CdTe:Cl ingot during its cooling after growth
was studied. The annealing was performed in two stages: a high-temperature
stage, with an approximate equality of chlorine and cadmium vacancy
concentrations established at the thermodynamic equilibrium between the crystal
and vapors of volatile components, and a low-temperature stage, with charged
defects interacting to form neutral associations. The chlorine concentrations
necessary to obtain semi-insulating crystals were determined for various ingot
cooling rates in the high temperature stage. The dependence of the chlorine
concentration [Cl+Te] in the ingot on the temperature of annealing in the
high-temperature stage was found. The carrier lifetimes and drift mobilities
were obtained in relation to the temperature and cadmium vapor pressure in the
postgrowth annealing of the ingot.
