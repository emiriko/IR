The Friedel oscillations resulting from coupling a quantum dot to one edge of
a disordered one-dimensional wire in the Mott insulator regime, are calculated
numerically using the DMRG method. By investigating the influence of the
disorder on the Friedel oscillations decay we find that the effect of disorder
is reduced by increasing the interaction strength. This behavior is opposite to
the recently reported influence of disorder in the Anderson insulator regime,
where disorder led to a stronger decay of the Friedel oscillations.
