We study maximal helicity three gaugino operators in N=4 Super Yang-Mills
theory. We show that the lowest anomalous dimension of scaling operators with
generic finite spin can be expressed in terms of the universal anomalous
dimension appearing at twist-2. This statement is rigourously proved at three
loops. The reason for this universality between sectors with different twist is
the hidden psu(1|1) invariance of the su(2|1) subsector of the theory.
