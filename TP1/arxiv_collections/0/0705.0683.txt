The effects of a thermalized gas of gluons in a q,q bar plasma is
investigated. Then the interplay between Debye screening and confinement is
analyzed in a simplified model. While the one-gluon exchange gives results very
similar, but not equal, to the electric case, the phenomenological introduction
of confinement leads to very different results.
