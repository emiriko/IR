Results on inclusive jet production in proton-antiproton collisions at
sqrt(s) =1.96 TeV based on 1 fb-1 of CDF Run II data are presented.
Measurements are preformed using the k_T algorithm in a wide range of jet
transverse momentum and jet rapidity. The measured cross sections are compared
to next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations.
