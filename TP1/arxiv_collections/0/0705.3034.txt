Starting from the Ginzburg-Landau free energy describing the normal state to
Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell (LOFF) state transition, we evaluate the free
energy of seven most common lattice structures such as stripe, square,
triangular,Simple Cubic (SC), Face centered Cubic (FCC),Body centered Cubic
(BCC) and Quasi-crystal (QC). We find that the stripe phase which is the
original LO state, is the most stable phase. This result maybe relevant to the
detection of LOFF state in some heavy fermion compounds and the pairing lattice
structure of fermions with unequal populations in the BCS side of Feshbach
resonance in ultra-cold atoms.
