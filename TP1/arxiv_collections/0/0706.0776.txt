The use of micro-Raman spectroscopy, through chemical bond nano-scale probes,
allows the changes in conformations (alpha helix -> beta sheet), chain
orientation, disconnection of disulfide bonds (-20%) and the increase of intra
and inter-chain distances during the strain to be distinguished. The
combination of micro-Raman spectroscopy and a allows a quantitative measure of
the extension of chemical bonds in the peptidic chain during loading. The
nano-structural transformations of keratin during the strain of human hair in a
dry environment (40-60 % relative humidity) and saturated with water have been
studied. The water permits the sliding of the chains and decreases the bond
energy hair. Spectral analyses and 2D correlation are two coherent and
independent methods to follow change the Raman probes which are sensitive to
structural . The between nano-mechanical (Raman) and micro-mechanical
(strain/stress) analyses confirms the validity of the experimental results,
tools and principles used, as well as the agreement with the structural model
of keratin fibres described by Chapman & Hearle.
