We derive one loop constraints on the anomalous quartic gauge couplings using
a general non-forward dispersion relation for the elastic scattering amplitude
of two longitudinally polarized vector bosons. We compare this result with
another one derived by the assumption that the underlying theory satisfies the
causality principle of Special Relativity and show that this latter is more
constraining.
