Fluids in which the interparticle potential has a hard core, is attractive at
moderate separations, and repulsive at greater separations are known to exhibit
novel phase behavior, including stable inhomogeneous phases. Here we report a
joint simulation and theoretical study of such a fluid, focusing on the
relationship between the liquid-vapor transition line and any new phases. The
phase diagram is studied as a function of the amplitude of the attraction for a
certain fixed amplitude of the long ranged repulsion. We find that the effect
of the repulsion is to substitute the liquid-vapor critical point and a portion
of the associated liquid-vapor transition line, by two first order transitions.
One of these transitions separates the vapor from a fluid of spherical
liquidlike clusters; the other separates the liquid from a fluid of spherical
voids. At low temperature, the two transition lines intersect one another and a
vapor-liquid transition line at a triple point. While most integral equation
theories are unable to describe the new phase transitions, the Percus Yevick
approximation does succeed in capturing the vapor-cluster transition, as well
as aspects of the structure of the cluster fluid, in reasonable agreement with
the simulation results.
