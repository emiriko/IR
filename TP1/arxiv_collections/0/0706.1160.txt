The classification of earthquakes in main shocks and aftershocks by a method
recently proposed by M. Baiesi and M. Paczuski allows to the generation of a
complex network composed of clusters that group the most correlated events. The
spatial distribution of epicentres inside these structures corresponding to the
catalogue of earthquakes in the eastern region of Cuba shows anomalous
anti-diffusive behaviour evidencing the attractive nature of the main shock and
the possible description in terms of fractional kinetics.
