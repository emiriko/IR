We show that the monogamy of entanglement is a sufficient phenomenon in every
physical theory, if the quantum key distribution is to be safe on the grounds
of such theory. To do so we present the QKD protocol that is safe in any
physical theory under the assumption of the monogamous entanglement only. The
necessity of this condition is also discussed.
