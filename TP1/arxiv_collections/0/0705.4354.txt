We analyze recent data on the electroproduction of hadrons on nuclei using
the Lund model for electroproduction on nucleons and a simple geometrical model
for the absorption effects. We show that the model seems to overestimate the
A-dependence of the absorption effects, although it described the earlier data
of the same HERMES experiment reasonably well. We trace the origin of this
discrepancy to the surprising difference between the data for nitrogen and
neon.
