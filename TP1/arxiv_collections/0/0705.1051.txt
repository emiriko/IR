The charged-current quasi-elastic scattering of muon neutrinos on oxygen
target is computed for neutrino energies between 200 MeV and 2.5 GeV using the
relativistic distorted-wave impulse approximation with relativistic optical
potential, which was earlier successfully applied to describe electron-nucleus
data. We study both neutrino and electron processes and show that the reduced
exclusive cross sections for neutrino and electron scattering are similar. The
comparison with the relativistic Fermi gas model (RFGM), which is widely used
in data analyses of neutrino experiments, shows that the RFGM fails completely
when applied to exclusive cross section data and leads to overestimated values
of inclusive and total cross sections. We also found significant nuclear-model
dependence of exclusive, inclusive and total cross sections for about 1 GeV
energy.
