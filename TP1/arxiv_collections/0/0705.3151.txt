We present preliminary results for a high statistics study of the topological
charge distribution in the SU(3) Yang-Mills theory obtained by using the
definition of the charge suggested by Neuberger fermions. We find statistical
evidence for deviations from a gaussian distribution. The large statistics
required has been obtained by using PCs of the INFN-GRID.
