In this work we solve the Dirac equation by constructing the exact bound
state solutions for a mixing of vector and scalar generalized Hartmann
potentials. This is done provided the vector potential is equal to or minus the
scalar potential. The cases of some quasi-exactly solvable and Morse-like
potentials are briefly commented.
