It was recently noted that the dispersion relation for the magnons of planar
N=4 SYM can be identified with the Casimir of a certain deformation of the
Poincare algebra, in which the energy and momentum operators are supplemented
by a boost generator J. By considering the relationship between J and su(2|2) x
R^2, we derive a q-deformed super-Poincare symmetry algebra of the kinematics.
Using this, we show that the dynamic magnon representations may be obtained by
boosting from a fixed rest-frame representation. We comment on aspects of the
coalgebra structure and some implications for the question of boost-covariance
of the S-matrix.
