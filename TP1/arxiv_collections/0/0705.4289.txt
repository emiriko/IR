This is continuation of the approach to performing quantum algorithms using
geometric structures which was presented by Aerts and Czachor. We solve the
Simon's problem which, next to the Shor's alghorithm, is a representative of a
quantum hidden subgroup class. We also highlight some advantages resulting from
the fact that no quantum mechanics is involved.
