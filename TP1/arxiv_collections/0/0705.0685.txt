We present 3 yr of timing observations for PSR J1453+1902, a 5.79-ms pulsar
discovered during a 430-MHz drift-scan survey with the Arecibo telescope. Our
observations show that PSR J1453+1902 is solitary and has a proper motion of
8(2) mas/yr. At the nominal distance of 1.2 kpc estimated from the pulsar's
dispersion measure, this corresponds to a transverse speed of 46(11) km/s,
typical of the millisecond pulsar population. We analyse the current sample of
55 millisecond pulsars in the Galactic disk and revisit the question of whether
the luminosities of isolated millisecond pulsars are different from their
binary counterparts. We demonstrate that the apparent differences in the
luminosity distributions seen in samples selected from 430-MHz surveys can be
explained by small-number statistics and observational selection biases. An
examination of the sample from 1400-MHz surveys shows no differences in the
distributions. The simplest conclusion from the current data is that the spin,
kinematic, spatial and luminosity distributions of isolated and binary
millisecond pulsars are consistent with a single homogeneous population.
