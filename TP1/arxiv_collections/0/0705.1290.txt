From several points of view it is strongly suggested that the current
universe is unstable and will ultimately decay to one that is exactly
supersymmetric (susy). The possibility that atoms and molecules form in this
future universe requires that the degenerate electron/selectron mass is
non-zero and hence that electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) survives the phase
transition to exact susy. However, the minimal supersymmetric standard model
(MSSM) and several of its extensions have no EWSB in the susy limit. Among the
extended higgs models that have been discussed one stands out in this regard.
The higgs sector that is revealed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will
therefore have implications for the future universe. We also address the
question as to whether the transition to the exact susy phase with EWSB is
exothermic.
