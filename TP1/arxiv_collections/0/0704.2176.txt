We review the theoretical methods to evaluate fusion cross sections in
collisions of weakly bound nuclei. We piont out that in such collisions the
coupling to the breakup channel leads to the appearance of different fusion
processes. The extentsion of the coupled-channel method to coupling with the
continuum is the most successful treatment for these collisions. However,
evaluating separate cross section for each fusion process remains a very hard
task.
