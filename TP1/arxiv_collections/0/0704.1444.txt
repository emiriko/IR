Molecular dynamics simulations of crack propagation are performed for two
extreme cases of complex metallic alloys (CMAs): In a model quasicrystal the
structure is determined by clusters of atoms, whereas the model C15 Laves phase
is a simple periodic stacking of a unit cell. The simulations reveal that the
basic building units of the structures also govern their fracture behaviour.
Atoms in the Laves phase play a comparable role to the clusters in the
quasicrystal. Although the latter are not rigid units, they have to be regarded
as significant physical entities.
