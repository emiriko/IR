Higgs boson production in association with two tagging jets will be mediated
by electroweak vector boson fusion and by gluon fusion. For the gluon fusion
process, analysis of the azimuthal angle correlations of the two jets provides
for a direct measurement of the CP-nature of the $Htt$ Yukawa coupling which is
responsible for the effective $Hgg$ vertex.
