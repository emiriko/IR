We present optical UBVRI sky brightness measures from 1992 through 2006. The
data are based on CCD imagery obtained with the CTIO 0.9-m, 1.3-m, and 1.5-m
telescopes. The B- and V-band data are in reasonable agreement with
measurements previously made at Mauna Kea, though on the basis of a small
number of images per year there are discrepancies for the years 1992 through
1994. Our CCD-based data are not significantly different than values obtained
at Cerro Paranal. We find that the yearly averages of V-band sky brightness are
best correlated with the 10.7-cm solar flux taken 5 days prior to the sky
brightness measures. This implies an average speed of 350 km/sec for the solar
wind. While we can measure an enhancement of the night sky levels over La
Serena 10 degrees above the horizon, at elevation angles above 45 degrees we
find no evidence that the night sky brightness at Cerro Tololo is affected by
artificial light of nearby towns and cities.
