We show that the characters of all highest weight modules over an affine Lie
algebra with the highest weight away from the critical hyperplane are
meromorphic functions in the positive half of Cartan subalgebra, their
singularities being at most simple poles at zeros of real roots. We obtain some
information about these singularities.
