We consider the cosmological role of the scalar fields generated by the
compactification of 11-dimensional Einstein gravity on a 7D elliptic twisted
torus, which has the attractive features of giving rise to a positive
semi-definite potential, and partially fixing the moduli. This compactification
is therefore relevant for low energy M-theory, 11D supergravity. We find that
slow-roll inflation with the moduli is not possible, but that there is a novel
scaling solution in Friedmann cosmologies in which the massive moduli oscillate
but maintain a constant energy density relative to the background barotropic
fluid.
