The spectrum of supersymmetric theories with R-parity violation are much more
weakly constrained than that of supersymmetric theories with a stable
neutralino. We investigate the signatures of supersymmetry at the LHCb
experiment in the region of parameter space where the neutralino decay leaves a
displaced vertex. We find sensitivity to squark production up to squark masses
of order 1 TeV. We note that if the Higgs decays to neutralinos in this
scenario, LHCb should see the lightest Higgs boson before ATLAS and CMS.
