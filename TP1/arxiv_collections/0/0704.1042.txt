Entangling and disentangling capacities are the key manifestation of the
nonlocal content of a quantum operation. A lot of effort has been put recently
into investigating (dis)entangling capacities of unitary operations, but very
little is known about capacities of non-unitary operations. Here we investigate
(dis)entangling capacities of unital CPTP maps acting on two qubits.
