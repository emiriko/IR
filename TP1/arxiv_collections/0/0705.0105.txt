From a detailed analysis of InN epilayers deposited in a close-coupled
showerhead metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE) system under various
conditions we investigate the effect of growth parameters on the lattice
constants of the InN layer. The layers are under significant internal
hydrostatic stress which influences the optical properties. Samples typically
fall into two broad categories of stress, with resultant luminescence emission
around 0.8eV and 1.1eV. We can correlate the internal stress in the layer and
the value of the optical absorption edge, and the PL emission wavelength.
