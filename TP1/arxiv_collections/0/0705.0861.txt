We study the spectrum of the even parity excitations of the nucleon in
quenched lattice QCD. We extend our earlier analysis by including an expanded
basis of nucleon interpolating fields, increasing the physical size of the
lattice, including more configurations to enhance statistics and probing closer
to the chiral limit. With a review of world lattice data, we conclude that
there is little evidence of the Roper resonance in quenched lattice QCD.
