We present a general theoretical method to generate maximally entangled mixed
states of a pair of photons initially prepared in the singlet polarization
state. This method requires only local operations upon a single photon of the
pair and exploits spatial degrees of freedom to induce decoherence. We report
also experimental confirmation of these theoretical results.
