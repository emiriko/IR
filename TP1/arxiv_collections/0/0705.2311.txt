In the classical one-dimensional solution of fluid dynamics equations all
unknown functions depend only on time t and Cartesian coordinate x. Although
fluid spreads in all directions (velocity vector has three components) the
whole picture of motion is relatively simple: trajectory of one fluid particle
from plane x=const completely determines motion of the whole plane. Basing on
the symmetry analysis of differential equations we propose generalization of
this solution allowing movements in different directions of fluid particles
belonging to plane x=const. At that, all functions but an angle determining the
direction of particle's motion depend on t and x only, whereas the angle
depends on all coordinates. In this solution the whole picture of motion
superposes from identical trajectories placed under different angles in 3D
space. Orientations of the trajectories are restricted by a finite relation
possessing functional arbitrariness. The solution describes three-dimensional
nonlinear processes and singularities in infinitely conducting plasma, gas or
incompressible liquid.
