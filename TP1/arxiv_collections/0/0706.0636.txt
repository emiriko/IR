Results for the cross sections of the exclusive 16O(e,e'pn)14N and
16O(gamma,pn)14N knockout reactions are presented and discussed in different
kinematics. In comparison with earlier work, a complete treatment of the
center-of-mass (CM) effects in the nuclear one-body current is considered in
connection with the problem of the lack of orthogonality between initial bound
and final scattering states. The effects due to CM and orthogonalization are
investigated in combination with different treatments of correlations in the
two-nucleon overlap function and for different parametrizations of the two-body
currents. The CM effects lead in super-parallel kinematics to a dramatic
increase of the 16O(e,e'pn) cross section to the 1_2^+ excited state (3.95 MeV)
of 14N. In all the situations considered the results are very sensitive to the
treatment of correlations. A crucial role is played by tensor correlations, but
also the contribution of long-range correlations is important.
