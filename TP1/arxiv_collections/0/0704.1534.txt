We present a modified outer gap model to study the phase-resolved spectra of
the Crab pulsar. A theoretical double peak profile of the light curve
containing the whole phase is shown to be consistent with the observed light
curve of the Crab pulsar by shifting the inner boundary of the outer gap
inwardly to $\sim 10$ stellar radii above the neutron star surface. In this
model, the radial distances of the photons corresponding to different phases
can be determined in the numerical calculation. Also the local electrodynamics,
such as the accelerating electric field, the curvature radius of the magnetic
field line and the soft photon energy, are sensitive to the radial distances to
the neutron star. Using a synchrotron self-Compton mechanism, the
phase-resolved spectra with the energy range from 100 eV to 3 GeV of the Crab
pulsar can also be explained.
