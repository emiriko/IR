The purpose of this work is to test the application of the finite element
method to quantum mechanical problems, in particular for solving the
Schroedinger equation.
  We begin with an overview of quantum mechanics, and standard numerical
techniques. We then give an introduction to finite element analysis using the
diffusion equation as an example. Three numerical time evolution methods are
considered: the (tried and tested) Crank-Nicolson method, the continuous
space-time method, and the discontinuous space-time method.
