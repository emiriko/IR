We examine the orbits of satellite galaxies identified in a suite of
N-body/gasdynamical simulations of the formation of $L_*$ galaxies in a LCDM
universe. Most satellites follow conventional orbits; after turning around,
they accrete into their host halo and settle on orbits whose apocentric radii
are steadily eroded by dynamical friction. However, a number of outliers are
also present, we find that ~1/3 of satellites identified at $z=0$ are on
unorthodox orbits, with apocenters that exceed their turnaround radii. This
population of satellites on extreme orbits consists typically of the faint
member of a satellite pair that has been ejected onto a highly-energetic orbit
during its first approach to the primary. Since the concurrent accretion of
multiple satellite systems is a defining feature of hierarchical models of
galaxy formation, we speculate that this three-body ejection mechanism may be
the origin of (i) some of the newly discovered high-speed satellites around M31
(such as Andromeda XIV); (ii) some of the distant fast-receding Local Group
members, such as Leo I; and (iii) the oddly isolated dwarf spheroidals Cetus
and Tucana in the outskirts of the Local Group. Our results suggest that care
must be exercised when using the orbits of the most weakly bound satellites to
place constraints on the total mass of the Local Group.
