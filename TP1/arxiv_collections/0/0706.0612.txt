We consider the algebraic form of a generalized Lame equation with five free
parameters. By introducing a generalization of Jacobi's elliptic functions we
transform this equation to a 1-dim time-independent Schroedinger equation with
(quasi-doubly) periodic potential. We show that only for a finite set of
integral values for the five parameters quasi-doubly periodic eigenfunctions
expressible in terms of generalized Jacobi functions exist. For this purpose we
also establish a relation to the generalized Ince equation.
