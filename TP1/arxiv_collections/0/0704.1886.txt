The Kripke semantics of classical propositional normal modal logic is made
algebraic via an embedding of Kripke structures into the larger class of
pointed stably supported quantales. This algebraic semantics subsumes the
traditional algebraic semantics based on lattices with unary operators, and it
suggests natural interpretations of modal logic, of possible interest in the
applications, in structures that arise in geometry and analysis, such as
foliated manifolds and operator algebras, via topological groupoids and inverse
semigroups. We study completeness properties of the quantale based semantics
for the systems K, T, K4, S4, and S5, in particular obtaining an axiomatization
for S5 which does not use negation or the modal necessity operator. As
additional examples we describe intuitionistic propositional modal logic, the
logic of programs PDL, and the ramified temporal logic CTL.
