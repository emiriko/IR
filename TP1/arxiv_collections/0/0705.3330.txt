We discuss some features of supersymmetry breaking induced by a
brane-localized source which is stabilized at the IR end of warped throat, and
also the resulting mirage mediation pattern of soft terms of the visible fields
which are localized in the bulk space corresponding to the UV end of throat.
Such supersymmetry breaking scheme can be naturally realized in KKLT-type
string compactification, and predicts highly distinctive pattern of low energy
superparticle masses which might be tested at the LHC.
