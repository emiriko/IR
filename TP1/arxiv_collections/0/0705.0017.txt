Quantum computing promises exponential speed-ups for important simulation and
optimization problems. It also poses new CAD problems that are similar to, but
more challenging, than the related problems in classical (non-quantum) CAD,
such as determining if two states or circuits are functionally equivalent.
While differences in classical states are easy to detect, quantum states, which
are represented by complex-valued vectors, exhibit subtle differences leading
to several notions of equivalence. This provides flexibility in optimizing
quantum circuits, but leads to difficult new equivalence-checking issues for
simulation and synthesis. We identify several different equivalence-checking
problems and present algorithms for practical benchmarks, including quantum
communication and search circuits, which are shown to be very fast and robust
for hundreds of qubits.
