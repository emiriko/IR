We study bottlebrush macromolecules in a good solvent by small-angle neutron
scattering (SANS), static light scattering (SLS), and dynamic light scattering
(DLS). These polymers consist of a linear backbone to which long side chains
are chemically grafted. The backbone contains about 1600 monomer units (weight
average) and every second monomer unit carries side-chains with ca. 60 monomer
units. The SLS- and SANS data extrapolated to infinite dilution lead to the
form factor of the polymer that can be described in terms of a worm-like chain
with a contour length of 380 nm and a persistence length of 17.5 nm. An
analysis of the DLS data confirm these model parameters. The scattering
intensities taken at finite concentration can be modeled using the polymer
reference interaction site model. It reveals a softening of the bottlebrush
polymers caused by their mutual interaction. We demonstrate that the
persistence decreases from 17.5 nm down to 5 nm upon increasing the
concentration from dilute solution to the highest concentration 40.59 g/l under
consideration. The observed softening of the chains is comparable to the
theoretically predicted decrease of the electrostatic persistence length of
linear polyelectrolyte chains at finite concentrations.
