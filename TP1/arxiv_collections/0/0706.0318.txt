In this paper, we present a framework for getting a series of exact vacuum
solutions to the Einstein equation. This procedure of resolution is based on a
canonical form of the metric. According to this procedure, the Einstein
equation can be reduced to some 2-dimensional Laplace-like equations or
rotation and divergence equations, which are much convenient for the
resolution.
