We have used the very large JVAS/CLASS 8.4-GHz surveys of flat-spectrum radio
sources to test the hypothesis that there is a systematic alignment of
polarization position angle vectors on cosmological scales of the type claimed
by Hutsemekers et al (2005). The polarization position angles of 4290 sources
with polarized flux density >=1 mJy have been examined. They do not reveal
large-scale alignments either as a whole or when split in half into
high-redshift (z >= 1.24) and low-redshift sub-samples. Nor do the radio
sources which lie in the specific areas covered by Hutsemekers et al (2005).
show any significant effect. We have also looked at the position angles of
parsec-scale jets derived from VLBI observations and again find no evidence for
systematic alignments. Finally, we have investigated the correlation between
the polarization position angle and those of the parsec-scale jets. As
expected, we find that there is a tendency for the polarization angles to be
perpendicular to the jet angles. However, the difference in jet and
polarization position angles does not show any systematic trend in different
parts of the sky.
