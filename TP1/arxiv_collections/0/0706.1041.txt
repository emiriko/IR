We explore the rich internal structure of Cs_2 Feshbach molecules. Pure
ultracold molecular samples are prepared in a CO_2-laser trap, and a multitude
of weakly bound states is populated by elaborate magnetic-field ramping
techniques. Our methods use different Feshbach resonances as input ports and
various internal level crossings for controlled state transfer. We populate
higher partial-wave states of up to eight units of rotational angular momentum
(l-wave states). We investigate the molecular structure by measurements of the
magnetic moments for various states. Avoided level crossings between different
molecular states are characterized through the changes in magnetic moment and
by a Landau-Zener tunneling method. Based on microwave spectroscopy, we present
a precise measurement of the magnetic-field dependent binding energy of the
weakly bound s-wave state that is responsible for the large background
scattering length of Cs. This state is of particular interest because of its
quantum-halo character.
