We analyse a series of pilot observations in order to study microlensing of
(unresolved) stars in M31 with the 1.5m Loiano telescope, including
observations on both identified variable source stars and reported microlensing
events. We also look for previously unknown variability and discover a nova. We
discuss an observing strategy for an extended campaign with the goal of
determining whether MACHOs exist or whether all microlensing events are
compatible with lens stars in M31.
