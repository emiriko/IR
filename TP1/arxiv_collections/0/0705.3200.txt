We apply the real-time renormalization group (RG) in nonequilibrium to an
arbitrary quantum dot in the Coulomb blockade regime. Within one-loop
RG-equations, we include self-consistently the kernel governing the dynamics of
the reduced density matrix of the dot. As a result, we find that relaxation and
dephasing rates generically cut off the RG flow. In addition, we include all
other cutoff scales defined by temperature, energy excitations, frequency, and
voltage. We apply the formalism to transport through single molecular magnets,
realized by the fully anisotropic Kondo model (with three different exchange
couplings J_x, J_y, and J_z) in a magnetic field h_z. We calculate the
differential conductance as function of bias voltage V and discuss a quantum
phase transition which can be tuned by changing the sign of J_x J_y J_z via the
anisotropy parameters. Finally, we calculate the noise S(Omega) at finite
frequency Omega for the isotropic Kondo model and find that the dephasing rate
determines the height of the shoulders in dS(\Omega)/d Omega near Omega=V.
