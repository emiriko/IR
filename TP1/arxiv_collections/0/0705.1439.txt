We present a new, detailed analysis of late-time mid-infrared (IR)
observations of the Type II-P supernova (SN) 2003gd. At about 16 months after
the explosion, the mid-IR flux is consistent with emission from 4 x 10^(-5)
M(solar) of newly condensed dust in the ejecta. At 22 months emission from
point-like sources close to the SN position was detected at 8 microns and 24
microns. By 42 months the 24 micron flux had faded. Considerations of
luminosity and source size rule out the ejecta of SN 2003gd as the main origin
of the emission at 22 months. A possible alternative explanation for the
emission at this later epoch is an IR echo from pre-existing circumstellar or
interstellar dust. We conclude that, contrary to the claim of Sugerman et al.
(2006, Science, 313, 196), the mid-IR emission from SN 2003gd does not support
the presence of 0.02 M(solar) of newly formed dust in the ejecta. There is, as
yet, no direct evidence that core-collapse supernovae are major dust factories.
