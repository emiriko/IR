The inverse square law of gravity is poorly probed by experimental tests at
distances of ~ 10 AUs. Recent analysis of the trajectory of the Pioneer 10 and
11 spacecraft have shown an unmodeled acceleration directed toward the Sun
which was not explained by any obvious spacecraft systematics, and occurred
when at distances greater than 20 AUs from the Sun. If this acceleration
represents a departure from Newtonian gravity or is indicative of an additional
mass distribution in the outer solar system, it should be detectable in the
orbits of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs). To place limits on deviations from
Newtonian gravity, we have selected a well observed sample of TNOs found
orbiting between 20 and 100 AU from the Sun. By examining their orbits with
modified orbital fitting software, we place tight limits on the perturbations
of gravity that could exist in this region of the solar system.
