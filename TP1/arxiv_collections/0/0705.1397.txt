The work presented in this paper is related to the use of a haptic device in
an environment of robotic simulation. Such device introduces a new approach to
feel and to understand the boundaries of the workspace of mechanisms as well as
its kinetostatic properties. Indeed, these concepts are abstract and thus often
difficult to understand for the end-users. To catch his attention, we propose
to amplify the problems of the mechanisms in order to help him to take the good
decisions.
