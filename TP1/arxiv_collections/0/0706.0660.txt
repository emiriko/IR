The work contains the description of two narrow IR-bands observational data
of total lunar eclipse of March, 3, 2007, one- and two-dimensional procedures
of radiative transfer equation solution. The results of the procedure are the
extinction values for atmospheric aerosol and water vapor at different
altitudes in the troposphere along the Earth's terminator crossing North
America, Arctic, Siberia and South-Eastern Asia. The altitude range and
possible latitude and altitude resoltion of atmosphere remote sensing by the
lunar eclipses observation are fixed. The results of water vapor retrieval are
compared with data of space experiment, the scale of vertical water vapor
distribution is found.
