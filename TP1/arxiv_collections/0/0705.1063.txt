A simple stochastic formulation of the multiple scattering representation
solution of the classical linear incoherent trapping problem is presented for a
broad audience. A clear connection with the alternative Holstein's solution
ansatz is emphasized by the (re)interpretation of the fundamental mode as the
one associated with a relaxed nonchanging spatial distribution of excitation.
Expressions for overall relaxation parameters (ensemble emission yield and
lifetime) as well as time-resolved (decay and spatial distribution) and
steady-state quantities (spectra and spatial distribution) are given with the
fundamental mode contribution singled out. The multiple scattering
representation is advocated for final undergraduate and beginning graduate
physics instruction based on physical insight and computation feasibility. This
will be illustrated in the following instalment of this contribution.
