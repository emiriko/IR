The predicted thermal flash from SN shock breakout might have been detected
for the first time by Swift in GRB 060218/SN 2006aj. The detected thermal X-ray
emission in this event implies emergence of a trans-relativistic (TR) SN shock
with kinetic energy of E_k>1E49 erg. During TRSN shock breakout, the thermal
photons could be "accelerated" by the shock through repeated bulk Compton
scattering, forming a nonthermal gamma/X-ray component with dominant energy
over thermal one. This mechanism of "photon acceleration" at TRSN shock
breakout might also account for gamma-rays in the other similar low-luminosity
GRBs, implying that they are atypical GRBs with only TR outflows. TRSNe form a
peculiar type of SNe with large kinetic energy, >1E49 erg, in TR ejecta,
\Gamma\beta ~2.
