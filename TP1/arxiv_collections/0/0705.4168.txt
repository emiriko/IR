We present a Monte Carlo algorithm for selectively sampling radial
distribution functions and effective interaction potentials in asymmetric
liquid mixtures. We demonstrate its efficiency for hard-sphere mixtures, and
for model systems with more general interactions, and compare our simulations
with several analytical approximations. For interaction potentials containing a
hard-sphere contribution, the algorithm yields the contact value of the radial
distribution function.
