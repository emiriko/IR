Multiwavelength observations of SNR 1987A show that its morphology is rapidly
changing at X-ray, radio, and optical wavelengths as the blast wave from the
explosion expands into the circumstellar equatorial ring. Infrared emission
arises from the interaction of dust grains with the hot X-ray emitting gas. We
show that the IR emission provides important complementary information on the
interaction of the SN blast wave with the circumstellar equatorial ring that
cannot be obtained at any other wavelength.
