We propose that the CP violating phase in the CKM mixing matrix is identical
to the CP phases responsible for the spontaneous CP violation in the Higgs
potential. A specific multi-Higgs model with Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is
constructed to realize this idea. The CP violating phase does not vanish when
all Higgs masses become large. There are flavor changing neutral current (FCNC)
interactions mediated by neutral Higgs bosons at the tree level. However,
unlike general multi-Higgs models, the FCNC Yukawa couplings are fixed in terms
of the quark masses and CKM mixing angles. Implications for meson-anti-meson
mixing, including recent data on $D-\bar D$ mixing, and neutron electric dipole
moment (EDM) are studied. We find that the neutral Higgs boson masses can be at
the order of one hundred GeV. The neutron EDM can be close to the present
experimental upper bound.
