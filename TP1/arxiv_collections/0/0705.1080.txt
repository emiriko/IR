First we briefly review our covariant Hamiltonian approach to quasi-local
energy, noting that the Hamiltonian-boundary-term quasi-local energy
expressions depend on the chosen boundary conditions and reference
configuration. Then we present the quasi-local energy values resulting from the
formalism applied to homogeneous Bianchi cosmologies. Finally we consider the
quasi-local energies of the FRW cosmologies. Our results do not agree with
certain widely accepted quasi-local criteria.
