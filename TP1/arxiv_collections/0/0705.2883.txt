We show that epitaxial (001) thin films of multiferroic bismuth ferrite
BiFeO3 are monoclinic at room temperature instead of tetragonal or Rhombohedral
as reported earlier . We report a orthorhombic order-disorder beta-phase
between 820C and 950C contrary to the earlier report. The transition sequence
monoclinic-orthorhombic phase in (001)BiFeO3 thin film
(rhombohedral-orthorhombic transition in single crystal) resembles that of
BaTiO3 or PbSc1/2Ta1/2O3. The transition to the cubic $\gamma$-phase causes an
abrupt collapse of the bandgap toward zero (insulator-metal transition) at the
orthorhombic-cubic beta-gamma transition around 950C. This transition is
similar to the metal-insulator transition in Ba0.6K0.4BiO3.
