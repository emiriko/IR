We consider a non-spherical colloidal particle immersed in a fluid close to
its critical point. The temperature dependence of the corresponding order
parameter profile is calculated explicitly. We perform a systematic expansion
of the order parameter profile in powers of the local curvatures of the surface
of the colloidal particle. This curvature expansion reduces to the short
distance expansion of the order parameter profile in the case that the solvent
is at the critical composition.
