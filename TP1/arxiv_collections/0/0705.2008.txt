A review of CP violation from the Standard Model to strings is given which
includes a broad landscape of particle physics models, encompassing the
non-supersymmetric 4D extensions of the standard model, and models based on
supersymmetry, on extra dimensions, on strings and on branes. The
supersymmetric models discussed include complex mSUGRA and its extensions,
while the models based on extra dimensions include 5D models including models
based on warped geometry. CP violation beyond the standard model is central to
achieving the desired amount of baryon asymmetry in the universe via
baryogenesis and leptogenesis. They also affect a variety of particle physics
phenomena: electric dipole moments, $g-2$, relic density and detection rates
for neutralino dark matter in supersymmetric theories, Yukawa unification in
grand unified and string based models, and sparticle production cross sections,
and their decays patterns and signatures at hadron colliders. Additionally CP
violations can generate CP even-CP odd Higgs mixings, affect the neutral Higgs
spectrum and lead to phenomena detectable at colliders. Prominent among these
are the CP violation effects in decays of neutral and charged Higgs bosons.
Neutrino masses introduce new sources of CP violation which will be explored in
neutrino factories in the future. Such phases can also enter in proton
stability in unified models of particle interactions. The current experimental
status of CP violation is discussed and possibilities for the future outlined.
