Pressure induced long range antiferromagnetic order is discovered in Yb2Pd2Sn
by measuring the electrical resistivity under pressure up to 5.0 GPa. Magnetic
ordering is observed above about 1.0 GPa, being the lowest pressure in
Yb-intermetallics showing pressure induced magnetic ordering, Unexpectedly,
ordering disappears above about 4.0 GPa, giving rise to the first observation
of the appearance of two quantum critical points persisting in a broad range of
pressure within a single material.
