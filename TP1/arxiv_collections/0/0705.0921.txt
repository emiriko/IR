Phenomenologically viable and interesting regions of parameter space in the
minimal super-gravity (mSUGRA) model with small $m_0$ and small $m_{1/2}$
consistent with the WMAP data on dark matter relic density and the bound on the
mass of the lightest Higgs scalar $ m_h>$ 114 GeV from LEP2 open up if the
rather adhoc assumption $A_0$=0, where $A_0$ is the common trilinear soft
breaking parameter, employed in most of the existing analyses is relaxed. Since
this region corresponds to relatively light squarks and gluinos which are
likely to be probed extensively in the very early stages of the LHC
experiments, the consequences of moderate or large negative values of $A_0$ are
examined in detail. We find that in this region several processes including
lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) pair annihilation, LSP - lighter tau
slepton (${\tilde \tau}_1$) coannihilation and LSP - lighter top squark
(${\tilde t}_1$) coannihilation contribute to the observed dark matter relic
density. %\sout{The possibility that a relic density producing ${\tilde t}_1$
can be %observed at the current experiments at the Tevatron is wide open.} The
possibility that a ${\tilde t}_1$ that can participate in coannihilation with
the lightest neutralino to satisfy the WMAP bound on relic density and at the
same time be observed at the current experiments at the Tevatron is wide open.
At the LHC a large number of squark - gluino events lead to a very distinctive
semi-inclusive signature $\tau^\pm$+X$_\tau$ (anything without a tau lepton)
with a characteristic size much larger than $e^\pm$+X$_e$ or $\mu^\pm$+X$_\mu$
events.
