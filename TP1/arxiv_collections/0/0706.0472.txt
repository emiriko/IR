We report the measurement of Lamda and Anti-Lamda yields and inverse slope
parameters in d + Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV at forward and backward
rapidities (y = +- 2.75), using data from the STAR forward time projection
chambers. The contributions of different processes to baryon transport and
particle production are probed exploiting the inherent asymmetry of the d + Au
system. Comparisons to model calculations show that the baryon transport on the
deuteron side is consistent with multiple collisions of the deuteron nucleons
with gold participants. On the gold side HIJING based models do not describe
the measured particle yields while models with initial state nuclear effects
and/or hadronic rescattering do. The multichain model can provide a good
description of the net baryon density in d + Au collisions at energies
available at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, and the derived
parameters of the model agree with those from nuclear collisions at lower
energies.
