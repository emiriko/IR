A class of discrete renewal processes with super-exponentially decaying
inter-arrival distributions coincides with the infinite volume limit of general
homogeneous pinning models in their localized phase. Pinning models are
statistical mechanics systems to which a lot of attention has been devoted both
for their relevance for applications and because they are solvable models
exhibiting a non-trivial phase transition. The spatial decay of correlations in
these systems is directly mapped to the speed of convergence to equilibrium for
the associated renewal processes. We show that close to criticality, under
general assumptions, the correlation decay rate, or the renewal convergence
rate, coincides with the inter-arrival decay rate. We also show that, in
general, this is false away from criticality. Under a stronger assumption on
the inter-arrival distribution we establish a local limit theorem, capturing
thus the sharp asymptotic behavior of correlations.
