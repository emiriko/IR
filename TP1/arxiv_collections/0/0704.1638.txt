The concept of the scalar graviton as the source of the dark matter and dark
energy of the gravitaional origin is applied to study the evolution of the
isotropic homogeneous Universe. A realistic self-consistent solution to the
modified pure gravity equations, which correctly describes the accelerated
expansion of the spatially flat Universe, is found and investigated. It is
argued that the scenario with the scalar gravitons filling up the Universe may
emulate the LCDM model, reducing thus the true dark matter to an artefact.
