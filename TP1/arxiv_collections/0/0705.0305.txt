We explore the thermodynamic and global structural properties of a local
patch of an accretion disk whose parameters were chosen so that radiation
pressure and gas pressure would be comparable in magnitude. Heating, radiative
transport, and cooling are computed self-consistently with the structure by
solving the equations of radiation MHD in the shearing-box approximation. Using
a fully 3-d and energy-conserving code, we compute the structure and energy
balance of this disk segment over a span of more than forty cooling times. As
is also true when gas pressure dominates, the disk's upper atmosphere is
magnetically-supported. However, unlike the gas-dominated case, no steady-state
is reached; instead, the total (i.e., radiation plus gas) energy content
fluctuates by factors of 3--4 over timescales of several tens of orbits, with
no secular trend. Because the radiation pressure varies much more than the gas
pressure, the ratio of radiation pressure to gas pressure varies over the
approximate range 0.5--2. The volume-integrated dissipation rate generally
increases with increasing total energy, but the mean trend is somewhat slower
than linear, and the instantaneous dissipation rate is often a factor of two
larger or smaller than the mean for that total energy level. Locally, the
dissipation rate per unit volume scales approximately in proportion to the
current density; the time-average dissipation rate per unit mass is
proportional to m^{-1/2}, where m is the horizontally-averaged mass column
density to the nearer of the top or bottom surface. As in our earlier study of
a gas-dominated shearing-box, we find that energy transport is completely
dominated by radiative diffusion, with Poynting flux carrying less than 1% of
the energy lost from the box.
