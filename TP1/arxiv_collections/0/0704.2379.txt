In this article we obtain a fundamental measure functional for the model of
aligned hard hexagons in the plane. Our aim is not just to provide a functional
for a new, admittedly academic, model, but to investigate the structure of
fundamental measure theory. A model of aligned hard hexagons has similarities
with the hard disk model. Both share "lost cases", i.e. admit configurations of
three particles in which there is pairwise overlap but not triple overlap.
These configurations are known to be problematic for fundamental measure
functionals, which are not able to capture their contribution correctly. This
failure lies in the inability of these functionals to yield a correct low
density limit of the third order direct correlation function. Here we derive
the functional by projecting aligned hard cubes on the plane x+y+z=0. The
correct dimensional crossover behavior of these functionals permits us to
follow this strategy. The functional of aligned hard cubes, however, does not
have lost cases, so neither had the resulting functional for aligned hard
hexagons. The latter exhibits, in fact, a peculiar structure as compared to the
one for hard disks. It depends on a uniparametric family of weighted densities
through a new term not appearing in the functional for hard disks. Apart from
studying the freezing of this system, we discuss the implications of the
functional structure for new developments of fundamental measure theory.
