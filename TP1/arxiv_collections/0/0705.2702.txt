A Hydrogen atom immersed in a finite jellium sphere is solved using
variational quantum Monte Carlo (VQMC). The same system is also solved using
density functional theory (DFT), in both the local spin density (LSDA) and
self-interaction correction (SIC) approximations. The immersion energies
calculated using these methods, as functions of the background density of the
jellium, are found to lie within 1eV of each other with minima in approximately
the same positions. The DFT results show overbinding relative to the VQMC
result. The immersion energies also suggest an improved performance of the SIC
over the LSDA relative to the VQMC results. The atom-induced density is also
calculated and shows a difference between the methods, with a more extended
Friedel oscillation in the case of the VQMC result.
