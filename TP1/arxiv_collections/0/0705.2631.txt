We numerically investigate quantum diffusion of an electron in a model of
poly(dG)-poly(dC) and poly(dA)-poly(dT) DNA polymers with fluctuation of the
parameters due to the impact of colored noise. The randomness is introduced by
fluctuations of distance between two consecutive bases along the stacked base
pairs. We demonstrate that in the model the decay time of the correlation can
control the spread of the electronic wavepacket. Furthermore it is shown that
in a motional narrowing regime the averaging over fluctuation causes ballistic
propagation of the wavepacket, and in the adiabatic regime the electronic
states are affected by localization.
