Standard choices of quasi-circular orbit parameters for black-hole binary
evolutions result in eccentric inspiral. We introduce a conceptually simple
method, which is to integrate the post-Newtonian equations of motion through
hundreds of orbits, and read off the values of the momenta at the separation at
which we wish to start a fully general relativistic numerical evolution. For
the particular case of non-spinning equal-mass inspiral with an initial
coordinate separation of $D = 11M$ we show that this approach reduces the
eccentricity by at least a factor of five to $e < 0.002$ as compared to using
standard quasi-circular initial parameters.
