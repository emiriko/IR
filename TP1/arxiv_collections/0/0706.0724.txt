Hadronic resonances with short life times and strong coupling to the dense
medium may exhibit mass shifts and width broadening as signatures of chiral
symmetry restoration at the phase transition between hadronic and partonic
matter. Resonances with different lifetimes are also used to extract
information about the time evolution and temperature of the expanding hadronic
medium. In order to collect information about the early stage (at the phase
transition) of a heavy-ion collision, resonances and decay particles which are
unaffected by the hadronic medium have to be used. We explore a possible new
technique to extract signals from the early stage through the selection of
resonances from jets. A first attempt of this analysis, using the reconstructed
$\phi$(1020) from 200 GeV Au+Au collisions in STAR, is presented.
