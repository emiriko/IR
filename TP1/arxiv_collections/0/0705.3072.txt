Searches for planets in close binary systems explore the degree to which
stellar multiplicity inhibits or promotes planet formation. There is a
degeneracy between planet formation models when only systems with single stars
are studied--several mechanisms appear to be able to produce such a final
result. This degeneracy is lifted by searching for planets in binary systems;
the resulting detections (or evidence of non-existence) of planets in binaries
isolates which models may contribute to how planets form in nature. In this
chapter, we consider observational efforts to detect planetary companions to
binary stars in two types of hierarchical planet-binary configurations: first
``S-type'' planets which orbit just one of the stars, with the binary period
being much longer than the planet's; second, ``P-type'' or circumbinary
planets, where the planet simultaneously orbits both stars, and the planetary
orbital period is much longer than that of the binary. The S-type planet
finding techniques are different for binaries that can or cannot be spatially
resolved. For wider systems, techniques reviewed include dualstar
interferometric differential astrometry and precision radial velocities.
Alternatively, unresolved binaries can be studied using modified dualstar
"PHASES-style" differential astrometry or a modification of the radial velocity
technique for composite spectra. Should a fortunately aligned--but still long
period--binary be found, eclipse timing can also reveal the presence of S-type
planets. Methods for detecting P-type planets include the composite-spectra
variant of the radial velocity technique and eclipse timing.
