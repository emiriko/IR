A new class of cylindrically symmetric inhomogeneous string cosmological
models is investigated. To get the deterministic solution, it has been assumed
that the expansion ($\theta$) in the model is proportional to the eigen value
$\sigma^{1}_{1}$ of the shear tensor $\sigma^{i}_{j}$. The physical and
geometric aspects of the model are also discussed.
