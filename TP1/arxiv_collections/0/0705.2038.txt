While ferromagnetism at relatively high temperatures is seen in diluted
magnetic semiconductors such as Ga_(1-x)Mn_(x)As, doped semiconductors without
magnetic ions have not shown evidence for ferromagnetism. Using a generalized
disordered Hubbard model designed to characterize hydrogenic centers in
semiconductors, we find that such systems may also exhibit a ferromagnetic
ground state, at least on the nanoscale. This is found most clearly in a regime
inaccessible to bulk systems, but attainable in quantum dots as well as
heterostructures. We present numerical results demonstrating the occurrence of
high spin ground states in both lattice and positionally disordered systems. We
examine how the magnetic phases are affected by characteristics of real doped
semiconductors, such as positional disorder and electron-hole asymmetry.
