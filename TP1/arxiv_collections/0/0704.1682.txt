Owing to their distinct properties, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have emerged as
promising candidate for field emission devices. It has been found
experimentally that the results related to the field emission performance show
variability. The design of an efficient field emitting device requires the
analysis of the variabilities with a systematic and multiphysics based modeling
approach. In this paper, we develop a model of randomly oriented CNTs in a thin
film by coupling the field emission phenomena, the electron-phonon transport
and the mechanics of single isolated CNT. A computational scheme is developed
by which the states of CNTs are updated in time incremental manner. The device
current is calculated by using Fowler-Nordheim equation for field emission to
study the performance at the device scale.
