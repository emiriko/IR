We present a new technique for time-domain numerical evolution of the scalar
field generated by a pointlike scalar charge orbiting a black hole. Time-domain
evolution offers an efficient way for calculating black hole perturbations,
especially as input for computations of the local self force acting on orbiting
particles. In Kerr geometry, the field equations are not fully separable in the
time domain, and one has to tackle them in 2+1 dimensions (two spatial
dimensions and time; the azimuthal dependence is still separable). A technical
difficulty arises when the source of the field is a pointlike particle, as the
2+1-dimensional perturbation is then singular: Each of the azimuthal modes
diverges logarithmically at the particle. To deal with this problem we split
the numerical domain into two regions: Inside a thin worldtube surrounding the
particle's worldline we solve for a regularized variable, obtained from the
full field by subtracting out a suitable ``puncture'' function, given
analytically. Outside this worldtube we solve for the full, original field. The
value of the evolution variable is adjusted across the boundary of the
worldtube. In this work we demonstrate the applicability of this method in the
example of circular orbits around a Schwarzschild black hole (refraining from
exploiting the spherical symmetry of the background, and working in 2+1
dimensions).
