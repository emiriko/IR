We report on the detection of giant pulses from the Crab Nebula pulsar at a
frequency of 200 MHz using the field deployment system designed for the Mileura
Widefield Array's Low Frequency Demonstrator (MWA-LFD). Our observations are
among the first high-quality detections at such low frequencies. The measured
pulse shapes are deconvolved for interstellar pulse broadening, yielding a
pulse-broadening time of 670$\pm$100 $\mu$s, and the implied strength of
scattering (scattering measure) is the lowest that is estimated towards the
Crab nebula from observations made so far. The sensitivity of the system is
largely dictated by the sky background, and our simple equipment is capable of
detecting pulses that are brighter than $\sim$9 kJy in amplitude. The brightest
giant pulse detected in our data has a peak amplitude of $\sim$50 kJy, and the
implied brightness temperature is $10^{31.6}$ K. We discuss the giant pulse
detection prospects with the full MWA-LFD system. With a sensitivity over two
orders of magnitude larger than the prototype equipment, the full system will
be capable of detecting such bright giant pulses out to a wide range of
Galactic distances; from $\sim$8 to $\sim$30 kpc depending on the frequency.
The MWA-LFD will thus be a highly promising instrument for the studies of giant
pulses and other fast radio transients at low frequencies.
