The effects of unquenching on the perturbative improvement coefficients in
the Symanzik action are computed within the framework of L\"uscher-Weisz
on-shell improvement. We find that the effects of quark loops are surprisingly
large, and their omission may well explain the scaling violations observed in
some unquenched studies.
