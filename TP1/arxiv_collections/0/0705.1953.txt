In the large extra dimensional ADD scenario, Z bosons undergo a one-loop
decay into a photon and Kaluza-Klein towers of gravitons/gravi-scalars. We
calculate such a decay width, extending previous arguments about the general
form of the four-dimensional on-shell amplitude. The amplitudes calculated are
relevant to processes in other extra dimensional models where the Standard
Model fields are confined to a 4-brane.
