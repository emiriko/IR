The spectrum of meson and diquark excitations of dense quark matter is
considered in the framework of the Nambu -- Jona-Lasinio model with three types
of massless quarks in the presense of a quark number chemical potential $\mu$.
We investigate the effective action of meson- and diquark fields both at
sufficiently large values of $\mu>\mu_c\approx 330$ MeV, where the
color--flavor locked (CFL) phase is realized, and in the chirally broken phase
of quark matter ($\mu<\mu_c$). In the last case all nine pseudoscalar mesons
are Nambu -- Goldstone (NG) bosons, whereas the mass of the scalar meson nonet
is twice the dynamical quark mass. In the chirally broken phase the
pseudoscalar diquarks are not allowed to exist as stable particles, but the
scalar diquarks might be stable only at a rather strong interaction in the
diquark channel. In the case of the CFL phase, all NG bosons of the model are
realized as scalar and pseudoscalar diquarks. Moreover, it turns out that
massive diquark excitations are unstable for this phase. In particular, for the
scalar and pseudoscalar octets of diquark resonances a mass value around 230
MeV was found numerically. In contrast, mesons are stable particles in the CFL
phase. Their masses lie in the interval 400$\div$500 MeV for not too large
values of $\mu>\mu_c$.
