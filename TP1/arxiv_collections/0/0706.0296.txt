In this article, we study the vertices $D^*D^*P$, $D^*DV$ and DDV with the
light-cone QCD sum rules. The strong coupling constants g_{D^*D^*P}, g_{D^*DP},
f_{D^*DV}, f_{D^*D^*V}, g_{DDV} and g_{D^*D^*V} play an important role in
understanding the final-state interactions in the hadronic B decays. They
relate to the basic parameters g, $\lambda$ and $\beta$ in the heavy quark
effective Lagrangian respectively. Our numerical values of the g, $\beta$ and
$\lambda$ are much smaller than most of the existing estimations. If the
predictions from the light-cone QCD sum rules are robust, the final-state
interaction effects maybe overestimated in the hadronic B decays.
