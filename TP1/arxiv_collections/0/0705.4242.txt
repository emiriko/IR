This paper considers a "striking outwards" reed coupled to a resonator. This
expression, due to Helmholtz, is not discussed here : it corresponds to the
most common model of a lip-type valve, when the valve is assumed to be a one
degree of freedom oscillator. The presented work is an extension of the works
done by Wilson and Beavers (1974), Tarnopolsky (2000). The range of the playing
frequencies is investigated. The first results are analytical : when no losses
are present in the resonator, it is proven that the ratio between the threshold
frequency and the reed resonance frequency is found to be necessarily within
the interval between unity and the square root of 3. This is a musical sixth.
Actually the interval is largely smaller, and this is in accordance with e.g.
the results by Cullen et al.. The smallest blowing pressure is found to be
directly related to the quality factor of the reed. Numerical results confirm
these statements, and are discussed in comparison with previous ones by Cullen
et al (2000).
