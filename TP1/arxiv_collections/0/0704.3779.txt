We sketch the derivation of a Newtonian gravity-like force emerging from a
direct-action variant of classical electromagnetism. The binding energy is a
consequence of maximal phase correlation of the sources mediated by
approximately monochromatic direct-action fields. The resulting force then has
the character of a strong version of the van der Waals force, whose superior
strength can be attributed to relatively coherent primary fields (compared with
the totally incoherent effects of the ZPF). The model also predicts the
existence of a background having some of the character of dark energy.
