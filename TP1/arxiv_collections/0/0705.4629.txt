We report the first measurement of the opening angle distribution between
pairs of jets produced in high-energy collisions of transversely polarized
protons. The measurement probes (Sivers) correlations between the transverse
spin orientation of a proton and the transverse momentum directions of its
partons. With both beams polarized, the wide pseudorapidity ($-1 \leq \eta \leq
+2$) coverage for jets permits separation of Sivers functions for the valence
and sea regions. The resulting asymmetries are all consistent with zero and
considerably smaller than Sivers effects observed in semi-inclusive deep
inelastic scattering (SIDIS). We discuss theoretical attempts to reconcile the
new results with the sizable transverse spin effects seen in SIDIS and forward
hadron production in pp collisions.
