A large fraction of SN1987A electron antineutrino events has been recorded in
the first second. We study how this observation fits into the conventional
paradigm for neutrino emission, and show that there is a 3.2 sigma hint for an
initial accretion phase. This phase involves a large fraction of the energy
emitted in neutrinos and antineutrinos, about 20 % or larger. The occurrence of
neutrino oscillations strengthens these inferences. We discuss why three flavor
oscillations with normal mass hierarchy are completely acceptable, whereas
oscillations with inverted mass hierarchy require more troublesome
interpretations, if theta(13) is above 0.5-1 degrees.
