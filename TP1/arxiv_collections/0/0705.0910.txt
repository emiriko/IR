In this paper we present the guidelines for an extrasolar planet taxonomy.
The discovery of an increasing number of extrasolar planets showing a vast
variety of planetary parameters, like Keplerian orbital elements and
environmental parameters, like stellar masses, spectral types, metallicity
etc., prompts the development of a planetary taxonomy. In this work via
principal component analysis followed by hierarchical clustering analysis, we
report the definition of five robust groups of planets. We also discuss the
physical relevance of such analysis, which may provide a valid basis for
disentangling the role of the several physical parameters involved in the
processes of planet formation and subsequent evolution. For instance, we were
able to divide the hot Jupiters into two main groups on the basis of their
stellar masses and metallicities. Moreover, for some groups, we find strong
correlations between metallicity, semi-major axis and eccentricity. The
implications of these findings are discussed.
