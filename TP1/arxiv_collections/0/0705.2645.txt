We investigate graphene and graphene layers on different substrates by
monochromatic and white-light confocal Rayleigh scattering microscopy. The
image contrast depends sensitively on the dielectric properties of the sample
as well as the substrate geometry and can be described quantitatively using the
complex refractive index of bulk graphite. For few layers (<6) the
monochromatic contrast increases linearly with thickness: the samples behave as
a superposition of single sheets which act as independent two dimensional
electron gases. Thus, Rayleigh imaging is a general, simple and quick tool to
identify graphene layers, that is readily combined with Raman scattering, which
provides structural identification.
