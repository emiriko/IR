We study the exotic hadrons in s-wave scattering of the Nambu-Goldstone boson
with a target hadron based on chiral dynamics. Utilizing the low energy theorem
of chiral symmetry, we show that the s-wave interaction is not strong enough to
generate bound states in exotic channels in flavor SU(3) symmetric limit,
although the interaction is responsible for generating some nonexotic hadron
resonances dynamically. We discuss the renormalization condition adopted in
this analysis.
