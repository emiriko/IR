This paper is devoted to discuss the energy-momentum for static axially
symmetric spacetimes in the framework of teleparallel theory of gravity. For
this purpose, we use the teleparallel versions of Einstein, Landau-Lifshitz,
Bergmann and M$\ddot{o}$ller prescriptions. A comparison of the results shows
that the energy density is different but the momentum turns out to be constant
in each prescription. This is exactly similar to the results available in
literature using the framework of General Relativity. It is mentioned here that
M$\ddot{o}$ller energy-momentum distribution is independent of the coupling
constant $\lambda$. Finally, we calculate energy-momentum distribution for the
Curzon metric, a special case of the above mentioned spacetime.
