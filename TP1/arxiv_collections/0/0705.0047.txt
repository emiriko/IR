We show that the quantum interference between downconverted photon pairs and
photons from coherent laser light can produce a maximally path entangled
N-photon output component with a fidelity greater than 90% for arbitrarily high
photon numbers. A simple beam splitter operation can thus transform the
2-photon coherence of down-converted light into an almost optimal N-photon
coherence.
