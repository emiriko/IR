We are revisiting the efficiency problem of DKR nonradiative transitions at
local electronic centers in polarizable solids. Following a brief survey, we
formulate the general rate equations thereby defining the microscopic
parameters controlling the nonradiative deexcitation. We also reproduce the
quantum mechanical expressions for the energy conserving "horizontal transfer
rates" to compare with the "verical transition rates" at various vibronic
energy levels.
