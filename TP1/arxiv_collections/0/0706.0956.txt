Some of the centrality experiments indicate regime change and saturation in
the behavior of characteristics of the secondary particles. It is observed as a
critical phenomenon for hadron-nuclear, nuclear-nuclear interactions and
ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. The existing simple models do not
explain the effect. We believe that the responsible mechanism to explain the
phenomena could be the percolation cluster formation and expect appearance of
deconfinement in the cluster.
