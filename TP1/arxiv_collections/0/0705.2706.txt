There are many processes in biology in which mechanical forces are generated.
Force-bearing networks can transduce locally developed mechanical signals very
extensively over different parts of the cell or tissues. In this article we
conduct an overview of this kind of mechanical transduction, focusing in
particular on the multiple layers of complexity displayed by the mechanisms
that control and trigger the conversion of a mechanical signal into a
biochemical function. Single molecule methodologies, through their capability
to introduce the force in studies of biological processes in which mechanical
stresses are developed, are unveiling subtle intertwining mechanisms between
chemistry and mechanics and in particular are revealing how chemistry can
control mechanics. The possibility that chemistry interplays with mechanics
should be always considered in biochemical studies.
