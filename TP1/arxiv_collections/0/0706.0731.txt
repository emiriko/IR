We explore the relation between classical and quantum states in both open and
closed (super)strings discussing the relevance of coherent states as a
semiclassical approximation. For the closed string sector a gauge-fixing of the
residual world-sheet rigid translation symmetry of the light-cone gauge is
needed for the construction to be possible. The circular target-space loop
example is worked out explicitly.
