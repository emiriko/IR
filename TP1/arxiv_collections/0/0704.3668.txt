We investigate the Dbar-N interaction at low energies using a meson-exchange
model supplemented with a short-distance contribution from one-gluon-exchange.
The model is developed in close analogy to the meson-exchange KN interaction of
the Juelich group utilizing SU(4) symmetry constraints. The main ingredients of
the interaction are provided by vector meson (rho, omega) exchange and
higher-order box diagrams involving D*N, D\Delta, and D*\Delta intermediate
states. The short range part is assumed to receive additional contributions
from genuine quark-gluon processes. The predicted cross sections for Dbar-N for
excess energies up to 150 MeV are of the same order of magnitude as those for
KN but with average values of around 20 mb, roughly a factor two larger than
for the latter system. It is found that the omega-exchange plays a very
important role. Its interference pattern with the rho-exchange, which is
basically fixed by the assumed SU(4) symmetry, clearly determines the
qualitative features of the Dbar-N interaction -- very similiar to what happens
also for the KN system.
