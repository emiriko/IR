The existence and stability under linear perturbation of closed timelike
curves in the spacetime associated to Schwarzschild black hole pierced by a
spinning string are studied. Due to the superposition of the black hole, we
find that the spinning string spacetime is deformed in such a way to allow the
existence of closed timelike geodesics.
