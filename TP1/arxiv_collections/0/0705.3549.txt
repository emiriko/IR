In this paper we suggest a configuration of photons consistent with a spin
$\hbar$, and a configuration of the fermions coherent with a spin $\hbar/2$.
These suggested configurations open the way to further analyses which lead to
the following conclusions:
  - There cannot exist elementary particles of spin $\hbar/2$ with a mass
inferior to $1m_e$ or with a radius greater than $1l_e$.
  - The electrostatic force derives from the centrifugal forces inherent to the
spin and are propagated by photons.
  - The derivation of the electrostatic force explains the existence of
positive and negative charges and Coulomb's law.
  - The enormous differences between the centrifugal forces and the centripetal
forces at the surface of the protons give rise to quantic fluctuations of space
which generate the energy flows necessary for equilibrium. These energy flows
can explain gravitation and the strong force.
  - The mass of the proton, $m_p$, and the mass of the neutron, $m_n$, must
each have a concrete value required for the cohesion of the atomic nuclei. The
suggested hypoteses show that the relation $m_n/m_p$ must be very slightly
greater than 1.00, and that, by a first approximation, both $m_n$ and $m_p$
must be slightly less than 1851 $m_e$.
  - There are no "gravitons" and no "gluons"; the "messenger particles" are
always the very real photons.
