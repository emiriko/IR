We present deep emission-line imaging taken with the SOAR Optical Imaging
Camera of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in the nearby (z=0.035) X-ray
cluster 2A0335+096. We analyze long-slit optical spectroscopy, archival VLA,
Chandra X-ray, and XMM UV data. 2A0335+096 is a bright, cool-core X-ray
cluster, once known as a cooling flow. Within the highly disturbed core
revealed by Chandra X-ray observations, 2A0335+096 hosts a highly structured
optical emission-line system. The redshift of the companion is within 100 km/s
of the BCG and has certainly interacted with the BCG, and is likely bound to
it. The comparison of optical and radio images shows curved filaments in
H-alpha emission surrounding the resolved radio source. The velocity structure
of the emission-line bar between the BCG nucleus and the companion galaxy
provides strong evidence for an interaction between the two in the last ~50
Myrs. The age of the radio source is similar to the interaction time, so this
interaction may have provoked an episode of radio activity. We estimate a star
formation rate of >7 solar mass/yr based on the Halpha and archival UV data, a
rate similar to, but somewhat lower than, the revised X-ray cooling rate of
10-30 solar masses/year estimated from XMM spectra by Peterson & workers. The
Halpha nebula is limited to a region of high X-ray surface brightness and cool
X-ray temperature. The detailed structures of H-alpha and X-ray gas differ. The
peak of the X-ray emission is not the peak of H-alpha emission, nor does it lie
in the BCG. The estimated age of the radio lobes and their interaction with the
optical emission-line gas, the estimated timescale for depletion and
accumulation of cold gas, and the dynamical time in the system are all similar,
suggesting a common trigger mechanism.
