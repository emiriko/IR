It is shown that the massless energy spectrum of electrons and holes in
graphene leads to the strongly non-linear electromagnetic response of this
system. We predict that the graphene layer, irradiated by electromagnetic
waves, emits radiation at higher frequency harmonics and can work as a
frequency multiplier. The operating frequency of the graphene frequency
multiplier can lie in a broad range from microwaves to the infrared.
