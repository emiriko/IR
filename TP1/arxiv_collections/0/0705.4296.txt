In mesoscopic systems conductance fluctuations are a sensitive probe of
electron dynamics and chaotic phenomena. We show that the conductance of a
purely classical chaotic system with either fully chaotic or mixed phase space
generically exhibits fractal conductance fluctuations unrelated to quantum
interference. This might explain the unexpected dependence of the fractal
dimension of the conductance curves on the (quantum) phase breaking length
observed in experiments on semiconductor quantum dots.
