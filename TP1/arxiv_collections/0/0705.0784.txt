We show theoretically that it is possible to trap and cool the rotational
motion of a macroscopic mirror made of a perfectly reflecting spiral phase
element using orbital angular momentum transfer from a Laguerre-Gaussian
optical field. This technique offers a promising route to the placement of the
rotor in its quantum mechanical ground state in the presence of thermal noise.
It also opens up the possibility of simultaneously cooling a vibrational mode
of the same mirror. Lastly, the proposed design may serve as a sensitive
torsional balance in the quantum regime.
