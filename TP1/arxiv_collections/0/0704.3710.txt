The memory effects on microscopic kinetic systems have been sometimes
modelled by means of the introduction of second order time derivatives in the
macroscopic hydrodynamic equations. One prototypical example is the hyperbolic
modification of the Burgers equation, that has been introduced to clarify the
interplay of hyperbolicity and nonlinear hydrodynamic evolution. Previous
studies suggested the finite time blow-up of this equation, and here we present
a rigorous proof of this fact.
