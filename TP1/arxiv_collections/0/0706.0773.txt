Embedded Si and Ge nanocrystals (NCs) in wide band-gap matrices are studied
theoretically using an atomistic pseudopotential approach. From small clusters
to large NCs containing on the order of several thousand atoms are considered.
Effective band-gap values as a function of NC diameter reproduce very well the
available experimental and theoretical data. It is observed that the highest
occupied molecular orbital for both Si and Ge NCs and the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital for Si NCs display oscillations with respect to size among
the different irreducible representations of the $C_{3v}$ point group to which
these spherical NCs belong. Based on this electronic structure, first the
interband absorption is thoroughly studied which shows the importance of
surface polarization effects that significantly reduce the absorption when
included. This reduction is found to increase with decreasing NC size or with
increasing permittivity mismatch between the NC core and the host matrix.
Reasonable agreement is observed with the experimental absorption spectra where
available. The deformation of spherical NCs into prolate or oblate ellipsoids
are seen to introduce no pronounced effects for the absorption spectra. Next,
intraconduction and intravalence band absorption coefficients are obtained in
the wavelength range from far-infrared to visible region. These results can be
valuable for the infrared photodetection prospects of these NC arrays. Finally,
excited-state absorption at three different optical pump wavelengths, 532 nm,
355 nm and 266 nm are studied for 3- and 4 nm-diameter NCs. This reveals strong
absorption windows in the case of holes and a broad spectrum in the case of
electrons which can especially be relevant for the discussions on achieving
gain in these structures.
