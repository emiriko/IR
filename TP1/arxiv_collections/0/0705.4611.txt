During 2006 November an outburst of the dwarf nova AW Sge was observed using
CCD photometry. This revealed 0.25 magnitude superhumps confirming it to be a
superoutburst, possibly only the second confirmed such outburst of this star.
The superhumps were observed for 4 days and had a stable period Psh =
0.0745(2)d, a value which is consistent with Psh measured during the 2000
superoutburst.
