Four families of special functions, depending on n variables, are studied. We
call them symmetric and antisymmetric multivariate sine and cosine functions.
They are given as determinants or antideterminants of matrices, whose matrix
elements are sine or cosine functions of one variable each. These functions are
eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator, satisfying specific conditions at the
boundary of a certain domain F of the n-dimensional Euclidean space. Discrete
and continuous orthogonality on F of the functions within each family, allows
one to introduce symmetrized and antisymmetrized multivariate Fourier-like
transforms, involving the symmetric and antisymmetric multivariate sine and
cosine functions.
