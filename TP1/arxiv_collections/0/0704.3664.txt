We discuss the extrema of the Two Higgs Doublet Model with different physical
properties. We have found necessary and sufficient conditions for realization
of the extrema with different properties as the vacuum state of the model. We
found explicit equations for extremum energies via parameters of potential if
it has explicitly CP conserving form. These equations allow to pick out
extremum with lower energy -- vacuum state and to look for change of extrema
(phase transitions) with the variation of parameters of potential. Our goal is
to find general picture here to apply it for description of early Universe.
