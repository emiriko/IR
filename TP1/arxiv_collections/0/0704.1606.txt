Observations of stellar activity cycles provide an opportunity to study
magnetic dynamos under many different physical conditions. Space-based
asteroseismology missions will soon yield useful constraints on the interior
conditions that nurture such magnetic cycles, and will be sensitive enough to
detect shifts in the oscillation frequencies due to the magnetic variations. We
derive a method for predicting these shifts from changes in the Mg II activity
index by scaling from solar data. We demonstrate this technique on the
solar-type subgiant beta Hyi, using archival International Ultraviolet Explorer
spectra and two epochs of ground-based asteroseismic observations. We find
qualitative evidence of the expected frequency shifts and predict the optimal
timing for future asteroseismic observations of this star.
