A generalized zero-range process with a limited number of long-range
interactions is studied as an example of a transport process in which particles
at a T-junction make a choice of which branch to take based on traffic levels
on each branch. The system is analysed with a self-consistent mean-field
approximation which allows phase diagrams to be constructed. Agreement between
the analysis and simulations is found to be very good.
