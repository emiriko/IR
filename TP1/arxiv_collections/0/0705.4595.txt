We demonstrate an unconditional high-fidelity teleporter capable of
preserving the broadband entanglement in an optical squeezed state. In
particular, we teleport a squeezed state of light and observe $-0.8 \pm 0.2$dB
of squeezing in the teleported (output) state. We show that the squeezing
criterion translates directly into a sufficient criterion for entanglement of
the upper and lower sidebands of the optical field. Thus, this result
demonstrates the first unconditional teleportation of broadband entanglement.
Our teleporter achieves sufficiently high fidelity to allow the teleportation
to be cascaded, enabling, in principle, the construction of deterministic
non-Gaussian operations.
