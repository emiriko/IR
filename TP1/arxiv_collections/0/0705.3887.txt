We consider Higgs boson production by gluon fusion in hadron collisions. We
study the doubly-differential transverse-momentum (q_T) and rapidity (y)
distribution of the Higgs boson in perturbative QCD. In the region of small q_T
(q_T << M_H, M_H being the mass of the Higgs boson), we include the effect of
logarithmically-enhanced contributions due to multiparton radiation to all
perturbative orders. We use the impact parameter and double Mellin moments to
implement and factorize the multiparton kinematics constraint of transverse-
and longitudinal-momentum conservation. The logarithmic terms are then
systematically resummed in exponential form. At small q_T, we perform the
all-order resummation of large logarithms up to next-to-next-to-leading
logarithmic accuracy, while at large q_T (q_T ~ M_H), we apply a matching
procedure that recovers the fixed-order perturbation theory up to
next-to-leading order. We present quantitative results for the differential
cross section in q_T and y at the LHC, and we comment on the comparison with
the q_T cross section integrated over y.
