We consider a supersymmetric model in which gaugino masses are generated by
the anomaly-mediation mechanism while scalar masses are from tree-level
supergravity interaction. In such a model, scalar fermions as well as Higgsinos
become as heavy as O(10-100TeV) and hence only the gauginos are superparticles
kinematically accessible to the LHC. We study how and how well the properties
of gauginos can be studied. We also discuss the strategy to test the
anomaly-mediation model at the LHC.
