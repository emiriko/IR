Coincidence-structures in the transverse plane of Type-II spontaneous
parametric down-conversion carrying orbital angular momentum are obtained.
Azimuthal symmetry breaking around the pump beam direction reveals itself on
these quantum images. Analytical expressions for the amplitude probability of
the down conversion process are shown including the nonlinear polarizability
components.
