We study the effect of the kick velocity -- neutron star spin alignment
observed in young radio pulsars on the coalescence rate of binary neutron
stars. The effect is shown to be especially strong for large kick amplitudes
and tight alignments, reducing the galactic rate of binary neutron star
coalescences up to an order of magnitude with respect to the rates calculated
for random kicks. The spin-kick correlation also leads to much narrower NS
spin-orbit misalignments compared to random kicks.
