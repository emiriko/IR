Pores are one of the various features forming in the photosphere by the
emergence of magnetic field onto the solar surface. They lie at the border
between tiny magnetic elements and larger sunspots. Light bridges, in such
structures, are bright features separating umbral areas in two or more
irregular regions. Commonly, light bridges indicate that a the merging of
magnetic regions or, conversely, the breakup of the area is underway. We
investigate the velocity structure of a solar pore (AR10812) with light bridge,
and of the quiet solar photosphere nearby, analyzing high spatial and spectral
resolution images. The pore area has been observed with the Interferometric
BI-dimensional Spectrometer (IBIS) at the Dunn Solar Telescope, acquiring
monochromatic images in the Ca II 854.2 nm line and in the Fe I 709.0 nm line
as well as G-band and broad-band images. We also computed the Line of Sight
(LoS) velocity field associated to the Fe I and Fe II photospheric lines. The
amplitude of the LoS velocity fluctuations, inside the pore, is smaller than
that observed in the quiet granulation near the active region. We computed the
azimuthal average LoS velocity and derived its radial profile. The whole pore
is characterized by a downward velocity -200 m/s and by an annular downflow
structure with an average velocity of -350 m/s with respect to the nearby quiet
sun. The light bridge inside the pore, when observed in the broad-band channel
of IBIS and in the red wing of Ca II 854.2 nm line, shows an elongated dark
structure running along its axis, that we explain with a semi-analytical model.
In the highest resolution LoS velocity images the light bridge shows a profile
consistent with a convective roll: a weak upflow, 50-100m/s, in correspondence
of the dark lane, flanked by a downflow, -(200-300) m/s.
