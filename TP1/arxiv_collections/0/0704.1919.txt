Transiting extrasolar planets are now discovered jointly by photometric
surveys and by radial velocimetry. We want to determine whether the different
data sets are compatible between themselves and with models of the evolution of
extrasolar planets. We simulate directly a population of stars corresponding to
the OGLE transit survey and assign them planetary companions based on radial
velocimetry discoveries. We use a model of the evolution and structure of giant
planets assuming a variable fraction of heavy elements. The output list of
detectable planets of the simulations is compared to the real detections. We
confirm that the radial velocimetry and photometric survey data sets are
compatible within the statistical errors, assuming that planets with periods
between 1 and 2 days are approximately 5 times less frequent than planets with
periods between 2 and 5 days. We show that evolution models fitting present
observational constraints predict a lack of small giant planets with large
masses. We also identify distinct populations of planets: those with short
periods (P < 10d) are only found in orbit around metal-rich stars with [Fe/H] >
-0.07. We further confirm the relative absence of low-mass giant planets at
small orbital distances.
