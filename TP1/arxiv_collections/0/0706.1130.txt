Mobile entities with wireless links are able to form a mobile ad-hoc network.
Such an infrastructureless network does not have to be administrated. However,
self-organizing principles have to be applied to deal with upcoming problems,
e.g. information dissemination. These kinds of problems are not easy to tackle,
requiring complex algorithms. Moreover, the usefulness of pure ad-hoc networks
is arguably limited. Hence, enthusiasm for mobile ad-hoc networks, which could
eliminate the need for any fixed infrastructure, has been damped. The goal is
to overcome the limitations of pure ad-hoc networks by augmenting them with
instant Internet access, e.g. via integration of UMTS respectively GSM links.
However, this raises multiple questions at the technical as well as the
organizational level. Motivated by characteristics of small-world networks that
describe an efficient network even without central or organized design, this
paper proposes to combine mobile ad-hoc networks and infrastructured networks
to form hybrid wireless networks. One main objective is to investigate how this
approach can reduce the costs of a permanent backbone link and providing in the
same way the benefits of useful information from Internet connectivity or
service providers. For the purpose of bridging between the different types of
networks, an adequate middleware service is the focus of our investigation.
This paper shows our first steps forward to this middleware by introducing the
Injection Communication paradigm as principal concept.
