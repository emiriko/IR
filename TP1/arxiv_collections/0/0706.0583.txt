Band discontinuities at the InN-GaN heterointerface are experimentally
determined from internal photoemission spectroscopy measurements on n+ InN on
GaN epilayers. The photocurrent shows two threshold energies, one at 1.624 eV
and the other at 2.527 eV. From these we obtain the valence band offset 0.85 eV
and the conduction band offset 1.82 eV.
