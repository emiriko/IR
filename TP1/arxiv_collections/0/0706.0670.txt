Model independent, $m_1$, adiabatic, $m_{-1}$, and high-energy, $m_3$, energy
weighted sums for the isoscalar and isovector nuclear excitations are
investigated within the framework of the kinetic theory adopted to the
description of a two-component nuclear Fermi-liquid. For both the adiabatic and
scaling approaches, the connection of the EWS $m_{-1}$ and $m_3$ to the nuclear
stiffness coefficients and the first- and zero-sound velocity is established.
We study the enhancement factor $\kappa_{I}$ in the energy weighted sum $m'_1$
for the isovector excitations and provide the reasonable explanation of the
experimental exceeding of the 100% exhaustion of sum $m'_1$ for the isovector
giant dipole resonances. We show the dependence of the enhancement factor
$\kappa_{I}$ on the nuclear mass number $A$ and analyse its dependence on the
Landau's isovector amplitude $F'_1$.
