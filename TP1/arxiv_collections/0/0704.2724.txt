We explore the possibility of performing nuclear structure studies using low
energy neutrino beams. In particular, low energy beta-beams and conventional
sources (muon decay-at-rest) are considered. We present results on the total
charged-current as well as flux-averaged cross sections associated to electron
(anti)-neutrino scattering on oxygen, iron, molybdenum and lead, as typical
examples. It is shown that by using neutrinos from low energy beta-beams,
information on forbidden states, in particular the spin-dipole, could be
extracted.
