Engineering software systems is a multidisciplinary activity, whereby a
number of artifacts must be created - and maintained - synchronously. In this
paper we investigate whether production code and the accompanying tests
co-evolve by exploring a project's versioning system, code coverage reports and
size-metrics. Three open source case studies teach us that testing activities
usually start later on during the lifetime and are more "phased", although we
did not observe increasing testing activity before releases. Furthermore, we
note large differences in the levels of test coverage given the proportion of
test code.
