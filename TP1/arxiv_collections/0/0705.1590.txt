Thermal leptogenesis, in the seesaw model, is a popular mechanism for
generating the Baryon Asymmetry of the Universe. It was noticed recently, that
including lepton flavour can modify significantly the results. These
proceedings aim to discuss why and when flavour matters, in the thermal
leptogenesis scenario for hierarchical right-handed neutrinos. No Boltzmann
Equations are introduced.
