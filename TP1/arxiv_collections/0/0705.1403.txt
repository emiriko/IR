We investigate the state space of bipartite qutrits. We construct an analog
to the "magic" tetrahedron for bipartite qubits--a magic simplex W. It is
formed by all convex combination of nine Bell states which are constructed
using the Weyl operators. Due to the high symmetry it is enough to consider
certain typical slices through W. Via optimal entanglement witnesses we find
regions of bound entangled states inside W.
