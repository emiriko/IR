We have developed an image restoration technique based on the Richardson-Lucy
algorithm optimized for GLAST-LAT image analysis. Our algorithm is original
since it utilizes the PSF (point spread function) that is calculated for each
event. This is critical for EGRET and GLAST-LAT image analysis since the PSF
depends on the energy and angle of incident gamma-rays and varies by more than
one order of magnitude. EGRET and GLAST-LAT image analysis also faces Poisson
noise due to low photon statistics. Our technique incorporates wavelet
filtering to minimize noise effects. We present studies of EGRET sources using
this novel image restoration technique for possible identification of extended
gamma-ray sources.
