We present the performances and the strain sensitivity of the first spherical
gravitational wave detector equipped with a capacitive transducer and read out
by a low noise two-stage SQUID amplifier and operated at a temperature of 5 K.
We characterized the detector performance in terms of thermal and electrical
noise in the system output sygnal. We measured a peak strain sensitivity of
$1.5\cdot 10^{-20} Hz^{-1/2}$ at 2942.9 Hz. A strain sensitivity of better than
$5\cdot 10{-20}Hz{-1/2}$ has been obtained over a bandwidth of 30 Hz. We expect
an improvement of more than one order of magnitude when the detector will
operate at 50 mK. Our results represent the first step towards the development
of an ultracryogenic omnidirectional detector sensitive to gravitational
radiation in the 3kHz range.
