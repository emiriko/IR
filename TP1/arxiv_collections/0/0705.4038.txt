A polarized photon with well-defined orbital angular momentum that emerges
from a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) is shown to circumvent wave-particle
duality. Its polarization-resolved detection probability forms a non-sinusoidal
interferometric pattern. For certain phase differences between the MZI arms,
this pattern yields both reliable which-path information and high
phase-sensitivity.
