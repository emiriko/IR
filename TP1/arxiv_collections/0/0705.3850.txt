Niels Bohr introduced the concept of complementarity in order to give a
general account of quantum mechanics, however he stressed that the idea of
complementarity is related to the general dificulty in the formation of human
ideas, inherent in the distinction between subject and object. Earlier, we have
introduced a development of the concept of complementarity which constitutes a
new approach to the interpretation of quantum mechanics. We argue that this
development allows a better understanding of some of the paradigmatic
interpretational problems of quantum theory.
  Within the scheme proposed by modal interpretations we analyze the relation
between holism and reductionism as well as the problems proposed by Arntzenius
and Clifton. We discuss the problem of presupposing the concept of entity
within the quantum formalism and bring into stage the concept of faculty as a
way to recover the objective character of quantum mechanics.
