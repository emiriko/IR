The STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at
Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) is carrying out a spin physics program
colliding transverse or longitudinal polarized proton beams at
$\sqrt{s}=200-500 $GeV to gain a deeper insight into the spin structure and
dynamics of the proton. These studies provide fundamental tests of Quantum
Chromodynamics (QCD).
  One of the main objectives of the STAR spin physics program is the
determination of the polarized gluon distribution function through a
measurement of the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry, $A_{LL}$, for various
processes. Recent results will be shown on the measurement of $A_{LL}$ for
inclusive jet production, neutral pion production and charged pion production
at $\sqrt{s}=200 $GeV. In addition to these measurements involving longitudinal
polarized proton beams, the STAR collaboration has performed several important
measurements employing transverse polarized proton beams. New results on the
measurement of the transverse single-spin asymmetry, $A_{N}$, for forward
neutral pion production and the first measurement of $A_{N}$ for mid-rapidity
di-jet production will be discussed.
