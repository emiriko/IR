We apply the Average Spectrum Method to the problem of getting the excitation
spectrum from imaginary-time quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We show that with
high quality QMC data this method reproduces the dominant spectral features
very well. It is also capable of giving information on the spectrum in regions
dominated by the many-particle continuum of excitations.
