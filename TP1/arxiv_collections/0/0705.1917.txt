We investigate the usefulness of different classes of genuine quadripartite
entangled states as quantum resources for teleportation and superdense coding.
We examine the possibility of teleporting unknown one, two and three qubit
states. We show that one can use the teleportation protocol to send any general
one and two qubit states. A restricted class of three qubit states can also be
faithfully teleported. We also explore superdense coding protocol in
single-receiver and multi-receiver scenarios. We show that there exist genuine
quadripartite entangled states that can be used to transmit four cbits by
sending two qubits. We also discuss some interesting features of multi-receiver
scenario under LOCC paradigm.
