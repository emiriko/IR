Author offers and researched the new and revolutionary inflatable
electrostatic AB space towers (mast, new space elevator) up to one hundred
twenty thousands kilometers (or more) in height. The main innovation is filling
the tower by electron gas, which can create pressure up one atmosphere, has
negligible small weight and surprising properties.
  The suggested mast has following advantages in comparison with conventional
space elevator: 1. Electrostatic AB tower may be built from Earth surface
without the employment of any rockets. That decreases the cost of electrostatic
mast by thousands of times. 2. One can have any height and has a big control
load capacity. 3. Electrostatic tower can have the height of a geosynchronous
orbit (36,000 km) WITHOUT the additional top cable as the space elevator (up
120,000 - 160,000 km) and counterweight (equalizer) of hundreds of tons. 4. The
offered mast has less total mass than conventional space elevator. 5. The
offered tower can have the high-speed electrostatic climbers moved by
high-voltage electricity from Earth's surface. 6. The electrostatic mast can
bend in any needed direction when we give the necessary electric voltage in the
required parts of the extended mast. 7. Control mast has stability for any
altitude. Three projects 100 km, 36,000km (GEO), 120,000 km are computed and
presented.
