We show that a general solution to the extended holomorphic anomaly equations
for the open topological string on D-branes in a Calabi-Yau manifold, recently
written down by Walcher in arXiv:0705.4098, is obtained from the general
solution to the holomorphic anomaly equations for the closed topological string
on the same manifold, by shifting the closed string moduli by amounts
proportional to the 't Hooft coupling.
