The problem of characterizing complexity of quantum dynamics - in particular
of locally interacting chains of quantum particles - will be reviewed and
discussed from several different perspectives: (i) stability of motion against
external perturbations and decoherence, (ii) efficiency of quantum simulation
in terms of classical computation and entanglement production in operator
spaces, (iii) quantum transport, relaxation to equilibrium and quantum mixing,
and (iv) computation of quantum dynamical entropies. Discussions of all these
criteria will be confronted with the established criteria of integrability or
quantum chaos, and sometimes quite surprising conclusions are found. Some
conjectures and interesting open problems in ergodic theory of the quantum many
problem are suggested.
