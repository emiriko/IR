A Reflection ASymmetric Relativistic Mean Field (RAS-RMF) approach is
developed by expanding the equations of motion for both the nucleons and the
mesons on the eigenfunctions of the two-center harmonic-oscillator potential.
The efficiency and reliability of the RAS-RMF approach are demonstrated in its
application to the well-known octupole deformed nucleus $^{226}$Ra and the
available data, including the binding energy and the deformation parameters,
are well reproduced.
