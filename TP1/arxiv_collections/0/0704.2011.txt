In this talk we discuss at hand of two examples the crucial role played by
self consistency in hadron physics. The first example concerns the quark-mass
dependence of the baryon octet and decuplet masses. It is shown that within a
self consistent one-loop approach based on the chiral Lagrangian the
'mysterious' quark-mass dependence of the $\Xi$ mass predicted by the MILC
collaboration may be recovered in terms of a discontinuous chiral
extrapolation. This is a consequence of self consistency imposed on the partial
summation, i.e. the masses used in the loop functions are identical to those
obtained from the baryon self energies. In the second example we discuss recent
studies on the properties of D mesons in cold nuclear matter as they are
predicted by coupled-channel dynamics. Here a self consistent many-body
approach reveals the close interlink of the properties of D meson and
open-charm baryon resonances in nuclear matter. The relevance of exotic baryon
resonances for the spectral distortion of the $D_s^\pm$ in nuclear matter is
pointed out.
