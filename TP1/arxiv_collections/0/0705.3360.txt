This paper overviews the basic principles and recent advances in the emerging
field of Quantum Computation (QC), highlighting its potential application to
Artificial Intelligence (AI). The paper provides a very brief introduction to
basic QC issues like quantum registers, quantum gates and quantum algorithms
and then it presents references, ideas and research guidelines on how QC can be
used to deal with some basic AI problems, such as search and pattern matching,
as soon as quantum computers become widely available.
