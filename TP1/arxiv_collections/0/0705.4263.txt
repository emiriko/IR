Recent simulations of merging black holes with spin give recoil velocities
from gravitational radiation up to several thousand km/s. A recoiling
supermassive black hole can retain the inner part of its accretion disk,
providing fuel for a continuing QSO phase lasting millions of years as the hole
moves away from the galactic nucleus. One possible observational manifestation
of a recoiling accretion disk is in QSO emission lines shifted in velocity from
the host galaxy. We have examined QSOs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with
broad emission lines substantially shifted relative to the narrow lines. We
find no convincing evidence for recoiling black holes carrying accretion disks.
We place an upper limit on the incidence of recoiling black holes in QSOs of 4%
for kicks greater than 500 km/s and 0.35% for kicks greater than 1000 km/s
line-of-sight velocity.
