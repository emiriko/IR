Results from studies on exclusive production of electron-position pair,
di-photon, and di-jet production at CDF in proton-antiproton collisions at the
Fermilab Tevatron are presented. The first observation and cross section
measurements of exclusive e+e- and di-jet production in hadron-hadron
collisions are emphasized.
