We consider a probabilistic cellular automaton to analyze the stochastic
dynamics of a predator-prey system. The local rules are Markovian and are based
in the Lotka-Volterra model. The individuals of each species reside on the
sites of a lattice and interact with an unsymmetrical neighborhood. We look for
the effect of the space anisotropy in the characterization of the oscillations
of the species population densities. Our study of the probabilistic cellular
automaton is based on simple and pair mean-field approximations and explicitly
takes into account spatial anisotropy.
