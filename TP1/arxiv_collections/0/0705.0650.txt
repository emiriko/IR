We report on a search for the lepton flavor violating tau- -> mu- gamma and
tau- -> e- gamma decays based on 535/fb of data accumulated at the Belle
experiment. No signal is found and we set 90% confidence level upper limits on
the branching ratios Br(tau- -> mu- gamma) < 4.5x10^-8 and Br(tau- -> e- gamma)
< 1.2x10^-7.
