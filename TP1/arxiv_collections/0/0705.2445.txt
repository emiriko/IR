We demonstrate the existence of a helical state in patterned multilayer
nanomagnets. The artificial helimagnets consist of a stack of single domain
ferromagnetic disks separated by insulating nonmagnetic spacers. The spiral
state is shown to originate from the magnetostatic interaction between nearest
and next nearest neighbouring single-domain disks in the stack. Since the
magnetostatic interaction for such disks is rather strong, the helical state
should be stable at room temperature. The helimagnets were fabricated from a
[Co/Si]*3 multilayer using electron beam lithography. The helical state was
confirmed by a magnetic stray field analysis using magnetic force microscopy.
