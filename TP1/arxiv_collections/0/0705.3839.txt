We extend Witt's theorem to several kinds of simultaneous isometries of
subspaces. We determine sufficient and necessary conditions for the extension
of an isometry of subspaces $\phi:E\to E'$ to an isometry $\phi_V:V\to V'$ that
also sends a given subspace to another, or a given self-dual flag to another,
or a Witt's decomposition to another and a special self-dual flag to another.
We also determine sufficient and necessary conditions for the isometry of
generic flags or the simultaneous isometry of (subspace, self-dual flag) pairs.
