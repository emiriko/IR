We show that entangling capacities based on the Jamiolkowski isomorphism may
be used to place lower bounds on the communication capacities of arbitrary
bipartite unitaries. Therefore, for these definitions, the relations which have
been previously shown for two-qubit unitaries also hold for arbitrary
dimensions. These results are closely related to the theory of the
entanglement-assisted capacity of channels. We also present more general
methods for producing ensembles for communication from initial states for
entanglement creation.
