Thermal response functions of strongly correlated electron systems are of
appreciable interest to the larger scientific community both theoretically and
technologically. Here we focus on the infinitely correlated t-J model on a
geometrically frustrated two-dimensional triangular lattice.
  Using exact diagonalization on a finite sized system we calculate the
dynamical thermal response functions in order to determine the thermopower,
Lorenz number, and dimensionless figure of merit. The dynamical thermal
response functions is compared to the infinite frequency limit and shown to be
very weak functions of frequency, hence, establishing the validity of the high
frequency formalism recently proposed by Shastry for the thermopower, Lorenz
number, and the dimensionless figure of merit. Further, the thermopower is
demonstrated to have a low to mid temperature enhancement when the sign of the
hopping parameter $t$ is switched from positive to negative for the
geometrically frustrated lattice considered.
