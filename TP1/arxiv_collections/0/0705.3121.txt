In this work we derive an analytic expression for the Kolmogorov-Sinai
entropy of dilute wet granular matter, valid for any spatial dimension. The
grains are modelled as hard spheres and the influence of the wetting liquid is
described according to the Capillary Model, in which dissipation is due to the
hysteretic cohesion force of capillary bridges. The Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy is
expanded in a series with respect to density. We find a rapid increase of the
leading term when liquid is added. This demonstrates the sensitivity of the
granular dynamics to humidity, and shows that the liquid significantly
increases the chaoticity of the granular gas.
