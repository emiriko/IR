We consider a multidimensional random walk in a product random environment
with bounded steps, transience in some spatial direction, and high enough
moments on the regeneration time. We prove an invariance principle, or
functional central limit theorem, under almost every environment for the
diffusively scaled centered walk. The main point behind the invariance
principle is that the quenched mean of the walk behaves subdiffusively.
