In this paper we show that, under certain generic conditions, billiards on
ovals have only a finite number of periodic orbits, for each period, all
non-degenerate and at least one of them is hyperbolic. Moreover, the invariant
curves of two hyperbolic points are transversal. We explore these properties to
give some dynamical consequences specially about the dynamics in the
instability regions.
