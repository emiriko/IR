We present molecular simulation data for viscosity, self-diffusivity, and the
local structural ordering of (i) a hard-sphere fluid and (ii) a square-well
fluid with short-range attractions. The latter fluid exhibits a region of
dynamic anomalies in its phase diagram, where its mobility increases upon
isochoric cooling, which is found to be a subset of a larger region of
structural anomalies, in which its pair correlations strengthen upon isochoric
heating. This "cascade of anomalies" qualitatively resembles that found in
recent simulations of liquid water. The results for the hard-sphere and
square-well systems also show that the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein
relation upon supercooling occurs for conditions where viscosity and
self-diffusivity develop different couplings to the degree of pairwise
structural ordering of the liquid. We discuss how these couplings reflect
dynamic heterogeneities. Finally, we note that the simulation data suggests how
repulsive and attractive glasses may generally be characterized by two distinct
levels of short-range structural order.
