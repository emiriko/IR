We argue about a possible scenario of physical reality based on the
parallelism between Poincare group and the sunyata philosophy of Nagarjuna. The
notion of "relational" is the common denominator of two views. We have
approached the relational concept in third-person perspective (ontic level). It
is possible to deduce different physical consequence and interpretation through
first-person perspective approach. This relational interpretation leave open
the questions: i)we must abandon the idea for a physical system the possibility
to extract completeness information? ii)we must abandon the idea to infer a
possible structure of physical reality?
