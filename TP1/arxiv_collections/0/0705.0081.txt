This paper introduces a new combinatorial construction for q-ary
constant-weight codes which yields several families of optimal codes and
asymptotically optimal codes. The construction reveals intimate connection
between q-ary constant-weight codes and sets of pairwise disjoint combinatorial
designs of various types.
