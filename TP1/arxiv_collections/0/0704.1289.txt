The Arnowitt-Deser-Misner canonical formulation of general relativity is
extended to the covariant brane-world theory in arbitrary dimensions. The
exclusive probing of the extra dimensions makes a substantial difference,
allowing for the construction of a non-constrained canonical theory. The
quantum states of the brane-world geometry are defined by the
Tomonaga-Schwinger equation, whose integrability conditions are determined by
the classical perturbations of submanifolds contained in the Nash's
differentiable embedding theorem. In principle, quantum brane-world theory can
be tested by current experiments in astrophysics and by near future laboratory
experiments at Tev energy. The implications to the black-hole information loss
problem, to the accelerating cosmology, and to a quantum mathematical theory of
four-sub manifolds are briefly commented.
