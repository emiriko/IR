Finite dimensional matrices having more columns than rows have no left
inverses while those having more rows than columns have no right inverses. We
give generalizations of these simple facts to bi--infinite matrices and use
those to obtain density results for $p$--frames of time--frequency molecules in
modulation spaces and identifiability results for operators with bandlimited
Kohn--Nirenberg symbols.
