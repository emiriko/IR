It is presumed that the observed cosmic rays up to about $3\times 10^{18}$ eV
are of Galactic origin, the particles being the ones which are found in the
composition of the stellar winds of stars that explode as supernova into the
interstellar medium (ISM) or into their winds. These particles are accelerated
in the supernova shock. In order to obtain the observed cosmic ray spectrum it
is necessary to take into account the diffusive losses in the Galaxy (which are
making the energy spectrum more steeper). Another modification of the source
spectrum is due to the fragmentation (spallation) of the cosmic ray particles,
after their collision with the ISM atoms. In this paper we are proving that
some particles are injected in the supernova shock one or two time ionized,
and, also, that the contribution of massive stars ($30 M_{\odot}\leq M\leq 50
M_{\odot}$) accelerated particles to cosmic rays (where the winds are highly
enriched in heavy elements) is 1:2 for elements with $Z\geq 6$. Another goal of
this paper is to check if the particles are injected with the same velocity,
energy or momentum.
