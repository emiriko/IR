We compare and contrast the different approaches to the optically thick
adiabatic phase of GRB all the way to the transparency. Special attention is
given to the role of the rate equation to be self consistently solved with the
relativistic hydrodynamic equations. The works of Shemi and Piran (1990),
Piran, Shemi and Narayan (1993), Meszaros, Laguna and Rees (1993) and Ruffini,
Salmonson, Wilson and Xue (1999,2000) are compared and contrasted. The role of
the baryonic loading in these three treatments is pointed out. Constraints on
initial conditions for the fireball produced by electro-magnetic black hole are
obtained.
