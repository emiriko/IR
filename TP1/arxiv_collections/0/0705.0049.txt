A relativistic single particle model is used to calculate the inclusive
$(e,e')$ reaction from $A=$12, 40, 56, 197, and 208 nuclei in the quasielastic
region. We have shown that this model provides a very good description of the
available experimental cross sections when they are dominated by the
quasielastic process. In this paper we use this model to investigate the
dependence of $y$-scaling on electron kinematics, particularly the electron
scattering angle, for a range of squared four momentum transfer $0.20-0.80$
(GeV/c)$^2$. In this kinematic domain, Coulomb distortion of the electron does
not significantly affect scaling, but final state interactions of the knocked
out nucleon do affect scaling particularly when the nucleons have lower
energies. In general, we find that scaling works for this reaction, but at
lower values of the four momentum transfer, the scaling function does have some
dependence on the electron scattering angle. We also consider a modification of
y-scaling to include small binding energy effects as a function of Z and A and
show that there is some improvement in scaling.
