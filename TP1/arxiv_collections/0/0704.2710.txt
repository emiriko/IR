We report on the discovery of six new ZZ Ceti stars. They were selected as
candidates based on preparatory photometric observations of objects from the
Hamburg Quasar Survey (HQS), and based on the spectra of the Supernova Ia
Progenitor Survey (SPY). Time-series photometry of 19 candidate stars was
carried out at the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) at Roque de Los Muchachos
Observatory, Spain. The new variables are relatively bright, 15.4<B<16.6. Among
them is WD1150-153, which is the third ZZ Ceti star that shows photospheric
CaII in its spectrum.
