We consider stationary axisymmetric solutions of general relativity that
asymptote to five dimensional Minkowski space. It is known that this system has
a hidden SL(3,R) symmetry. We identify an SO(2,1) subgroup of this symmetry
group that preserves the asymptotic boundary conditions. We show that the
action of this subgroup on a static solution generates a one-parameter family
of stationary solutions carrying angular momentum. We conjecture that by
repeated applications of this procedure one can generate all stationary
axisymmetric solutions starting from static ones. As an example, we derive the
Myers-Perry black hole starting from the Schwarzschild solution in five
dimensions.
