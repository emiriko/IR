We develop an stochastic approach to study gravitational waves produced
during the inflationary epoch under the presence of a decaying cosmological
parameter, on a 5D geometrical background which is Riemann flat. We obtain that
the squared tensor metric fluctuations depend strongly on the cosmological
parameter $\Lambda (t)$ and we finally illustrate the formalism with an example
of a decaying $\Lambda(t)$.
