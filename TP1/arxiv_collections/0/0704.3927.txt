Theoretical estimates of $\alpha$-decay half lives of several nuclei in the
decay from element 113 are presented. Calculations in a WKB framework using
DDM3Y interaction and experimental Q-values are in good agreement with the
experimental data. Half life calculations are found to be quite sensitive to
the Q-values and angular momenta transfers. Calculated decay lifetime
decreases, owing to more penetrability as well as thinner barrier, as Q-value
increases. Deviations to this predominant behaviour observed in some recent
experimental data may be attributed to non zero spin-parities in some cases.
