Sum rules among superparticle masses are derived under the assumption that
models beyond the MSSM are four-dimensional supersymmetric grand unified
theories or five-dimensional supersymmetric orbifold grand unified theories.
Sfermion sum rules are classified into four types and those sum rules can be
useful probes of the MSSM and beyond.
