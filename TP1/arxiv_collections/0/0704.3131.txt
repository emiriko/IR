In this paper we study the possibility of detecting lensing signals in
high-resolution and high-sensitivity CMB experiments. At scales below 1 arcmin,
the CMB background is dominated by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in clusters
and by Ostriker-Vishniac effect distortions elsewhere. Assuming the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich component in clusters can be removed, we focus on the
Ostriker-Vishniac effect and study the possibility of its detection while
paying special attention to contaminants, such as instrumental noise and point
sources. After designing an optimal filter for this particular lensing signal
we explore the signal-to-noise ratio for different scenarios varying the
resolution of the experiment, its sensitivity, and the level of contamination
due to point sources. Our results show that the next generation of experiments
should be able to do new and exciting science through the lensing effect of the
Ostriker-Vishniac background.
