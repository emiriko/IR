We present a method of transferring a cold atom between spatially separated
microtraps by means of a Raman transition between the ground motional states of
the two traps. The intermediate states for the Raman transition are the
vibrational levels of a third microtrap, and we determine the experimental
conditions for which the overlap of the wave functions leads to an efficient
transfer. There is a close analogy with the Franck-Condon principle in the
spectroscopy of molecules. Spin-dependent manipulation of neutral atoms in
microtraps has important applications in quantum information processing. We
also show that starting with several atoms, precisely one atom can be
transferred to the final potential well hence giving deterministic preparation
of single atoms.
