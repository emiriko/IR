A method is proposed for the determination of the position and inclination
angles of the plane of a spiral galaxy based on the assumption that every
spiral arm is a monotonic function of the radius versus azimuthal angle. This
method may yield more accurate results than the more commonly employed isophote
method, which is fraught with various drawbacks. The use of the new method is
illustrated by applying it to a sample of 43 objects, and the results agree
well with data from other sources.
