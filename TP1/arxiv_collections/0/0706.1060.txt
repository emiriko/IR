A laser-based angle resolved photoemission (APRES) system utilizing 6 eV
photons from the fourth harmonic of a mode-locked Ti:sapphire oscillator is
described. This light source greatly increases the momentum resolution and
photoelectron count rate, while reducing extrinsic background and surface
sensitivity relative to higher energy light sources. In this review, the
optical system is described, and special experimental considerations for
low-energy ARPES are discussed. The calibration of the hemispherical electron
analyzer for good low-energy angle-mode performance is also described. Finally,
data from the heavily studied high T_c superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+\delta
(Bi2212) is compared to the results from higher photon energies.
