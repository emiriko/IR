Using the recently commissioned multi-object spectrograph AAOmega on the 3.9m
AAT we have obtained medium-resolution near-infrared spectra for 10,500 stars
in and around five southern globular clusters. The targets were 47 Tuc, M12,
M30, M55 and NGC 288. We have measured radial velocities to +/- 1 km/s with the
cross correlation method and estimated metallicity, effective temperature,
surface gra vity and rotational velocity for each star by fitting synthetic
model spectra. An analysis of the velocity maps and velocity dispersion of
member stars revealed systemic rotation in four of the target clusters.
