The transverse motion inside a Stark decelerator plays a large role in the
total efficiency of deceleration. We differentiate between two separate regimes
of molecule loss during the slowing process. The first mechanism involves
distributed loss due to coupling of transverse and longitudinal motion, while
the second is a result of the rapid decrease of the molecular velocity within
the final few stages. In this work, we describe these effects and present means
for overcoming them. Solutions based on modified switching time sequences with
the existing decelerator geometry lead to a large gain of stable molecules in
the intermediate velocity regime, but fail to address the loss at very low
final velocities. We propose a new decelerator design, the quadrupole-guiding
decelerator, which eliminates distributed loss due to transverse/longitudinal
couplings throughout the slowing process and also exhibits gain over normal
deceleration to the lowest velocities.
