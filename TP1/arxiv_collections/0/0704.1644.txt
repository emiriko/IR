It is shown that fermionic polar molecules or atoms in a bilayer optical
lattice can undergo the transition to a state with circulating currents, which
spontaneously breaks the time reversal symmetry. Estimates of relevant
temperature scales are given and experimental signatures of the circulating
current phase are identified. Related phenomena in bosonic and spin systems
with ring exchange are discussed.
