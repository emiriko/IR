We show that nuclear pairing Hamiltonian exhibits supersymmetry in the
strong-coupling limit. The underlying supersymmetric quantum mechanical
structure explains the degeneracies between the energies of the N and Nmax-N+1
pair eigenstates. The supersymmetry transformations connecting these states are
given.
