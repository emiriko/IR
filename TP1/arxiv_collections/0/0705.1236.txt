A computational model study for complete frequency redistribution linear
incoherent two-level atomic radiation trapping in optically dense media using
the multiple scattering representation is presented. This model study discuss
at length the influence of the spectral distributions, overall opacity and
emission quantum yield to trapping distorted ensemble quantities stressing
physical insight and with a non-specialist audience in mind. Macroscopic
reemission yield, lifetime, steady state spectra and spatial distributions are
calculated as a function of intrinsic emission yield, opacity and external
excitation mode for Doppler, Lorentz and Voigt lineshapes. The work could
constitute the basis for a final undergraduate or beginning graduate project in
computational physics instruction and implements the analytical developments of
the previous instalment of this contribution.
