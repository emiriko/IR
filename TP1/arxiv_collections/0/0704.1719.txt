We study the potential of radiative decays of the Upsilon(1S) and of the phi
mesons to search for a light pseudoscalar Higgs boson, proposed as a possible
interpretation of Sigma+ --> p mu+mu- events observed by the HyperCP
collaboration at Fermilab. We conclude that the detection of this signal should
certainly be possible with the current CLEO Upsilon(1S) data, and is within the
reach of KLOE in at least part of the range of couplings suggested by the
HyperCP findings.
