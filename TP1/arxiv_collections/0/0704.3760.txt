In the present work, an alternative interpretation of the source of
accelerated expansion of the Universe is suggested. A probable candidate is the
interaction between the quantum spin of a moving particle and the torsion of
space-time, produced by the background gravitational field of the Universe.
This interaction has been suggested by the author in a previous work, with some
experimental and observational evidences for its existence. It has been shown
that this interaction gives rise to a repulsive force. The accelerated
expansion of the Universe may give a further evidence on the existence of this
interaction on the cosmological scale.
