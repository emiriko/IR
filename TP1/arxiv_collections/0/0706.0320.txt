We concentrate on the geometric potential in the invariant perturbation
theory of quantum adiabatic process which is presented in our recent papers. It
is found out to be related to the geodesic curvature of the spherical curve in
2-dimension quantum systems. We also show that the geometric potential may
affect adiabatic approximation remarkably.
