We present a comprehensive study of the lowest moments of nucleon generalized
parton distributions in N_f=2+1 lattice QCD using domain wall valence quarks
and improved staggered sea quarks. Our investigation includes helicity
dependent and independent generalized parton distributions for pion masses as
low as 350 MeV and volumes as large as (3.5 fm)^3, for a lattice spacing of
0.124 fm. We use perturbative renormalization at one-loop level with an
improvement based on the non-perturbative renormalization factor for the axial
vector current, and only connected diagrams are included in the isosinglet
channel.
