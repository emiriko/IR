We report on X-ray observations of Nova Sagittarius 1998 (V4633 Sgr),
performed with XMM-Newton at three different epochs, 934, 1083 and 1265 days
after discovery. The nova was detected with the EPIC cameras at all three
epochs, with emission spanning the whole energy range from 0.2 to 10 keV.
  The X-ray spectra do not change significantly at the different epochs, and
are well fitted for the first and third observations with a multi-temperature
optically thin thermal plasma, while lower statistics in the second
observations lead to a poorer fit. The thermal plasma emission is most probably
originated in the shock heated ejecta, with chemical composition similar to
that of a CO nova. However, we can not completely rule out reestablished
accretion as the origin of the emission. We also obtain upper limits for the
temperature and luminosity of a potential white dwarf atmospheric component,
and conclude that hydrogen burning had already turned-off by the time of our
observations.
