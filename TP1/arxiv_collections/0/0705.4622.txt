[abridged] We present the results of a spectroscopic survey of the recently
discovered faint Milky Way satellites Boo, UMaI, UMaII and Wil1. Using the
DEIMOS spectrograph on Keck, we have obtained samples that contain from 15 to
85 probable members of these satellites for which we derive radial velocities
precise to a few km/s down to i~21-22. About half of these stars are observed
with a high enough S/N to estimate their metallicity to within \pm0.2 dex. From
this dataset, we show that UMaII is the only object that does not show a clear
radial velocity peak. However, the measured systemic radial velocity
(v_r=115\pm5 km/s) is in good agreement with recent simulations in which this
object is the progenitor of the recently discovered Orphan Stream. The three
other satellites show velocity dispersions that make them highly dark-matter
dominated systems. In particular the Willman 1 object is not a globular cluster
given its metallicity scatter over -2.0<[Fe/H]<-1.0 and is therefore almost
certainly a dwarf galaxy or dwarf galaxy remnant. We measure a radial velocity
dispersion of only 4.3_{-1.3}^{+2.3} km/s around a systemic velocity of
-12.3\pm2.3 km/s which implies a mass-to-light ratio of ~700 and a total mass
of ~5x10^5 Msun for this satellite, making it the least massive satellite
galaxy known to date. Such a low mass could mean that the 10^7 Msun limit that
had until now never been crossed for Milky Way and Andromeda satellite galaxies
may only be an observational limit and that fainter, less massive systems exist
within the Local Group. However, more modeling and an extended search for
potential extra-tidal stars are required to rule out the possibility that these
systems have not been significantly heated by tidal interaction.
