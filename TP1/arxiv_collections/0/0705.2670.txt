We study the dynamics of monodisperse hard ellipsoids via a new event-driven
molecular dynamics algorithm as a function of volume fraction $\phi$ and aspect
ratio $X_0$. We evaluate the translational $D_{trans}$ and the rotational
$D_{rot}$ diffusion coefficient and the associated isodiffusivity lines in the
$\phi-X_0$ plane. We observe a decoupling of the translational and rotational
dynamics which generates an almost perpendicular crossing of the $D_{trans}$
and $D_{rot}$ isodiffusivity lines. While the self intermediate scattering
function exhibits stretched relaxation, i.e. glassy dynamics, only for large
$\phi$ and $X_0 \approx 1$, the second order orientational correlator $C_2(t)$
shows stretching only for large and small $X_0$ values. We discuss these
findings in the context of a possible pre-nematic order driven glass
transition.
