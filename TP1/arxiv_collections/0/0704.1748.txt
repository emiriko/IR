As networks and their structure have become a major field of research, a
strong demand for network visualization has emerged. We address this challenge
by formalizing the well established spring layout in terms of dynamic
equations. We thus open up the design space for new algorithms. Drawing from
the knowledge of systems design, we derive a layout algorithm that remedies
several drawbacks of the original spring layout. This new algorithm relies on
the balancing of two antagonistic forces. We thus call it {\em arf} for
"attractive and repulsive forces". It is, as we claim, particularly suited for
a dynamic layout of smaller networks ($n < 10^3$). We back this claim with
several application examples from on going complex systems research.
