We have undertaken an unprecedentedly large 1.1 millimeter continuum survey
of three nearby star forming clouds using Bolocam at the Caltech Submillimeter
Observatory. We mapped the largest areas in each cloud at millimeter or
submillimeter wavelengths to date: 7.5 sq. deg in Perseus (Paper I), 10.8 sq.
deg in Ophiuchus (Paper II), and 1.5 sq. deg in Serpens with a resolution of
31", detecting 122, 44, and 35 cores, respectively. Here we report on results
of the Serpens survey and compare the three clouds. Average measured angular
core sizes and their dependence on resolution suggest that many of the observed
sources are consistent with power-law density profiles. Tests of the effects of
cloud distance reveal that linear resolution strongly affects measured source
sizes and densities, but not the shape of the mass distribution. Core mass
distribution slopes in Perseus and Ophiuchus (alpha=2.1+/-0.1 and
alpha=2.1+/-0.3) are consistent with recent measurements of the stellar IMF,
whereas the Serpens distribution is flatter (alpha=1.6+/-0.2). We also compare
the relative mass distribution shapes to predictions from turbulent
fragmentation simulations. Dense cores constitute less than 10% of the total
cloud mass in all three clouds, consistent with other measurements of low
star-formation efficiencies. Furthermore, most cores are found at high column
densities; more than 75% of 1.1 mm cores are associated with Av>8 mag in
Perseus, 15 mag in Serpens, and 20-23 mag in Ophiuchus.
