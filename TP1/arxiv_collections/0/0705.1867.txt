We investigate the degree of the polar transformations associated to a
certain class of multi-valued homogeneous functions. In particular we prove
that the degree of the pre-image of generic linear spaces by a polar
transformation associated to a homogeneous polynomial $F$ is determined by the
zero locus of $F$. For zero dimensional-dimensional linear spaces this was
conjecture by Dolgachev and proved by Dimca-Papadima using topological
arguments. Our methods are algebro-geometric and rely on the study of the Gauss
map of naturally associated logarithmic foliations.
