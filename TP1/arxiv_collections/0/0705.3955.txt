The magnetic properties in the Ising ferromagnetic thin films are studied. By
transfer matrix method, the transition temperatures are calculated as a
function of the intra- and interlayer exchange interactions. The transition
temperatures in the Ising ferromagnetic thin films with uniaxial anisotropy are
also studied. The results show that the transition temperature changes with the
film thickness.
