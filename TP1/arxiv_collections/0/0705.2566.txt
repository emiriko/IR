Finding control laws (pulse sequences) that can compensate for dispersions in
parameters which govern the evolution of a quantum system is an important
problem in the fields of coherent spectroscopy, imaging, and quantum
information processing. The use of composite pulse techniques for such tasks
has a long and widely known history. In this paper, we introduce the method of
Fourier synthesis control law design for compensating dispersions in quantum
system dynamics. We focus on system models arising in NMR spectroscopy and NMR
imaging applications.
