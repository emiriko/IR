Ultra-high energy cosmic ray protons accelerated in astrophysical objects
produce secondary electromagnetic cascades during propagation in the cosmic
microwave and infrared backgrounds. We show that such cascades can contribute
between ~1% and ~50% of the GeV-TeV diffuse photon flux measured by the EGRET
experiment. The GLAST satellite should have a good chance to discover this
flux.
