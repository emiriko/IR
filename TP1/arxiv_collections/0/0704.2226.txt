The majority of the globular clusters associated with the Sagittarius dwarf
galaxy are faint. In this respect it differs significantly from the globular
cluster systems surrounding typical giant galaxies. The observation that most
of globular clusters in the outer halo of the Galaxy are also sub-luminous may
be understood by assuming that these clusters once also belonged to faint
cluster-rich dwarf systems that were subsequently captured and destroyed by the
Milky Way System.
