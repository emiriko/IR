We consider the question of how large a subspace of a given bipartite quantum
system can be when the subspace contains only highly entangled states. This is
motivated in part by results of Hayden et al., which show that in large d x
d--dimensional systems there exist random subspaces of dimension almost d^2,
all of whose states have entropy of entanglement at least log d - O(1). It is
also related to results due to Parthasarathy on the dimension of completely
entangled subspaces, which have connections with the construction of
unextendible product bases. Here we take as entanglement measure the Schmidt
rank, and determine, for every pair of local dimensions dA and dB, and every r,
the largest dimension of a subspace consisting only of entangled states of
Schmidt rank r or larger. This exact answer is a significant improvement on the
best bounds that can be obtained using random subspace techniques. We also
determine the converse: the largest dimension of a subspace with an upper bound
on the Schmidt rank. Finally, we discuss the question of subspaces containing
only states with Schmidt equal to r.
