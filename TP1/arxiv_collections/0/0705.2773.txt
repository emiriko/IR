Arcminute-resolution radio continuum images at 408 and 1420 MHz from the
Canadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS) have been used to reexamine radio sources
listed in the Kallas and Reich (1980) catalogue. This catalogue is of
particular interest to Galactic studies as it lists both extended and compact
radio sources found in the second Galactic quadrant. We have determined the
nature (extended vs. compact, Galactic vs. extragalactic) of all of these
bright radio sources. A number of large HII regions with no optical
counterparts are highlighted along with a sample of large radio galaxies. Many
sources previously thought to be extended Galactic objects are shown to be
point sources. A sample of point sources with flat or rising spectra between
408 and 1420 MHz has been compiled, and within this sample likely Gigahertz
Peaked Spectrum sources have been identified.
