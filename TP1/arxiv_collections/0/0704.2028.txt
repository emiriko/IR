A numerical technique is developed to solve the Luttinger-Kohn equation for
impurity states directly in k-space and is applied to calculate bound hole wave
functions in a ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn)As host. The rich properties of the band
structure of an arbitrarily strained, ferromagnetic zinc-blende semiconductor
yields various features which have direct impact on the detailed shape of a
valence band hole bound to an active impurity. The role of strain is discussed
on the basis of explicit calculations of bound hole states.
