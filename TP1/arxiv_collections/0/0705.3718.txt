We present an analytic study for subdiffusive escape of overdamped particles
out of a cusp-shaped parabolic potential well which are driven by thermal,
fractional Gaussian noise with a $1/\omega^{1-\alpha}$ power spectrum. This
long-standing challenge becomes mathematically tractable by use of a
generalized Langevin dynamics via its corresponding non-Markovian,
time-convolutionless master equation: We find that the escape is governed
asymptotically by a power law whose exponent depends exponentially on the ratio
of barrier height and temperature. This result is in distinct contrast to a
description with a corresponding subdiffusive fractional Fokker-Planck
approach; thus providing experimentalists an amenable testbed to differentiate
between the two escape scenarios.
