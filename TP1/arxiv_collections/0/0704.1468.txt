The Feynman propagator has nonzero values outside of the forward light cone.
That does not allow messages to be transmitted faster than the speed of light,
but it is shown here that it does allow entanglement and mutual information to
be generated at space-like separated points. These effects can be interpreted
as being due to the propagation of virtual photons outside of the light cone or
as a transfer of pre-existing entanglement from the quantum vacuum. The
differences between these two interpretations are discussed.
