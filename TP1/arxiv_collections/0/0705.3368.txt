In this paper we present new formulas, which represent commutators and
anticommutators of Clifford algebra elements as sums of elements of different
ranks. Using these formulas we consider subalgebras of Lie algebras of
pseudounitary groups. Our main techniques are Clifford algebras. We have find
12 types of subalgebras of Lie algebras of pseudounitary groups.
