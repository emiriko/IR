The inclusive search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in four-lepton final
states with the ATLAS and CMS detectors at the LHC pp collider is presented.
The discussion focusses on the H-> ZZ^(*)->4l+X decay mode for a Higgs boson in
the mass range 120 ~< M_H ~< 600 GeV/c^2. A prospective analysis is presented
for the discovery potential based on a detailled simulation of the detector
response in the experimental conditions of the first years of LHC running at
low luminosity. An overview of the expected sensitivity in the measurement of
the Higgs boson properties is also given.
