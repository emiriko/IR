Wave chaos is demonstrated by studying a wave propagation in a periodically
corrugated wave-guide. In the limit of a short wave approximation (SWA) the
underlying description is related to the chaotic ray dynamics. In this case the
control parameter of the problem is characterized by the corrugation amplitude
and the SWA parameter. The considered model is fairly suitable and tractable
for the analytical analysis of a wave localization length. The number of
eigenmodes characterized the width of the localized wave packet is estimated
analytically.
