I suggest to use the effect of Coulomb drag between two closely positioned
graphite monolayers (graphene sheets) for experimental measurement of the
strength of weak non-linearities of the spectrum in graphene. I consider
trigonal warping as a representative mechanism responsible for the drag effect.
Since graphene is relatively defect-free, I evaluate the drag conductivity in
the ballistic regime and find that it is proportional to the fourth power of
the warping strength.
