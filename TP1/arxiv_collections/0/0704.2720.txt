We study gravitational radiation reaction in the equations of motion for
binary systems with spin-orbit coupling, at order (v/c)^7 beyond Newtonian
gravity, or O(v/c)^2 beyond the leading radiation reaction effects for
non-spinning bodies. We use expressions for the energy and angular momentum
flux at infinity that include spin-orbit corrections, together with an
assumption of energy and angular momentum balance, to derive equations of
motion that are valid for general orbits and for a class of coordinate gauges.
We show that the equations of motion are compatible with those derived earlier
by a direct calculation.
