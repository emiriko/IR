Interest in development of brain prostheses, which might be proposed to
recover mental functions lost due to neuron-degenerative disease or trauma,
requires new methods in molecular engineering and nanotechnology to build
artificial brain tissues. We develop a Dynamic Core model to analyze complexity
of damaged biological neural network as well as transition and recovery of the
system functionality due to changes in the system environment. We provide a
method to model complexity of physical systems which might be proposed as an
artificial tissue or prosthesis. Delocalization of Dynamic Core model is
developed to analyze migration of mental functions in dynamic bio-systems which
undergo architecture transition induced by trauma. Term Dynamic Core is used to
define a set of causally related functions and Delocalization is used to
describe the process of migration. Information geometry and topological
formalisms are proposed to analyze information processes. A holographic model
is proposed to construct dynamic environment with self-poetic Dynamic Core
which preserve functional properties under transition from one host to another.
We found statistical constraints for complex systems which conserve a Dynamic
Core under environment transition. Also we suggest those constraints might
provide recommendations for nanotechnologies and tissue engineering used in
development of an artificial brain tissue.
