We report the conjectures on the three-dimensional (3D) Ising model on simple
orthorhombic lattices, together with the details of calculations for a putative
exact solution. Two conjectures, an additional rotation in the fourth curled-up
dimension and the weight factors on the eigenvectors, are proposed to serve as
a boundary condition to deal with the topologic problem of the 3D Ising model.
The partition function of the 3D simple orthorhombic Ising model is evaluated
by spinor analysis, by employing these conjectures. Based on the validity of
the conjectures, the critical temperature of the simple orthorhombic Ising
lattices could be determined by the relation of KK* = KK' + KK'' + K'K'' or
sinh 2K sinh 2(K' + K'' + K'K''/K) = 1. For a simple cubic Ising lattice, the
critical point is putatively determined to locate exactly at the golden ratio
xc = exp(-2Kc) = (sq(5) - 1)/2, as derived from K* = 3K or sinh 2K sinh 6K = 1.
If the conjectures would be true, the specific heat of the simple orthorhombic
Ising system would show a logarithmic singularity at the critical point of the
phase transition. The spontaneous magnetization and the spin correlation
functions of the simple orthorhombic Ising ferromagnet are derived explicitly.
The putative critical exponents derived explicitly for the simple orthorhombic
Ising lattices are alpha = 0, beta = 3/8, gamma = 5/4, delta = 13/3, eta = 1/8
and nu = 2/3, showing the universality behavior and satisfying the scaling
laws. The cooperative phenomena near the critical point are studied and the
results obtained based on the conjectures are compared with those of the
approximation methods and the experimental findings. The 3D to 2D crossover
phenomenon differs with the 2D to 1D crossover phenomenon and there is a
gradual crossover of the exponents from the 3D values to the 2D ones.
