Compact OH(1720 MHz) masers have proven to be excellent signposts for the
interaction of supernova remnants with adjacent molecular clouds. Less
appreciated has been the weak, extended OH(1720 MHz) emission which accompanies
strong compact maser sources. Recent single-dish and interferometric
observations reveal the majority of maser-emitting supernova remnants have
accompanying regions of extended maser emission. Enhanced OH abundance created
by the passing shock is observed both as maser emission and absorption against
the strong background of the remnant. Modeling the observed OH profiles gives
an estimate of the physical conditions in which weak, extended maser emission
arises. I will discuss how we can realize the utility of this extended maser
emission, particularly the potential to measure the strength of the post-shock
magnetic field via Zeeman splitting over these large-scales.
