In particular cases of stationary and stationary axially symmetric space-time
passage to non-relativistic limit of Einstein equation is completed. For this
end the notions of absolute space and absolute time are introduced due to
stationarity of the space-time under consideration. In this construction
absolute time is defined as a function $t$ on the space-time such that $\prt_t$
is exactly the Killing vector and the space at different moments is presented
by the surfaces $t=\con $. The space-time metric is expressed in terms of
metric of the 3-space and two potentials one of which is exactly Newtonian
gravitational potential $\Phi$, another is vector potential $\vec A$ which,
however, differs from vector potential known in classical electrodynamics. In
the first-order approximation on $\Phi/c^2$, $|\vec A|/c$ Einstein equation is
reduced to a system for these functions in which left-hand sides contain
Laplacian of the Newtonian potential, derivatives of the vector potential and
curvature of the space and the right-hand sides do 3-dimensional stress tensor
and densities of mass and energy. Subj-class: Classical Physics
