We study electronic transport in graphene nanoribbons with rough edges. We
first consider a model of weak disorder that corresponds to an armchair ribbon
whose width randomly changes by a single unit cell size. We find that in this
case, the low-temperature conductivity is governed by an effective
one-dimensional hopping between segments of distinct band structure. We then
provide numerical evidence and qualitative arguments that similar behavior also
occurs in the limit of strong uncorrelated boundary disorder.
