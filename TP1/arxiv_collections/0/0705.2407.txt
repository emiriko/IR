Nonuniform tubular neighborhoods of curves in Euclidean n-space are studied
by using weighted distance functions and generalizing the normal exponential
map. Different notions of injectivity radii are introduced to investigate
singular but injective exponential maps. A generalization of the thickness
formula is obtained for nonuniform thickness. All singularities within almost
injectivity radius are classified by the Horizontal Collapsing Property.
Examples are provided to show the distinction between the different types of
injectivity radii, as well as showing that the standard differentiable
injectivity radius fails to be upper semicontinuous on a singular set of weight
functions.
