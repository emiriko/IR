Based on its strong CO+ emission it is argued that the M 82 star-burst galaxy
is exposed to a combination of FUV and X-ray radiation. The latter is likely to
be the result of the star-burst superwind, which leads to diffuse thermal
emission at ~0.7 keV, and a compact hard, 2-10 keV, source (but not an AGN).
Although a photon-dominated region (FUV) component is clearly present in the
nucleus of M 82, and capable of forming CO+, only X-ray irradiated gas of
density 10^3-10^5 cm^-3 can reproduce the large, ~(1-4)x10^13 cm^-2, columns of
CO+ that are observed toward the proto-typical star-burst M 82. The total X-ray
luminosity produced by M 82 is weak, ~10^41 erg s^-1, but this is sufficient to
drive the formation of CO+.
