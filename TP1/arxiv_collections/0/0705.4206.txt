It is shown that multiple volume reflections from different planes of one
bent crystal becomes possible when particles move at a small angle with respect
to a crystal axis. Such a Multiple Volume Reflection makes it possible to
increase the particle deflection angle inside one crystal by more than four
times and can be used to increase the efficiency of beam extraction and
collimation at the LHC and many other accelerators.
