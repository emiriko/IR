We investigate the possibility to localize scalar field configurations as a
model for black hole accretion. We analyze and resolve difficulties encountered
when localizing scalar fields in General Relativity. We illustrate this ability
with a simple spherically symmetric model which can be used to study features
of accreting shells around a black hole. This is accomplished by prescribing a
scalar field with a coordinate dependent potential. Numerical solutions to the
Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations are shown, where a scalar filed is indeed
confined within a region surrounding a black hole. The resulting spacetime can
be described in terms of simple harmonic time dependence.
