We report on calculations of broadening effects in QCL due to alloy
scattering. The output of numerical calculations of alloy broadened Landau
levels compare favorably with calculations performed at the self-consistent
Born approximation. Results for Landau level width and optical absorption are
presented. A disorder activated forbidden transition becomes significant in the
vicinity of crossings of Landau levels which belong to different subbands. A
study of the time dependent survival probability in the lowest Landau level of
the excited subband is performed. It is shown that at resonance the population
relaxation occurs in a subpicosecond scale.
