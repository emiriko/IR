We use the direct Fourier method to calculate the redshift-space power
spectrum of the maxBCG cluster catalog (Koester et al. 2007) -- currently by
far the largest existing galaxy cluster sample. The total number of clusters
used in our analysis is 12,616. After accounting for the radial smearing effect
caused by photometric redshift errors and also introducing a simple treatment
for the nonlinear effects, we show that currently favored low matter density
``concordance'' LambdaCDM cosmology provides a very good fit to the estimated
power. Thanks to the large volume (~ 0.4 h^{-3} Gpc^3), high clustering
amplitude (linear effective bias parameter b_{eff} ~ 3x(0.85/sigma_8)), and
sufficiently high sampling density (~ 3x10^{-5} h^{3} Mpc^{-3}) the recovered
power spectrum has high enough signal to noise to allow us to find weak
evidence (~ 2sigma CL) for the acoustic features. These results are encouraging
in light of the several proposed large cluster surveys. In case we use the
photometric redshift errors as suggested in Koester et al. (2007) we are left
with the excess large-scale power which has previously been noticed by several
other authors.
