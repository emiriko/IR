A recently developed time dependent model for the excitation of a nucleon
from a bound state to a continuum resonant state in the system n+core is
applied to the study of the population of the low energy continuum of the
unbound $^{10}$Li system obtained from $^{11}$Li fragmentation. Comparison of
the model results to new data from the GSI laboratory suggests that the
reaction mechanism is dominated by final state effects rather than by the
sudden process, but for the population of the l=0 virtual state, in which case
the two mechanisms give almost identical results. There is also, for the first
time, a clear evidence for the population of a d$_{5/2}$ resonance in
$^{10}$Li.
