We obtain the coefficients of a new fundamental plane for supermassive black
holes at the centers of elliptical galaxies, involving measured central black
hole mass and photometric parameters which define the light distribution. The
galaxies are tightly distributed around this mass fundamental plane, with
improvement in the rms residual over those obtained from the $\mbh-\sigma$ and
$\mbh-L$ relations. This implies a strong multidimensional link between the
central massive black hole formation and global photometric properties of
elliptical galaxies and provides an improved estimate of black hole mass from
galaxy data.
