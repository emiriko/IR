By considering the one-particle and two-particle scattering data of the
spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain at T=0 we derive a continuum limit relating the spin
chain to the 1D Bose gas. Applying this limit to the quantum transfer matrix
approach of the Heisenberg chain we obtain expressions for the correlation
functions of the Bose gas at arbitrary temperatures.
