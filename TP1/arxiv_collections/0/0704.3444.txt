We present a lattice Boltzmann algorithm based on an underlying free energy
that allows the simulation of the dynamics of a multicomponent system with an
arbitrary number of components. The thermodynamic properties, such as the
chemical potential of each component and the pressure of the overall system,
are incorporated in the model. We derived a symmetrical convection diffusion
equation for each component as well as the Navier Stokes equation and
continuity equation for the overall system. The algorithm was verified through
simulations of binary and ternary systems. The equilibrium concentrations of
components of binary and ternary systems simulated with our algorithm agree
well with theoretical expectations.
