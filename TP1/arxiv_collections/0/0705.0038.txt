In this paper, we enumerate prime graphs with respect to the Cartesian
multiplication of graphs. We use the unique factorization of a connected graph
into the product of prime graphs given by Sabidussi to find explicit formulas
for labeled and unlabeled prime graphs. In the case of species, we construct
the exponential composition of species based on the arithmetic product of
species of Maia and M\'endez and the quotient species, and express the species
of connected graphs as the exponential composition of the species of prime
graphs.
