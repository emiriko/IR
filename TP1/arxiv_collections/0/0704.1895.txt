We study jamming in granular mixtures from the novel point of view of
extended hydrodynamics. Using a hard sphere binary mixture model we predict
that a few large grains are expected to get caged more effectively in a matrix
of small grains compared to a few small grains in a matrix of larger ones. A
similar effect has been experimentally seen in the context of colloidal
mixtures.
