We propose a two-color scheme of atom guide and 1D optical lattice using
evanescent light fields of different transverse modes. The optical waveguide
carries a red-detuned light and a blue-detuned light, with both modes far from
resonance. The atom guide and 1D optical lattice potentials can be transformed
to each other by using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer to accurately control mode
transformation. This might provide a new approach to realize flexible
transition between the guiding and trapping states of atoms.
