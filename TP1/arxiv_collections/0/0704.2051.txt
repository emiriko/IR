We present the results of a deep 610 MHz survey of the 1^H XMM/Chandra survey
area with the GMRT. The resulting maps have a resolution of ~7 arcsec and an
rms noise limit of 60 microJy. To a 5 sigma detection limit of 300 microJy we
detect 223 sources within a survey area of diameter 64 arcmin. We compute the
610 MHz source counts and compare them to those measured at other radio
wavelengths. The well know flattening of the Euclidean-normalised 1.4 GHz
source counts below ~2 mJy, usually explained by a population of starburst
galaxies undergoing luminosity evolution, is seen at 610 MHz. The 610 MHz
source counts can be modelled by the same populations that explain the 1.4 GHz
source counts, assuming a spectral index of -0.7 for the starburst galaxies and
the steep spectrum AGN population. We find a similar dependence of luminosity
evolution on redshift for the starburst galaxies at 610 MHz as is found at 1.4
GHz (i.e. 'Q'= 2.45 (+0.3,-0.4)).
