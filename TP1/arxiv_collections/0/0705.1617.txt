With the great success in simulating many intelligent behaviors using
computing devices, there has been an ongoing debate whether all conscious
activities are computational processes. In this paper, the answer to this
question is shown to be no. A certain phenomenon of consciousness is
demonstrated to be fully represented as a computational process using a quantum
computer. Based on the computability criterion discussed with Turing machines,
the model constructed is shown to necessarily involve a non-computable element.
The concept that this is solely a quantum effect and does not work for a
classical case is also discussed.
