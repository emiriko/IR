The four Bell states can be represented by separable coherent states which
are products of individual non-hermitian spin operators. In the absence of
interactions, the non-hermitian states are predicted to form a new quantum
state of spin magnitude 1/sqrt(2) rather than 1/2. Properties of these states
show that an isolated spin is a resonance state with zero net angular momentum,
consistent with a point particle. In addition, the Bell states are shown to
take on the identical mathematical form when the two spins are bound (local) or
unbound (non-local). The bound Bell states are resonances between four states.
When the separate, they do so from only one of its resonance states and their
ensemble average defines the unbound Bell states. The bound and unbound Bell
states have the same mathematical form due to the persistence of the
rotationally invariance of sigma(1)dot sigma(2).
