We report the detection of CN(N=3-2) emission towards the Cloverleaf quasar
(z=2.56) based on observations with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer.
This is the first clear detection of emission from this radical at high
redshift. CN emission is a tracer of dense molecular hydrogen gas (n(H2) > 10^4
cm^{-3}) within star-forming molecular clouds, in particular in regions where
the clouds are affected by UV radiation. The HCN/CN intensity ratio can be used
as a diagnostic for the relative importance of photodissociation regions (PDRs)
in a source, and as a sensitive probe of optical depth, the radiation field,
and photochemical processes. We derive a lensing-corrected CN(N=3-2) line
luminosity of L'(CN(3-2) = (4.5 +/- 0.5) x 10^9 K km/s pc^2. The ratio between
CN luminosity and far-infrared luminosity falls within the scatter of the same
relationship found for low-z (ultra-) luminous infrared galaxies. Combining our
new results with CO(J=3-2) and HCN(J=1-0) measurements from the literature and
assuming thermal excitation for all transitions, we find a CO/CN luminosity
ratio of 9.3 +/- 1.9 and a HCN/CN luminosity ratio of 0.95 +/- 0.15. However,
we find that the CN(N=3-2) line is likely only subthermally excited, implying
that those ratios may only provide upper limits for the intrinsic 1-0 line
luminosity ratios. We conclude that, in combination with other molecular gas
tracers like CO, HCN, and HCO+, CN is an important probe of the physical
conditions and chemical composition of dense molecular environments at high
redshift.
