A few FRI radio galaxies were detected at GeV gamma-rays with CGRO EGRET,
with peroperties suggesting that the gamma-ray flux originates from the core.
Here we discuss the possibility that the extended radio features of radio
galaxies could be detected with the LAT, focusing on the particularly promising
case of the nearby giant radio galaxy Fornax A.
