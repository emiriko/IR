General properties of the hot and dense hadron matter (fireball) discovered
in AuAu collisions with pSNN = 130 and 200 GeV at RHIC are compared with these
for ideal electromagnetic plasma. None of them was found to be in contrary to
those of the plasma typical signs distinguishing its from other aggregate
states of the matter. The author notes that modern experimental data about the
fireball properties are limited to make their comprehensive comparison with
plasma signatures. The author also points out the directions needed to be
studied to answer question whether the hadron matter observed in the RHIC
experiments is a color analogue of the electromagnetic plasma or not.
