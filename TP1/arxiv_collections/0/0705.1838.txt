Time evolution of the cities and of the languages is considered in terms of
multiplicative noise and fragmentation processes; where power law (Pareto-Zipf
law) and slightly asymmetric log-normal (Gauss) distribution result for the
size distribution of the cities and for that of the languages, respectively.
The cities and the languages are treated differently (and as connected; for
example, the languages split in terms of splitting the cities, etc.) and thus
two distributions are obtained in the same computation at the same time.
Evolutions of lifetimes and families for the cities and the languages are also
studied. We suggest that the regularities may be evolving out of randomness, in
terms of the relevant processes.
