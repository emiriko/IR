Number-resolving photo-detection is necessary for many quantum optics
experiments, especially in the application of entangled state preparation.
Several schemes have been proposed for approximating number-resolving
photo-detection using non-number-resolving detectors. Such techniques include
multi-port detection and time-division multiplexing. We provide a detailed
analysis and comparison of different number-resolving detection schemes, with a
view to creating a useful reference for experimentalists. We show that the
ideal architecture for projective measurements is a function of the detector's
dark count and efficiency parameters. We also describe a process for selecting
an appropriate topology given actual experimental component parameters.
