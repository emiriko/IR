In a previous paper (Gavignaud et al. 2006), we presented the type-1 Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN) sample obtained from the first epoch data of the
VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey (VVDS). The sample consists of 130 faint, broad-line AGN
with redshift up to z=5 and 17.5< I <24.0, selected on the basis of their
spectra. In this paper we present the measurement of the Optical Luminosity
Function up to z=3.6 derived from this sample, we compare our results with
previous results from brighter samples both at low and at high redshift. Our
data, more than one magnitude fainter than previous optical surveys, allow us
to constrain the faint part of the luminosity function up to high redshift. By
combining our faint VVDS sample with the large sample of bright AGN extracted
from the SDSS DR3 (Richards et al., 2006b) and testing a number of different
evolutionary models, we find that the model which better represents the
combined luminosity functions, over a wide range of redshift and luminosity, is
a luminosity dependent density evolution (LDDE) model, similar to those derived
from the major X-surveys. Such a parameterization allows the redshift of the
AGN space density peak to change as a function of luminosity and explains the
excess of faint AGN that we find at 1.0< z <1.5. On the basis of this model we
find, for the first time from the analysis of optically selected samples, that
the peak of the AGN space density shifts significantly towards lower redshift
going to lower luminosity objects. This result, already found in a number of
X-ray selected samples of AGN, is consistent with a scenario of "AGN cosmic
downsizing", in which the density of more luminous AGN, possibly associated to
more massive black holes, peaks earlier in the history of the Universe, than
that of low luminosity ones.
