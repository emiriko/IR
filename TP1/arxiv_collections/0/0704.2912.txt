In distinction to the Neumann case the squeezing limit of a Dirichlet network
leads in the threshold region generically to a quantum graph with disconnected
edges, exceptions may come from threshold resonances. Our main point in this
paper is to show that modifying locally the geometry we can achieve in the
limit a nontrivial coupling between the edges including, in particular, the
class of $\delta$-type boundary conditions. We work out an illustration of this
claim in the simplest case when a bent waveguide is squeezed.
