Virtualization became recently a hot topic once again, after being dormant
for more than twenty years. In the meantime, it has been almost forgotten, that
virtual machines are not so perfect isolating environments as it seems, when
looking at the principles. These lessons were already learnt earlier when the
first virtualized systems have been exposed to real life usage.
  Contemporary virtualization software enables instant creation and destruction
of virtual machines on a host, live migration from one host to another,
execution history manipulation, etc. These features are very useful in
practice, but also causing headaches among security specialists, especially in
current hostile network environments.
  In the present contribution we discuss the principles, potential benefits and
risks of virtualization in a deja vu perspective, related to previous
experiences with virtualization in the mainframe era.
