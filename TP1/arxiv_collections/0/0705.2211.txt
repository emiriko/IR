Berry phases and the quantum-information theoretic notion of fidelity have
been recently used to analyze quantum phase transitions from a geometrical
perspective. In this paper we unify these two approaches showing that the
underlying mechanism is the critical singular behavior of a complex tensor over
the Hamiltonian parameter space. This is achieved by performing a scaling
analysis of this quantum geometric tensor in the vicinity of the critical
points. In this way most of the previous results are understood on general
grounds and new ones are found. We show that criticality is not a sufficient
condition to ensure superextensive divergence of the geometric tensor, and
state the conditions under which this is possible. The validity of this
analysis is further checked by exact diagonalization of the spin-1/2 XXZ
Heisenberg chain.
