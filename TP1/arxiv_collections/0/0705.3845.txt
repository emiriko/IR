The BSSN (Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura) formulation of the Einstein
evolution equations is written in spherical symmetry. These equations can be
used to address a number of technical and conceptual issues in numerical
relativity in the context of a single Schwarzschild black hole. One of the
benefits of spherical symmetry is that the numerical grid points can be tracked
on a Kruskal--Szekeres diagram. Boundary conditions suitable for puncture
evolution of a Schwarzschild black hole are presented. Several results are
shown for puncture evolution using a fourth--order finite difference
implementation of the equations.
