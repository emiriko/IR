The min-sum (MS) algorithm is arguably the second most fundamental algorithm
in the realm of message passing due to its optimality (for a tree code) with
respect to the {\em block error} probability \cite{Wiberg}. There also seems to
be a fundamental relationship of MS decoding with the linear programming
decoder \cite{Koetter}. Despite its importance, its fundamental properties have
not nearly been studied as well as those of the sum-product (also known as BP)
algorithm.
  We address two questions related to the MS rule. First, we characterize the
stability condition under MS decoding. It turns out to be essentially the same
condition as under BP decoding. Second, we perform a degree distribution
optimization. Contrary to the case of BP decoding, under MS decoding the
thresholds of the best degree distributions for standard irregular LDPC
ensembles are significantly bounded away from the Shannon threshold. More
precisely, on the AWGN channel, for the best codes that we find, the gap to
capacity is 1dB for a rate 0.3 code and it is 0.4dB when the rate is 0.9 (the
gap decreases monotonically as we increase the rate).
  We also used the optimization procedure to design codes for modified MS
algorithm where the output of the check node is scaled by a constant
$1/\alpha$. For $\alpha = 1.25$, we observed that the gap to capacity was
lesser for the modified MS algorithm when compared with the MS algorithm.
However, it was still quite large, varying from 0.75 dB to 0.2 dB for rates
between 0.3 and 0.9.
  We conclude by posing what we consider to be the most important open
questions related to the MS algorithm.
