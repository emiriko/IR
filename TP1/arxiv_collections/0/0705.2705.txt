Strangeness and multi-strangeness particles production can be used to explore
the initial transient field fluctuations in heavy ion collisions. We emphasize
the role played by Junction anti-Junction (JJbar) loops and strong color
electric fields (SCF) in these collisions. Transient field fluctuations of SCF
on the baryon production in central (0-5%) Pb+Pb collisions at nucleon-nucleon
centre of mass energy of 5.5 TeV will be discussed in the framework of
HIJING/BBbar v2.0 model, looking in particular to the predicted evolution of
nuclear modification factors R_AA from RHIC to LHC energies. Our results
indicate the importance of a good description of the baseline elementary p+p
collisions at this energy.
