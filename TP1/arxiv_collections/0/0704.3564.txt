For the BCS equation with local two-body interaction $\lambda V(x)$, we give
a rigorous analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the critical temperature as
$\lambda \to 0$. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on $V(x)$ for
the existence of a non-trivial solution for all values of $\lambda>0$.
