In the stripe-ordered state of a strongly-correlated two-dimensional
electronic system, under a set of special circumstances, the superconducting
condensate, like the magnetic order, can occur at a non-zero wave-vector
corresponding to a spatial period double that of the charge order. In this
case, the Josephson coupling between near neighbor planes, especially in a
crystal with the special structure of La_{2-x}Ba_xCuO_4, vanishes identically.
We propose that this is the underlying cause of the dynamical decoupling of the
layers recently observed in transport measurements at x=1/8.
