The ATLAS experiment at the LHC is building several detector systems for
forward physics studies and to determine the luminosity. The main forward
systems consist of a Cerenkov detector called LUCID, a Zero Degree Calorimeter
(ZDC) and Roman Pots which will house a scintillating fiber tracker system
called ALFA. Here we report some of the forward physics activities that are
foreseen in ATLAS together with the status of the related detector systems.
