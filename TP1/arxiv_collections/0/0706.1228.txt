The interferometry of single-photon pulses has been used to implement quantum
technology systems, like quantum key distribution, interaction-free measurement
and some other quantum communication protocols. In most of these
implementations, Mach-Zehnder, Michelson and Fabry-Perot interferometers are
the most used. In this work we present optical setups for interaction-free
measurement, quantum key distribution and quantum secret sharing using the
Sagnac interferometer. The proposed setups are described as well the quantum
protocols using them are explained.
