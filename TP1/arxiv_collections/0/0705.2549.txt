In this paper, we address the problem of discriminating two given quantum
operations. Firstly, based on the Bloch representation of single qubit systems,
we give the exact minimum error probability of discriminating two single qubit
quantum operations by unentangled input states. In particular, for the Pauli
channels discussed in [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 71}, 062340 (2005)], we use a more
intuitional and visual method to deal with their discrimination problem.
Secondly, we consider the condition for perfect discrimination of two quantum
operations. Specially, we get that two generalized Pauli channels are perfectly
distinguishable if and only if their characteristic vectors are orthogonal.
