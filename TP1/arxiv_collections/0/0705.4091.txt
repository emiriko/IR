The centre of our galaxy hosts the nearest super-massive black hole to the
solar system, identified to the compact radio source Sgr A*. High energy
experiments have tried in the past to detect the X/gamma-ray emission expected
from the accretion of the surrounding material into this super-massive black
hole. Only recently however, thanks to the new generation of telescopes, it has
been possible to reveal high energy radiation associated with Sgr A* or its
close environment. I will review and discuss in particular the results on the
Sgr A* X-ray flares discovered with Chandra and XMM-Newton, on the central soft
gamma-ray source detected with INTEGRAL and on the galactic centre TeV emission
revealed by HESS.
