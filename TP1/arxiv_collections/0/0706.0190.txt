We study the quantum properties and gravitational field of a system that has
oscillations in time. Treating time as a dynamical variable, we first construct
a wave with 4-vector amplitude that has matters vibrating in space and time. By
analyzing its Hamiltonian density equation, we find that such system shall be
treated as a quantized field. This quantized real scalar field obeys the
Klein-Gordon equation and has properties resemble a zero spin bosonic field. In
addition, the particle observed has oscillation in proper time. By neglecting
all quantum effects and assuming the particle as a classical object that can
remain stationary in space, we show that the spacetime geometry around the
proper time oscillation has properties similar to the Schwarzschild
gravitational field of a point mass in relativity.
