In this work, the spin dynamics of a single electron under parametric
modulation of a lateral quantum dot's electrostatic potential in the presence
of spin-orbit coupling is investigated. Numerical and theoretical calculations
demonstrate that, by squeezing and/or moving the electron's wave function, spin
rotations with Rabi frequencies on the order of tens of megahertz can be
achieved with experimentally accessible parameters in both parabolic and square
lateral quantum dots. Applications of parametric excitations for determining
spin-orbit coupling parameters and for increasing the spin polarization in the
electronic ground are demonstrated.
