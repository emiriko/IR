We use a recently proved fluctuation theorem for the currents to develop the
response theory of nonequilibrium phenomena. In this framework, expressions for
the response coefficients of the currents at arbitrary orders in the
thermodynamic forces or affinities are obtained in terms of the fluctuations of
the cumulative currents and remarkable relations are obtained which are the
consequences of microreversibility beyond Onsager reciprocity relations.
