When many fundamental strings are stacked together, they puff up into
D-branes. BIons and giant gravitons are the examples of such D-brane
configurations that arise from coincident strings. We propose and demonstrate
analogous transitions in topological string theory. Such transitions can also
be understood in terms of the Fourier transform of D-brane amplitudes.
