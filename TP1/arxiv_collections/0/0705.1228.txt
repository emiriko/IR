We show that classical electrodynamics of massless charged particles and the
Yang--Mills theory of massless quarks do not experience rearranging their
initial degrees of freedom into dressed particles and radiation. Massless
particles do not radiate. We consider a version of the direct interparticle
action theory for these systems following the general strategy of Wheeler and
Feynman.
