We analyze Regge trajectories in terms of the $1/N_c$ expansion of QCD.
Neglecting spin-orbit contributions to the large $N_c$ baryon mass operator, we
consider the evolution of the spin-flavor singlet component of the masses with
respect to the angular momentum. We find two distinct and remarkably linear
Regge trajectories for symmetric and for mixed symmetric spin-flavor
multiplets.
