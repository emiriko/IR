The approach exposed in the recent paper (A. Shebeko, P. Papakonstantinou, E.
Mavrommatis, Eur. Phys. J. A 27, 143 (2006)) has been applied in studying
center-of-mass motion effects on the nucleon density and momentum distributions
in nuclei. We are focused upon effects due to the center-of-mass and
short-range nucleon correlations embedded in translationally invariant
ground-state wavefunctions. The latter are constructed in the so-called fixed
center-of-mass approximation, starting with a Slater determinant wave function
modified by some correlator (e.g., after Jastrow or Villars). It is shown how
one can simplify evaluation of the corresponding expectation values that
determine the distributions. The analytic expressions derived here involve the
own "Tassie-Barker" factors for each distribution. As an illustration,
numerical calculations have been carried out for the nucleus ^{4}He with the
Slater determinant to describe the nucleon (1s)^4 configuration composed of
single-particle orbitals which differ from harmonic oscillator ones at small
distances. Such orbitals simulate somewhat short-range repulsion between
nucleons. Special attention is paid to a simultaneous shrinking of the
center--of--mass corrected density and momentum distributions compared to the
purely (1s)^4 shell nontranslationally invariant ones.
