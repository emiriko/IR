We propose an information reconciliation protocol that uses two-way classical
communication. In the case of the BB84 protocol and the six-state protocol, the
key rates of the quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols that use our proposed
information reconciliation protocol are higher than previously known protocols
for wide range of error rates. We also clarify the relation between the
proposed protocol and known QKD protocols, and the relation between the
proposed protocol and entanglement distillation protocols (EDPs).
