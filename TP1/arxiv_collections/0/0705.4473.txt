We calculate the two-point correlation function <x(t2)x(t1)> for a
subdiffusive continuous time random walk in a parabolic potential, generalizing
well-known results for the single-time statistics to two times. A closed
analytical expression is found for initial equilibrium, revealing a clear
deviation from a Mittag-Leffler decay.
