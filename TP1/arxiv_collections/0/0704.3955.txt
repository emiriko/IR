We present here a detailed study of the behaviour of a three dimensional
Brownian motor based on cold atoms in a double optical lattice [P. Sjolund et
al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 190602 (2006)]. This includes both experiments and
numerical simulations of a Brownian particle. The potentials used are spatially
and temporally symmetric, but combined spatiotemporal symmetry is broken by
phase shifts and asymmetric transfer rates between potentials. The diffusion of
atoms in the optical lattices is rectified and controlled both in direction and
speed along three dimensions. We explore a large range of experimental
parameters, where irradiances and detunings of the optical lattice lights are
varied within the dissipative regime. Induced drift velocities in the order of
one atomic recoil velocity have been achieved.
