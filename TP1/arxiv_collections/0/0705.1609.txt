We propose a program for finding the cyclicity of period annuli of quadratic
systems with centers of genus one. As a first step, we classify all such
systems and determine the essential one-parameter quadratic perturbations which
produce the maximal number of limit cycles. We compute the associated
Poincare-Pontryagin-Melnikov functions whose zeros control the number of limit
cycles. To illustrate our approach, we determine the cyclicity of the annuli of
two particular reversible systems.
