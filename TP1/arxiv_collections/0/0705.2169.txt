A supersymmetric extension of the dynamical symmetry group $Sp^{B}(12,R)$ of
the Interacting Vector Boson Model (IVBM), to the orthosymplectic group
$OSp(2\Omega/12,R)$ is developed in order to incorporate fermion degrees of
freedom into the nuclear dynamics and to encompass the treatment of odd mass
nuclei. The bosonic sector of the supergroup is used to describe the complex
collective spectra of the neighboring even-even nuclei and is considered as a
core structure of the odd nucleus. The fermionic sector is represented by the
fermion spin group $SO^{F}(2\Omega)\supset SU^{F}(2)$.
  The so obtained, new exactly solvable limiting case is applied for the
description of the nuclear collective spectra of odd mass nuclei. The
theoretical predictions for different collective bands in three odd mass
nuclei, namely $^{157}Gd$, $^{173}Yb$ and $^{163}Dy$ from rare earth region are
compared with the experiment. The $B(E2)$ transition probabilities for the
$^{157}Gd$ and $^{163}Dy$ between the states of the ground band are also
studied. The important role of the symplectic structure of the model for the
proper reproduction of the $B(E2)$ behavior is revealed. The obtained results
reveal the applicability of the models extension.
