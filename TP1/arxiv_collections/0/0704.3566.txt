Biquadratic {\it antisymmetric} exchange terms of the form $ - [C_{ij}
e^{\alpha}_{ij}({\bf s}_i\times{\bf s}_j)_z]^2$, where ${\bf e}_{ij}$ is the
unit vector connecting sites $i$ and $j$ and $\alpha = x,y$, due partially to
magnetoelectric coupling effects, are shown to be responsible for the spin-flop
helical phase in CuFeO$_2$ at low magnetic field and temperature. Usual
biquadratic {\it symmetric} exchange, likely due to magnetoelastic coupling, is
found to support the stability of axial magnetic states at higher fields in
this nearly-Heisenberg like stacked triangular antiferromagnet. A model
Hamiltonian which also includes substantial interplane and higher-neighbor
intraplane exchange interactions, reproduces the unique series of observed
commensurate and incommensurate periodicity phases with increasing applied
magnetic field in this highly frustrated system. The magnetic field-temperature
phase diagram is discussed in terms of a Landau-type free energy.
