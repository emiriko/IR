Both the highest- and the linear temperature dependence of the resistivity in
wide temperature range appear at the optimally doped regions of Cu-based
superconductors1,2,3,4,5, and the highest- of Fe-based superconductors6,7 are
also associated with the linear temperature dependence of the resistivity in
normal states near superconducting states. This means that the high temperature
superconductivity and the linear temperature dependence of the resistivity
should be dominated by the same mechanism. This letter on theoretic calculation
clearly shows that strong spin-charge correlation dominated resistivity behaves
the linear temperature dependence, thus high-temperature superconductivity
should be induced by strong spin-charge correlation.
