Digital linear filters are used in a variety of applications (sound
treatment, control/command, etc.), implemented in software, in hardware, or a
combination thereof. For safety-critical applications, it is necessary to bound
all variables and outputs of all filters. We give a compositional, effective
abstraction for digital linear filters expressed as block diagrams, yielding
sound, precise bounds for fixed-point or floating-point implementations of the
filters.
