The formation of long-lasting structures at the surfaces of stars is commonly
ascribed to the action of strong magnetic fields. This paradigm is supported by
observations of evolving cool spots in the Sun and active late-type stars, and
stationary chemical spots in the early-type magnetic stars. However, results of
our seven-year monitoring of mercury spots in non-magnetic early-type star
alpha Andromedae show that the picture of magnetically-driven structure
formation is fundamentally incomplete. Using an indirect stellar surface
mapping technique, we construct a series of 2-D images of starspots and
discover a secular evolution of the mercury cloud cover in this star. This
remarkable structure formation process, observed for the first time in any
star, is plausibly attributed to a non-equilibrium, dynamical evolution of the
heavy-element clouds created by atomic diffusion and may have the same
underlying physics as the weather patterns on terrestrial and giant planets.
