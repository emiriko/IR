The new requirement for "collaboration" between multidisciplinary
collaborators induces to exchange and share adequate information on the
product, processes throughout the products' lifecycle. Thus, effective capture
of information, and also its extraction, recording, exchange, sharing, and
reuse become increasingly critical. These lead companies to adopt new improved
methodologies in managing the exchange and sharing of information. The aim of
this paper is to describe a collaborative framework system to exchange and
share information, which is based on: (i) The Product Process Collaboration
Organization model (PPCO) which defines product and process information, and
the various collaboration methods for the organizations involved in the supply
chain. (ii) Viewpoint model describes relationships between each actor and the
comprehensive Product/Process model, defining each actor's "domain of interest"
within the evolving product definition. (iii) A layer which defines the
comprehensive organization and collaboration relationships between the actors
within the supply chain. (iv) Based on the above relationships, the last layer
proposes a typology of exchanged messages. A communication method, based on
XML, is developed that supports optimal exchange/sharing of information. To
illustrate the proposed framework system, an example is presented related to
collaborative design of a new piston for an automotive engine. The focus is on
user-viewpoint integration to ensure that the adequate information is retrieved
from the PPCO.
