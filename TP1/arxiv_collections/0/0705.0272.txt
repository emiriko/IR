We present a search for the near infrared spectroscopic signature of the
close orbiting extrasolar giant planet HD 75289b. We obtained ~230 spectra in
the wavelength range 2.18 - 2.19 microns using the Phoenix spectrograph at
Gemini South. By considering the direct spectrum, derived from irradiated model
atmospheres, we search for the absorption profile signature present in the
combined star and planet light. Since the planetary spectrum is separated from
the stellar spectrum at most phases, we apply a phase dependent orbital model
and tomographic techniques to search for absorption signatures.
  Because the absorption signature lies buried in the noise of a single
exposure we apply a multiline deconvolution to the spectral lines available in
order to boost the effective S/N ratio of the data. The wavelength coverage of
80 angstroms is expected to contain ~100 planetary lines, enabling a mean line
with S/N ratio of ~800 to be achieved after deconvolution. We are nevertheless
unable to detect the presence of the planet in the data and carry out further
simulations to show that broader wavelength coverage should enable a planet
like HD 75289b to be detected with 99.9 per cent (4 sigma) confidence. We
investigate the sensitivity of our method and estimate detection tolerances for
mismatches between observed and model planetary atmospheres.
