Results of resonance particle production measured at RHIC in $\sqrt{s_{\rm
NN}} = $ 200 GeV Au+Au collisions are compared to measurements in p+p and d+Au
collisions in order to verify the existence of an extended hardronically
interacting medium. Yield and momentum distributions of resonances maybe
modified during the fireball lifetime due to resonance decay and the subsequent
rescattering of their decay daughters as well as the regeneration of resonances
from their decay products. Modified momentum spectra in heavy ion collisions
may change the nuclear modification factor R$_{\rm AA}$. The influence on the
elliptic flow v$_{2}$ due to late regeneration of resonances is discussed.
