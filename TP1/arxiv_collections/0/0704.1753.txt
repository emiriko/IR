We generalize the relativistic flux tube model for arbitrary two- or
three-body systems. The spin-independent and spin-dependent contributions of
the flux tube to the total Hamiltonian are computed in perturbation. In
particular, we show that the spin-dependent part exhibits a universal
spin-orbit form: It does not depend on the nature of the confined particles.
The general equations we present, being well-defined for light particles, can
thus be applied to usual as well as exotic hadrons such as hybrid mesons and
glueballs.
