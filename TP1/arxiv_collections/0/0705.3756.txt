The purpose of this paper is to describe the relation between the Legendre
and the Lenstra constants. Indeed we show that they are equal whenever the
Legendre constant exists; in particular, this holds for both Rosen continued
fractions and $\alpha$-continued fractions. We also give the explicit value of
the entropy of the Rosen map with respect to the absolutely continuous
invariant probability measure.
