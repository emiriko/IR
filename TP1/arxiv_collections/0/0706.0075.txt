We consider an hierarchy of integrable 1+2-dimensional equations related to
Lie algebra of the vector fields on the line. The solutions in quadratures are
constructed depending on $n$ arbitrary functions of one argument. The most
interesting result is the simple equation for the generating function of the
hierarchy which defines the dynamics for the negative times and also has
applications to the second order spectral problems. A rather general theory of
integrable 1+1-dimensional equations can be developed by study of polynomial
solutions of this equation under condition of regularity of the corresponding
potentials.
