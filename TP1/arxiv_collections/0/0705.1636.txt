We present here the current performances of the AMBER / VLTI instrument for
standard use and compare these with the offered modes of the instrument. We
show that the instrument is able to reach its specified precision only for
medium and high spectral resolution modes, differential observables and bright
objects. For absolute observables, the current achievable accuracy is strongly
limited by the vibrations of the Unit Telescopes, and also by the observing
procedure which does not take into account the night-long transfer function
monitoring. For low-resolution mode, the current limitation is more in the data
reduction side, since several effects negligible at medium spectral resolution
are not taken into account in the current pipeline. Finally, for faint objects
(SNR around 1 per spectral channel), electromagnetic interferences in the VLTI
interferometric laboratory with the detector electronics prevents currently to
get unbiased measurements. Ideas are under study to correct in the data
processing side this effect, but a hardware fix should be investigated
seriously since it limits seriously the effective limiting magnitude of the
instrument.
