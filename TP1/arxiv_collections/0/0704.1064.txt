The anisotropic XXZ spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain is studied using
renormalization-group theory. The specific heats and nearest-neighbor spin-spin
correlations are calculated thoughout the entire temperature and anisotropy
ranges in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regions, obtaining a global
description and quantitative results. We obtain, for all anisotropies, the
antiferromagnetic spin-liquid spin-wave velocity and the Isinglike
ferromagnetic excitation spectrum gap, exhibiting the spin-wave to spinon
crossover. A number of characteristics of purely quantum nature are found: The
in-plane interaction s_i^x s_j^x + s_i^y s_j^y induces an antiferromagnetic
correlation in the out-of-plane s_i^z component, at higher temperatures in the
antiferromagnetic XXZ chain, dominantly at low temperatures in the
ferromagnetic XXZ chain, and, in-between, at all temperatures in the XY chain.
We find that the converse effect also occurs in the antiferromagnetic XXZ
chain: an antiferromagnetic s_i^z s_j^z interaction induces a correlation in
the s_i^xy component. As another purely quantum effect, (i) in the
antiferromagnet, the value of the specific heat peak is insensitive to
anisotropy and the temperature of the specific heat peak decreases from the
isotropic (Heisenberg) with introduction of either type (Ising or XY)
anisotropy; (ii) in complete contrast, in the ferromagnet, the value and
temperature of the specific heat peak increase with either type of anisotropy.
