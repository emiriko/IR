We report preliminary results of AKARI observations of two globular clusters,
NGC104 and NGC362. Imaging data covering areas of about 10x10 arcmin^2 centered
on the two clusters have been obtained with InfraRed Camera (IRC) at 2.4, 3.2,
4.1, 7.0, 9.0, 11.0, 15.0, 18.0 and 24.0 mu. We used F11/F2 and F24/F7 flux
ratios as diagnostics of circumstellar dust emission. Dust emissions are mainly
detected from variable stars obviously on the asymptotic giant branch, but some
variable stars that reside below the tip of the first-ascending giant branch
also show dust emissions. We found eight red sources with F24/F7 ratio greater
than unity in NGC362. Six out of the eight have no 2MASS counterparts. However,
we found no such source in NGC104.
