We introduce a procedure developed by the ``Teramo Stellar Populations
Tools'' group (Teramo-SPoT), specifically optimized to obtain realistic
simulations of CCD images of elliptical galaxies.
  Particular attention is devoted to include the Surface Brightness Fluctuation
(SBF) signal observed in ellipticals and to simulate the Globular Cluster (GC)
system in the galaxy, and the distribution of background galaxies present in
real CCD frames. In addition to the physical properties of the simulated
objects - galaxy distance and brightness profile, luminosity function of GC and
background galaxies, etc. - the tool presented allows the user to set some of
the main instrumental properties - FoV, zero point magnitude, exposure time,
etc.
