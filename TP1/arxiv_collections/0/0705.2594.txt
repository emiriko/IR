Molecular spiders are synthetic bio-molecular systems which have "legs" made
of short single-stranded segments of DNA. Spiders move on a surface covered
with single-stranded DNA segments complementary to legs. Different mappings are
established between various models of spiders and simple exclusion processes.
For spiders with simple gait and varying number of legs we compute the
diffusion coefficient; when the hopping is biased we also compute their
velocity.
