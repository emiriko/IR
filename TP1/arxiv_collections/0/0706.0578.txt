Systems of polynomial equations over the complex or real numbers can be used
to model combinatorial problems. In this way, a combinatorial problem is
feasible (e.g. a graph is 3-colorable, hamiltonian, etc.) if and only if a
related system of polynomial equations has a solution. In the first part of
this paper, we construct new polynomial encodings for the problems of finding
in a graph its longest cycle, the largest planar subgraph, the edge-chromatic
number, or the largest k-colorable subgraph.
  For an infeasible polynomial system, the (complex) Hilbert Nullstellensatz
gives a certificate that the associated combinatorial problem is infeasible.
Thus, unless P = NP, there must exist an infinite sequence of infeasible
instances of each hard combinatorial problem for which the minimum degree of a
Hilbert Nullstellensatz certificate of the associated polynomial system grows.
  We show that the minimum-degree of a Nullstellensatz certificate for the
non-existence of a stable set of size greater than the stability number of the
graph is the stability number of the graph. Moreover, such a certificate
contains at least one term per stable set of G. In contrast, for non-3-
colorability, we found only graphs with Nullstellensatz certificates of degree
four.
