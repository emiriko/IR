The article is devoted to the investigation of groups of diffeomorphisms and
loops of manifolds over ultra-metric fields of zero and positive
characteristics. Different types of topologies are considered on groups of
loops and diffeomorphisms relative to which they are generalized Lie groups or
topological groups. Among such topologies pairwise incomparable are found as
well. Topological perfectness of the diffeomorphism group relative to certain
topologies is studied. There are proved theorems about projective limit
decompositions of these groups and their compactifications for compact
manifolds. Moreover, an existence of one-parameter local subgroups of
diffeomorphism groups is investigated.
