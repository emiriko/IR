We construct a Hamiltonian formulation for the class of plane-fronted
gravitational waves with parallel rays (pp-waves). Because of the existence of
a light-like Killing vector, the dynamics is effectively reduced to a 2+1
evolution with "time" chosen to be light-like. In spite of the vanishing action
this allows us to geometrically identify a symplectic form as well as dynamical
Hamiltonian, thus casting the system into canonical form.
