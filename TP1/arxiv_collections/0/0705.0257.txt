We show theoretically that graphene, which exhibits a massless Dirac like
spectrum for its electrons, can exhibit unconventional Kondo effect that can be
tuned by an experimentally controllable applied gate voltage. We demonstrate
the presence of a finite critical Kondo coupling strength in neutral graphene.
We discuss the possibility of multichannel Kondo effect in this system which
might lead to a non-Fermi liquid like ground state and provide a discussion of
possible experimental realization of Kondo phenomenon in graphene.
