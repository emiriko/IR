We present two new continuous time quantum search algorithms similar to the
adiabatic search algorithm, but now without an adiabatic evolution. We find
that both algorithms work for a wide range of values of the parameters of the
Hamiltonian, and one of them has, as an additional feature that, for values of
time larger than a characteristic one, it will converge to a state which can be
close to the searched state.
