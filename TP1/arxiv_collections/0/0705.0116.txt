This document reports on a series of experimental and theoretical studies
conducted to assess the astro-particle physics potential of three future
large-scale particle detectors proposed in Europe as next generation
underground observatories. The proposed apparatus employ three different and,
to some extent, complementary detection techniques: GLACIER (liquid Argon TPC),
LENA (liquid scintillator) and MEMPHYS (\WC), based on the use of large mass of
liquids as active detection media. The results of these studies are presented
along with a critical discussion of the performance attainable by the three
proposed approaches coupled to existing or planned underground laboratories, in
relation to open and outstanding physics issues such as the search for matter
instability, the detection of astrophysical- and geo-neutrinos and to the
possible use of these detectors in future high-intensity neutrino beams.
