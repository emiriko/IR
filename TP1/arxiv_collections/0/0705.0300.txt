The Walecka many-body field theory is investigated in the context of quantum
nonextensive statistical mechanics, characterized by a dimensionless parameter
$q$. We consider nuclear matter described statistically by a power-law
distribution which generalizes the standard Fermi-Dirac distribution ($q = 1$).
We show that the scalar and vector meson fields become more intense due to the
nonextensive effects ($q \neq 1$). From a numerical treatment, we also show
that as the nonextensive parameter $q$ increases, the nucleon effective mass
diminishes and the equation of state becomes stiffer. Finally, the usual
Maxwell construction seems not to be necessary for isotherms with temperatures
in the range 14 Mev$<k_BT<$20 MeV.
