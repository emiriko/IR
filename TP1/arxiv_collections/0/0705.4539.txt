In this paper, we first construct a Lie algebra $L$ from rank 3 quantum
torus, and show that it is isomorphic to the core of EALAs of type $A_1$ with
coordinates in rank 2 quantum torus. Then we construct two classes of
irreducible ${\bf Z}$-graded highest weight representations, and give the
necessary and sufficient conditions for these representations to be
quasifinite. Next, we prove that they exhaust all the generalized highest
weight irreducible ${\bf Z}$-graded quasifinite representations. As a
consequence, we determine all the irreducible ${\bf Z}$-graded quasifinite
representations with nonzero central charges. Finally, we construct two classes
of highest weight ${\bf Z}^2$-graded quasifinite representations by using these
${\bf Z}$-graded modules.
