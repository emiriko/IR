We resolve the photokinetic rates enhancement of Rhodamine 6G molecules
diffusing in a water-glycerol mixture within a single nanometric aperture
milled in an opaque aluminium film. Combining fluorescence correlation
spectroscopy and lifetime measurements, we report the relative influence of
excitation, radiative and non-radiative decay in the fluorescence process,
giving a detailed description of the physics behind the overall 15 fold
enhancement of the average fluorescence rate per molecule. This procedure is
broadly adaptable to a wide range of nanostructures.
