We present a new code generator, called O'Jacare.net, to inter-operate
between C# and Objective Caml through their object models. O'Jacare.net defines
a basic IDL (Interface Definition Language) that describes classes and
interfaces in order to communicate between Objective Caml and C#. O'Jacare.net
generates all needed wrapper classes and takes advantage of static type
checking in both worlds. Although the IDL intersects these two object models,
O'Jacare.net allows to combine features from both.
