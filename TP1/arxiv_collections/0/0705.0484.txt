The calculation of conserved charges of black holes is a rich problem, for
which many methods are known. Until recently, there was some controversy on the
proper definition of conserved charges in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS)
spaces in arbitrary dimensions. This paper provides a systematic and explicit
Hamiltonian derivation of the energy and the angular momenta of both
asymptotically flat and asymptotically AdS spacetimes in any dimension D bigger
or equal to 4. This requires as a first step a precise determination of the
asymptotic conditions of the metric and of its conjugate momentum. These
conditions happen to be achieved in ellipsoidal coordinates adapted to the
rotating solutions.The asymptotic symmetry algebra is found to be isomorphic
either to the Poincare algebra or to the so(D-1, 2) algebra, as expected. In
the asymptotically flat case, the boundary conditions involve a generalization
of the parity conditions, introduced by Regge and Teitelboim, which are
necessary to make the angular momenta finite. The charges are explicitly
computed for Kerr and Kerr-AdS black holes for arbitrary D and they are shown
to be in agreement with thermodynamical arguments.
