Far-infrared (IR) images of the nearby Sb galaxy NGC2841 and the Sc galaxy
NGC2976 at wavelengths of 65, 90, 140, and 160 um have been obtained with the
Far-Infrared Surveyor (FIS) onboard AKARI. Both galaxies reveal similar
morphologies of dust rings. They are, however, significantly different in the
dust temperature: a cold (21 K) ring for NGC2841 and a warm (30 K) ring for
NGC2976, which presumably reflects the difference in the origin of the ring
structure for the different Hubble type of the galaxy. In addition to the dust
ring structure, a warm dust component is detected from the central region of
NGC2841, which may be attributed to the heating by its Low-Ionization Nuclear
Emission-line Region nucleus. As for NGC2976, an extended dust component is
observed along the minor axis, which shows a distribution somewhat asymmetrical
to the galactic disk; this might be associated with the HI bridge in the
M81/M82 group that NGC2976 belongs to. By taking advantage of a wealth of the
far-IR bands of the FIS, it is demonstrated that the spectral energy
distribution of NGC2841 is spatially more variable than that of NGC2976.
