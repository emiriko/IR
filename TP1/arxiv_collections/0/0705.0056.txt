From an N=1 supersymmetric electric gauge theory with the gauge group SU(N_c)
x SU(N_c') with fundamentals for each gauge group, the bifundamentals and a
symmetric flavor and a conjugate symmetric flavor for SU(N_c), we apply Seiberg
dual to each gauge group independently and obtain two N=1 supersymmetric dual
magnetic gauge theories with dual matters including the gauge singlets. By
analyzing the F-term equations of the dual magnetic superpotentials, we
describe the intersecting brane configurations of type IIA string theory
corresponding to the meta-stable nonsupersymmetric vacua of these gauge
theories. The case where the above symmetric flavor is replaced by an
antisymmetric flavor is also discussed.
