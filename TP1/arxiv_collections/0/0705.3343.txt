In binary images, the distance transformation (DT) and the geometrical
skeleton extraction are classic tools for shape analysis. In this paper, we
present time optimal algorithms to solve the reverse Euclidean distance
transformation and the reversible medial axis extraction problems for
$d$-dimensional images. We also present a $d$-dimensional medial axis filtering
process that allows us to control the quality of the reconstructed shape.
