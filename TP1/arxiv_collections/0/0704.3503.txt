Usage of the Thomas-Ehrman Level Displacement formalism has been examined.
Mistakes and inconsistencies are found in several papers, being repeated in

of definitions. Full algorithms are made available, both as a {\tt FORTRAN}
source file and as a user-friendly Visual Basic executable tool, available for
download on the World Wide Web.
