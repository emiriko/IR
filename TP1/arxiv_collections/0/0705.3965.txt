Experimental and theoretical developments of the last decade in the study of
exotic atoms and some related low-energy reactions are reviewed, in order to
provide information on the in-medium hadron-nucleon t matrix over a wide range
of densities up to central nuclear densities. In particular, we review pionic
deeply bound atomic states and related evidence for partial restoration of
chiral symmetry in dense nuclear matter. The case for relatively narrow deeply
bound atomic states for antikaons and antiprotons is made, based on the physics
of strong nuclear absorption. Recent experimental suggestions for signals of
antikaon-nuclear deeply bound states are reviewed, and dynamical models for
calculating binding energies, widths and densities of antikaon nuclear states
are discussed. Specific features of low-energy in-medium interactions of kaons,
antiprotons and of Sigma hyperons are discussed, and suggestions to study
experimentally Cascade atoms are reviewed.
