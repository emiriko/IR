In this paper we describe our massively parallel version of Enzo, a
multiphysics, parallel, AMR application for simulating cosmological structure
formation developed at UCSD and Columbia. We describe its physics, numerical
algorithms, implementation, and performance on current terascale platforms. We
also discuss our future plans and some of the challenges we face as we move to
the petascale.
