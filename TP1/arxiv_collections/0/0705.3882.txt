The Einstein field equation as an equation of state of a thermodynamical
system of spacetime is reconsidered in the present Letter. We argue that a
consistent interpretation leads us to identify scalar curvature and
cosmological constant terms representing the bulk viscosity of the spacetime
fluid. Since Einstein equation itself corresponds to a near-equilibrium state
in this interpretation invoking $f(R)$ gravity for nonequilibrium
thermodynamics is not required. A logically consistent generalization to
include the effect of so called 'tidal forces' due to the Riemann curvature is
presented. A new equation of state for higher curvature gravity is derived and
its physical interpretation is discussed.
