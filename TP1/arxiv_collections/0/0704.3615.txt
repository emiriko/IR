We study quantum Darwinism -- the redundant recording of information about a
decohering system by its environment -- in zero-temperature quantum Brownian
motion. An initially nonlocal quantum state leaves a record whose redundancy
increases rapidly with its spatial extent. Significant delocalization (e.g., a
Schroedinger's Cat state) causes high redundancy: many observers can measure
the system's position without perturbing it. This explains the objective (i.e.
classical) existence of einselected, decoherence-resistant pointer states of
macroscopic objects.
