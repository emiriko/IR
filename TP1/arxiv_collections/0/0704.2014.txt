Standard game theory assumes that the structure of the game is common
knowledge among players. We relax this assumption by considering extensive
games where agents may be unaware of the complete structure of the game. In
particular, they may not be aware of moves that they and other agents can make.
We show how such games can be represented; the key idea is to describe the game
from the point of view of every agent at every node of the game tree. We
provide a generalization of Nash equilibrium and show that every game with
awareness has a generalized Nash equilibrium. Finally, we extend these results
to games with awareness of unawareness, where a player i may be aware that a
player j can make moves that i is not aware of, and to subjective games, where
payers may have no common knowledge regarding the actual game and their beliefs
are incompatible with a common prior.
