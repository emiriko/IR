The bottomonium and charmonium systems have long proved to be a rich source
of QCD physics. Recent CLEO contributions in three disparate areas are
presented: (1) the study of quark and gluon hadronization using $\Upsilon$
decays; (2) the interpretation of heavy charmonium states, including
non-$c\bar{c}$ candidates; and (3) the exploration of light quark physics using
the decays of narrow charmonium states as a well-controlled source of light
quark hadrons.
