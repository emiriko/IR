On 27 October, 2003, two GOES M-class flares occurred in the lapse of three
hours in active region NOAA 10486. The two flares were confined and their
associated brightenings appeared at the same location, displaying a very
similar shape both at the chromospheric and coronal levels. We focus on the
analysis of magnetic field (SOHO/MDI), chromospheric (HASTA, Kanzelhoehe Solar
Observatory, TRACE) and coronal (TRACE) observations. By combining our data
analysis with a model of the coronal magnetic field, we compute the magnetic
field topology associated to the two M flares. We find that both events can be
explained in terms of a localized magnetic reconnection process occurring at a
coronal magnetic null point. This null point is also present at the same
location one day later, on 28 October, 2003. Magnetic energy release at this
null point was proposed as the origin of a localized event that occurred
independently with a large X17 flare on 28 October, 2003, at 11:01 UT. The
three events, those on 27 October and the one on 28 October, are homologous.
Our results show that coronal null points can be stable topological structures
where energy release via magnetic reconnection can happen, as proposed by
classical magnetic reconnection models.
