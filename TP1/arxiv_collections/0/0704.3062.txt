First results of observations of the low mass X-ray binary Her X-1/HZ Her
performed by the INTEGRAL satellite in July-August 2005 are presented. A
significant part of one 35 day main-on state was covered. The cyclotron line in
the X-ray spectrum is well observed and its position and shape, as well as its
variability with time and phase of the 1.24 s pulsation are explored. X-ray
pulse profiles for different energy bands are studied throughout the
observation. The pulse period is found to vary on short time scales revealing a
dynamical spin-up/spin-down behavior. Results of simultaneous optical
observations of HZ Her are also discussed.
