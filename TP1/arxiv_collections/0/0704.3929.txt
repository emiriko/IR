We predict cascade hypernuclear production spectra expected in the
forthcoming J-PARC experiment. In the Green's function method of the distorted
wave impulse wave approximation with the local optimal Fermi averaging
t-matrix, we can describe the Xi production spectra in the continuum and bound
state region reasonably well. Predictions to the high resonlution spectra at
J-PARC suggest hat we should observe Xi bound state peak structure in (K-,K+)
spectra in light nuclear targets such as 12C and 27Al.
