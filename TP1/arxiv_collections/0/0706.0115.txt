In order to investigate more features of the Brans-Dicke cosmology in the
five-dimensional space-time, we explore the solutions of its dynamiacal
systems. A behavior of the universe in its early and late time by means of the
scale factor is considered. As a results, we show that it is possible to avoid
the big rip singularity and to cross the phantom divide line. Furthermore, we
review the dark energy component of the universe and its agreement with the
observation data for this 3-brane Brans Dicke cosmology by means of the
cosmological parameters.
