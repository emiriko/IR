We investigate from first principles the optoelectronic properties of
nanometer-sized armchair graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). We show that many-body
effects are essential to correctly describe both energy gaps and optical
response. As a signature of the confined geometry, we observe strongly bound
excitons dominating the optical spectra, with a clear family dependent binding
energy. Our results demonstrate that GNRs constitute 1D nanostructures whose
absorption and luminescence performance can be controlled by changing both
family and edge termination.
