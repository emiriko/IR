We present measurements on the spontaneous imbibition (capillary rise) of
water, a linear hydrocarbon (n-C16H34) and a liquid crystal (8OCB) into the
pore space of monolithic, nanoporous Vycor glass (mean pore radius 5 nm).
Measurements on the mass uptake of the porous hosts as a function of time,
m(t), are in good agreement with the Lucas-Washburn square root of time
prediction, typical of imbibition of liquids into porous hosts. The relative
capillary rise velocities scale as expected from the bulk fluid parameters.
