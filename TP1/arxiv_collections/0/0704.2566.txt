Using the method of Fukuda and Kugo \cite{FUKKUG} the continuation of
Euclidean solution is performed to the timelike axis of fourmomenta. It is
shown that assumed presence of the real simple pole in quark propagator is not
in agreement with the solution. The simple pole disappears because of the
discontinuity in the resulting quark mass function.
