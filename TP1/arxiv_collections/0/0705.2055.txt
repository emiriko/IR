The exchange bias (EB) effect was discovered 60 years ago by Meiklejohn and
Bean. Meanwhile the EB effect has become an integral part of modern magnetism
with implications for basic research and for numerous device applications. The
EB effect was the first of its kind which relates to an interface effect
between two different classes of materials, here between a ferromagnet and an
antiferromagnet. Here we review fundamental aspects of the exchange bias
effect.
