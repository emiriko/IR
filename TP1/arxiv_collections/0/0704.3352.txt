Several theories for weakly damped free-surface flows have been formulated.
In this paper we use the linear approximation to the Navier-Stokes equations to
derive a new set of equations for potential flow which include dissipation due
to viscosity. A viscous correction is added not only to the irrotational
pressure (Bernoulli's equation), but also to the kinematic boundary condition.
The nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation that one can derive from the new set
of equations to describe the modulations of weakly nonlinear, weakly damped
deep-water gravity waves turns out to be the classical damped version of the
NLS equation that has been used by many authors without rigorous justification.
