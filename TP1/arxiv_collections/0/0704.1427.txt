We consider the fluctuations of the electrical current (shot noise) in the
presence of a voltage time-modulation. For a non-interacting metal, it is known
that the derivative of the photo-assisted noise has a staircase behavior. In
the presence of Coulomb interactions, we show that the photo-assisted noise
presents a more complex profile, in particular for the two following systems:
1) a two-dimensional electron gas in the fractional quantum Hall regime for
which we have obtained evenly spaced singularities in the noise derivative,
with a spacing related to the filling factor and, 2) a carbon nanotube for
which a smoothed staircase in the noise derivative is obtained.
