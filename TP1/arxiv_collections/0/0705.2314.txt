The addition of forward proton detectors to LHC experiments will
significantly enlarge the potential for studying New Physics. A topical example
is Higgs production by the central exclusive diffractive process, pp -> p+H+p.
We discuss the exclusive production of Higgs bosons in both the SM and MSSM.
Special attention is paid to the backgrounds to the H -> bbbar signal.
