The Fermi-Watson theorem is generalized to the case of two coupled channels
with different masses and applied to final state interaction in $K_{e4}$
decays. The impact of considered effect on the phase of the $\pi\pi$ scattering
is estimated and shown that it can be crucial for scattering lengths extraction
from experimental data on $K_{e4}$ decays.
