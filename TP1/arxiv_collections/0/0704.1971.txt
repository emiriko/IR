We consider the evolution and dissipation of vortex rings in a condensate at
non-zero temperature, in the context of the classical field approximation,
based on the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. The temperature in
such a system is fully determined by the total number density and the number
density of the condensate. A vortex ring is introduced into a condensate in a
state of thermal equilibrium, and interacts with non-condensed particles. These
interactions lead to a gradual decrease in the vortex line density, until the
vortex ring completely disappears. We show that the square of the vortex line
length changes linearly with time, and obtain the corresponding universal decay
law. We relate this to mutual friction coefficients in the fundamental equation
of vortex motion in superfluids.
