Zero-knowledge proof system is an important protocol that can be used as a
basic block for construction of other more complex cryptographic protocols. An
intrinsic characteristic of a zero-knowledge systems is the assumption that is
impossible for the verifier to show to a third part that he has interacted with
the prover. However, it has been shown that using quantum correlations the
impossibility of transferring proofs can be successfully attacked. In this work
we show two new protocols for proof transference, being the first one based on
teleportation and the second one without using entangled states.
