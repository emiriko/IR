The STAR experiment at RHIC has measured identified pi(+/-), K(+/-) and
p(pbar) spectra and ratios from sqrt(s_NN) = 62.4 and 200 GeV Cu+Cu collisions.
The new Cu+Cu results are studied with hydro-motivated blast-wave and
statistical model frameworks in order to characterize the freeze-out properties
of this system. Along with measurements from Au+Au and p+p collisions, the
obtained freeze-out parameters are discussed as a function of collision energy,
system size, centrality and inferred energy density. This multi-dimensional
systematic study reveals the importance of the collision geometry and furthers
our understanding of the QCD phases.
