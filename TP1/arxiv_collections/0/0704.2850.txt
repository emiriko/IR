The ideas of dynamical complexity induced intermittent turbulence by sporadic
localized interactions of coherent structures are discussed. In particular, we
address the phenomenon of magnetic reconfiguration due to coarse-grained
dissipation as well as the interwoven connection between criticality and
multifractal processes. Specific examples are provided.
