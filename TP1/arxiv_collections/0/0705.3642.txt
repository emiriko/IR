We investigate isophotal properties and dust morphology in the nuclear
regions of 84 radio galaxies, imaged in the optical and near-infrared as part
of Hubble Space Telescope snapshot surveys. We present a sample-wide trend
between host galaxy isophotal structure and the inclination of dusty
circumnuclear disks at the centers of 13 of these objects. We find that
galaxies containing edge-on disks are invariably seen to possess boxy
isophotes, while round, face-on disks are seen exclusively in objects with
round or elliptical isophotes. Dust-rich sources with disky isophotes are
observed only to possess dust in the form of extended filamentary lanes, and
not in settled distributions like disks. As we do not expect that edge-on and
face-on disks reside in different populations of galaxies, we conclude that
perceived isophotal boxiness is dependent upon the angle at which the observer
views the host galaxy's axis of symmetry. We discuss our results in the context
of dissipative merger scenarios, and infer that dusty disks primarily reside in
old, boxy remnants of gas-poor galaxy mergers, whereas filamentary dust lanes
reside in younger disky remnants of gas-rich mergers.
