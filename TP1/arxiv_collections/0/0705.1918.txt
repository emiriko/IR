A path-integral for the t-J model in two dimensions is constructed based on
Dirac quantization, with an action found originally by Wiegmann (Phys. Rev.
Lett. {\bf 60}, 821 (1988); Nucl. Phys. B323, 311 (1989)). Concentrating on the
low doping limit, we assume short range antiferromagnetic order of the spin
degrees of freedom. Going over to a local spin quantization axis of the dopant
fermions, that follows the spin degree of freedom, staggered CP$^1$ fields
result and the constraint against double occupancy can be resolved. The
staggered CP$^1$ fields are split into slow and fast modes, such that after a
gradient expansion, and after integrating out the fast modes and the dopant
fermions, a CP$^1$ field-theory with a massive gauge field is obtained that
describes generically incommensurate coplanar magnetic structures, as discussed
previously in the context of frustrated quantum antiferromagnets. Hence, the
possibility of deconfined spinons is opened by doping a colinear
antiferromagnet.
