An experimental demonstration of a novel all-optical technique for loading
ion traps, that has particular application to microtrap architectures, is
presented. The technique is based on photo-ionisation of an atomic beam created
by pulsed laser ablation of a calcium target, and provides improved temporal
control compared to traditional trap loading methods. Ion loading rates as high
as 125 ions per second have so far been observed. Also described are
observations of trap loading where Rydberg state atoms are photo-ionised by the
ion Doppler cooling laser.
