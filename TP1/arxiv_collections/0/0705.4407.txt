We investigate hadronic unquenching effects in light quarks and mesons.
Within the non-perturbative continuum framework of Schwinger-Dyson and
Bethe-Salpeter equations we quantify the strength of the back reaction of the
pion onto the quark-gluon interaction. To this end we add a Yang-Mills part of
the interaction such that unquenched lattice results for various current quark
masses are reproduced. We find considerable effects in the quark mass function
at low momenta as well as for the chiral condensate. The quark wave function is
less affected. The Gell--Mann-Oakes-Renner relation is valid to good accuracy
up to pion masses of 400-500 MeV. As a byproduct of our investigation we verify
the Coleman theorem, that chiral symmetry cannot be broken spontaneously when
QCD is reduced to 1+1 dimensions.
