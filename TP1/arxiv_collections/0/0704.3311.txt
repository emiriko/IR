The branching ratios and photon spectra of the rare processes rho(omega)->
pi^0 pi^0 gamma, rho(omega) -> eta pi^0 gamma are calculated in the framework
of the standard local quark Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. Three types of
diagrams are considered: the quark box and the pole diagrams with scalar
(sigma,a_0(980)) and vector (rho,omega) mesons. The obtained estimations for
the widths of the processes rho(omega)-> pi^0 pi^0 gamma are in satisfactory
agreement with existing experimental data. Predictions are made for the widths
of the processes rho(omega) -> eta pi^0 gamma.
