We present cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters aimed
at studying the process of metal enrichment of the intra--cluster medium (ICM).
These simulations have been performed by implementing a detailed model of
chemical evolution in the Tree-SPH \gd code. This model allows us to follow the
metal release from SNII, SNIa and AGB stars, by properly accounting for the
lifetimes of stars of different mass, as well as to change the stellar initial
mass function (IMF), the lifetime function and the stellar yields. As such, our
implementation of chemical evolution represents a powerful instrument to follow
the cosmic history of metal production. The simulations presented here have
been performed with the twofold aim of checking numerical effects, as well as
the impact of changing the model of chemical evolution and the efficiency of
stellar feedback.
