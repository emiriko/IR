We study Langevin dynamics of a driven charged particle in the presence as
well as in the absence of magnetic field. We discuss the validity of various
work fluctuation theorems using different model potentials and external drives.
We also show that one can generate an orbital magnetic moment in a
nonequilibrium state which is absent in equilibrium.
