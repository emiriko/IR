We present a scheme for conditionally teleporting an unknown atomic state in
cavity QED, which requires two atoms and one cavity mode. The translational
degrees of freedom of the atoms are taken into account using the optical
Stern-Gerlach model. We show that successful teleportation with probability 1/2
can be achieved through local measurements of the cavity photon number and
atomic positions. Neither direct projection onto highly entangled states nor
holonomous interaction-time constraints are required.
