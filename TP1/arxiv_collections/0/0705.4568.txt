We present simultaneous X-ray (RXTE) and optical (ULTRACAM) narrow band
(Bowen blend/HeII and nearby continuum) observations of Sco X-1 at 2-10 Hz time
resolution. We find that the Bowen/HeII emission lags the X-ray light-curves
with a light travel time of ~11-16s which is consistent with reprocessing in
the companion star. The echo from the donor is detected at orbital phase ~0.5
when Sco X-1 is at the top of the Flaring Branch. Evidence of echoes is also
seen at the bottom of the Flaring Branch but with time-lags of 5-10s which are
consistent with reprocessing in an accretion disc with a radial temperature
profile. We discuss the implication of our results for the orbital parameters
of Sco X-1.
