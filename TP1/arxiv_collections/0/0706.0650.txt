We computed the phase diagram for a system of model anisotropic particles
with six attractive patches in an octahedral arrangement. We chose to study
this model for a relatively narrow value of the patch width where the
lowest-energy configuration of the system is a simple cubic crystal. At this
value of the patch width, there is no stable vapour-liquid phase separation,
and there are three other crystalline phases in addition to the simple cubic
crystal that is most stable at low pressure. Firstly, at moderate pressures, it
is more favourable to form a body-centred cubic crystal, which can be viewed as
two interpenetrating, and almost non-interacting, simple cubic
lattices.Secondly, at high pressures and low temperatures, an orientationally
ordered face-centred cubic structure becomes favourable. Finally, at high
temperatures a face-centred cubic plastic crystal is the most stable solid
phase.
