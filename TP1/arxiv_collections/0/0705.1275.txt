The theory of Bogoliubov is generalized for the case of a weakly-interacting
Bose-gas in harmonic trap. A set of nonlinear matrix equations is obtained to
make the diagonalization of Hamiltonian possible. Its perturbative solution is
used for the calculation of the energy and the condensate fraction of the model
system to show the applicability of the method.
