The pressure-induced changes in the optical properties of
$\beta$-Na$_{0.33}$V$_2$O$_5$ single crystals at room temperature were studied
by polarization-dependent Raman and far-infrared reflectivity measurements
under high pressure. From the changes in the Raman- and infrared-active phonon
modes in the pressure range 9 - 12 GPa a transfer of charge between the
different V sites can be inferred. The importance of electron-phonon coupling
in the low-pressure regime is discussed.
