Quantum tunnelling from a tilted, but otherwise periodic potential is
studied. Our theoretical and experimental results show that, by controlling the
system's parameters, we can engineer the escape rate of a Bose-Einstein
condensate to an exceptional degree. Possible applications of this atom-optics
realization of the open Wannier-Stark system are discussed.
