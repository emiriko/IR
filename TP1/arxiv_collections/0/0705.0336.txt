In the search for new spintronic materials with high spin-polarization at
room-temperature, we have synthesized an osmium based double perovskite with a
Curie-temperature of 725 K. Our combined experimental results confirm the
existence of a sizable induced magnetic moment at the Os site, supported by
band-structure calculations in agreement with a proposed kinetic energy driven
mechanism of ferrimagnetism in these compounds. The intriguing property of
Sr2CrOsO6 is that it is at the endpoint of a metal-insulator transition due to
5d band filling, and at the same time ferrimagnetism and high-spin polarization
is preserved.
