It is known that von Neumann-Landau wave equation can present a mathematical
formalism of motion of quantum mechanics, that is an extension of
Schr\"{o}dinger's wave equation. In this paper, we concern with the Dirichlet
problem of the stationary von Neumann-Landau wave equation:
  {(- \triangle_x + \triangle_y) \Phi (x, y) = 0, x, y \in \Omega,
  \Phi|_{\partial \Omega \times \partial \Omega} = f, where $\Omega$ is a
bounded domain in $\mathbf{R}^n.$ By introducing anti-inner product spaces, we
show the existence and uniqueness of the generalized solution for the above
Dirichlet problem by functional-analytic methods.
