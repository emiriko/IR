We show how to construct discrete-time quantum walks on directed, Eulerian
graphs. These graphs have tails on which the particle making the walk
propagates freely, and this makes it possible to analyze the walks in terms of
scattering theory. The probability of entering a graph from one tail and
leaving from another can be found from the scattering matrix of the graph. We
show how the scattering matrix of a graph that is an automorphic image of the
original is related to the scattering matrix of the original graph, and we show
how the scattering matrix of the reverse graph is related to that of the
original graph. Modifications of graphs and the effects of these modifications
are then considered. In particular we show how the scattering matrix of a graph
is changed if we remove two tails and replace them with an edge or cut an edge
and add two tails. This allows us to combine graphs, that is if we connect two
graphs we can construct the scattering matrix of the combined graph from those
of its parts. Finally, using these techniques, we show how two graphs can be
compared by constructing a larger larger graph in which the two original graphs
are in parallel, and performing a quantum walk on the larger graph. This is a
kind of quantum walk interferometry.
