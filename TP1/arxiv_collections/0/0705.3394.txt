We measure the obscured star formation in z~1 early-type galaxies. This
constrains the influence of star formation on their optical/near-IR colors,
which, we found, are redder than predicted by the model by Bruzual & Charlot
(2003). From deep ACS imaging we construct a sample of 95 morphologically
selected early-type galaxies in the HDF-N and CDF-S with spectroscopic
redshifts in the range 0.85<z<1.15. We measure their 24 micron fluxes from the
deep GOODS-MIPS imaging and derive the IR luminosities and star formation
rates. The fraction of galaxies with >2 sigma detections (~25 muJy} is
17(-4,+9)%. Of the 15 galaxies with significant detections at least six have an
AGN. Stacking the MIPS images of the galaxies without significant detections
and adding the detected galaxies without AGN we find an upper limit on the mean
star formation rate (SFR) of 5.2+/-3.0 Msol yr^-1, and on the mean specific SFR
of 4.6+/-2.2 * 10^-11 yr^-1. Under the assumption that the average SFR will
decline at the same rate as the cosmic average, the in situ growth in stellar
mass of the early-type galaxy population is less than 14+/-7% between z=1 and
the present. We show that the typically low IR luminosity and SFR imply that
the effect of obscured star formation (or AGN) on their rest-frame
optical/near-IR SEDs is negligible for ~90% of the galaxies in our sample.
Hence, their optical/near-IR colors are most likely dominated by evolved
stellar populations. This implies that the colors predicted by the Bruzual &
Charlot (2003) model for stellar populations with ages similar to those of z~1
early-type galaxies (~1-3 Gyr) are most likely too blue, and that stellar
masses of evolved, high-redshift galaxies can be overestimated by up to a
factor of ~2.
