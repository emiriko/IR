Taking advantage of an improved genetic optimization algorithm for fitting
unconstrained Kepler orbits to the Hipparcos intermediate astrometric data, we
obtain additional orbital solutions for 81 Hipparcos stars with previous
stochastic (failed) solutions. The sample includes astrophysically interesting
objects, including the old disk wide binary HIP 754, the nearby AGB star HIP
34922 (L2 Pup), and the nearby M2 dwarf HIP 5496 (GJ 54, at 8 pc from the Sun)
which has a resolved M dwarf companion.
