Corresponding to Fresnel transform there exists a unitary operator in quantum
optics theory, which could be named Fresnel operator (FO). We show that the
multiplication rule of FO naturally leads to the quantum optical ABCD law. The
canonical operator methods as mapping of ray-transfer ABCD matrix is explicitly
shown by FO's normally ordered expansion through the coherent state
representation and the technique of integration within an ordered product of
operators. We show that time evolution of the damping oscillator embodies the
quantum optical ABCD law.
