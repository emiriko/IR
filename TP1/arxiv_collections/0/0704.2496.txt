We consider the Bose-Hubbard model in a two dimensional rotating optical
lattice and investigate the consequences of the effective magnetic field
created by rotation. Using a Gutzwiller type variational wavefunction, we find
an analytical expression for the Mott insulator(MI)-Superfluid(SF) transition
boundary in terms of the maximum eigenvalue of the Hofstadter butterfly. The
dependence of phase boundary on the effective magnetic field is complex,
reflecting the self-similar properties of the single particle energy spectrum.
Finally, we argue that fractional quantum Hall phases exist close to the MI-SF
transition boundaries, including MI states with particle densities greater than
one.
