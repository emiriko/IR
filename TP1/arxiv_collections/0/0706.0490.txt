Thermalization of quark-gluon plasmas in heavy-ion collisions is a difficult
theoretical problem. One theoretical goal has been to understand the physics of
thermalization in the relatively simplifying limit of arbitrarily high energy
collisions, where the running coupling alpha_s is weak. One of the current
roadblocks to achieving this goal is lack of knowledge about the behavior of
plasma instabilities when particle distributions are highly anisotropic. In
particular, it has not been known how the magnetic fields generated by plasma
instabilities scale with anisotropy. In this paper, we use numerical
simulations in a first attempt to determine this scaling.
