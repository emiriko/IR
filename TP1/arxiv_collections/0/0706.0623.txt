Black holes could be produced at the Large Hadron Collider in TeV-scale
gravity scenarios. We discuss missing energy mechanisms in black hole
production and decay in large extra-dimensional models. In particular, we
examine how graviton emission into the bulk could give the black hole enough
recoil to leave the brane. Such a perturbation would cause an abrupt
termination in Hawking emission and result in large missing-energy signatures.
