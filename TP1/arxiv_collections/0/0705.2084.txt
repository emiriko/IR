Scientists and Technologists involved in the development of radar and remote
sensing systems all over the world are now trying to involve themselves in
saving of manpower in the form of developing a new application of their ideas
in Intelligent Transport system(ITS). The world statistics shows that by
incorporating such wireless radar system in the car would decrease the world
road accident by 8-10% yearly. The wireless technology has to be chosen
properly which is capable of tackling the severe interferences present in the
open road. A combined digital technology like Spread spectrum along with
diversity reception will help a lot in this regard. Accordingly, the choice is
for FHSS based space diversity system which will utilize carrier frequency
around 5.8 GHz ISM band with available bandwidth of 80 MHz and no license. For
efficient design, the radio channel is characterized on which the design is
based. Out of two available modes e.g. Communication and Radar modes, the radar
mode is providing the conditional measurement of the range of the nearest car
after authentication of the received code, thus ensuring the reliability and
accuracy of measurement. To make the system operational in simultaneous mode,
we have started the Software Defined Radio approach for best speed and
flexibility.
