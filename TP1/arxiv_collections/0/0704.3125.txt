We study tunneling conductance in normal metal / insulator / ferromagnetic
superconductor junctions. The tunneling spectra show a clear difference between
spin-singlet s-wave pairing, spin-triplet opposite spin pairing and
spin-triplet equal spin pairing: These pairings exhibit, respectively, gap
struture, double peak structure and zero bias peak in the spectra. The obtained
result may serve as a tool for determining the pairing symmetry of
ferromagnetic superconductors.
