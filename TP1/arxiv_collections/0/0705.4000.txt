In this paper, we introduce 3-dimensional $L-$summing method, which is a
rearrangement of the summation $\sum A_{abc}$ with $1\leq a,b,c\leq n$.
Applying this method on some special arrays, we obtain some identities on the
Riemann zeta function and digamma function. Also, we give a Maple program for
this method to obtain identities with input various arrays and out put
identities concerning some elementary functions and hypergeometric functions.
Finally, we introduce a further generalization of $L-$summing method in higher
dimension spaces.
