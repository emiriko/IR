Position determination in biological systems is often achieved through
protein concentration gradients. Measuring the local concentration of such a
protein with a spatially-varying distribution allows the measurement of
position within the system. In order for these systems to work effectively,
position determination must be robust to noise. Here, we calculate fundamental
limits to the precision of position determination by concentration gradients
due to unavoidable biochemical noise perturbing the gradients. We focus on
gradient proteins with first order reaction kinetics. Systems of this type have
been experimentally characterised in both developmental and cell biology
settings. For a single gradient we show that, through time-averaging, great
precision can potentially be achieved even with very low protein copy numbers.
As a second example, we investigate the ability of a system with oppositely
directed gradients to find its centre. With this mechanism, positional
precision close to the centre improves more slowly with increasing averaging
time, and so longer averaging times or higher copy numbers are required for
high precision. For both single and double gradients, we demonstrate the
existence of optimal length scales for the gradients, where precision is
maximized, as well as analyzing how precision depends on the size of the
concentration measuring apparatus. Our results provide fundamental constraints
on the positional precision supplied by concentration gradients in various
contexts, including both in developmental biology and also within a single
cell.
