It is shown that Beck and Mackey electromagnetic model of dark energy in
superconductors can account for the non-classical inertial properties of
superconductors, which have been conjectured by the author to explain the
Cooper pair's mass excess reported by Cabrera and Tate. A new Einstein-Planck
regime for gravitation in condensed matter is proposed as a natural scale to
host the gravitoelectrodynamic properties of superconductors.
