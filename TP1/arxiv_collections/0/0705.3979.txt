By the method of additional pulsed magnetic field influence in different
magnetic materials (half metals, manganites, lithium ferrite, cobalt) it is
established the analogy of time diagrams of magnetic pulse influence on single-
and two pulse echoes in magnets when the distortion mechanism of single-pulse
echo formation is effective, and the absence of such analogy in the case of
lithium ferrite where the multipulse mechanism of single-pulse echo formation
is effective.
  It is shown also that the timing and frequency diagrams of magnetic pulse
influence on the two-pulse echo signals, corresponding to the symmetric and
asymmetric magnetic pulse applications in the studied magnets, are defined by
their domain walls parameters and could serve for their qualitative and
quantitative characterization.
