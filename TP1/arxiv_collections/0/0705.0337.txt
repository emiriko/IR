We present here a review of the fundamental topics of Hartree-Fock theory in
Quantum Chemistry. From the molecular Hamiltonian, using and discussing the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we arrive to the Hartree and Hartree-Fock
equations for the electronic problem. Special emphasis is placed in the most
relevant mathematical aspects of the theoretical derivation of the final
equations, as well as in the results regarding the existence and uniqueness of
their solutions. All Hartree-Fock versions with different spin restrictions are
systematically extracted from the general case, thus providing a unifying
framework. Then, the discretization of the one-electron orbitals space is
reviewed and the Roothaan-Hall formalism introduced. This leads to a exposition
of the basic underlying concepts related to the construction and selection of
Gaussian basis sets, focusing in algorithmic efficiency issues. Finally, we
close the review with a section in which the most relevant modern developments
(specially those related to the design of linear-scaling methods) are commented
and linked to the issues discussed. The whole work is intentionally
introductory and rather self-contained, so that it may be useful for non
experts that aim to use quantum chemical methods in interdisciplinary
applications. Moreover, much material that is found scattered in the literature
has been put together here to facilitate comprehension and to serve as a handy
reference.
