An analogy between Wigner resonant tunneling and tunneling across a static
potential barrier in a static magnetic field is found. Whereas in the process
of Wigner tunneling an electron encounters a classically allowed regions, where
a discrete energy level coincides with its energy, in the magnetic field a
potential barrier is a constant in the direction of tunneling. Along the
tunneling path the certain regions are formed, where, in the classical
language, the kinetic energy of the motion perpendicular to tunneling is
negative. These regions play a role of potential wells, where a discrete energy
level can coincide with the electron energy. Such phenomenon, which occurs at
the certain magnetic field, is called Euclidean resonance and substantially
depends on a shape of potential forces in the direction perpendicular to
tunneling. Under conditions of Euclidean resonance a long distance underbarrier
motion is possible.
