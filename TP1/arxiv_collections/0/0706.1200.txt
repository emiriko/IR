We construct generalized 11D supergravity solutions of fully localized
intersecting D2/D4 brane systems. These solutions are obtained by embedding
six-dimensional resolved Eguchi-Hanson conifolds lifted to M-theory. We reduce
these solutions to ten dimensions, obtaining new D-brane systems in type IIA
supergravity. We discuss the limits in which the dynamics of the D2 brane
decouples from the bulk for these solutions.
