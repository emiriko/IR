We consider a chirally invariant lattice Higgs-Yukawa model based on the
Neuberger overlap operator. As a first step towards the eventual determination
of Higgs mass bounds we study the phase diagram of the model analytically in
the large Nf-limit. We present an expression for the effective potential at
tree-level in the regime of small Yukawa and quartic coupling constants and
determine the order of the phase transitions. In the case of strong Yukawa
couplings the model effectively becomes an O(4)-symmetric non-linear
sigma-model for all values of the quartic coupling constant. This leads to the
existence of a symmetric phase also in the regime of large values of the Yukawa
coupling constant. On finite and small lattices, however, strong finite volume
effects prevent the expectation value of the Higgs field from vanishing thus
obscuring the existence of the symmetric phase at strong Yukawa couplings.
