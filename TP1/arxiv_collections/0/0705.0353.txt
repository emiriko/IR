To improve the quality of life in a modern society it is essential to reduce
the distance between basic research and applications, whose crucial roles in
shaping today's society prompt us to seek their understanding. Existing studies
on this subject, however, have neglected the network character of the
interaction between university and industry. Here we use state-of-the-art
network theory methods to analyze this interplay in the so-called Framework
Programme--an initiative which sets out the priorities for the European Union's
research and technological development. In particular we study in the 5th
Framework Programme (FP5) the role played by companies and scientific
institutions and how they contribute to enhance the relationship between
research and industry. Our approach provides quantitative evidence that while
firms are size hierarchically organized, universities and research
organizations keep the network from falling into pieces, paving the way for an
effective knowledge transfer.
