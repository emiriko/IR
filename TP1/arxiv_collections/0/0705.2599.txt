In this work we solve exactly a class of three-body propagators for the most
general quadratic interactions in the coordinates, for arbitrary masses and
couplings. This is done both for the constant as the time-dependent couplings
and masses, by using the Feynman path integral formalism. Finally the energy
spectrum and the eigenfunctions are recovered from the propagators.
