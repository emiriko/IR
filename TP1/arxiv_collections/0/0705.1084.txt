Actual organizations, in particular the ones which operate in evolving and
distributed environments, need advanced frameworks for the management of the
knowledge life cycle. These systems have to be based on the social relations
which constitute the pattern of collaboration ties of the organization. We
demonstrate here, with the aid of a model taken from the theory of graphs, that
it is possible to provide the conditions for an effective knowledge management.
A right way could be to involve the actors with the highest betweeness
centrality in the generation of discussion groups. This solution allows the
externalization of tacit knowledge, the preservation of knowledge and the raise
of innovation processes.
