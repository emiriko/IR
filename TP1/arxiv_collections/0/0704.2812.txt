By using the self-dual vortex background on extra two-dimensional Riemann
surfaces in 5+1 dimensions, the localization mechanism of bulk fermions on a
string-like defect with the exponentially decreasing warp-factor is obtained.
We give the conditions under which localized spin 1/2 and 3/2 fermions can be
obtained.
