We study lepton flavor violating analogs of the photoelectric effect, with a
final $\mu$ or $\tau$ instead of an electron: $\gamma e\to \mu$ and $\gamma
e\to \tau$. On the basis of the general parametrization of the matrix element
of the electromagnetic current we estimate the upper limits for the cross
sections and event rates of these processes, imposed by the current
experimental bounds on $\mu\to e \gamma$ and $\tau\to e \gamma$ decays.
