We apply the recently proposed amplitude reduction at the integrand level
method, to the computation of the scattering process 2 photons -> 4 photons,
including the case of a massive fermion loop. We also present several
improvements of the method, including a general strategy to reconstruct the
rational part of any one-loop amplitude and the treatment of vanishing
Gram-determinants.
