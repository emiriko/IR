Recent results from the HARP experiment on the measurements of the
double-differential production cross-section of pions in proton interactions
with beryllium, carbon and tantalum targets are presented. These results are
relevant for a detailed understanding of neutrino flux in accelerator neutrino
experiments MiniBooNE/SciBooNE, for a better prediction of atmospheric neutrino
fluxes as well as for an optimization of a future neutrino factory design.
