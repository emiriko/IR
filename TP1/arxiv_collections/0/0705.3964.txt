Polymer Optical Fiber (POF) can be and are being used in various fields of
applications. Two of the main fields are the automotive and the home
entertainment sector. The POF can be applied in several different optical
communication systems as automotive multi-media busses or in-house Ethernet
systems.
  The requirements of bandwidth are increasing very fast in these sectors and
therefore solutions that satisfy these demands are of high actuality. One
solution is to use the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technique. Here,
several different wavelengths can carry information over one POF fiber. All
wavelengths that are transmitted over the fiber, must be separated at the
receiver to regain and redirect the information channels. These separators are
so-called Demultiplexers.
  There are several systems available on the market, which are all afflicted
with certain disadvantages. But all these solutions have one main disadvantage,
they are all too expensive for most of the applications mentioned above. So the
goal of this study is to develop an economical Demultiplexer for WDM
transmission over POF.
  The main idea is to separate the chromatic light in its monochromatic
components with the help of a prism with low reciprocal dispersive power. The
prism and the other assemblies, which are needed to adjust the optical path,
should be manufactured in injection molding technique. This manufacturing
technique is a very simple and economical way to produce a mass production
applicable Demultiplexer for POF.
