We present a quantum Monte Carlo study of the quantum correlations in the
parametric luminescence from semiconductor microcavities in the strong
exciton-photon coupling regime. As already demonstrated in recent experiments,
a ring-shaped emission is obtained by applying two identical pump beams with
opposite in-plane wavevectors, providing symmetrical signal and idler beams
with opposite in-plane wavevectors on the ring. We study the squeezing of the
signal-idler difference noise across the parametric instability threshold,
accounting for the radiative and non-radiative losses, multiple scattering and
static disorder. We compare the results of the complete multimode Monte Carlo
simulations with a simplified linearized quantum Langevin analytical model.
