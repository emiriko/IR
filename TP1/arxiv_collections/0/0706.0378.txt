The electro-magnetic and particle radiation detected from the direction of
Cygnus X3 raise the question of the existence of special long-lived, neutral
particles. We investigate the origin of these particles in a special approach:
the source object may contain compactified extra dimension and these particles
are messengers of this state. We describe hyperon stars in 3+1 dimension and
introduce the description of a compact stars in 3+1_c+1 dimensional space-time.
