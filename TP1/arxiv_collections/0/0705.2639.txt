We consider the bosonic sl(2) sector of the maximally supersymmetric N=4 SYM
model and show that anomalous dimension of the twist-3 single-trace composite
operators built of scalar fields, recently calculated up to the four-loop
order, can be generated by a compact reciprocity respecting evolution kernel.
