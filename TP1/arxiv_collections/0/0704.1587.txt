Using Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer Seyfert 1 and 1.2 data spanning 9 years, we
study correlations between X-ray spectral features. The sample consists of 350
time-resolved spectra from 12 Seyfert 1 and 1.2 galaxies. Each spectrum is
fitted to a model with an intrinsic powerlaw X-ray spectrum produced close to
the central black hole that is reprocessed and absorbed by material around the
black hole. To test the robustness of our results, we performed Monte Carlo
simulations of the spectral sample. We find a complex relationship between the
iron line equivalent width (EW) and the underlying power law index (Gamma). The
data reveal a correlation between Gamma and EW which turns over at Gamma <~ 2,
but finds a weak anti-correlation for steeper photon indices. We propose that
this relationship is driven by dilution of a disk spectrum (which includes the
narrow iron line) by a beamed jet component and, hence, could be used as a
diagnostic of jet-dominance. In addition, our sample shows a strong correlation
between the reflection fraction (R) and Gamma, but we find that it is likely
the result of modeling degeneracies. We also see the X-ray Baldwin effect (an
anti-correlation between the 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity and EW) for the sample
as a whole, but not for the individual galaxies and galaxy types.
