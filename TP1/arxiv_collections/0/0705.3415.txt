The analysis of the dynamics of a material point perfectly constrained to a
submanifold of the three-dimensional euclidean space and subjected to a locally
conservative force's field, namely a force's field corresponding to a closed
but not necessarily exact differential form on such a submanifold, requires a
generalization of the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian formalism that is here
developed.
