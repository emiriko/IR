We illustrate through numerical results a number of features of
environment-induced decoherence under a broad class of apparatus-environment
interactions in quantum measurements wherein the reduced system-apparatus
density matrix evolves towards the nearest separable state and, in addition,
there occurs a mixing in relevant groups of apparatus microstates (see below).
The resulting final state is unique and correctly embodies the measurement
statistics even in the absence of environment-induced superselection because of
energy differences between these groups of states. The partial transpose
remains non-positive throughout the process.
