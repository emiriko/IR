Experimental evidence for the generation of intrinsic localized modes (ILMs)
in a nonlinear electrical transmission line is presented both via modulational
instability (MI) of the uniform mode and via driving the lattice locally. The
spatial profiles of these modes localized on the order of the lattice spacing
can be directly measured in this macroscopic lattice, in contrast to most other
systems where ILMs have so far been detected.
