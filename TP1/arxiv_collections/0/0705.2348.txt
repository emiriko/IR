Molecular Dynamics simulations of water confined in nanometer sized,
hydrophobic channels show that water forms localized cavities for pore diameter
~ 2.0 nm. The cavities present non-spherical shape and lay preferentially
adjacent to the confining wall inducing a peculiar form to the liquid exposed
surface. The regime of localized cavitation appears to be correlated with the
formation of a vapor layer, as predicted by the Lum-Chandler-Weeks theory,
implying partial filling of the pore.
