We introduce a convenient parametrization of dark energy models that is
general enough to include several modified gravity models and generalized forms
of dark energy. In particular we take into account the linear perturbation
growth factor, the anisotropic stress and the modified Poisson equation. We
discuss the sensitivity of large scale weak lensing surveys like the proposed
DUNE satellite to these parameters. We find that a large-scale weak-lensing
tomographic survey is able to easily distinguish the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati
model from LCDM and to determine the perturbation growth index to an absolute
error of 0.02-0.03.
