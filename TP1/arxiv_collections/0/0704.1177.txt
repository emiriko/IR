Performances of the symmetric universal and phase-covariant cloning
transformations and entanglement cloners -- qubit case -- are investigated when
the initial state of the hardware or the original state to be cloned is weakly
coupled to a thermal environment. Different behaviors of each of these
transformations are analyzed and contrasted with the ideal cases.
