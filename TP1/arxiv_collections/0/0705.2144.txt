In the past both instrumentalism and empiricism have inspired certain
pragmatic elements into the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. The
relation of such pragmatisms with the correspondence principle is discussed. It
is argued that neither Bohr nor Heisenberg did take `correspondence' in one of
these forms, and that it, in particular, was Bohr's classical attitude which
caused him to apply in an inconsistent way his correspondence principle to the
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiment, thus causing much confusion. It is
demonstrated that an empiricist pragmatism is conducive to an explanation of
violation of the Bell inequalities as a consequence of `complementarity' in the
sense of `mutual disturbance in a joint nonideal measurement of incompatible
observables' rather than as being caused by `nonlocal influences'.
