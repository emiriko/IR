Present expansion stage of the universe is believed to be mainly governed by
the cosmological constant, collisionless dark matter and baryonic matter. The
latter two components are often modeled as zero-pressure fluids. In our
previous work we have shown that to the second-order cosmological
perturbations, the relativistic equations of the zero-pressure, irrotational,
multi-component fluids in a spatially near flat background effectively coincide
with the Newtonian equations. As the Newtonian equations only have quadratic
order nonlinearity, it is practically interesting to derive the potential
third-order perturbation terms in general relativistic treatment which
correspond to pure general relativistic corrections. Here, we present pure
general relativistic correction terms appearing in the third-order
perturbations of the multi-component zero-pressure fluids. We show that, as in
a single component situation, the third-order correction terms are quite small
(~ 5 x10^{-5} smaller compared with the relativistic/Newtonian second-order
terms) due to the weak level anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background
radiation. Still, there do exist pure general relativistic correction terms in
third-order perturbations which could potentially become important in future
development of precision cosmology. We include the cosmological constant in all
our analyses.
