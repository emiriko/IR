We present a chaplygin gas Friedmann-Robertson-Walker quantum cosmological
model. In this work the Schutz's variational formalism is applied with
positive, negative, and zero constant spatial curvature. In this approach the
notion of time can be recovered. These give rise to
Schr\"odinger-Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the scale factor. We use the
eigenfunctions in order to construct wave packets for each case. We study the
time dependent behavior of the expectation value of the scale factor, using the
many-worlds interpretations of quantum mechanics.
