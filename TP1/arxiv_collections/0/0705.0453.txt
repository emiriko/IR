We present in this paper a generic object-oriented benchmark (the Object
Clustering Benchmark) that has been designed to evaluate the performances of
clustering policies in object-oriented databases. OCB is generic because its
sample database may be customized to fit the databases introduced by the main
existing benchmarks (e.g., OO1). OCB's current form is clustering-oriented
because of its clustering-oriented workload, but it can be easily adapted to
other purposes. Lastly, OCB's code is compact and easily portable. OCB has been
implemented in a real system (Texas, running on a Sun workstation), in order to
test a specific clustering policy called DSTC. A few results concerning this
test are presented.
