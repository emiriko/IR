We show that the massive (or massless) neutrinos can be described as special
states of Heisenberg nonlinear spinors. As a by-product of this decomposition a
particularly attractive consequence appears: the possibility of relating the
existence of only three species of mass-less neutrinos to such internal
non-linear structure. At the same time it allows the possibility that neutrino
oscillation can occurs even for massless neutrinos.
