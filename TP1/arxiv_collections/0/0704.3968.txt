Electroweak radiative corrections to muon capture on nuclei are computed and
found to be sizable. They enhance the capture rates for hydrogen and helium by
2.8% and 3.0% respectively. As a result, the value of the induced pseudoscalar
coupling, g_P^exp, extracted from a recent hydrogen 1S singlet capture
experiment is increased by about 21% to g_P^exp = 7.3 +/- 1.2 and brought into
good agreement with the prediction of chiral perturbation theory,
g_P^theory=8.2 +/- 0.2. Implications for helium capture rate predictions are
also discussed.
