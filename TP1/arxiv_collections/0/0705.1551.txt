There are nine metal-deficient stars that have Li abundances well below the
Li plateau that is defined by over 100 unevolved stars with temperatures above
5800 K and values of [Fe/H] $<$ $-$1.0. Abundances of Be have been determined
for most of these ultra-Li-deficient stars in order to investigate the cause of
the Li deficiencies. High-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra have been
obtained in the Be II spectral region near 3130 \AA for six ultra-Li-deficient
stars with the Keck I telescope and its new uv-sensitive CCD on the upgraded
HIRES. The spectrum synthesis technique has been used to determine Be
abundances. All six stars are found to have Be deficiencies also. Two have
measurable - but reduced - Be and four have only upper limits on Be. These
results are consistent with the idea that these Li- and Be-deficient stars are
analogous to blue stragglers. The stars have undergone mass transfer events (or
mergers) which destroy or dilute both Li and Be. The findings cannot be matched
by the models that predict that the deficiencies are due to extra-mixing in a
subset of halo stars that were initially rapid rotators, with the possible
exception of one star, G 139-8. Because the ultra-Li-deficient stars are also
Be-deficient, they appear to be genuine outliers in population of halo stars
used to determine the value of primordial Li; they no longer have the Li in
their atmospheres that was produced in the Big Bang.
