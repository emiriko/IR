This paper discusses the ATLAS potential to study Supersymmetry for the
"Focus-Point" region of the parameter space of mSUGRA models. The potential to
discovery a deviation from Standard Model expectations with the first few
${fb}^{-1}$ of LHC data was studied using the parametrized simulation of the
ATLAS detector. Several signatures were considered, involving hard jets, large
missing energy, and either $b$-tagged jets, opposite-sign isolated electron or
muon pairs, or top quarks reconstructed exploiting their fully hadronic decays.
With only 1 ${fb}^{-1}$ of data each of these signatures may allow to observe
an excess of events over Standard Model expectation with a statistical
significance exceeding 5 standard deviations. An analytical expression was
derived for the shape of the distribution of the dilepton invariant mass
arising from the three-body leptonic decay of the neutralinos under the
hypothesis of heavy scalars, which is appropriate for the focus-point scenario.
The resulting function was used to fit the distribution of the dilepton
invariant mass obtained with simulated LHC data, and to extract the value of
two kinematic endpoints measuring the $\tilde \chi^0_2 - \tilde \chi^0_1$ and
the $\tilde \chi^0_3 - \tilde \chi^0_1$ mass differences. This information was
used to constrain the MSSM parameter space compatible with the data.
