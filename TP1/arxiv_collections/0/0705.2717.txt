During Cycle 14 a total of 113 HST orbits were secured to observe five
isolated dwarf galaxies, namely Tucana, LGS3, LeoA, IC1613, and Cetus. The aim
of the project is a full characterization of the stellar content of these
galaxies, in term of their SFH, radial distributions, halo populations and
variable stars. Deep (V~29) F475W, F814W data allowed us to fully sample all
the evolutionary phases from the tip of the Red Giant Branch (RGB) to well
below the old Main Sequence Turnoff (MSTO). Here we describe the observational
design, and the reduction and calibration strategy adopted. A comparison of the
results obtained using two different packages, ALLFRAME and Dolphot, is
presented.
