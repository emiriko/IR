We consider a possible interpretation of the new charm-strange meson
Ds0*(2317) as a hadronic molecule - a bound state of D and K mesons. Using an
effective Lagrangian approach we calculate the strong Ds0* to Ds pi0 and
radiative Ds0* to Ds* gamma decays. A new impact related to the DK molecular
structure of the Ds0*(2317) meson is that the presence of u(d) quarks in the D
and K mesons gives rise to a direct strong isospin-violating transition Ds0* to
Ds pi0 in addition to the decay mechanism induced by eta-pi0 mixing considered
previously. We show that the direct transition dominates over the eta-pi0
mixing transition in the Ds0* to Ds pi0 decay. Our results for the partial
decay widths are consistent with previous calculations.
