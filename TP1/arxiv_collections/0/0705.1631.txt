We calculate the response of a molecular magnet subject to a time-varying
magnetic field and coupled to a heat bath. We propose that observations of
calculated oscillations transverse to the field direction may be an effective
way of demonstrating quantum tunneling and thus probing the details of level
repulsion. The effective model of a triangle of Heisenberg spins and weak
anisotropies, as has been used to model the molecular magnets V15 and Cu3, is
used to illustrate this.
