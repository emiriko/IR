We report magnetotransport measurements of fractional quantum Hall states in
an AlAs quantum well around Landau level filling factor nu = 3/2, demonstrating
that the quasiparticles are composite Fermions (CFs) with a valley degree of
freedom. By monitoring the valley level crossings for these states as a
function of applied symmetry-breaking strain, we determine the CF valley
susceptibility and polarization. The data can be explained well by a simple
Landau level fan diagram for CFs, and are in nearly quantitative agreement with
the results reported for CF spin polarization.
