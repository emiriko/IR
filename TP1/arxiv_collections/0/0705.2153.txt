We propose a model of metastable dynamical supersymmetry breaking in which
all scales are generated dynamically. Our construction is a simple variant of
the Intriligator-Seiberg-Shih model, with quark masses induced by
renormalizable couplings to an auxiliary supersymmetric QCD sector. Since all
scales arise from dimensional transmutation, the model has no fundamental
dimensionful parameters. It also does not rely on higher-dimensional operators.
