The compound Y2PdGe3 was earlier reported by us to be one of the very few
ternary superconducting compounds (T_c= 3 K) belonging to the same structure as
that of MgB2. Here we report the results of electrical resistivity,
magnetization and heat capacity measurements at low temperatures on the solid
solution with a nominal starting composition, Y2Pd(1-x)Pt(x)Ge3, to understand
the influence of gradual replacement of Pd by Pt on T_c. The superconducting
properties of this solution is distinctly interesting in the sense that the Tc
varies monotonically with increasing x in sharp contrast to the non-monotonic
variation for other isostructural solid solutions reported recently.
