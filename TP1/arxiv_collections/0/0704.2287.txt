Using the renormalization group method, new type of fluctuation-driven first
order phase transitions and critical phenomena are predicted for certain
classes of ferromagnetic superconductors and superfluids with unconventional
(spin-triplet) Cooper pairing. The problem for the quantum phase transitions at
extremely low and zero temperatures is also discussed. The results can be
applied to a wide class of ferromagnetic superconductive and superfluid
systems, in particular, to itinerant ferromagnets as UGe2 and URhGe.
