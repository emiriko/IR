The GLIMPSE archive was used to obtain 3.6--8.0micron, point source
photometry and images for 381 massive protostellar candidates lying in the
Galactic mid-plane. The colours, magnitudes and spectral indicies of sources in
each of the 381 target fields were analysed and compared with the predictions
of 2D radiative transfer model simulations. Although no discernable embedded
clusters were found in any targets, multiple sources or associations of
redenned young stellar objects were found in many sources indicating
multiplicity at birth. The spectral index ($\alpha$) of these point sources in
3.6--8.0mum bands display large values of $\alpha$=2--5. A color-magnitude
analog plot was used to identify 79 infrared counterparts to the HMPOs. Compact
nebulae are found in 75% of the detected sources with morphologies that can be
well described by core-halo, cometary, shell-like and bipolar geometries
similar to those observed in ultra-compact HII regions. The IRAC band SEDs of
the IR counterparts of HMPOs are best described to represent YSOs with a mass
range of 8--20\msun in their Class I stages when compared with 2D radiative
transfer models. They also suggest that the high $\alpha$ values represent
reprocessed star/star+disk emission that is arising in the dense envelopes.
Thus we are witnessing the luminous envelopes around the protostars rather than
their photospheres or disks. We argue that the compact infrared nebulae likely
reflect the underlying physical structure of the dense cores and are found to
imitate the morphologies of known UCHII regions. Our results favour models of
continuuing accretion involving both molecular and ionised accretion components
to build the most massive stars rather than purely molecular rapid accretion
flows.
