We describe the hardwired implementation of algorithms for Monte Carlo
simulations of a large class of spin models. We have implemented these
algorithms as VHDL codes and we have mapped them onto a dedicated processor
based on a large FPGA device. The measured performance on one such processor is
comparable to O(100) carefully programmed high-end PCs: it turns out to be even
better for some selected spin models. We describe here codes that we are
currently executing on the IANUS massively parallel FPGA-based system.
