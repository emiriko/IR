We analyze the broad range of spin-dependent nonequilibrium transport
properties of hybrid systems composed of a normal region tunnel coupled to two
superconductors with exchange fields induced by the proximity to thin
ferromagnetic layers and highlight its functionalities. By calculating the
quasiparticle distribution functions in the normal region we find that they are
spin-dependent and strongly sensitive to the relative angle between exchange
fields in the two superconductors. The impact of inelastic collisions on their
properties is addressed. As a result, the electric current flowing through the
system is found to be strongly dependent on the relative angle between exchange
fields, giving rise to a huge value of magnetoresistance. Moreover, the current
presents a complete spin-polarization in a wide range of bias voltages, even in
the quasiequilibrium case. In the nonequilibrium limit we parametrize the
distributions with an ``effective`` temperature, which turns out to be strongly
spin-dependent, though quite sensitive to inelastic collisions. By tunnel
coupling the normal region to an additional superconducting electrode we show
that it is possible to implement a spin-polarized current source of both spin
species, depending on the bias voltages applied.
