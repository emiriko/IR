We employ generalized complex geometry to investigate supersymmetric
embeddings of D-brane probes in a large class of SU(2) structure manifolds.
This class includes the gravity dual of mass deformation and marginal beta
deformation of N=4 SYM gauge theory. We find supersymmetric configurations of
D-branes with different dimensionality and propose their interpretation in the
dual gauge theory.
