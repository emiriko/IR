[Abridged] We have been exploring a spectroscopic unification for all known
types of broad line emitting AGN. The 4D Eigenvector 1 (4DE1) parameter space
shows promise as a unification capable of organizing quasar diversity on a
sequence primarily governed by Eddington ratio. This paper considers the role
of CIV 1549 measures with special emphasis on the CIV 1549 line shift as a
principal 4DE1 diagnostic. We use HST archival spectra for 130 sources with S/N
high enough to permit reliable CIV 1549 broad component (BC) measures. We find
a CIV 1549 BC profile blueshift that is strongly concentrated among (largely
radio-quiet: RQ) sources with FWHM(H beta BC) < 4000 km/s (which we call
Population A). Narrow line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1, with FWHM H beta < 2000 km/s)
sources belong to this population but do not emerge as a distinct class. The
systematic blueshift, widely interpreted as arising in a disk wind/outflow, is
not observed in broader lined AGN which we call Population B. We find new
correlations between FWHM(CIV 1549 BC) and CIV 1549 line shift as well as the
equivalent width of CIV 1549. They are seen only in Pop. A sources. CIV 1549
measures enhance the apparent dichotomy at FWHM(Hbeta BC) approx. 4000 \kms\
(Sulentic et al. 2000) suggesting that it has more significance in the context
of Broad Line Region structure than the more commonly discussed RL vs. RQ
dichotomy. Black hole masses computed from FWHM CIV 1549 BC for about 80 AGN
indicate that the CIV 1549 width is a poor virial estimator. Comparison of mass
estimates derived from Hbeta BC and CIV 1549 reveals that the latter show
different and nonlinear offsets for population A and B sources. A significant
number of sources also show narrow line CIV 1549 emission. We present a recipe
for CIV 1549 narrow component extraction.
