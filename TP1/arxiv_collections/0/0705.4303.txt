Manipulating a database system on a quantum computer is an essential aim to
benefit from the promising speed-up of quantum computers over classical
computers in areas that take a vast amount of storage and processing time such
as in databases. In this paper, the basic operations for manipulating the data
in a quantum database will be defined, e.g. INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT,
backing up and restoring a database file. This gives the ability to perform the
data processing that usually takes a long processing time on a classical
database system, in a simultaneous way on a quantum computer. Defining a
quantum version of more advanced concepts used in database systems, e.g. the
referential integrity and the relational algebra, is a normal extension to this
work
