Differential cross sections for the reaction $\gamma p \to p \pi^0$ have been
measured with the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) and a tagged
photon beam with energies from 0.675 to 2.875 GeV. The results reported here
possess greater accuracy in the absolute normalization than previous
measurements. They disagree with recent CB-ELSA measurements for the process at
forward scattering angles. Agreement with the SAID and MAID fits is found below
1 GeV. The present set of cross sections has been incorporated into the SAID
database, and exploratory fits have been extended to 3 GeV. Resonance couplings
have been extracted and compared to previous determinations.
