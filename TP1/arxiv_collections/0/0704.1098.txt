The transition between the low density groups of T Tauri stars and the high
density clusters around massive stars occurs in the intermediate-mass (IM)
range (M$_*$$\sim$2--8 M$_\odot$). High spatial resolution studies of IM young
stellar objects (YSO) can provide important clues to understand the clustering
in massive star forming regions.
  Aims: Our aim is to search for clustering in IM Class 0 protostars. The high
spatial resolution and sensitivity provided by the new A configuration of the
Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) allow us to study the clustering in these
nearby objects.
  Methods: We have imaged three IM Class 0 protostars (Serpens-FIRS 1, IC 1396
N, CB 3) in the continuum at 3.3 and 1.3mm using the PdBI. The sources have
been selected with different luminosity to investigate the dependence of the
clustering process on the luminosity of the source.
  Results: Only one millimeter (mm) source is detected towards the low
luminosity source Serpens--FIRS 1. Towards CB 3 and IC1396 N, we detect two
compact sources separated by $\sim$0.05 pc. The 1.3mm image of IC 1396 N, which
provides the highest spatial resolution, reveal that one of these cores is
splitted in, at least, three individual sources.
