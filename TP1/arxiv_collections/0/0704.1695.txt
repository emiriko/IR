We present a detailed calculation of the electron-positron production rate
using neutrinos in an intense background magnetic field. The computation is
done for the process nu -> nu e- e+ (where nu can be nu_e, nu_mu, or nu_tau)
within the framework of the Standard Model. Results are given for various
combinations of Landau-levels over a range of possible incoming neutrino
energies and magnetic field strengths.
