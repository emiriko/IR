The recent debate on hypercomputation has arisen new questions both on the
computational abilities of quantum systems and the Church-Turing Thesis role in
Physics. We propose here the idea of "effective physical process" as the
essentially physical notion of computation. By using the Bohm and Hiley active
information concept we analyze the differences between the standard form
(quantum gates) and the non-standard one (adiabatic and morphogenetic) of
Quantum Computing, and we point out how its Super-Turing potentialities derive
from an incomputable information source in accordance with Bell's constraints.
On condition that we give up the formal concept of "universality", the
possibility to realize quantum oracles is reachable. In this way computation is
led back to the logic of physical world.
