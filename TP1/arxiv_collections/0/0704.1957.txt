The entanglement cost of arbitrary sequences of bipartite states is shown to
be expressible as the minimization of a conditional spectral entropy rate over
sequences of separable extensions of the states in the sequence. The expression
is shown to reduce to the regularized entanglement of formation when the n-th
state in the sequence consists of n copies of a single bipartite state.
