We investigate the possibility to deduce momentum space properties from
time-dependent density functional calculations. Electron and ion momentum
distributions after double ionization of a model Helium atom in a strong
few-cycle laser pulse are studied. We show that, in this case, the choice of
suitable functionals for the observables is considerably more important than
the choice of the correlation potential in the time-dependent Kohn-Sham
equations. By comparison with the solution of the time-dependent Schroedinger
equation, the insufficiency of functionals neglecting electron correlation is
demonstrated. We construct a functional of the Kohn-Sham orbitals, which in
principle yields the exact momentum distributions of the electrons and the ion.
The product-phase approximation is introduced, which reduces the problem of
approximating this functional significantly.
