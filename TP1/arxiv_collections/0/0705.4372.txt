This paper generalizes two previously known techniques for generating
minimally coupled Einstein-scalar field solutions in 4 dimensions; the Buchdahl
and Fonarev transformations. By applying this solution generation technique,
minimally coupled Einstein-scalar field solutions can be generated from vacuum
solutions with arbitrary cosmological constant in arbitrary dimension. The only
requirement to a seed solution is that it posesses a hypersurface-orthogonal
Killing vector field. The generalization that allows us to use seed solutions
with arbitrary cosmological constant uncovers a new class of Einstein-scalar
field solutions that has previously not been studied. We apply the new solution
transformation to the (A)dS4 vacuum solution. Transforming the resulting
Einstein-scalar field solution to the conformal frame, a two-parameter family
of spatially finite, expanding and accelerating cosmological solutions are
found that are conformally isometric to the Einstein static universe RxS^3. We
study null geodesics and find that for any observer, the solution has a
cosmological horizon at an angular distance of pi/2 away from the observer. We
find that a subset of these solutions can be naturally interpreted as expanding
cosmologies in which a scalar black hole is formed at late times. The
conformally coupled scalar field satisfies the weak energy condition as long as
the energy density is positive, while the strong energy condition is generally
violated.
