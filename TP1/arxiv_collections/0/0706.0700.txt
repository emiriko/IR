Traditionally, since the discovery of the Josephson effect in 1962, the
magnetic diffraction pattern of planar Josephson tunnel junctions has been
recorded with the field applied in the plane of the junction. Here we discuss
the static junction properties in a transverse magnetic field where
demagnetization effects imposed by the junction geometry and configuration of
the electrodes are important. Measurements of the critical current versus
magnetic field in planar Nb-based high-quality junctions with different
geometry, size and critical current density show that it is advantageous to use
a transverse magnetic field rather than an in-plane field to suppress the
Josephson tunnel current and Fiske resonances in practical applications.
