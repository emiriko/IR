Cherenkov gluons may be responsible for the asymmetry of dilepton mass
spectra near rho-meson observed in experiment. They can be produced only in the
low-mass wing of the resonance. Therefore the dilepton mass spectra are
flattened there and their peak is slightly shifted to lower masses compared
with the in-vacuum rho-meson mass. This feature must be common for all
resonances.
