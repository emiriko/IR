The possibility that around some astrophysical objects there are non-static
magnetic fields of enormous intensity suggests that in these situations real
particles may be produced. The slowness of the variation is compensated by the
huge intensity. The main issue is the production of e+,e- pairs annihilating
into photons and the direct production of photons, as one of the concurrent
process in the GRB (gamma ray bursts). Then some simple effects due to the
presence of the intense gravity are studied and finally a look is given to the
production of other kinds of particles.
