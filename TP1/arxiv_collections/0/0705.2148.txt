We show that a certain type of quasi finite, conservative, ergodic, measure
preserving transformation always has a maximal zero entropy factor, generated
by predictable sets. We also construct a conservative, ergodic, measure
preserving transformation which is not quasi finite; and consider distribution
asymptotics of information showing that e.g. for Boole's transformation,
information is asymptotically mod-normal with square root normalization. Lastly
we see that certain ergodic, probability preserving transformations with zero
entropy have analogous properties and consequently entropy dimension of at most
1/2.
