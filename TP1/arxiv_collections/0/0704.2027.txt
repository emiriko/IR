The performance of a quantum teleportation algorithm implemented on an ion
trap quantum computer is investigated. First the algorithm is analyzed in terms
of the teleportation fidelity of six input states evenly distributed over the
Bloch sphere. Furthermore, a quantum process tomography of the teleportation
algorithm is carried out which provides almost complete knowledge about the
algorithm.
