Unbiased angular diameter measurements are required for accurate distances to
Cepheids using the interferometric Baade Wesselink method (IBWM). The precision
of this technique is currently limited by interferometric measurements at the
1.5% level. At this level, the center-to-limb darkening (CLD) and the presence
of circumstellar envelopes (CSE) seem to be the two main sources of bias. The
observations we performed aim at improving our knowledge of the interferometric
visibility profile of Cepheids. In particular, we assess the systematic
presence of CSE around Cepheids in order determine accurate distances with the
IBWM free from CSE biased angular diameters. We observed a Cepheid (Y Oph) for
which the pulsation is well resolved and a non-pulsating yellow supergiant
(alpha Per) using long-baseline near-infrared interferometry. We interpreted
these data using a simple CSE model we previously developed. We found that our
observations of alpha Per do not provide evidence for a CSE. The measured CLD
is explained by an hydrostatic photospheric model. Our observations of Y Oph,
when compared to smaller baseline measurements, suggest that it is surrounded
by a CSE with similar characteristics to CSE found previously around other
Cepheids. We have determined the distance to Y Oph to be d=491+/-18 pc.
Additional evidence points toward the conclusion that most Cepheids are
surrounded by faint CSE, detected by near infrared interferometry: after
observing four Cepheids, all show evidence for a CSE. Our CSE non-detection
around a non-pulsating supergiant in the instability strip, alpha Per, provides
confidence in the detection technique and suggests a pulsation driven mass-loss
mechanism for the Cepheids.
