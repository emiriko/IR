The Invar package is introduced, a fast manipulator of generic scalar
polynomial expressions formed from the Riemann tensor of a four-dimensional
metric-compatible connection. The package can maximally simplify any polynomial
containing tensor products of up to seven Riemann tensors within seconds. It
has been implemented both in Mathematica and Maple algebraic systems.
