We investigate self-dual vertex operator algebras (VOAs) and super algebras
(SVOAs). Using the genus one correlation functions, it is shown that self-dual
SVOAs exist only for half-integral central charges. It is described how
self-dual SVOAs can be constructed from self-dual VOAs of larger central
charge. The analogy with integral lattices and binary codes is emphasized.
  One main result is the construction of the shorter Moonshine module, a
self-dual SVOA of central charge 23.5 on which the Baby monster - the second
largest sporadic simple group - acts by automorphisms. The shorter Moonshine
module has the character q^(-47/48)*(1+ 4371q^(3/2)+ 96256q^2+ 1143745q^(5/2)
+...) and is the "shorter cousin" of the Moonshine module. Its lattice and code
analog are the shorter Leech lattice and shorter Golay code. We conjecture that
the shorter Moonshine module is the unique SVOA with this character.
  The final chapter introduces the notion of extremal VOAs and SVOAs. These are
self-dual (S)VOAs with character having the same first few coefficients as the
vacuum representation of the Virasoro algebra of the same central charge. We
show that extremal VOAs exist at least for the central charges 8, 16, 24, 32,
40 and that extremal SVOAs exist only for the central charges c=0.5, 1, ...,
7.5, 8, 12, 14, 15, 15.5, 23.5 and 24. Examples for c=24 (resp. 23.5) are the
(shorter) Moonshine module. Again, our results are similar to results known for
codes and lattices.
