We have investigated the peculiar motions of clusters of galaxies in the Ursa
Major (UMa) supercluster and its neighborhood. Based on SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky
Survey) data, we have compiled a sample of early-type galaxies and used their
fundamental plane to determine the cluster distances and peculiar velocities.
The samples of early-type galaxies in the central regions (within R_200) of 12
UMa clusters of galaxies, in three main subsystems of the supercluster -- the
filamentary structures connecting the clusters, and in nine clusters from the
nearest UMa neighborhood have similar parameters. The fairly high overdensity
(3 by the galaxy number and 15 by the cluster number) suggests that the
supercluster as a whole is gravitationally bound, while no significant peculiar
motions have been found: the peculiar velocities do not exceed the measurement
errors by more than a factor of 1.5-2. The mean random peculiar velocities of
clusters and the systematic deviations from the overall Hubble expansion in the
supercluster are consistent with theoretical estimates. For the possible
approach of the three UMa subsystems to be confirmed, the measurement accuracy
must be increased by a factor of 2-3.
