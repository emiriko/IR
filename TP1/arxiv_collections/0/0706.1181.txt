The effect of an intense external linear polarized radiation field on the
angular distributions and polarization states of the photons emitted during the
radiative recombination is investigated. It is predicted, on symmetry grounds,
and corroborated by numerical calculations of approximate recombination rates,
that emission of elliptically polarized photons occurs when the momentum of the
electron beam is not aligned to the direction of the oscillating field.
Moreover, strong modifications to the angular distributions of the emitted
photons are induced by the external radiation field.
