Recently it was shown that the eigenfunctions for the the asymmetric
exclusion problem and several of its generalizations as well as a huge family
of quantum chains, like the anisotropic Heisenberg model, Fateev- Zamolodchikov
model, Izergin-Korepin model, Sutherland model, t-J model, Hubbard model, etc,
can be expressed by a matrix product ansatz. Differently from the coordinate
Bethe ansatz, where the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are plane wave
combinations, in this ansatz the components of the eigenfunctions are obtained
through the algebraic properties of properly defined matrices. In this work, we
introduce a formulation of a matrix product ansatz for the six-vertex model
with periodic boundary condition, which is the paradigmatic example of
integrability in two dimensions. Remarkably, our studies of the six-vertex
model are in agreement with the conjecture that all models exactly solved by
the Bethe ansatz can also be solved by an appropriated matrix product ansatz.
