Transitions between metabasins in supercooled liquids seem to occur through
rapid "democratic" collective particle rearrangements. Here we show that this
apparent homogeneous particle motion is a direct consequence of dynamic
facilitation. We do so by studying metabasin transitions in facilitated spin
models and constrained lattice gases. We find that metabasin transitions occur
through a sequence of locally facilitated events taking place over a relatively
short time frame. When observed on small enough spatial windows these events
appear sudden and homogeneous. Our results indicate that metabasin transitions
are essentially "non-democratic" in origin and yet another manifestation of
dynamical heterogeneity in glass formers.
