In this paper we give explicit construction of massive N=1 supermultiplets in
flat d=4 Minkowski space-time. We work in a component on-shell formalism based
on gauge invariant description of massive integer and half-integer spin
particles where massive supermultiplets are constructed out of appropriate set
of massless ones.
