A summary of recent results on B rare decays from the CDF and D0 experiments
operating in Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron is given; analyzed decay modes are
B_{d,s}--> hh, B_{d,s}--> mu^{+}mu^{-}, and B--> mu^{+} mu^{-}h. Data samples
are relative to 1 fb^{-1} or more integrated luminosity of p-pbar collisions at
sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV. All reported results are in agreement with Standard Model
predictions and consistent with B-Factories analyzes.
