Attosecond laser pulses open the door to resolve microscopic electron
dynamics in time. Experiments performed include the decay of a core hole, the
time-resolved measurement of photo ionization and electron tunneling. The
processes investigated share the coherent character of the dynamics involving
very few, ideally one active electron. Here, we introduce a scheme to probe
dissipative multi-electron motion in time. In this context attosecond probing
enables one to obtain information which is lost at later times and cannot be
retrieved by conventional methods in the energy domain due to the incoherent
nature of the dynamics. As a specific example we will discuss the charging of a
rare-gas cluster during a strong femtosecond pulse with attosecond pulses. The
example illustrates the proposed use of attosecond pulses and suggests an
experimental resolution of a controversy about the mechanism of energy
absorption by rare-gas clusters in strong vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) pulses.
