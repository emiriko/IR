We present Very Large Array observations at 7 millimeters wavelength that
resolve the dust emission structure in the disk around the young star TW Hydrae
at the scale of the ~4 AU (~0.16") radius inner hole inferred from spectral
energy distribution modeling. These high resolution data confirm directly the
presence of an inner hole in the dust disk and reveal a high brightness ring
that we associate with the directly illuminated inner edge of the disk. The
clearing of the inner disk plausibly results from the dynamical effects of a
giant planet in formation. In an appendix, we develop an analytical framework
for the interpretation of visibility curves from power-law disk models with
inner holes.
