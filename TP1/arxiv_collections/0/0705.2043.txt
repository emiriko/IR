The extended Hubbard Hamiltonian is a widely accepted model for uncovering
the effects of strong correlations on the phase diagram of low-dimensional
systems, and a variety of theoretical techniques have been applied to it. In
this paper the world-line quantum Monte Carlo method is used to study spin,
charge, and bond order correlations of the one-dimensional extended Hubbard
model in the presence of coupling to the lattice. A static alternating lattice
distortion (the ionic Hubbard model) leads to enhanced charge density wave
correlations at the expense of antiferromagnetic order. When the lattice
degrees of freedom are dynamic (the Hubbard-Holstein model), we show that a
similar effect occurs even though the charge asymmetry must arise
spontaneously. Although the evolution of the total energy with lattice coupling
is smooth, the individual components exhibit sharp crossovers at the phase
boundaries. Finally, we observe a tendency for bond order in the region between
the charge and spin density wave phases.
