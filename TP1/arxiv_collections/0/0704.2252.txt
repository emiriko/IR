Negative differential conductivity is reported for the far from equilibrium
quantum spin transport in the insulating regime (J_x < J_z) of finite
Heisenberg XXZ spin 1/2 chains. The phenomenon is reproduced analytically for
small chains of N=4 spins and further analyzed numerically, for up to N=16,
using an efficient pure-state simulation with stochastic spin baths.
