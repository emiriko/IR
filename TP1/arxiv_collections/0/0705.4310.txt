The so-called stripe phase of the manganites is an important example of the
complex behaviour of metal oxides, and has long been interpreted as the
localisation of charge at atomic sites. Here, we demonstrate via resistance
measurements on La_{0.50}Ca_{0.50}MnO_3 that this state is in fact a
prototypical charge density wave (CDW) which undergoes collective transport.
Dramatic resistance hysteresis effects and broadband noise properties are
observed, both of which are typical of sliding CDW systems. Moreover, the high
levels of disorder typical of manganites result in behaviour similar to that of
well-known disordered CDW materials. Our discovery that the manganite
superstructure is a CDW shows that unusual transport and structural properties
do not require exotic physics, but can emerge when a well-understood phase (the
CDW) coexists with disorder.
