A static light scattering (SLS) study of bovine serum albumin (BSA) mixtures
with two anionic graft copolymers of poly (sodium acrylate-co-sodium
2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulphonate)-graft-poly (N,
N-dimethylacrylamide), with a high composition in poly (N,
N-dimethylacrylamide) (PDMAM) side chains, revealed the formation of oppositely
charged complexes, at pH lower than 4.9, the isoelectric point of BSA. The
core-corona nanoparticles formed at pH = 3.00, were characterized. Their
molecular weight and radius of gyration were determined by SLS, while their
hydrodynamic radius was determined by dynamic light scattering. Small angle
neutron scattering measurements were used to determine the radius of the
insoluble complexes, comprising the core of the particles. The values obtained
indicated that their size and aggregation number of the nanoparticles, were
smaller when the content of the graft copolymers in neutral PDMAM side chains
was higher. Such particles should be interesting drug delivery candidates, if
the gastrointestinal tract was to be used.
