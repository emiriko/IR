Long-standing discrepancies within determinations of the Ginzburg-Landau
parameter $\kappa$ from supercritical field measurements on superconducting
microspheres are reexamined. The discrepancy in tin is shown to result from
differing methods of analyses, whereas the discrepancy in indium is a
consequence of significantly differing experimental results. The reanalyses
however confirms the lower $\kappa$ determinations to within experimental
uncertainties.
