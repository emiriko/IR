Using pulsed laser ablation with arsenic over pressure, the growth conditions
for GaAs nanowires have been systematically investigated and optimized. Arsenic
over pressure with As$_2$ molecules was introduced to the system by thermal
decomposition of polycrystalline GaAs to control the stoichiometry and shape of
the nanowires during growth. GaAs nanowires exhibit a variety of geometries
under varying arsenic over pressure, which can be understood by different
growth processes via vapor-liquid-solid mechanism. Single-crystal GaAs
nanowires with uniform diameter, lengths over 20 $\mu$m, and thin surface oxide
layer were obtained and can potentially be used for further electronic
characterization.
