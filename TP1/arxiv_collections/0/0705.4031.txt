For thermoelectric, galvanomagnetic and some other effects there may
simultaneously exist two percolation thresholds, close to which the effective
kinetic coefficients of macroscopically disordered media are critically
dependent on the proximity to percolation thresholds, their behavior being
described by universal critical indexes.
