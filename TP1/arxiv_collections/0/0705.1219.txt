We have analyzed and designed an organic high speed digital optical switch
(DOS) based on transverse electro-optic effect. In analysis section, we
proposed a quantum photonic model (QPM) to explain linear electro-optic (EO)
effect. This model interpret this effect by photon-electron interaction in
attosecond regime. We simulate applied electric field on molecule and crystal
by Monte-Carlo method in time domain. We show how a waveguide response to an
optical signal with different wavelengths when a transverse electric field
applied to the waveguide. In design section, we configure conceptually a 2 * 2
EO switch with full adiabatic coupler. In this DOS, we use a rib waveguides
that its core has been constructed from NPP crystal. This switch is smaller at
least to one-half of similar DOS in dimensions.
