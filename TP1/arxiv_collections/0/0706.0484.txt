Modern society is permeated with computers, and the software that controls
them can have latent, long-term, and immediate effects that reach far beyond
the actual users of these systems. This places researchers in Computer Science
and Software Engineering in a critical position of influence and
responsibility, more than any other field because computer systems are vital
research tools for other disciplines. This essay presents several key ethical
concerns and responsibilities relating to research in computing. The goal is to
promote awareness and discussion of ethical issues among computer science
researchers. A hypothetical case study is provided, along with questions for
reflection and discussion.
