One of the key motivations for supersymmetry is that it provides a natural
candidate for dark matter. For a long time the density of this candidate
particle fell within cosmological bounds across much of the SUSY parameter
space. However with the precision results of WMAP, it has become apparent that
the majority of the SUSY parameter space no longer fits the observed relic
density. This has given rise to claims that supersymmetry no longer provides a
natural explanation of dark matter. We address this claim by quantifying the
degree of fine-tuning required for the different dark matter regions. We find
that the dark matter regions vary widely in the degree of tuning required. This
degree of tuning can then be used to provide valuable insights into the
structure of SUSY breaking at the GUT scale.
