We study stability conditions induced by functors between triangulated
categories. Given a finite group acting on a smooth projective variety we prove
that the subset of invariant stability conditions embeds as a closed
submanifold into the stability manifold of the equivariant derived category. As
an application we examine stability conditions on Kummer and Enriques surfaces
and we improve the derived version of the Torelli Theorem for the latter
surfaces already present in the litterature. We also study the relationship
between stability conditions on projective spaces and those on their canonical
bundles.
