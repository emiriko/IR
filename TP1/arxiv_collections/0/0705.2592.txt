One of the most notorious non-Fermi liquid properties of both archetypal
heavy-fermion systems [1-4] and the high-Tc copper oxide superconductors [5] is
an electrical resistivity that evolves linearly with temperature, T. In the
heavy-fermion superconductor CeCoIn5 [5], this linear behaviour was one of the
first indications of the presence of a zero-temperature instability, or quantum
critical point. Here, we report the observation of a unique control parameter
of T-linear scattering in CeCoIn5, found through systematic chemical
substitutions of both magnetic and non-magnetic rare-earth, R, ions into the Ce
sub-lattice. We find that the evolution of inelastic scattering in Ce1-xRxCoIn5
is strongly dependent on the f-electron configuration of the R ion, whereas two
other key properties -- Cooper-pair breaking and Kondo-lattice coherence -- are
not. Thus, T-linear resistivity in CeCoIn5 is intimately related to the nature
of incoherent scattering centers in the Kondo lattice, which provides insight
into the anomalous scattering rate synonymous with quantum criticality [7].
