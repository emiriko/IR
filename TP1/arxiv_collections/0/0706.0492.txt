We study the conditions for the probing of an environment affecting one party
of a bipartite system of interacting objects by measurements operated only on
the other element. We show that entanglement plays no crucial role in such an
environment-characterization. On the other hand, if an interaction is
established between the two parties, information can be reliably gathered. This
result holds for both discrete and continuous variables and helps in the
interpretation of recent experiments addressing the properties of mesoscopic
objects.
