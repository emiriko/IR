We show that the Galactic thick disk reaches at least solar metallicities,
and that it experienced strong chemical enrichment during a period of ~3 Gyr,
ending around 8-9 Gyr ago. This finding puts further constraints on the
relation and interface between the thin and thick disks, and their formation
processes. Our results are based on a detailed elemental abundance analysis of
261 kinematically selected F and G dwarf stars in the solar neighborhood: 194
likely members of the thick disk and 67 likely members of the thin disk, in the
range -1.3<[Fe/H]<+0.4.
