In a previous paper, new sets of parameters to replace the Michel parameters
were proposed to analyze data for the muon decay $\mu^{+} \to
e^{+}\nu_{e}\bar{\nu_{\mu}}$. Both $(V-A)$ and $(V+A)$ charged currents with
finite neutrino mass have been used to study this decay. In the present paper,
this parameterization is extended to a more general form, and a method for data
analysis (least squares) is discussed for the propose of determining the rate
of contribution from the $(V+A)$ current. We find that there is a simple form
in which the set of parameters is related primitively to the physical
quantities. It is shown that the Michel parameters are one of the other sets
that are obtained from this simple form by rearranging one term. We derive the
condition to obtain the same information regarding unknown physical quantities
in the case that the data are analyzed using these simple and rearranged forms
separately. We find that there is some possibility to get different results
from these analyses, because the equivalent condition is very delicate and the
QED radiative corrections should be treated carefully. We propose a consistent
formula for data analysis. It is useful to compare the value obtained in the
least squares fit using the simple form with that obtained using the prediction
of the standard model, because a large difference is not expected, especially
in the case of the Majorana neutrino. Finally, we point out that the method we
proposed to determine the type of neutrino in the previous paper is incorrect.
