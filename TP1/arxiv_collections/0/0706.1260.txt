The magnon and optical phonon spectrum of an incommensurate multiferroic such
as BiFeO3 is considered in the framework of a phenomenological Landau theory.
The resulting spin wave spectrum is quite distinct from commensurate substances
due to soft mode anisotropy and magnon zone folding. The former allows
electrical control of spin wave propagation via reorientation of the
spontaneous ferroelectric moment. The latter gives rise to multiple
magneto-dielectric resonances due to the coupling of optical phonons at zero
wavevector to magnons at integer multiples of the cycloid wavevector. These
results show that the optical response of a multiferroic reveals much more
about its magnetic excitations than previously anticipated on the basis of
simpler models.
