Employing Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) deep magnetograms and H${\alpha}$
images in a quiet region and a coronal hole, observed on September 14 and 16,
2004, respectively, we have explored the magnetic flux emergence, disappearance
and distribution in the two regions. The following results are obtained: (1)
The evolution of magnetic flux in the quiet region is much faster than that in
the coronal hole, as the flux appeared in the form of ephemeral regions in the
quiet region is 4.3 times as large as that in the coronal hole, and the flux
disappeared in the form of flux cancellation, 2.9 times as fast as in the
coronal hole. (2) More magnetic elements with opposite polarities in the quiet
region are connected by arch filaments, estimating from magnetograms and
H${\alpha}$ images. (3) We measured the magnetic flux of about 1000 magnetic
elements in each observing region. The flux distribution of network and
intranetwork (IN) elements is similar in both polarities in the quiet region.
For network fields in the coronal hole, the number of negative elements is much
more than that of positive elements. However for the IN fields, the number of
positive elements is much more than that of negative elements. (4) In the
coronal hole, the fraction of negative flux change obviously with different
threshold flux density. 73% of the magnetic fields with flux density larger
than 2 Gauss is negative polarity, and 95% of the magnetic fields is negative,
if we only measure the fields with their flux density larger than 20 Gauss. Our
results display that in a coronal hole, stronger fields is occupied by one
predominant polarity; however the majority of weaker fields, occupied by the
other polarity.
