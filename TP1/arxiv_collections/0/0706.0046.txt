In this paper, we propose a useful replacement for quicksort-style utility
functions. The replacement is called Symmetry Partition Sort, which has
essentially the same principle as Proportion Extend Sort. The maximal
difference between them is that the new algorithm always places already
partially sorted inputs (used as a basis for the proportional extension) on
both ends when entering the partition routine. This is advantageous to speeding
up the partition routine. The library function based on the new algorithm is
more attractive than Psort which is a library function introduced in 2004. Its
implementation mechanism is simple. The source code is clearer. The speed is
faster, with O(n log n) performance guarantee. Both the robustness and
adaptivity are better. As a library function, it is competitive.
