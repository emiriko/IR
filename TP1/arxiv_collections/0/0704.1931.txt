We propose a scalable approach to building cluster states of matter qubits
using coherent states of light. Recent work on the subject relies on the use of
single photonic qubits in the measurement process. These schemes have a low
initial success probability and low detector efficiencies cause a serious
blowup in resources. In contrast, our approach uses continuous variables and
highly efficient measurements. We present a two-qubit scheme, with a simple
homodyne measurement system yielding an entangling operation with success
probability 1/2. Then we extend this to a three-qubit interaction, increasing
this probability to 3/4. We discuss the important issues of the overhead cost
and the time scaling, showing how these can be vastly improved with access to
this new probability range.
