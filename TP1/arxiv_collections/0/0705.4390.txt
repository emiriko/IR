Epitaxial thin films of Bi2FeCrO6 have been synthesized by pulsed laser
deposition on SrRuO3 on (100)- and (111)-oriented SrTiO3 substrates. Detailed
X-ray diffraction and cross-section transmission electron microscopy analysis
revealed a double perovskite crystal structure of the Bi2FeCrO6 epitaxial films
very similar to that of BiFeO3 along with a particularly noteworthy Fe3+/Cr3+
cation ordering along the [111] direction. The films contain no detectable
magnetic iron oxide impurities and have the correct cationic average
stoichiometry throughout their thickness. They however exhibit a slight
modulation in the Fe and Cr compositions forming complementary stripe patterns,
suggesting minor local excess or depletion of Fe and Cr. The epitaxial BFCO
films exhibit good ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties, in addition to
magnetic properties at room temperature, as well as an unexpected
crystallographic orientation dependence of their room temperature magnetic
properties. Our results qualitatively confirm the predictions made using the
ab-initio calculations: the double-perovskite structure of Bi2FeCrO6 films
exhibit a Fe3+/Cr3+ cation ordering and good multiferroic properties, along
with the unpredicted existence of magnetic ordering at room temperature.
