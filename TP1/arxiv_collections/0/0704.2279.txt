We study how rotation affects observable amplitudes of high-order g- and
mixed r/g-modes and examine prospects for their detection and identification.
Our formalism, which is described in some detail, relies on a nonadiabatic
generalization of the traditional approximation. Numerical results are
presented for a number of unstable modes in a model of SPB star, at rotation
rates up to 250 km/s. It is shown that rotation has a large effect on mode
visibility in light and in mean radial velocity variations. In most cases, fast
rotation impairs mode detectability of g-modes in light variation, as Townsend
(2003b) has already noted, but it helps detection in radial velocity variation.
The mixed modes, which exist only at sufficiently fast rotation, are also more
easily seen in radial velocity. The amplitude ratios and phase differences are
strongly dependent on the aspect, the rotational velocity and on the mode. The
latter dependence is essential for mode identification.
