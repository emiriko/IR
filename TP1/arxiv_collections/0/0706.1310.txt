These lecture notes are meant to serve as an introduction to some geometric
constructions and techniques (in particular the ones of toric geometry) often
employed by the physicist working on string theory compactifications. The
emphasis is wholly on the geometry side, not on the physics.
  The treated topics include toroidal orbifolds, methods of toric geometry,
desinglularization of toroidal orbifolds and their orientifold quotients.
