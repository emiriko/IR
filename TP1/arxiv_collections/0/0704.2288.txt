Feedback from black hole activity is widely believed to play a key role in
regulating star formation and black hole growth. A long-standing issue is the
relation between the star formation and fueling the supermassive black holes in
active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We compile a sample of 57 Seyfert galaxies to
tackle this issue. We estimate the surface densities of gas and star formation
rates in circumnuclear regions (CNRs). Comparing with the well-known
Kennicutt-Schmidt (K-S) law, we find that the star formation rates in CNRs of
most Seyfert galaxies are suppressed in this sample. Feedback is suggested to
explain the suppressed star formation rates.
