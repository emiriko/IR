We report $^{63,65}$Cu NQR measurements on slightly underdoped
NdBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6+y}$ single crystals heavily doped by Ni and Zn
impurities. Owing to the impurity doping superconductivity is fully suppressed
in both cases. The Ni strongly enhances magnetic correlations and induces a
wipeout of the NQR signal comparable to that found in stripe ordered lanthanum
cuprates. In contrast, the magnetism is suppressed in the Zn doped sample where
no wipeout effect is observed and the nuclear spin relaxation rate is reduced.
Our findings are in a striking correspondence with the different impact of Ni
and Zn impurities on the charge pseudogap evidenced by recent optical data,
uncovering thereby a close relationship between the magnetic correlations and
pseudogap phenomena.
