Using data collected with the CLEO III detector at the Cornell Electron
Storage Ring, we study the inclusive production of baryons/antibaryons (p, /)
and mesons (phi and f_2(1270)) in gluon-fragmentation and quark-fragmentation
processes. We first corroborate previous per-event total particle yields in
Upsilon(1S)->ggg compared with nearby continuum (e+e- -> qqbar) indicating
greater (x2) per-event yields of baryons in 3-gluon fragmentation. We find
similar results when we extend that comparison to include the Upsilon(2S) and
Upsilon(3S) resonances. With higher statistics, we now also probe the momentum
dependence of these per-event particle yields. Next, we compare particle
production in the photon-tagged process Upsilon(1S)->gggamma with that in e+e-
-> qqbar events, to allow comparison of two-parton with three-parton
particle-specific fragmentation. For each particle, we determine the
`enhancement' ratio, defined as the ratio of particle yields per gluon
fragmentation event compared to quark fragmentation event. Thus defined, an
enhancement of 1.0 implies equal per-event production in both gluon and quark
fragmentation. In the photon-tagged analysis (U(1S)->gggamma compared to e+e-
-> qqbar+gamma), we find almost no enhancement for protons (1.2+/-0.1), but a
significant enhancement (1.9+/-0.3) for /\'s. Overall, per-event baryon
production in radiative two-gluon fragmentation is somewhat smaller than that
observed in three-gluon decays of the Upsilon(1S). Our results for baryon
production are inconsistent with the predictions of the JETSET (7.3)
fragmentation model.
