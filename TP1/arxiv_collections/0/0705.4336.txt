Recently, it has been suggested that Hawking radiation can be derived from
quantum tunnelling methods. In this letter, we calculated Hawking temperature
of dilatonic black holes from tunnelling formalism. The two semi-classical
methods adopted here are: the null-geodesic method proposed by Parikh and
Wilczek and the Hamilton-Jacobi method propsed by Angheben et al. We apply the
two methods to anylysis the Hawking temperature of the static spherical
symmetric dilatonic black hole, the rotating Kaluza-Klein black hole, and the
rotating Kerr-Sen black hole.
