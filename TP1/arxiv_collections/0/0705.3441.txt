An empirical method for correcting low-resolution astronomical spectra for
second-order contamination is presented. The method was developed for
correcting spectra obtained with grism #4 of the ALFOSC spectrograph at the
Nordic Optical Telescope and the performance is demonstrated on spectra of two
nearby bright Type Ia supernovae.
