The exact relativistic form for the beta decay endpoint spectrum is derived
and presented in a simple factorized form. We show that our exact formula can
be well approximated to yield the endpoint form used in the fit method of the
KATRIN collaboration. We also discuss the three neutrino case and how
information from neutrino oscillation experiments may be useful in analyzing
future beta decay endpoint experiments.
