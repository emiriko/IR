We propose that the rich-club phenomena in complex networks should be defined
in the spirit of bootstrapping, in which a null model is adopted to assess the
statistical significance of the rich-club detected. Our method can be served as
a definition of rich-club phenomenon and is applied to analyzing three real
networks and three model networks. The results improve significantly compared
with previously reported results. We report a dilemma with an exceptional
example, showing that there does not exist an omnipotent definition for the
rich-club phenomenon.
