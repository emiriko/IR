We propose two alternatives to Xu's axiomatization of the Chellas STIT. The
first one also provides an alternative axiomatization of the deliberative STIT.
The second one starts from the idea that the historic necessity operator can be
defined as an abbreviation of operators of agency, and can thus be eliminated
from the logic of the Chellas STIT. The second axiomatization also allows us to
establish that the problem of deciding the satisfiability of a STIT formula
without temporal operators is NP-complete in the single-agent case, and is
NEXPTIME-complete in the multiagent case, both for the deliberative and the
Chellas' STIT.
