We consider global and gravitational lensing properties of the recently
suggested Einstein clusters of WIMPs as galactic dark matter halos. Being
tangential pressure dominated, Einstein clusters are strongly anisotropic
systems which can describe any galactic rotation curve by specifying the
anisotropy. Due to this property, Einstein clusters may be considered as dark
matter candidates. We analyse the stability of the Einstein clusters against
both radial and non-radial pulsations, and we show that the Einstein clusters
are dynamically stable. With the use of the Buchdahl type inequalities for
anisotropic bodies, we derive upper limits on the velocity of the particles
defining the cluster. These limits are consistent with those obtained from
stability considerations. The study of light deflection shows that the
gravitational lensing effect is slightly smaller for the Einstein clusters, as
compared to the singular isothermal density sphere model for dark matter.
Therefore lensing observations may discriminate, at least in principle, between
Einstein cluster and other dark matter models.
