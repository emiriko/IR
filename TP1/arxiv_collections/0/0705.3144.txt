In this paper we investigate the impact of the floating-point precision and
interpolation scheme on the results of direct numerical simulations (DNS) of
turbulence by pseudo-spectral codes. Three different types of floating-point
precision configurations show no differences in the statistical results. This
implies that single precision computations allow for increased Reynolds numbers
due to the reduced amount of memory needed. The interpolation scheme for
obtaining velocity values at particle positions has a noticeable impact on the
Lagrangian acceleration statistics. A tri-cubic scheme results in a slightly
broader acceleration probability density function than a tri-linear scheme.
Furthermore the scaling behavior obtained by the cubic interpolation scheme
exhibits a tendency towards a slightly increased degree of intermittency
compared to the linear one.
