The linear entropy, the von Neumann entropy and the atomic Wehrl entropy are
frequently used to quantify entanglement in the quantum systems. These
relations provide typical information on the entanglement in the
Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM). In this Letter, we explain the origin of this
analytically and derive a closed form for the atomic Wehrl entropy. Moreover,
we show that it is more convenient to use the Bloch sphere radius for
quantifying entanglement in the JCM instead of these entropic relations.
