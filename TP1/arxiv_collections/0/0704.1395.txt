The phenomenology of the low scale U(1)_{B-L} extension of the standard model
and its implications at LHC is presented. In this model, an extra gauge boson
corresponding to B-L gauge symmetry and an extra SM singlet scalar (heavy
Higgs) are predicted. We show a detailed analysis of both heavy and light
Higgses decay and production in addition to the possible decay channels of the
new gauge boson. We find that the cross sections of the SM-like Higgs
production are reduced by ~ 20%-30%, while its decay branching ratios remain
intact. The extra Higgs has relatively small cross sections and the branching
ratios of Z'-> l^+ l^- are of order ~20% compared to ~ 3% of the SM resuls.
Hence, the search for Z' is accessible via a clean dilepton signal at LHC.
