A self-control mechanism that stabilizes the size of Rhodamine B-doped water
microdroplets standing on a superhydrophobic surface is demonstrated. The
mechanism relies on the interplay between the condensation rate that was kept
constant and evaporation rate induced by laser excitation which critically
depends on the size of the microdroplets. The radii of individual water
microdroplets (>5 um) stayed within a few nanometers during long time periods
(up to 455 seconds). By blocking the laser excitation for 500 msec, the stable
volume of individual microdroplets was shown to change stepwise.
