In the present work we take the non relativistic limit of relativistic models
and compare the obtained functionals with the usual Skyrme parametrization.
Relativistic models with both constant couplings and with density dependent
couplings are considered. While some models present very good results already
at the lowest order in the density, models with non-linear terms only reproduce
the energy functional if higher order terms are taken into account in the
expansion.
