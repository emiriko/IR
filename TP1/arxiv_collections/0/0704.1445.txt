The spatial Fourier spectrum of the electron density distribution in a finite
1D system and the distribution function of electrons over single-particle
states are studied in detail to show that there are two universal features in
their behavior, which characterize the electron ordering and the deformation of
Wigner crystal by boundaries. The distribution function has a $\delta$-like
singularity at the Fermi momentum $k_F$. The Fourier spectrum of the density
has a step-like form at the wavevector $2k_F$, with the harmonics being absent
or vanishing above this threshold. These features are found by calculations
using exact diagonalization method. They are shown to be caused by Wigner
ordering of electrons, affected by the boundaries. However the common Luttinger
liquid model with open boundaries fails to capture these features, because it
overestimates the deformation of the Wigner crystal. An improvement of the
Luttinger liquid model is proposed which allows one to describe the above
features correctly. It is based on the corrected form of the density operator
conserving the particle number.
