We study the interplay between correlation, itinerant ferromagnetism and
local moment formation on the electron doped triangular lattice of sodium
cobaltates Na$_x$CoO$_2$. We find that strong correlation renormalizes the
Stoner criterion and stabilizes the paramagnetic state for $x<x_c\simeq0.67$.
For $x>x_c$, ferromagnetic (FM) order emerges. The enhanced Na dopant potential
fluctuations play a crucial role in the sodium rich phases and lead to an
inhomogeneous FM state, exhibiting nonmagnetic Co$^{3+}$ patches,
antiferromagnetic (AF) correlated regions, and FM clusters with AF domains.
Hole doping the band insulator at x=1 leads to the formation of local moments
near the Na vacancies and AF correlated magnetic clusters. We explain recent
observations by neutron, $\mu$SR, and NMR experiments on the evolution of the
magnetic properties in the sodium rich phases.
