An effective field theory model of the massive Yang-Mills theory is
considered. Assuming that the renormalized coupling constants of
'non-renormalizable' interactions are suppressed by a large scale parameter it
is shown that in analogy to the non-abelian gauge invariant theory the
dimensionless coupling constant vanishes logarithmically for large values of
the renormalization scale parameter.
