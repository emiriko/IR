We examine the nature of large-scale, coronal, propagating wave fronts (``EIT
waves'') and find they are incongruous with solutions using fast-mode MHD
plane-wave theory. Specifically, we consider the following properties:
non-dispersive single pulse manifestions, observed velocities below the local
Alfven speed, and different pulses which travel at any number of constant
velocities, rather than at the ``predicted'' fast-mode speed. We discuss the
possibility of a soliton-like explanation for these phenomena, and show how it
is consistent with the above-mentioned aspects.
