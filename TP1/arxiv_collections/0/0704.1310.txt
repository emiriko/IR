The celebrated Thistlethwaite theorem relates the Jones polynomial of a link
with the Tutte polynomial of the corresponding planar graph. We give a
generalization of this theorem to virtual links. In this case, the graph will
be embedded into a (higher genus) surface. For such graphs we use the
generalization of the Tutte polynomial discovered by B.Bollobas and O.Riordan.
