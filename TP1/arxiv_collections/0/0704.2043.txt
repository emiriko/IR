We present a novel comprehensive first-principles theoretical study of the
electronic properties and relative stabilities of edge-oxidized zigzag graphene
nanoribbons. The oxidation schemes considered include hydroxyl, carboxyl,
ether, and ketone groups. Using screened exchange density functional theory, we
show that these oxidized ribbons are more stable than hydrogen-terminated
nanoribbons except for the case of the etheric groups. The stable oxidized
configurations maintain a spin-polarized ground state with antiferromagnetic
ordering localized at the edges, similar to the fully hydrogenated
counterparts. More important, edge oxidation is found to lower the onset
electric field required to induce half-metallic behavior and extend the overall
field range at which the systems remain half-metallic. Once the half-metallic
state is reached, further increase of the external electric field intensity
produces a rapid decrease in the spin magnetization up to a point where the
magnetization is quenched completely. Finally, we find that oxygen containing
edge groups have a minor effect on the energy difference between the
antiferromagnetic ground state and the above-lying ferromagnetic state.
