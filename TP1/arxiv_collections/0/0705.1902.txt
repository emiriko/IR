The renormalizable Abelian quantum field theory model of Kroll, Lee, and
Zumino is used to compute the one-loop vertex corrections to the tree-level,
Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) pion form factor. These corrections, together with
the known one-loop vacuum polarization contribution, lead to a substantial
improvement over VMD. The resulting pion form factor in the space-like region
is in excellent agreement with data in the whole range of accessible momentum
transfers. The time-like form factor, known to reproduce the Gounaris-Sakurai
formula at and near the rho-meson peak, is unaffected by the vertex correction
at order $\cal{O}$$(g_\rpp^2)$.
