In this paper we discuss new types of differential equations which we call
anticipated backward stochastic differential equations (anticipated BSDEs). In
these equations the generator includes not only the values of solutions of the
present but also the future. We show that these anticipated BSDEs have unique
solutions, a comparison theorem for their solutions, and a duality between them
and stochastic differential delay equations.
