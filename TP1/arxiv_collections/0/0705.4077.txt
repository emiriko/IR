We study the computational strength of quantum particles (each of finite
dimensionality) arranged on a line. First, we prove that it is possible to
perform universal adiabatic quantum computation using a one-dimensional quantum
system (with 9 states per particle). This might have practical implications for
experimentalists interested in constructing an adiabatic quantum computer.
Building on the same construction, but with some additional technical effort
and 12 states per particle, we show that the problem of approximating the
ground state energy of a system composed of a line of quantum particles is
QMA-complete; QMA is a quantum analogue of NP. This is in striking contrast to
the fact that the analogous classical problem, namely, one-dimensional
MAX-2-SAT with nearest neighbor constraints, is in P. The proof of the
QMA-completeness result requires an additional idea beyond the usual techniques
in the area: Not all illegal configurations can be ruled out by local checks,
so instead we rule out such illegal configurations because they would, in the
future, evolve into a state which can be seen locally to be illegal. Our
construction implies (assuming the quantum Church-Turing thesis and that
quantum computers cannot efficiently solve QMA-complete problems) that there
are one-dimensional systems which take an exponential time to relax to their
ground states at any temperature, making them candidates for being
one-dimensional spin glasses.
