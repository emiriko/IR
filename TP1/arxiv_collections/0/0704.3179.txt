We demonstrate the possibility of controlling the border between the quantum
and the classical world by performing nonselective measurements on quantum
systems. We consider a quantum harmonic oscillator initially prepared in a
Schroedinger cat state and interacting with its environment. We show that the
environment induced decoherence transforming the cat state into a statistical
mixture can be strongly inhibited by means of appropriate sequences of
measurements.
