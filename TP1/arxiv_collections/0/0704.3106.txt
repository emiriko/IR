The newly discovered brown-dwarf eclipsing binary 2MASS J05352184-0546085
provides a unique laboratory for testing the predictions of theoretical models
of brown-dwarf formation and evolution. The finding that the lower-mass brown
dwarf in this system is hotter than its higher-mass companion represents a
challenge to brown-dwarf evolutionary models, none of which predict this
behavior. Here we present updated determinations of the basic physical
properties of 2M0535-05, bolstering the surprising reversal of temperatures
with mass in this system. We compare these measurements with widely used
brown-dwarf evolutionary tracks, and find that the temperature reversal can be
explained by some models if the components of 2M0535-05 are mildly non-coeval,
possibly consistent with dynamical simulations of brown-dwarf formation.
Alternatively, a strong magnetic field on the higher-mass brown dwarf might
explain its anomalously low surface temperature, consistent with emerging
evidence that convection is suppressed in magnetically active, low-mass stars.
Finally, we discuss future observational and theoretical work needed to further
characterize and understand this benchmark system.
