We study the superfluid to Mott insulator transition of bosons in a
two-legged ladder optical lattice, of a type accessible in current experiments
on double-well optical lattices. The zero-temperature phase diagram is mapped
out, with a focus on its dependence upon interchain hopping and the tilt
between double wells. We find that the unit-filling Mott phase exhibits a
non-monotonic behavior as a function of the tilt parameter, producing a
reentrant phase transition between Mott insulator and superfluid phases.
