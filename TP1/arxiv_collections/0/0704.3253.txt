Quantum key distribution (QKD) systems can send signals over more than 100 km
standard optical fiber and are widely believed to be secure. Here, we show
experimentally for the first time a technologically feasible attack, namely the
time-shift attack, against a commercial QKD system. Our result shows that,
contrary to popular belief, an eavesdropper, Eve, has a non-negligible
probability (~4%) to break the security of the system. Eve's success is due to
the well-known detection efficiency loophole in the experimental testing of
Bell inequalities. Therefore, the detection efficiency loophole plays a key
role not only in fundamental physics, but also in technological applications
such as QKD.
