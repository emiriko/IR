A model of an emergent universe is obtained in brane world. Here the bulk
energy is in the form of cosmological constant, while the brane consists of the
Chaplygin gas with the modified equation of state such as $p=A\rho-B/\rho$.
Initially the brane matter for the special choice $A=1/3$ may have negative or
positive pressure depending on the relative magnitudes of the parameter $B$ and
the cosmological constant of the bulk, while asymptotically in future the brane
world approaches a $\Lambda$CDM model.
