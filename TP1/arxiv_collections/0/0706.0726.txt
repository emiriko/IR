In this Comment we compute the contributions of the radiation reaction force
in the 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) gravitational wave polarizations for compact
binaries in circular orbits. (i) We point out and correct an inconsistency in
the derivation of Arun, Blanchet, Iyer, and Qusailah. (ii) We prove that all
contributions from radiation reaction in the 2.5PN waveform are actually
negligible since they can be absorbed into a modification of the orbital phase
at the 5PN order.
