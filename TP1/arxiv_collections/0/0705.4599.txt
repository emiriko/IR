The scale invariant unparticle physics recently proposed by Georgi could
manifest at low energies as non integral number d_U of invisible particles.
Unparticles if existing, could couple to the Standard Model fields and
consequently affect the collider phenomenology. We consider the DY process to
explore effects of the peculiar propagator of the scalar and tensor unparticle
operators. To probe these effects at hadron collider one needs to go beyond LO
in QCD and hence the quantitative impact of QCD corrections for unparticle
physics at LHC is investigated. We present the K-factors at LHC. Inclusion of
QCD corrections to NLO stabilises the cross section with respect to scale
variations.
