Effective mass Schrodinger equation is solved exactly for a given potential.
Nikiforov-Uvarov method is used to obtain energy eigenvalues and the
corresponding wave functions. A free parameter is used in the transformation of
the wave function. The effective mass Schrodinger equation is also solved for
the Morse potential transforming to the constant mass Schr\"{o}dinger equation
for a potential. One can also get solution of the effective mass Schrodinger
equation starting from the constant mass Schrodinger equation.
