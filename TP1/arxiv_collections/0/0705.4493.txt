A vector-like colorless fermion doublet and a singlet added to the Standard
Model allow a consistent interpretation of dark matter in terms of the lightest
neutral particle, as they may help in obtaining successful gauge coupling
unification. We analyze in detail the mass range of the lightest neutral
particle below the W mass, i.e. in a range of the parameters where the physics
of the Standard Model Higgs boson may be substantially affected either directly
or indirectly.
