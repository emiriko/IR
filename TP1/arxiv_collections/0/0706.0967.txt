The basic one-bit gates (X, Y, Z, Hadamard, phase, pi/8) as well as the
controlled cnot and Toffoli gates are reformulated in the language of
geometric-algebra quantum-like computation. Thus, all the quantum algorithms
can be reformulated in purely geometric terms without any need of tensor
products.
