Calculations are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of Moon shadow
observations for mean primary energies in the region 0.5-1.5 TeV using a muon
detector operating under the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan, Mexico. Due to
the small height of that monument (65 m), the experiment is capable of
providing considerably high statistics, although with reduced angular accuracy
for primary particle direction reconstruction. Our estimates are based on
simulations of muon production and transport in the atmosphere by CORSIKA and
along the body of the pyramid by GEANT4. The deflection of primaries in the
earth magnetic field is calculated using the IGRF model. The statistics for the
Moon shadow observations, which depends on different factors affecting the
accuracy of the primary particle direction reconstruction, are analyzed in
detail.
