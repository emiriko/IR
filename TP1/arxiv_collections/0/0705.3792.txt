We present the initial results of multi-epoch VLBI observations of the 22 GHz
H2O masers in the Orion KL region with VERA (VLBI Exploration of Radio
Astrometry). With the VERA dual-beam receiving system, we have carried out
phase-referencing VLBI astrometry and successfully detected an annual parallax
of Orion KL to be 2.29+/-0.10 mas, corresponding to the distance of 437+/-19 pc
from the Sun. The distance to Orion KL is determined for the first time with
the annual parallax method in these observations. Although this value is
consistent with that of the previously reported, 480+/-80 pc, which is
estimated from the statistical parallax method using proper motions and radial
velocities of the H2O maser features, our new results provide the much more
accurate value with an uncertainty of only 4%. In addition to the annual
parallax, we have detected an absolute proper motion of the maser feature,
suggesting an outflow motion powered by the radio source I along with the
systematic motion of source I itself.
