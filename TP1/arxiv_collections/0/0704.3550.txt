We update the analytical estimate of the final spin of a coalescing
black-hole binary derived within the Effective-One-Body (EOB) approach. We
consider unequal-mass non-spinning black-hole binaries. It is found that a more
complete account of relevant physical effects (higher post-Newtonian accuracy,
ringdown losses) allows the {\it analytical} EOB estimate to `converge towards'
the recently obtained {\it numerical} results within 2%. This agreement
illustrates the ability of the EOB approach to capture the essential physics of
coalescing black-hole binaries. Our analytical approach allows one to estimate
the final spin of the black hole formed by coalescing binaries in a mass range
($\nu=m_1m_2/(m_1+m_2)^2 < 0.16 $) which is not presently covered by numerical
simulations.
