The fast changing reality in technical and natural domains perceived by
always more accurate observations has drawn attention on new and very broad
class of systems with specific behaviour represented under the common wording
complexity. From elementary system graph representation with components as
nodes and interactions as vertices, systems are shown to belong to only three
states : simple, complicated, and complex, the main properties of which are
discussed. The first two states have been studied at length over past
centuries, and last one finds its origin in the elementary fact that when
system performance is pushed up, there exists a threshold above which
interaction between components overtake outside interaction. Then system
self-organizes and filters corresponding outer action, making it more robust to
outer effect, with emergence of new behaviour not predictable from only
components study. Examples in Physics and Biology are given. Three main classes
of complexity behaviour are distinguished corresponding to different grades of
difficulty to handle their dynamics. The interest of using complex state
properties in man-made systems is stressed. Important issues concentrating on
the difficult balance between relative system isolation when becoming complex
and required delegation of corresponding new capability from (outside) operator
are discussed. This implies giving the system some intelligence in an adequate
frame between new augmented system state and supervising operator, with
consequences on canonical system triplet {effector-sensor-controller} to be
reorganized in this new setting. Moreover, entering complexity state opens the
possibility for function to feedback onto structure, ie to mimic at technical
level the invention of Nature over Her very long history.
