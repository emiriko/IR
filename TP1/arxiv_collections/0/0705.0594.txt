The recent PRB, henceforth referred as Ref.[1], experimentally resolves the
intrinsic shape of the c-axis current-voltage characteristics (IVC) of HTSC and
demonstrates that at sufficiently high heat loads the heating-induced IVC
nonlinearities exceed the intrinsic ones so radically that the latter might be
safely ignored.
  The author of the comment fails to take account of the experimental findings
by Ref.[1] and seeks to cast doubt on all its conclusions through reference to
a brush-like IVC, which is claimed to be free of heating. I will show that this
claim lacks substantiation; indeed it can be stated with certainty that the IVC
is not free from heating. I will further show that the data selected for this
comment make it possible to explore for the first time the effect of
temperature on a range of loads where the genuine response is not hidden by
heating and to demonstrate for the first time that $R(T)$ of the same sample is
responsible for a rich variety of IVC behaviours taken above and below $T_c$ at
bath temperatures spanned over 180K. Thus these data in fact provide strong
novel evidence in favour of the major conclusions by Ref.[1], in particular the
extrinsic cause of the key findings by intrinsic tunnelling spectroscopy.
