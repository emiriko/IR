The magnetoconductance of p-n junctions formed in clean single wall carbon
nanotubes is studied in the noninteracting electron approximation and
perturbatively in electron-electron interaction, in the geometry where a
magnetic field is along the tube axis. For long junctions the low temperature
magnetoconductance is anomalously large: the relative change in the conductance
becomes of order unity even when the flux through the tube is much smaller than
the flux quantum. The magnetoconductance is negative for metallic tubes. For
semiconducting and small gap tubes the magnetoconductance is nonmonotonic;
positive at small and negative at large fields.
