In the present review we make a comprehensive analysis of our understanding
on electron transport in mesoscopic single-channel rings and multi-channel
cylinders within a tight-binding framework. A spectacular mesoscopic phenomenon
where a non-decaying current circulates in a small conducting loop is observed
upon the application of an Aharonov-Bohm flux $\phi$. To understand its
behavior one has to focus attention on the interplay of quantum phase
coherence, electron-electron correlation and disorder. This is a highly
challenging problem and here we address it for some simple loop geometries with
their detailed energy band structures to get an entire picture at the
microscopic level. The behavior of low-field magnetic response of persistent
current and its temperature dependence are also discussed.
