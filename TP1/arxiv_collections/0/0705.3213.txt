We present a theoretical analysis of recent experimental measurements of
magnetoresistance in (Ga,Mn)As epilayers with perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy. The model reproduces the field-antisymmetric anomalies observed in
the longitudinal magnetoresistance in the planar geometry (magnetic field in
the epilayer plane and parallel to the current density), as well as the unusual
shape of the accompanying transverse magnetoresistance. The magnetoresistance
characteristics are attributed to circulating currents created by the presence
of magnetic domain walls.
