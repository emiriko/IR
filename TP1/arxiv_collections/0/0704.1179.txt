When ultrathin metal films are subjected to multiple cycles of rapid melting
and resolidification by a ns pulsed laser, spatially correlated interfacial
nanostructures can result from a competition among several possible thin film
self-organizing processes. Here we investigate self-organization and the
ensuing length scales when Co films (1-8 nm thick) on SiO_{\text{2}} surfaces
are repeatedly and rapidly melted by non-uniform (interference) laser
irradiation. Pattern evolution produces nanowires, which eventually break-up
into nanoparticles exhibiting spatial order in the nearest neighbor spacing,
\lambda_{NN2}.The scaling behavior is consistent with pattern formation by
thermocapillary flow and a Rayleigh-like instability. For h_{0}\leq2 nm, a
hydrodynamic instability of a spinodally unstable film leads to the formation
of nanoparticles.
