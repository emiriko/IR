Nucleon-nucleon scattering in spin-triplet channels is analysed within an
effective field theory where one-pion exchange is treated nonperturbatively.
Justifying this requires the identification of an additional low-energy scale
in the strength of that potential. Short-range interactions are organised
according to the resulting power counting, in which the leading term is
promoted to significantly lower order than in the usual perturbative counting.
In each channel there is a critical momentum above which the waves probe the
singular core of the tensor potential and the new counting is necessary. When
the effects of one- and two-pion exchange have been removed using a
distorted-wave Born approximation, the residual scattering in waves with L<=2
is well described by the first three terms in the new counting. In contrast,
the scattering in waves with L>=3 is consistent with the perturbative counting,
at least for energies up to 300 MeV. This pattern is in agreement with
estimates of the critical momenta in these channels.
