Thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) and conductivity (TSC) are considered
using the classical insulator model that assumes one kind of the active trap,
one kind of inactive deep trap, and one kind of the recombination center.
Kinetic equations describing the model are solved numerically without and with
the use of the quasiequilibrium (QE) approximation. The QE state parameter qI,,
the relative recombination probability g, and a new parameter called
quasi-stationary (QS) state parameter q*=qIg are used for the analysis of the
TSL and TSC. The TSL and TSC curves and the temperature dependences of qI, q*,
g, the recombination lifetime, and the occupancies of active traps and
recombination centers are numerically calculated for five sets of kinetic
parameters and different heating rates. These calculation results show that:
(1) the upper limit of the heating rate for presence of the QS state appears at
higher heating rate than that for the QE state when the retrapping process is
present, and (2) the TSL (TSC) curves in the QS state have the properties
similar to those for the TSL (TSC) curves in the QE state. Approximate formulas
for calculation of the parameters qI and q* in the initial range of the TSL and
TSC curves are derived and used in the heating-rate methods, proposed in this
work, for determination of those parameters from the calculated TSL curves.
