We completely describe all integer symmetric matrices that have all their
eigenvalues in the interval [-2,2]. Along the way we classify all signed
graphs, and then all charged signed graphs, having all their eigenvalues in
this same interval. We then classify subsets of the above for which the integer
symmetric matrices, signed graphs and charged signed graphs have all their
eigenvalues in the open interval (-2,2).
