We comment on the relationships between several supersymmetric lattice
models; the ``orbifold lattice theory'' by Cohen-Kaplan-Katz-Unsal (CKKU),
lattice regularization of the topological field theory by Sugino and the
``geometrical approach'' by Catterall. We point out that these three models
have close relationships; the N =(2,2) model by Catterall [Catterall] and the
two-dimensional N = (2,2) lattice theory being similar to Sugino's construction
[Sugino] can be derived by appropriate truncation of fields in the
two-dimensional N = (4,4) orbifold lattice theory by CKKU [Cohen et al].
Catterall's N = (2,2) description possesses extra degrees of freedom compared
to the target N = (2,2) theory. If we remove those extra degrees of freedom in
a way keeping supersymmetry on the lattice, Catterall's description reduces to
a model of the Sugino type.
