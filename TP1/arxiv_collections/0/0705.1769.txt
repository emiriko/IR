We discuss the existence and properties of a nontrivial fixed point in
f(R)-gravity, where f is a polynomial of order up to six. Within this
seven-parameter class of theories, the fixed point has three
ultraviolet-attractive and four ultraviolet-repulsive directions; this brings
further support to the hypothesis that gravity is nonperturbatively
renormalizabile.
