In this reply, we show that when we apply standard distribution theory to the
Lippmann-Schwinger equation, the resulting spaces of test functions would
comply with the Hardy axiom only if classic results of Paley and Wiener, of
Gelfand and Shilov, and of the theory of ultradistributions were wrong. As
well, we point out several differences between the ``standard method'' of
constructing rigged Hilbert spaces in quantum mechanics and the method used in
Time Asymmetric Quantum Theory.
