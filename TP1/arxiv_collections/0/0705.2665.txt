We introduce a feasible method of constructing the entanglement witness that
detects the genuine entanglement of a given pure multiqubit state. We
illustrate our method in the scenario of constructing the witnesses for the
multiqubit states that are broadly theoretically and experimentally
investigated. It is shown that our method can construct the effective witnesses
for experiments. We also investigate the entanglement detection of symmetric
states and mixed states.
