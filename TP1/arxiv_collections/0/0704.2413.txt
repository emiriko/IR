We present radio and X-ray observations of an impulsive solar flare that was
moderately intense in microwaves, yet showed very meager EUV and X-ray
emission. The flare occurred on 2001 Oct 24 and was well-observed at radio
wavelengths by the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH), the Nobeyama Radio
Polarimeters (NoRP), and by the Owens Valley Solar Array (OVSA). It was also
observed in EUV and X-ray wavelength bands by the TRACE, GOES, and Yohkoh
satellites. We find that the impulsive onset of the radio emission is
progressively delayed with increasing frequency relative to the onset of hard
X-ray emission. In contrast, the time of flux density maximum is progressively
delayed with decreasing frequency. The decay phase is independent of radio
frequency. The simple source morphology and the excellent spectral coverage at
radio wavelengths allowed us to employ a nonlinear chi-squared minimization
scheme to fit the time series of radio spectra to a source model that accounts
for the observed radio emission in terms of gyrosynchrotron radiation from
MeV-energy electrons in a relatively dense thermal plasma. We discuss plasma
heating and electron acceleration in view of the parametric trends implied by
the model fitting. We suggest that stochastic acceleration likely plays a role
in accelerating the radio-emitting electrons.
