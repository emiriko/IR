The author presents a method for calculating the magnetic fields near a
planar surface of a superconductor with a given intrinsic magnetization in the
London limit. He computes solutions for various magnetic domain boundary
configurations and derives relations between the spectral densities of the
magnetization and the resulting field in the vacuum half space, which are
useful if the magnetization can be considered as a statistical quantity and its
features are too small to be resolved individually. The results are useful for
analyzing and designing magnetic scanning experiments. Application to existing
data from such experiments on Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ show that a domain wall would have
been detectable, but the magnetic field of randomly oriented small domains and
small defects may have been smaller than the experimental noise level.
