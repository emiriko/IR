We present pseudorapidity and transverse momentum distributions for the cross
section for the production of the lightest neutral Higgs boson in association
with a high-p_T hadronic jet, calculated in the framework of the minimal
supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). We discuss the theoretical predictions
for the differential cross sections at the Large Hadron Collider and the
Tevatron for the most common benchmark scenarios.
