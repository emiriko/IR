We have measured temperature dependent (between 20 and 80 C) electrical
conductivity and molecular structure (Raman spectroscopy) of DNA-lipid cast
film. Our findings show that the conductivity is strongly influenced by
premelting effects in the molecular structure starting near physiological
temperatures (~40 C), prior to the global DNA denaturation.
