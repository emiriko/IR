We present Cluster measurements of large electric fields correlated with
intense downward field-aligned currents, and show that the data can be
reproduced by a simple model of ionospheric plasma depletion caused by the
currents. This type of magnetosphere-ionosphere interaction may be important
when considering the mapping between these two regions of space.
