Past work has shown that ions can pass through a membrane more readily in one
direction than the other. We demonstrate here in a model and an experiment that
for a mixture of small and large particles such asymmetric diffusion can arise
solely from an asymmetry in the geometry of the pores of the membrane. Our
deterministic simulation considers a two-dimensional gas of elastic disks of
two sizes diffusing through a membrane, and our laboratory experiment examines
the diffusion of glass beads of two sizes through a metal membrane. In both
experiment and simulation, the membrane is permeable only to the smaller
particles, and the asymmetric pores lead to an asymmetry in the diffusion rates
of these particles. The presence of even a small percentage of large particles
can clog a membrane, preventing passage of the small particles in one direction
while permitting free flow of the small particles in the other direction. The
purely geometric kinetic constraints may play a role in common biological
contexts such as membrane ion channels.
