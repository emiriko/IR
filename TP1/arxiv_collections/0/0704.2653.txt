Analysis of the $nd\to p(nn)$ reaction in a GeV-energy region is performed in
the framework based on the multiple-scattering theory for the few-nucleon
system. The special kinematic condition, when momentum transfer from neutron
beam to final proton closes to zero, is considered. The possibility to extract
the spin-dependent term of the elementary $np\to pn $ amplitude from
$nd$-breakup process is investigated. The energy dependence of the ratio
$R=\frac{d\sigma_{nd}} {d\Omega} / \frac{d\sigma_{np}}{d\Omega}$ is obtained
taking account of the final-state interaction of the two outgoing neutrons in
$^1 S_0$-state.
