We report on a deep search for CO(J=3-2) line emission from the host galaxy
of GRB 980425 with the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE). We
observed five points of the galaxy covering the entire region. After combining
all of the spectra, we obtained a global spectrum with the rms noise level of
3.3 mK in T_mb scale at a velocity resolution of 10 km s^-1. No significant
emission was detected, though we find a marginal emission feature in the
velocity range corresponding to the redshift of the galaxy. We derive 3 sigma
upper limits on the global properties: the velocity-integrated CO(3-2)
intensity of I_CO(3-2) < 0.26 K km s^-1 by adopting a velocity width of 67 km
s^-1; the H_2 column density of N(H_2) < 3 x 10^20 cm^-2; the molecular gas
mass of M(H_2) < 3 x 10^8 M_sun, by assuming a CO line luminosity to H_2
molecular gas mass conversion factor of X_CO = 5.0 x 10^20 cm^-2 (K km
s^-1)^-1; and the star formation rate of SFR < 0.1 M_sun yr^-1, based on the
Schmidt law. The SFR is consistent with the previous results of H_alpha and
mid-IR observations, thereby suggesting that there is no significant obscured
star formation in the host galaxy of GRB 980425. This result implies that there
is a variety of GRB hosts with regard to the presence of obscured star
formation.
