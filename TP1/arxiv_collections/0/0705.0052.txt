Edge-to-edge interprecipitate distance distributions are critical for
predicting precipitation strengthening of alloys and other physical phenomena.
A method to calculate this 3D distance and the 2D interplanar distance from
atom-probe tomographic data is presented. It is applied to nanometer-sized
Cu-rich precipitates in an Fe-1.7 at.% Cu alloy. Experimental interprecipitate
distance distributions are discussed.
