In this fourth paper of the series, I clarify the somewhat mysterious
relation between the large class of {\it orientation orbifolds} (with twisted
open-string CFT's at $\hat c=52$) and {\it orientifolds} (with untwisted open
strings at $c=26$), both of which have been associated to division by
world-sheet orientation-reversing automorphisms. In particular -- following a
spectral clue in the previous paper -- I show that, even as an {\it interacting
string system}, a certain half-integer-moded orientation orbifold-string system
is in fact equivalent to the archetypal orientifold. The subtitle of this
paper, that orientation orbifolds include and generalize standard orientifolds,
then follows because there are many other orientation orbifold-string systems
-- with higher fractional modeing -- which are not equivalent to untwisted
string systems.
