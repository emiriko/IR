We study supersymmetric branes in AdS_7 x S^4 and AdS_4 x S^7. We show that
in the former case the membranes should be viewed as M5 branes with fluxes and
we identify two types of such fivebranes (they are analogous to giant gravitons
and to dual giants). In AdS_4 x S^7 we find both M5 branes with fluxes and
freestanding stacks of membranes. We also go beyond probe approximation and
construct regular supergravity solutions describing geometries produced by the
branes. The metrics are completely specified by one function which satisfies
either Laplace or Toda equation and we give a complete classification of
boundary conditions leading to smooth geometries. The brane configurations
discussed in this paper are dual to various defects in three- and
six-dimensional conformal field theories.
