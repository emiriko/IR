We study the expansion of ultracold neutral plasmas in the regime in which
inelastic collisions are negligible. The plasma expands due to the thermal
pressure of the electrons, and for an initial spherically symmetric Gaussian
density profle, the expansion is self-similar. Measurements of the plasma size
and ion kinetic energy using fluorescence imaging and spectroscopy show that
the expansion follows an analytic solution of the Vlasov equations for an
adiabatically expanding plasma.
