The commonly used West and Yennie integral formula for the relative phase
between the Coulomb and elastic hadronic amplitudes might be consistently
applied to only if the hadronic amplitude had the constant ratio of the real to
the imaginary parts al all kinematically allowed values of four momentum
transfer squared.
