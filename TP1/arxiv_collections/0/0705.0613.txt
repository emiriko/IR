The recent extension of the standard model to include massive neutrinos in
the framework of noncommutative geometry and the spectral action principle
involves new scalar fields and their interactions with the usual complex scalar
doublet. After ensuring that they bring no unphysical consequences, we address
the question of how these fields affect the physics predicted in Weinberg-Salam
theory, particularly in the context of the Electroweak phase transition.
Applying the Dolan-Jackiw procedure, we calculate the finite temperature
corrections, and find that the phase transition is first order. The new scalar
interactions significantly improve the stability of the Electroweak Z string,
through the ``bag'' phenomenon described by Watkins and Vachaspati. (Recently
cosmic strings have climbed back into interest due to new evidence). Sourced by
static embedded strings, an internal space analogy of Cartan's torsion is
drawn, and a possible Higgs-force-like `gravitational' effect of this
non-propagating torsion on the fermion masses is described. We also check that
the field generating the Majorana mass for the $\nu_R$ is non-zero in the
physical vacuum.
