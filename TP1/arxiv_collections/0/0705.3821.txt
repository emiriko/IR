We extend harmonic map techniques to the setting of more general differential
equations in conformal geometry. We obtain an extension of Siu's rigidity to
Kahler-Weyl geometry and apply the latter to Vaisman's conjecture. Other
applications include topological obstructions to the existence of Kahler-Weyl
structures. For example, we show that no co-compact lattice in SO(1,n), n>2,
can be the fundamental group of a compact Kahler-Weyl manifold of certain type.
