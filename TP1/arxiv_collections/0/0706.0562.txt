Using Monte Carlo simulations we study jamming and percolation processes upon
the random sequential adsorption of dimers on binary alloys with different
degrees of structural order. We obtain the equimolar mixtures used as
substrates by applying the isomorphism between an alloy and the Ising model
(conserved order parameter). The annealing temperature $T$ of the mixture then
is a continuous parameter that characterizes the different sets of substrates,
shaping the deposition process. As the alloy undergoes an order-disorder phase
transition at the Onsager critical temperature ($T_{c}$), the jamming and
percolating properties of the dimers deposited over the substrate are subjected
to non-trivial changes. These are reflected in a density-temperature phase
diagram with three well-defined regions. We find that for $T < T^* = 1.22
T_{c}$ the occurrence of jamming prevents the onset of percolating clusters,
while percolation is possible for $T > T^{*}$. Particular attention is focused
close to $T^{*}$, where the interplay between jamming and percolation restricts
fluctuations, forcing exponents seemingly different from the standard
percolation universality class. By analogy with a thermal transition, we study
the onset of percolation by using the {\it temperature} (in this case, the
substrate annealing temperature) as a control parameter. By proposing thermal
scaling Ansatzes we analyze the behavior of the percolation threshold and its
thermally induced fluctuations. Also, the fractal dimension of the percolating
cluster is determined. Based on these measurements and the excellent data
collapsing, we conclude that the universality class of standard percolation is
preserved for all temperatures.
