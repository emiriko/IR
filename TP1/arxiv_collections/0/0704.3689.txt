The thermodynamics with medium effects expressed by the dispersion relation
of the temperature and density dependent particle mass is studied. Many
previous treatments have been reviewed. A new thermodynamical treatment based
on the equilibrium state is suggested. Employing the quark mass density- and
temperature-dependent model, the discrepancies between our treatment and others
are addressed.
