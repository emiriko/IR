Two types of surface models have been investigated by Monte Carlo simulations
on triangulated spheres with compartmentalized domains. Both models are found
to undergo a first-order collapsing transition and a first-order surface
fluctuation transition. The first model is a fluid surface one. The vertices
can freely diffuse only inside the compartments, and they are prohibited from
the free diffusion over the surface due to the domain boundaries. The second is
a skeleton model. The surface shape of the skeleton model is maintained only by
the domain boundaries, which are linear chains with rigid junctions. Therefore,
we can conclude that the first-order transitions occur independent of whether
the shape of surface is mechanically maintained by the skeleton (= the domain
boundary) or by the surface itself.
