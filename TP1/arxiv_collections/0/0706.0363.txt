The multiple scale expansion method is used to derive amplitude equations for
a system with thermohaline convection in the neighborhood of Hopf and Taylor
bifurcation points and at the double zero point of the dispersion relation. A
complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, a Newell-Whitehead-type equation, and an
equation of the $\phi^4$ type, respectively, were obtained. Analytic
expressions for the coefficients of these equations and their various
asymptotic forms are presented. In the case of Hopf bifurcation for low and
high frequencies, the amplitude equation reduces to a perturbed nonlinear
Schr\"odinger equation. In the high-frequency limit, structures of the type of
"dark" solitons are characteristic of the examined physical system.
