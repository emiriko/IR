The aim of this note is to introduce a compound basis for the space of
symmetric functions. Our basis consists of products of Schur functions and
$Q$-functions. The basis elements are indexed by the partitions. It is well
known that the Schur functions form an orthonormal basis for our space. A
natural question arises. How are these two bases connected? In this note we
present some numerical results of the transition matrix for these bases. In
particular we will see that the determinant of the transition matrix is a power
of 2. This is not a surprising fact. However the explicit formula involves an
interesting combinatorial feature.
  Our compound basis comes from the twisted homogeneous realization of the
basic representation of the affine Lie algebras.
  This note is not written in a standard style of mathematical articles. It is
more like a draft of a talk. In particular proofs are not given here. Details
and proofs will be published elsewhere.
