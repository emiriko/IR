In the present work we investigate one possible variation on the usual static
pulsars: the inclusion of rotation. We use a formalism proposed by Hartle and
Thorne to calculate the properties of rotating pulsars with all possible
compositions. All calculations were performed for zero temperature and also for
fixed entropy equations of state.
