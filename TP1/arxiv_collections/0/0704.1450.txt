We report new detailed surface U, B, V, R, and I photometry of 81 stellar
structures in the disk of the barred galaxy NGC 3367. The images show many
different structures indicating that star formation is going on in the most
part of the disk. NGC 3367 is known to have a very high concentration of
molecular gas distribution in the central regions of the galaxy and bipolar
synchrotron emission from the nucleus with two lobes (at 6 kpc) forming a
triple structure similar to a radio galaxy. We have determined the U, B, V, R,
and I magnitudes and U - B, B - V, U - V, and V - I colors for the central
region (nucleus), a region which includes supernovae 2003 AA, and 79 star
associations throughout NGC 3367. Estimation of ages of star associations is
very difficult due to several factors, among them: filling factor, metallicity,
spatial distribution of each structure and the fact that we estimated the
magnitudes with a circular aperture of 16 pixels in diameter, equivalent to
$6''.8\sim1.4$ kpc. However, if the colors derived for NGC 3367 were similar to
the colors expected of star clusters with theoretical evolutionary star tracks
developed for the LMC and had a similar metallicity, NGC 3367 show 51 percent
of the observed structures with age type SWB I (few tens of Myrs), with seven
sources outside the bright surface brightness visible disk of NGC 3367.
