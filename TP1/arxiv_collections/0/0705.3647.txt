We jointly model 22 early-type gravitational lens galaxies with stellar
dynamical measurements using standard CDM halo models. The sample is
inhomogeneous in both its mass distributions and the evolution of its stellar
populations unless the true uncertainties are significantly larger than the
reported measurement errors. In general, the individual systems cannot
constrain halo models, in the sense that the data poorly constrains the stellar
mass fraction of the halo. The ensemble of systems, however, strongly
constrains the average stellar mass represented by the visible galaxies to
$0.026\pm0.006$ of the halo mass if we neglect adiabatic compression, rising to
$0.056\pm0.011$ of the halo mass if we include adiabatic compression. Both
estimates are significantly smaller than the global baryon fraction,
corresponding to a star formation efficiency for early-type galaxies of
$10%-30%$. In the adiabatically compressed models, we find an average local
B-band stellar mass-to-light ratio of $(M/L)_0 =
(7.2\pm0.5)(M_{\sun}/L_{\sun})$ that evolves by $d\log(M/L)/dz = -0.72\pm0.08$
per unit redshift. Adjusting the isotropy of the stellar orbits has little
effect on the results. The adiabatically compressed models are strongly favored
if we impose either local estimates of the mass-to-light ratios of early-type
galaxies or the weak lensing measurements for the lens galaxies on 100 kpc
scales as model constraints.
