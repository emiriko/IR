Quantum-resonance ratchets associated with the periodically kicked particle
are experimentally realized for the first time. This is achieved by using a
Bose-Einstein condensate exposed to a pulsed standing light wave and prepared
in an initial state differing from the usual plane wave. Both the standing-wave
potential and the initial state have a point symmetry around some center and
the ratchet arises from the non-coincidence of the two centers. The dependence
of the directed quantum transport on the quasimomentum is studied. A detailed
theoretical analysis is used to explain the experimental results.
