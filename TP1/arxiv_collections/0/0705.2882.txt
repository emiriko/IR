Landau level bending near the edge of graphene, described using 2d Dirac
equation, provides a microscopic framework for understanding the quantum Hall
Effect (QHE) in this material. We review properties of the QHE edge states in
graphene, with emphasis on the novel phenomena that arise due to Dirac
character of electronic states. A method of mapping out the dispersion of the
edge states using scanning tunneling probes is proposed. The Zeeman splitting
of Landau levels is shown to create a particularly interesting situation around
the Dirac point, where it gives rise to counter-circulating modes with opposite
spin. These chiral spin modes lead to a rich variety of spin transport
phenomena, including spin Hall effect, spin filtering and injection, and
electric detection of spin current. The estimated Zeeman spin gap, enhanced by
exchange, of a few hundred Kelvin, makes graphene an attractive system for
spintronics. Comparison to recent transport measurements near nu=0 is
presented.
