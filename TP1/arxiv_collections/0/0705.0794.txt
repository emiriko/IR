The unparticle stuff scenario related to the notrivial IR fixed point in
4D-conformal field theory is recently suggested by Georgi. We illustrate its
physical effects in Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) process. A possible signal
of unparticle related to parity violation asymmetry in DIS is investigated. It
is found out that the behavior of this parity violation signal is sensitive to
the value of the scale dimension $d_{\cal U}$ of unpaticle.
