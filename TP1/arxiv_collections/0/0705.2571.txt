The method for the recursive calculation of the effective potential is
applied successfully in case of weak coupling limit (g tend to zero) to a
multidimensional complex cubic potential. In strong-coupling limit (g tend to
infinity), the result is resumed using the variational perturbation theory
(VPT). It is found that the convergence of VPT-results approaches those
expected.
