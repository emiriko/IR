The quantum-classical hybrid-description of rare-gas clusters interacting
with intense light pulses which we have developed is described in detail. Much
emphasis is put on the treatment of screening electrons in the cluster which
set the time scale for the evolution of the system and form the link between
electrons strongly bound to ions and quasi-free plasma electrons in the
cluster. As an example we discuss the dynamics of an Ar147 cluster exposed to a
short VUV laser pulse of 20eV photon energy.
