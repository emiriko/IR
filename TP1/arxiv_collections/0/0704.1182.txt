We present a five (u*,g',r',i',z') band optical photometry catalog of the
sources in the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) region based on deep observations made
with MegaCam at CFHT. The source catalog covers about 2 square degree area
centered at the NEP and reaches depths of about 26 mag for u*, g', r' bands,
about 25 mag for i' band, and about 24 mag for z' band (4 sigma detection over
an 1 arcsec aperture). The total number of cataloged sources brighter than r'=
23 mag is about 56,000 including both point sources and extended sources. From
the investigation of photometric properties using the color-magnitude diagrams
and color-color diagrams, we have found that the colors of extended sources are
mostly (u*-r') < 3.0 and (g'-z') > 0.5. This can be used to separate the
extended sources from the point sources reliably, even for the faint source
domain where typical morphological classification schemes hardly work
efficiently. We have derived an empirical color-redshift relation of the red
sequence galaxies using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. By applying this
relation to our photometry catalog and searching for any spatial overdensities,
we have found two galaxy clusters and one nearby galaxy group.
