A major difficulty in realizing a solid-state quantum computer is the
reliable measurement of the states of the quantum registers. In this paper, we
propose an efficient readout scheme making use of the resonant tunneling of a
ballistic electron produced by a single electron pump. We treat the measurement
interaction in detail by modeling the full spatial configuration, and show that
for pumped electrons with suitably chosen energy the transmission coefficient
is very sensitive to the qubit state. We further show that by using a short
sequence of pumping events, coupled with a simple feedback control procedure,
the qubit can be measured with high accuracy.
