Recent experimental findings of several mesons and baryons with "beauty" and
"charm" as flavors remind us of the days when strangeness was discovered, and
how its inclusion led to SU(3)-flavor symmetry with enormous success in the
classification of the "proliferated" states into SU(3) multiplets. One of the
key elements was the successful application of the first order perturbation in
symmetry breaking, albeit what then appeared to be huge mass differences, and
the prediction of new states that were confirmed by experiments. In this note,
we venture into the past and, applying the same techniques, predict some new
"beauty-" and "charm-" flavored hadrons. If these new states are confirmed
experimentally, it may provide a useful phenomenological model for classifying
numerous states that are found to be in the PDG data and could invite further
theoretical challenges towards our understanding of symmetry breaking.
