We study whether the broad enhancement X(1576) arises from the final state
interaction (FSI) of $\rho(1450,1700)\to \rho^+\rho^-\to K^{+}K^{-}$ decays. We
consider both the absorptive and dispersive contribution of the above
amplitudes since the intermediate states are very close to $\rho(1450,1700)$.
The same mechanism leads to a similar enhancement around 1580 MeV in the
$\pi^{+}\pi^-$ spectrum in the $J/\psi\to \pi^{0}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ channel, which
can be used to test whether X(1576) can be ascribed to the FSI effect of
$\rho(1450,1700)\to \rho^+\rho^-$.
