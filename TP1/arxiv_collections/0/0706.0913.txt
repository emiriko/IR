We investigate the average sizes of the $n$ largest fragments in nuclear
multifragmentation events near the critical point of the nuclear matter phase
diagram. We perform analytic calculations employing Poisson statistics as well
as Monte Carlo simulations of the percolation type. We find that previous
claims of manifestations of Zipf's Law in the rank-ordered fragment size
distributions are not born out in our result, neither in finite nor infinite
systems. Instead, we find that Zipf-Mandelbrot distributions are needed to
describe the results, and we show how one can derive them in the infinite size
limit. However, we agree with previous authors that the investigation of
rank-ordered fragment size distributions is an alternative way to look for the
critical point in the nuclear matter diagram.
