Due to its relatively small distance (725 pc), the Cepheus A East
star-forming region is an ideal laboratory to study massive star formation
processes. Based on its morphology, it has been suggested that the flattened
molecular gas distribution around the YSO HW2 may be a 350-AU-radius massive
protostellar disk. Goal of our work is to ascertain the nature of this
structure. We have employed the Plateau de Bure Interferometer to acquire
(sub-)arcsecond-resolution imaging of high-density and shock tracers, such as
methyl cyanide (CH3CN) and silicon monoxide (SiO), towards the HW2 position. On
the 1-arcsecond (about 725 AU) scale, the flattened distribution of molecular
gas around HW2 appears to be due to the projected superposition, on the plane
of the sky, of at least three protostellar objects, of which at least one is
powering a molecular outflow at a small angle with respect to the line of
sight. The presence of a protostellar disk around HW2 is not ruled out, but
such structure is likely to be detected on a smaller spatial scale, or using
different molecular tracers.
