Dick Dalitz produced lasting contributions to particle physics for 50 years.
Along with Dalitz pairs, Dalitz plots and CDD poles, he did major work in
parity violation, hyperon resonance identification, the quark model, and
hypernuclei. These topics will be summarized, with some emphasis on the
author's collaboration with Dalitz on quark spin and fragmentation
correlations, and, particularly, the work on the identification of the top
quark and its mass. Short biographical information is interspersed. This paper
is based on a presentation at the International School of Subnuclear Physics,
Erice 2006.
