Recently, Berry phase in the semiclassical dynamical of Bloch electrons has
been found to make a correction to the phase-space density of states and a
general multi-band formula for finite-temperature orbital magnetization has
been given [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{97}, 026603 (2006)], where the orbital
magnetization $\mathcal{M}$ consists of two parts, i.e., the conventional part
$M_{c}$ and the Berry-phase correction part $M_{\Omega}$. Using this general
formula, we theoretically investigate the orbital magnetization and its effects
on thermoelectric transport and magnetic susceptibility properties of the
two-dimensional \textit{kagom\'{e}} lattice with spin anisotropies included.
The study in this paper is highly interesting by the occurrence of nonzero
Chern number in the lattice. The spin chirality parameter $\phi$ (see text)
results in profound effects on the orbital magnetization properties. It is
found that the two parts in orbital magnetization opposite each other. In
particular, we show that $M_{c}$ and $M_{\Omega}$ yield the paramagnetic and
diamagnetic responses, respectively. It is further shown that the orbital
magnetization displays fully different behavior in the metallic and insulating
regions, which is due to the different roles $M_{c}$ and $M_{\Omega}$ play in
these two regions. The anomalous Nernst conductivity is also calculated, which
displays a peak-valley structure as a function of the electron Fermi energy.
