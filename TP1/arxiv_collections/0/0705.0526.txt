Direct photon production is an important observable in heavy ion collisions
as photons are penetrating and therefore largely insensetive to final state
effects that lead to jet quenching. Measurements of the fragmentation component
to prompt photon yields in p+p and Au+Au collisions will provide both an
important test of pQCD predictions and of predictions for modifications of this
component in heavy ion collisions. By selecting photons associated with jets on
the near side using hadron-photon correlations, fragmentation photons can be
measured directly.
