We calculated the binding energy of a polaron bound to a hydrogenic donor
impurity located in a spherical quantum dot by means of a variational and
numerical technique for finite potential models. The polaronic effect has been
considered taking into account the ion-phonon coupling under the Lee Low Pines
approach. The results show that the binding energies are drastically affected
by the dot radius, the potential barrier height and the polaronic effects.
