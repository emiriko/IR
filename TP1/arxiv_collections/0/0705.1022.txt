Using the 3.6/4.5/5.8/8.0 micron images with 1.2 arcsec pixel resolution from
the Spitzer/GLIMPSE survey, we investigated 23 masing and 18 very red objects
that were not identified in the 2MASS survey. Counterparts for all selected
objects were found in the GLIMPSE images. Color indices in these IR bands
suggest the presence of a high-extinction layer of more than a few tenths of a
solar mass in front of the central star. Furthermore, radio observations in the
SiO and H2O maser lines found characteristic maser-line spectra of the embedded
objects, e.g., the SiO J=1-0 line intensity in the v=2 state stronger than that
of the v=1 state, or very widespread H2O maser emission spectra. This indicates
that these objects are actually enshrouded by very thick circumstellar matter,
some of which cannot be ascribed to the AGB wind of the central star.
Individually interesting objects are discussed, including two newly found water
fountains and an SiO source with nebulosity.
