We present decompositions of various positive kernels as integrals or sums of
positive kernels. Within this framework we study the reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces associated with the fractional and bi-fractional Brownian motions. As a
tool, we define a new function of two complex variables, which is a natural
generalization of the classical Gamma function for the setting we consider
