We suggest to combine the Anthropic Principle with Many-Worlds Interpretation
of Quantum Theory. Realizing the multiplicity of worlds it provides an
opportunity of explanation of some important events which are assumed to be
extremely improbable. The Mesoscopic Anthropic Principle suggested here is
aimed to explain appearance of such events which are necessary for emergence of
Life and Mind. It is complementary to Cosmological Anthropic Principle
explaining the fine tuning of fundamental constants. We briefly discuss various
possible applications of Mesoscopic Anthropic Principle including the Solar
Eclipses and assembling of complex molecules. Besides, we address the problem
of Time's Arrow in the framework of Many-World Interpretation. We suggest the
recipe for disentangling of quantities defined by fundamental physical laws and
by an anthropic selection.
