The harmonic emission from cluster nanoplasmas subject to short, intense
infrared laser pulses is analyzed by means of particle-in-cell simulations. A
pronounced resonant enhancement of the low-order harmonic yields is found when
the Mie plasma frequency of the ionizing and expanding cluster resonates with
the respective harmonic frequency. We show that a strong, nonlinear resonant
coupling of the cluster electrons with the laser field inhibits coherent
electron motion, suppressing the emitted radiation and restricting the spectrum
to only low-order harmonics. A pump-probe scheme is suggested to monitor the
ionization dynamics of the expanding clusters.
