We have investigated the evolution of ferromagnetic order in the correlated
metal series URh_{1-x}Ru_{x}Ge. Magnetization, transport and specific heat
measurements provide convincing evidence for a ferromagnetic quantum critical
point at the critical concentration x_{c} = 0.38. Here we report
ac-susceptibility and magnetization measurements on selected samples with Ru
doping concentrations near the critical point.
