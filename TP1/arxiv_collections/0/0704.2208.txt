In this paper we make a first attempt at understanding how to build an
optimal approximate normal factor analysis model. The criterion we have chosen
to evaluate the distance between different models is the I-divergence between
the corresponding normal laws. The algorithm that we propose for the
construction of the best approximation is of an the alternating minimization
kind.
