This article deals with the problem of gathering information on the time
evolution of a single metastable quantum system whose evolution is impeded by
the quantum Zeno effect. It has been found it is in principle possible to
obtain some information on the time evolution and, depending on the specific
system, even to measure its average decay rate, even if the system does not
undergo any evolution at all.
