We investigate, in the context of five-dimensional (5D) Brans-Dicke theory of
gravity, the idea that macroscopic matter configurations can be generated from
pure vacuum in five dimensions, an approach first proposed in the framework of
general relativity. We show that the 5D Brans-Dicke vacuum equations when
reduced to four dimensions lead to a modified version of Brans-Dicke theory in
four dimensions (4D). As an application of the formalism, we obtain two
five-dimensional extensions of four-dimensional O'Hanlon and Tupper vacuum
solution and show that they lead two different cosmological scenarios in 4D.
