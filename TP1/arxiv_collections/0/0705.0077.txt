The first general analytic solutions for the one-dimensional walk in position
and momentum space are derived. These solutions reveal, among other things, new
symmetry features of quantum walk probability densities and further insight
into the behaviour of their moments. The analytic expressions for the quantum
walk probability distributions provide a means of modelling quantum phenomena
that is analogous to that provided by random walks in the classical domain.
