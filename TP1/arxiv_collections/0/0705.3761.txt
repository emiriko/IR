I present the exact analytical expression for the activation energy as a
function of externally applied magnetic fields for a single--domain magnetic
particle with uniaxial anisotropy (Stoner--Wohlfahrt model), and investigate
the scaling behavior of the activation energy close to the switching boundary.
