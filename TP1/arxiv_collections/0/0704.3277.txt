Some arguments in favour of the existence of tachyons and extensions of the
Lorentz Group are presented. On the former, it is observed that with a slight
modification to standard electromagnetic theory a single superluminal charge
will bind to itself in a self-sustaining circular orbit, suggestive of a
(modified) electromagnetic interpretation of the strong force. Symmetries in
that theory are used in the subsequent analysis as a starting point in the
search for physically-motivated extensions of the Lorentz Group. There is some
discussion of the validity of imaginary coordinates in superluminal
transformations of frame. The article concludes with some speculation on the
implications for faster-than light travel.
