We show how to control and perform universal three-qubit quantum computation
with trapped electron quantum states. The three qubits are the electron spin,
and the first two quantum states of the cyclotron and axial harmonic
oscillators. We explicitly show how the universal gates can be performed. As an
example of a non-trivial quantum algorithm, we outline the implementation of
the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm in this system.
