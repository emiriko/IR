We study scattering of the electroweak gauge bosons in 5D warped models.
Within two different models we determine the precise manner in which the Higgs
boson and the vector resonances ensure the unitarity of longitudinal vector
boson scattering. We identify three separate scales that determine the dynamics
of the scattering process in all cases. For a quite general background geometry
of 5D, these scales can be linked to a simple functional of the warp factor.
The models smoothly interpolate between a `composite' Higgs limit and a
Higgsless limit. By holographic arguments, these models provide an effective
description of vector boson scattering in 4D models with a strongly coupled
electroweak breaking sector.
