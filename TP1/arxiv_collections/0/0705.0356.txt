Theoretical studies predict that Trojans are likely a frequent byproduct of
planet formation and evolution. We examine the sensitivity of transit timing
observations for detecting Trojan companions to transiting extrasolar planets.
We demonstrate that this method offers the potential to detect terrestrial-mass
Trojans using existing ground-based observatories. We compare the transit
timing variation (TTV) method with other techniques for detecting extrasolar
Trojans and outline the future prospects for this method.
