Recent developments for mixing and CP violation in the D0 and Bs systems are
reviewed, including (i) the recently emerging evidence for D0-D0bar mixing and
the interpretations of the measurements; (ii) the theoretical status of the
calculations of Delta(Gamma_D) and Delta(m_D); (iii) some implications of the
measurement of Bs mixing for new physics.
