We present observations of a solar quiet region obtained by the ground-based
Dutch Open Telescope (DOT), and by instruments on the spacecraft SOHO and
TRACE. The observations were obtained during a coordinated observing campaign
on October 2005. The aim of this work is to present the rich diversity of
fine-scale structures that are found at the network boundaries and their
appearance in different instruments and different spectral lines that span the
photosphere to the corona. Detailed studies of these structures are crucial to
understanding their dynamics in different solar layers, as well as the role
such structures play in the mass balance and heating of the solar atmosphere.
