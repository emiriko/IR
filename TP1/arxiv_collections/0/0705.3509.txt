A simple regression analysis designed for predicting the supermassive black
hole mass from the effective radius and mean effective surface brightness of
the host bulge has been performed using the data from Barway & Kembhavi
(arXiv:0705.1508). The scatter in the log M_bh direction is 0.32 dex, greater
than reported and comparable with values obtained using a single predictor
quantity such as luminosity, velocity dispersion or Sersic index.
