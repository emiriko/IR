We report on broad-band infrared ellipsometry measurements of the c-axis
conductivity of underdoped RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-d} (R=Y, Nd, and La) single
crystals. Our data provide a detailed account of the spectral weight (SW)
redistributions due to the normal state pseudogap (PG) and the superconducting
(SC) gap. They show that these phenomena involve different energy scales,
exhibit distinct doping dependencies and thus are likely of different origin.
In particular, the SW redistribution in the PG state closely resembles the one
of a conventional charge- or spin density wave (CDW or SDW) system.
