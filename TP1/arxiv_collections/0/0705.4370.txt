Conformal rescaling of conformal Yano--Killing tensors and relations between
Yano and CYK tensors are discussed. Pullback of these objects to a submanifold
is used to construct all solutions of a CYK equation in anti-de Sitter and de
Sitter spacetimes. Properties of asymptotic conformal Yano--Killing tensors are
examined for asymptotic anti-de Sitter spacetimes. Explicit asymptotic forms of
them are derived. The results are used to construct asymptotic charges in
asymptotic AdS spacetime. Well known examples like Schwarzschild-AdS, Kerr-AdS
and NUT-AdS are examined carefully in the construction of the concept of
energy, angular momentum and dual mass in asymptotic AdS spacetime.
