A disorder parameter detecting dual superconductivty of the vacuum is used as
a probe to characterize the confining properties of the phase diagram of two
color QCD at finite temperature and density. We obtain evidence for the
disappearing of dual superconductivity (deconfinement) induced by a finite
density of baryonic matter, as well as for a coincidence of this phenomenon
with the restoration of chiral symmetry both at zero and finite density. The
saturation transition induced by Pauli blocking is studied as well, and a
general warning is given about the possible effects that this unphysical
transition could have on the study of the QCD phase diagram at strong values of
the gauge coupling.
