The discovery that the bolometric energetics (and/or peak luminosity) of
Gamma Ray Bursts correlates with their spectral properties has allowed to
standardize the burst energetics to such a degree to enable their use for
constraining the cosmological parameters, in the same way as SN Ia. With
respect to SN Ia, there is the advantage of having sources free from extinction
problems, and easily detectable also at large redshifts. On the other hand,
these spectral-energy correlations are not yet understood, and bursts with a
complete set of information (to standardize their energetics) are still few
(two dozens). There have been already attempts to use these bursts to constrain
Omega_Lambda and Omega_M, and even the dark energy equation of state. These
results are very encouraging.
