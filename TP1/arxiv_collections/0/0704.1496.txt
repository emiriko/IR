We present follow-up observations of pulsating subdwarf B (sdB) stars as part
of our efforts to resolve the pulsation spectra for use in asteroseismological
analyses. This paper reports on multisite campaigns of the pulsating sdB stars
PG 1618+563B and PG 0048+091. Data were obtained from observatories placed
around the globe for coverage from all longitudes. For PG 1618+563B, our
five-site campaign uncovered a dichotomy of pulsation states: Early during the
campaign the amplitudes and phases (and perhaps frequencies) were quite
variable while data obtained late in the campaign were able to fully resolve
five stable pulsation frequencies. For PG 0048+091, our five-site campaign
uncovered a plethora of frequencies with short pulsation lifetimes. We find
them to have observed properties consistent with stochastically excited
oscillations, an unexpected result for subdwarf B stars. We discuss our
findings and their impact on subdwarf B asteroseismology.
