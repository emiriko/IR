I discuss fundamental limits placed on information and information processing
by gravity. Such limits arise because both information and its processing
require energy, while gravitational collapse (formation of a horizon or black
hole) restricts the amount of energy allowed in a finite region. Specifically,
I use a criterion for gravitational collapse called the hoop conjecture. Once
the hoop conjecture is assumed a number of results can be obtained directly:
the existence of a fundamental uncertainty in spatial distance of order the
Planck length, bounds on information (entropy) in a finite region, and a bound
on the rate of information processing in a finite region. In the final section
I discuss some cosmological issues related to the total amount of information
in the universe, and note that almost all detailed aspects of the late universe
are determined by the randomness of quantum outcomes. This paper is based on a
talk presented at a 2007 Bellairs Research Institute (McGill University)
workshop on black holes and quantum information.
