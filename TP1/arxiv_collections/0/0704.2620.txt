This review covers selected developments in maser theory since the previous
meeting, "Cosmic Masers: From Proto-Stars to Black Holes" (Migenes & Reid
2002). Topics included are time variability of fundamental constants, pumping
of OH megamasers and indicators for differentiating disks from bi-directional
outflows.
