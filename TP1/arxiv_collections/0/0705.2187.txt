We consider a quantum dot in the regime of the quantum Hall effect,
particularly in Laughlin states and non-Abelian Read-Rezayi states. We find the
location of the Coulomb blockade peaks in the conductance as a function of the
area of the dot and the magnetic field. When the magnetic field is fixed and
the area of the dot is varied, the peaks are equally spaced for the Laughlin
states. In contrast, non-Abelian statistics is reflected in modulations of the
spacing which depend on the magnetic field.
