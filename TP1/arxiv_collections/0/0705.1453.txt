Data warehouse architectural choices and optimization techniques are critical
to decision support query performance. To facilitate these choices, the
performance of the designed data warehouse must be assessed. This is usually
done with the help of benchmarks, which can either help system users comparing
the performances of different systems, or help system engineers testing the
effect of various design choices. While the TPC standard decision support
benchmarks address the first point, they are not tuneable enough to address the
second one and fail to model different data warehouse schemas. By contrast, our
Data Warehouse Engineering Benchmark (DWEB) allows to generate various ad-hoc
synthetic data warehouses and workloads. DWEB is fully parameterized to fulfill
data warehouse design needs. However, two levels of parameterization keep it
relatively easy to tune. Finally, DWEB is implemented as a Java free software
that can be interfaced with most existing relational database management
systems. A sample usage of DWEB is also provided in this paper.
