We discuss a parity nonconserving (PNC) asymmetry in the cross section of
dielectronic recombination of polarized electrons on multiply charged ions with
Z>40. This effect is strongly enhanced for close doubly-excited states of
opposite parity in the intermediate compound ion. Such states are known for
He-like ions. However, these levels have large energy and large radiative
widths which hampers observation of the PNC asymmetry. We argue that
accidentally degenerate states of the more complex ions may be more suitable
for the corresponding experiment.
