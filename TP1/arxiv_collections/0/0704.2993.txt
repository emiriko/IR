We present a 127deg x 63deg extinction map of the Anticenter of the Galaxy,
based on <J-H> and <H-K> colour excess maps from 2MASS. This 8001 square degree
map with a resolution of 4 arcminutes is provided as online material. The
colour excess ratio <J-H> / <H-K> is used to determine the power law index of
the reddening law (\beta) for individual regions contained in the area (e.g.
Orion, Perseus, Taurus, Auriga, Monoceros, Camelopardalis, Cassiopeia). On
average we find a dominant value of \beta=1.8+-0.2 for the individual clouds,
in agreement with the canonical value for the interstellar medium. We also show
that there is an internal scatter of \beta values in these regions, and that in
some areas more than one dominant \beta value is present. This indicates large
scale variations in the dust properties. The analysis of the A_V values within
individual regions shows a change in the slope of the column density
distribution with distance. This can either be attributed to a change in the
governing physical processes in molecular clouds on spatial scales of about 1pc
or an A_V dilution with distance in our map.
