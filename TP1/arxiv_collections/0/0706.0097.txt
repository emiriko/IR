We present a scheme for multiparty quantum secret sharing of a private key
with pure entangled states and decoy photons. The boss, say Alice uses the
decoy photons, which are randomly in one of the four nonorthogonal
single-photon states, to prevent a potentially dishonest agent from
eavesdropping freely. This scheme requires the parties of communication to have
neither an ideal single-photon quantum source nor a maximally entangled one,
which makes this scheme more convenient than others in a practical application.
Moreover, it has the advantage of having high intrinsic efficiency for qubits
and exchanging less classical information in principle.
