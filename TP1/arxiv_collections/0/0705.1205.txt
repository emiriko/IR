We present photoluminescence studies of the molecular neutral
biexciton-exciton spectra of individual vertically stacked InAs/GaAs quantum
dot pairs. We tune either the hole or the electron levels of the two dots into
tunneling resonances. The spectra are described well within a few-level,
few-particle molecular model. Their properties can be modified broadly by an
electric field and by structural design, which makes them highly attractive for
controlling nonlinear optical properties.
