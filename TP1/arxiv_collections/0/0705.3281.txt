An analytic construction of compact Calabi-Yau manifolds with del Pezzo
singularities is found. We present complete intersection CY manifolds for all
del Pezzo singularities and study the complex deformations of these
singularities. An example of the quintic CY manifold with del Pezzo 6
singularity and some number of conifold singularities is studied in details.
The possibilities for the 'geometric' and ISS mechanisms of dynamical SUSY
breaking are discussed. As an example, we construct the ISS vacuum for the del
Pezzo 6 singularity.
