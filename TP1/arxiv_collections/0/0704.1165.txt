We point out that it is possible to associate the electroweak Higgs boson
with the pseudo-Goldstone boson of broken scale invariance, thus resolving the
hierarchy problem in a technically natural way. We illustrate this idea with
two specific gauge models. Besides being consistent with all currently
available experimental data, both models maintain the predictive power of the
standard model, since the first model has only one additional parameter beyond
the standard model, and the second has the same number of free parameters as
the standard model.
