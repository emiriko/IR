Nanoparticles of superconducting YBa2Cu3O7-delta (YBCO) (Tc = 91 K) exhibit
ferromagnetism at room temperature while the bulk YBCO, obtained by heating the
nanoparticles at high temperature (940 degree C), shows a linear magnetization
curve. Across the superconducting transition temperature, the magnetization
curve changes from that of a soft ferromagnet to a superconductor. Furthermore,
our experiments reveal that not only nanoparticles of metal oxides but also
metal nitrides such as NbN (Tc = 6 - 12 K) and delta-MoN (Tc ~ 6 K) exhibit
room-temperature ferromagnetism.
