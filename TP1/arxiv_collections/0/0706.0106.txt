We study light emission patterns from stadium-shaped semiconductor (GaAs)
microcavity lasers theoretically and experimentally. Performing systematic wave
calculations for passive cavity modes, we demonstrate that the averaging by
low-loss modes, such as those realized in multi-mode lasing, generates an
emission pattern in good agreement with the ray model's prediction. In
addition, we show that the dependence of experimental far-field emission
patterns on the aspect ratio of the stadium cavity is well reproduced by the
ray model.
