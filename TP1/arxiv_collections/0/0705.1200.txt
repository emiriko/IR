We derive general constraints on the relic abundances of a long-lived
particle which mainly decays into a neutrino (and something else) at
cosmological time scales. Such an exotic particle may show up in various
particle-physics models based on physics beyond the standard model. The
constraints are obtained from big-bang nucleosynthesis, cosmic microwave
background and diffuse neutrino and photon fluxes, depending on the lifetime
and the electromagnetic and hadronic branching ratios.
