Recent observations of the J/psi spectrum produced in e^+e^- collisions at
the Upsilon(4S) resonance are in conflict with fixed-order calculations using
Non-Relativsitic QCD effective theory (NRQCD). One problem is an enhancement in
the cross section when the J/psi has maximal energy, due to large perturbative
corrections (Sudakov logarithms). In a recent paper, the Sudakov logarithms in
the color-octet contribution were summed by combining NRQCD with the
Soft-Collinear Effective Theory. However to be consistent, the color-singlet
contributions must also be summed in the endpoint region which was not done in
that paper. In this paper, we sum the leading and next-to-leading logarithms in
the color-singlet contribution to the J/psi production cross section. We find
that the color-singlet cross section is suppressed near endpoint compared to
the fixed order NRQCD prediction.
