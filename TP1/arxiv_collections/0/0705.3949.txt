This paper is about Kripke structures that are inside a relational database
and queried with a modal language. At first the modal language that is used is
introduced, followed by a definition of the database and relational algebra.
Based on these definitions two things are presented: a mapping from components
of the modal structure to a relational database schema and instance, and a
translation from queries in the modal language to relational algebra queries.
