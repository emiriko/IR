We apply the new dynamics of 3-space to cosmology by deriving a Hubble
expansion solution. This dynamics involves two constants; G and alpha - the
fine structure constant. This solution gives an excellent parameter-free fit to
the recent supernova and gamma-ray burst data without the need for `dark
energy' or `dark matter'. The data and theory together imply an older age for
the universe of some 14.7Gyrs. Various problems such as fine tuning, the event
horizon problem etc are now resolved. A brief review discusses the origin of
the 3-space dynamics and how that dynamics explained the bore hole anomaly,
spiral galaxy flat rotation speeds, the masses of black holes in spherical
galaxies, gravitational light bending and lensing, all without invoking `dark
matter' or `dark energy'. These developments imply that a new understanding of
the universe is now available.
