Context: The evolution of a young protocluster depends on the relative
spatial distributions and dynamics of both stars and gas. Aims: We study the
distribution and properties of the gas and stars surrounding the luminous (10^4
L_sun) protocluster IRAS 18511+0146. Methods: IRAS 18511+0146 and the cluster
associated with it has been investigated using the sub-millimetre (JCMT-SCUBA),
infrared (Spitzer-MIPSGAL, Spitzer-GLIMPSE, Palomar) and radio (VLA) continuum
data. Cluster simulations have been carried out in order to understand the
properties of clusters as well as to compare with the observations. Results:
The central most obscured part of the protocluster coincident with the compact
sub-millimetre source found with SCUBA is responsible for at least 2/3 of the
total luminosity. A number of cluster members have been identified which are
bright in mid infrared and show rising (near to mid infrared) spectral energy
distributions suggesting that these are very young stellar sources. In the mid
infrared 8.0 micron image, a number of filamentary structures and clumps are
detected in the vicinity of IRAS 18511+0146. Conclusions: Based on the
luminosity and cluster size as well as on the evolutionary stages of the
cluster members, IRAS 18511+0146 is likely to be protocluster with the most
massive object being a precursor to a Herbig type star.
