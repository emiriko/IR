High--resolution 2D--MHD numerical simulations have been carried out to
investigate the effects of continuing infall of clumpy gas in extended HI
galactic disks. Given a certain accretion rate, the response of the disk
depends on its surface gas density and temperature. For Galactic conditions at
a galactocentric distance of ~20 kpc, and for mass accretion rates consistent
with current empirical and theoretical determinations in the Milky Way, the
rain of compact high velocity clouds onto the disk can maintain transonic
turbulent motions in the warm phase (~2500 K) of HI. Hence, the HI line width
is expected to be ~6.5 km/s for a gas layer at 2500 K, if infall were the only
mechanism of driving turbulence. Some statistical properties of the resulting
forcing flow are shown in this Letter. The radial dependence of the gas
velocity dispersion is also discussed.
