In this paper we extend the notions of Schwartz functions, tempered functions
and generalized Schwartz functions to Nash (i.e. smooth semi-algebraic)
manifolds. We reprove for this case classically known properties of Schwartz
functions on $R^n$ and build some additional tools which are important in
representation theory.
