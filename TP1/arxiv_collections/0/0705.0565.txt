In order to describe Lambda(1405) as a resonance in the baryon-meson
scattering, we have investigated q^3-q qbar scattering system with the
flavor-singlet q^3 (0s)^2(0p) state (the Lambda^1 pole). The scattering is
treated by the quark cluster model (QCM). The Lambda^1 pole is treated as a
bound state embedded in the continuum. We found that the peak appears below the
N Kbar threshold in the spin one half, isospin 0 channel even if the mass of
the Lambda^1 pole is above the threshold. This peak disappears when the
coupling to the Lambda^1 pole is switched off. To use the observed hadron mass
in the kinetic part of QCM is also found to be important to reproduce a peak
just below the N Kbar threshold.
