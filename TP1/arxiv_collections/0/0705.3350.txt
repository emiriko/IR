Context: Cool stars, companions to compact objects, are known to show Li
abundances which are high compared to field stars of the same spectral type,
which are heavily Li depleted. This may be due either to Li production or Li
preservation in these systems. Aims: To measure the lithium isotopic ratio in
the companion star of the neutron star X-ray binary Cen X-4. Method: We use
UVES spectra obtained in years 2000 and 2004 around the orbital quadratures.
The spectra are analysed with spectrum synthesis techniques and the errors
estimated with Monte Carlo simulations. Results: We measure A(Li)=2.87+-0.20
and 6Li/7Li = 0.12+0.08-0.05 at 68% confidence level. We also present updated
system parameters with a refined determination of the orbital period and
component masses i.e. 1.14+-0.45 Msun and 0.23+-0.10 Msun for the neutron star
and companion, respectively. Conclusions: In our view the low level of 6Li
favours Li preservation scenarios, although Li production mechanisms cannot be
ruled out. In the case of preservation, no Li is freshly created in the binary,
but the tidally-locked companion has preserved its original Li by some
mechanism, possibly inhibited destruction due to its fast rotation.
