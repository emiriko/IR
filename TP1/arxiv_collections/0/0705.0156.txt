We compute the high-frequency emission and absorption noise in a fractional
quantum Hall effect (FQHE) sample at arbitrary temperature. We model the edges
of the FQHE as chiral Luttinger liquids (LL) and we use the non-equilibrium
perturbative Keldysh formalism. We find that the non-symmetrized high frequency
noise contains important signatures of the electron-electron interactions that
can be used to test the Luttinger liquid physics, not only in FQHE edge states,
but possibly also in other one-dimensional systems such as carbon nanotubes. In
particular we find that the emission and absorption components of the excess
noise (defined as the difference between the noise at finite voltage and at
zero voltage) are different in an interacting system, as opposed to the
non-interacting case when they are identical. We study the resonance features
which appear in the noise at the Josephson frequency (proportional to the
applied voltage), and we also analyze the effect of the distance between the
measurement point and the backscattering site. Most of our analysis is
performed in the weak backscattering limit, but we also compute and discuss
briefly the high-frequency noise in the tunneling regime.
