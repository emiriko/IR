We derive four-dimensional (4D) effective theories of the gauge-Higgs
unification models in the warped spacetime. The effective action can be
expressed in a simple form by neglecting subleading corrections to the wave
functions. We have shown in our previous works that some Higgs couplings to the
other fields are suppressed by factors that depend on $\bar{\theta}_H$ from the
values in the standard model. Here $\bar{\theta}_H$ is the Wilson line phase
along the fifth dimension, which characterizes the electroweak symmetry
breaking. The effective action derived here explicitly shows a nonlinear
structure of the Higgs sector, which clarifies the origins of those suppression
factors.
