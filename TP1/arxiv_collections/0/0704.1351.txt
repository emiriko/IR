We write down the relevant field equations for a stationary axially symmetric
rigidly rotating dust source in such a way that the general solution depends
upon the solution of an elliptic equation and upon harmonic functions. Starting
with the dipole Bonnor solution, we built an asymptotically flat solution with
two curvature singularities on the rotational axis with diverging mass. Apart
from the two point singularities on the axis, the metric is regular everywhere.
Finally, we study a non-asymptotically flat solution with NUT charge and a
massless ring singularity, but with a well-defined mass-energy expression.
