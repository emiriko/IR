We have studied the concurrence of two-site entanglement and have shown that
it is related to the geometric phase accumulated due to a complete rotation of
the entangled state. The geometric phase and hence the concurrence is evaluated
for transverse Ising model and antiferromagnetic chain which is found to be in
good agreement with that obtained by other methods.
