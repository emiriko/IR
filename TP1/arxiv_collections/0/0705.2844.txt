Marginal beta deformations of N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory are known to
correspond to a certain class of deformations of the S^5 background subspace of
type IIB string theory in AdS_5 x S^5. An analogous set of deformations of the
AdS_5 subspace is reviewed here. String energy spectra computed in the
near-pp-wave limit of these backgrounds match predictions encoded by discrete,
asymptotic Bethe equations, suggesting that the twisted string theory is
classically integrable in this regime. These Bethe equations can be derived
algorithmically by relying on the existence of Lax representations, and on the
Riemann-Hilbert interpretation of the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. This letter
is a review of a seminar given at the Institute for Advanced Study, based on
research completed in collaboration with McLoughlin.
