This paper quantifies the information rate of multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems with finite rate channel state feedback and power on/off
strategy. In power on/off strategy, a beamforming vector (beam) is either
turned on (denoted by on-beam) with a constant power or turned off. We prove
that the ratio of the optimal number of on-beams and the number of antennas
converges to a constant for a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when the number
of transmit and receive antennas approaches infinity simultaneously and when
beamforming is perfect. Based on this result, a near optimal strategy, i.e.,
power on/off strategy with a constant number of on-beams, is discussed. For
such a strategy, we propose the power efficiency factor to quantify the effect
of imperfect beamforming. A formula is proposed to compute the maximum power
efficiency factor achievable given a feedback rate. The information rate of the
overall MIMO system can be approximated by combining the asymptotic results and
the formula for power efficiency factor. Simulations show that this
approximation is accurate for all SNR regimes.
