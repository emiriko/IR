The Randall-Sundrum model with gauge fields and fermions in the bulk has
several attractive features including the gauge coupling unification, a
candidate for the dark matter, and an explanation for the hierarchical Yukawa
couplings.
  In this paper, we point out that the 1st Kaluza-Klein modes of right-handed
neutrinos may be produced at colliders, for both Dirac and Majorana neutrino
cases. Furthermore, we can see whether the neutrino masses are Dirac type or
Majorana type from the mass spectrum of KK particles.
