We consider a class of real random polynomials, indexed by an integer d, of
large degree n and focus on the number of real roots of such random
polynomials. The probability that such polynomials have no real root in the
interval [0,1] decays as a power law n^{-\theta(d)} where \theta(d)>0 is the
exponent associated to the decay of the persistence probability for the
diffusion equation with random initial conditions in space dimension d. For n
even, the probability that such polynomials have no root on the full real axis
decays as n^{-2(\theta(d) + \theta(2))}. For d=1, this connection allows for a
physical realization of real random polynomials. We further show that the
probability that such polynomials have exactly k real roots in [0,1] has an
unusual scaling form given by n^{-\tilde \phi(k/\log n)} where \tilde \phi(x)
is a universal large deviation function.
