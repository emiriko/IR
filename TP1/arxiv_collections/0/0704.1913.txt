We extend previous analyses of the supersymmetric loop correction to the
neutral Higgs couplings to include the coupling $\chi^{+}_j \chi^{-}_kH^{0}_l$.
The analysis completes the previous analyses where similar corrections were
computed for the $\bar{\tau} \tau H^{0}_l$, $\bar{b} b H^{0}_l$, $\bar{c} c
H^{0}_l$ and for $\bar{t} t H^{0}_l$ couplings within the minimal
supersymmetric standard model. The effective one loop Lagrangian is then
applied to the computation of the neutral Higgs decays. The sizes of the
supersymmetric loop corrections of the neutral Higgs decay widths into
$\chi^{+}_i \chi^{-}_j$ ($i=1,2$; $j=1,2$) are investigated and the
supersymmetric loop correction is found to be in the range of $7\sim15%$ in
significant regions of the parameter space. By including the loop corrections
of the other decay channels $\bar{b} b$, $\bar{t} t$, $\bar{\tau} \tau$,
$\bar{c} c$, and $\chi^0_i \chi^0_j$ ($i=1-4$; $j=1-4$), the corrections to
branching ratios for $H^{0}_l\to \chi^{+}_i \chi^{-}_j$ can reach as high as
40%.
  The effects of CP phases on the branching ratio are also investigated.
