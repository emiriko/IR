Direct correlation between temporal structural fluctuations and electron wind
force is demonstrated, for the first time, by STM imaging and analysis of
atomically-resolved motion on a thin film surface under large applied current
(10e5 Amp/sqare cm). The magnitude of the momentum transfer between current
carriers and atoms in the fluctuating structure is at least five to fifteen
times (plus or minus one sigma range) larger than for freely diffusing adatoms.
The corresponding changes in surface resistivity will contribute significant
fluctuation signature to nanoscale electronic properties.
