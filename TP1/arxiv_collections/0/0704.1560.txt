We propose a scheme for generating entangled states of light fields. This
scheme only requires the cross-Kerr nonlinear interaction between coherent
light-beams, followed by a homodyne detection. Therefore, this scheme is within
the reach of current technology. We study in detail the generation of the
entangled states between two modes, and that among three modes. In addition to
the Bell states between two modes and the W states among three modes, we find
plentiful new kinds of entangled states. Finally, the scheme can be extend to
generate the entangled states among more than three modes.
