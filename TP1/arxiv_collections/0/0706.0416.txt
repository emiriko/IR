We study the spectrum of fermionic modes on cosmic string loops. We find no
fermionic zero modes nor massive bound states - this implies that vortons
stabilized by fermionic currents do not exist. We have also studied
kink-(anti)kink and vortex-(anti)vortex systems and find that all systems that
have vanishing net topological charge do not support fermionic bound modes.
