The vortex density of a rotating superfluid, divided by its particle mass,
dictates the superfluid's angular velocity through the Feynman relation. To
find how the Feynman relation applies to superfluid mixtures, we investigate a
rotating two-component Bose-Einstein condensate, composed of bosons with
different masses. We find that in the case of sufficiently strong interspecies
attraction, the vortex lattices of the two condensates lock and rotate at the
drive frequency, while the superfluids themselves rotate at two different
velocities, whose ratio is the ratio between the particle mass of the two
species. In this paper, we characterize the vortex-locked state, establish its
regime of stability, and find that it surives within a disk smaller than a
critical radius, beyond which vortices become unbound, and the two Bose-gas
rings rotate together at the frequency of the external drive.
