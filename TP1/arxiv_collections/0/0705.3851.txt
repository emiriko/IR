The joint cumulative distribution function for order statistics arising from
several different populations is given in terms of the distribution function of
the populations. The computational cost of the formula in the case of two
populations is still exponential in the worst case, but it is a dramatic
improvement compared to the general formula by Bapat and Beg. In the case when
only the joint distribution function of a subset of the order statistics of
fixed size is needed, the complexity is polynomial, for the case of two
populations.
