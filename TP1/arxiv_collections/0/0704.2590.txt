We analyze theoretically adiabatic quantum pumping through a normal conductor
that couples the normal regions of two superconductor/normal
metal/superconductor Josephson junctions. By using the phases of the
superconducting order parameter in the superconducting contacts as pumping
parameters, we demonstrate that a non zero pumped charge can flow through the
device. The device exploits the evolution of the superconducting phases due to
the ac Josephson effect, and can therefore be operated at very high frequency,
resulting in a pumped current as large as a few nanoAmperes. The experimental
relevance of our calculations is discussed.
