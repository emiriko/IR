As a solvable and broadly applicable model system, the totally asymmetric
exclusion process enjoys iconic status in the theory of non-equilibrium phase
transitions. Here, we focus on the time dependence of the total number of
particles on a 1-dimensional open lattice, and its power spectrum. Using both
Monte Carlo simulations and analytic methods, we explore its behavior in
different characteristic regimes. In the maximal current phase and on the
coexistence line (between high/low density phases), the power spectrum displays
algebraic decay, with exponents -1.62 and -2.00, respectively. Deep within the
high/low density phases, we find pronounced \emph{oscillations}, which damp
into power laws. This behavior can be understood in terms of driven biased
diffusion with conserved noise in the bulk.
