We derive the QCD sum rules for the vector and scalar meson mixing in nuclear
medium, using a two quark interpolating field for both mesons. Modeling the
mixing via a nucleon hole contribution with known coupling constant, the sum
rule can be used to determine the overlap of the interpolating field and the
scalar meson. In the I=0 channel, we find a stable Borel curve and an overlap
that is about 10% of the corresponding value in the pseudo scalar or vector
channel. The sum rule in the I=1 channel is less reliable but also consistent
with a small value for the overlap. These results suggest that both the
$\sigma$ and $a_0$ have a small two quark and thus probably a large tetraquark
components. We discuss the possibility of observing these scalar mesons from
vector mesons emanating from the nuclear medium.
