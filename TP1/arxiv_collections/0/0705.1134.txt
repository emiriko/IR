We apply the mathematical technique of factorization of differential
operators to two different problems. First we review our results related to the
supersymmetry of the Montroll kinks moving onto the microtubule walls as well
as mentioning the sine-Gordon model for the microtubule nonlinear excitations.
Second, we find analytic expressions for a class of one-parameter solutions of
a sort of diffusion equation of Bessel type that is obtained by supersymmetry
from the homogeneous form of a simple damped wave equations derived in the
works of P.A. Robinson and collaborators for the corticothalamic system. We
also present a possible interpretation of the diffusion equation in the brain
context
