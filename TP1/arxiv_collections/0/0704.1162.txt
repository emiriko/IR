The high multiplicity of massive stars in dense, young clusters is
established early in their evolution. The mechanism behind this remains
unresolved. Recent results suggest that massive protostars may capture
companions through disk interactions with much higher efficiency than their
solar mass counterparts. However, this conclusion is based on analytic
determinations of capture rates and estimates of the robustness of the
resulting binaries. We present the results of coupled n-body and SPH
simulations of star-disk encounters to further test the idea that disk-captured
binaries contribute to the observed multiplicity of massive stars.
