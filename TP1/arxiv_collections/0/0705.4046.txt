We evaluate the pion-nucleon and the pion-Delta sigma terms by employing the
method of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) sum rules. The obtained value of the
pion-nucleon sigma term is compatible with the larger values already
anticipated by the recent calculations. It is also found that the pion-Delta
sigma term is as large as the pion-nucleon sigma term.
