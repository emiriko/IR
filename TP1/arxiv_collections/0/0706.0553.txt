In this paper we show that the Scharnhorst effect (Vacuum with boundaries or
a Casimir type vacuum) cannot be used to generate signals showing measurable
faster-than-c speeds. Furthermore, we aim to show that the Scharnhorst effect
would violate special relativity, by allowing for a variable speed of light in
vacuum, unless one can specify a small invariant length scale. This invariant
length scale would be agreed upon by all inertial observers. We hypothesize the
approximate scale of the invariant length.
