CLIC is a linear $e^+e^-$ ($\gamma\gamma$) collider project which uses a
drive beam to accelerate the main beam. The drive beam provides RF power for
each corresponding unit of the main linac through energy extracting RF
structures. CLIC has a wide range of center-of-mass energy options from 150 GeV
to 3 TeV. The present paper contains optimization of Free Electron Laser (FEL)
using one bunch of CLIC drive beam in order to provide polarized light
amplification using appropriate wiggler and luminosity spectrum of
$\gamma\gamma$ collider for $E_{cm}$=0.5 TeV. Then amplified laser can be
converted to a polarized high-energy $\gamma$ beam at the Conversion point
(CP-prior to electron positron interaction point) in the process of Compton
backscattering. At the CP a powerful laser pulse (FEL) focused to main linac
electrons (positrons). Here this scheme described and it is show that CLIC
drive beam parameters satisfy the requirement of FEL additionally essential
undulator parameters has been defined. Achievable $\gamma\gamma$ luminosity is
above $10^{34}$.
