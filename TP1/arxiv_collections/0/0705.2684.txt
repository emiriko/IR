We study the superfluid-insulator transition in Bose-Hubbard models in one-,
two-, and three-dimensional cubic lattices by means of a recently proposed
variational wave function. In one dimension, the variational results agree with
the expected Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless scenario of the interaction-driven
Mott transition. In two and three dimensions, we find evidences that, across
the transition,most of the spectral weight is concentrated at high energies,
suggestive of pre-formed Mott-Hubbard side-bands. This result is compatible
with the experimental data by Stoferle et al.
