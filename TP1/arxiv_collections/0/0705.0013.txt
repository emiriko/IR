We argue that the rolling-tachyon solution in cubic OSFT proceeds at late
times to precisely the analytic tachyon-vacuum solution constructed by Schnabl.
In addition, we demonstrate the relationship between the rolling-tachyon
solution and the standard BCFT description by showing that there is a finite
gauge transformation which relates the two.
