Following a model recently investigated by Veneziano and Wosiek we briefly
introduce Planar Quantum Mechanics (PQM). Then, we present high precision
numerical results in the sectors with two and three fermions. We confirm, that
the transition point in the 't Hooft's coupling constant lambda in these
sectors occurs at lambda = 1, as was expected.
