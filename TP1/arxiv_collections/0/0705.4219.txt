We consider neutralino dark matter within the framework of SUSY GUTs with
non-universal gaugino masses. In particular we focus on the case of SU(5) with
a SUSY breaking F-term in the 1, 24, 75 and 200 dimensional representations. We
discuss the 24 case in some detail, and show that the bulk dark matter region
cannot be accessed. We then go on to consider the admixture of the singlet SUSY
breaking F-term with one of the 24, 75 or 200 dimensional F-terms, and show
that in these cases it becomes possible to access the bulk regions
corresponding to low fine-tuned dark matter. Our results are presented in the
$(M_1,M_2)$ plane for fixed $M_3$ and so are useful for considering general GUT
models, as well as more general non-universal gaugino models.
