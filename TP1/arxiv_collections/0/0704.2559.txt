Yes, there is. - A new kind of gauge theory is introduced, where the minimal
coupling and corresponding covariant derivatives are defined in the space of
functions pertaining to the functional Schroedinger picture of a given field
theory. While, for simplicity, we study the example of an U(1) symmetry, this
kind of gauge theory can accommodate other symmetries as well. We consider the
resulting relativistic nonlinear extension of quantum mechanics and show that
it incorporates gravity in the (0+1)-dimensional limit, where it leads to the
Schroedinger-Newton equations. Gravity is encoded here into a universal
nonlinear extension of quantum theory. The probabilistic interpretation, i.e.
Born's rule, holds provided the underlying model has only dimensionless
parameters.
