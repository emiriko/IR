The behavior of lipid membranes in the presence of an external electric field
is studied and used to examine the influence of such fields on membrane
parameters such as roughness and show that for a micro sized membrane,
roughness grows as the field increases. The dependence of bending rigidity on
the electric field is also studied and an estimation of thickness of the
accumulated charges around lipid membranes in a free-salt solution is
presented.
