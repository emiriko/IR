Most ocean models in current use are built upon structured meshes. It follows
that most existing tools for extracting diagnostic quantities (volume and
surface integrals, for example) from ocean model output are constructed using
techniques and software tools which assume structured meshes. The greater
complexity inherent in unstructured meshes (especially fully unstructured grids
which are unstructured in the vertical as well as the horizontal direction) has
left some oceanographers, accustomed to traditional methods, unclear on how to
calculate diagnostics on these meshes. In this paper we show that tools for
extracting diagnostic data from the new generation of unstructured ocean models
can be constructed with relative ease using open source software. Higher level
languages such as Python, in conjunction with packages such as NumPy, SciPy,
VTK and MayaVi, provide many of the high-level primitives needed to perform 3D
visualisation and evaluate diagnostic quantities, e.g. density fluxes. We
demonstrate this in the particular case of calculating flux of vector fields
through isosurfaces, using flow data obtained from the unstructured mesh finite
element ocean code ICOM, however this tool can be applied to model output from
any unstructured grid ocean code.
