Based on 24h high speed photometry of the hybrid PG 1159 star Abell 43, we
have detected 6 sighificant pulsations with periods between 2380 s and 6075 s.
A short (4h) run on the almost spectroscopic twin NGC 7094 central star
resulted in detection of 3 low amplitude pulsations with periods between 2000 s
and 5000 s. The results are close to predictions for g-mode pulsations driven
by the kappa-mechanism induced by the partial ionization of carbon and oxygen.
