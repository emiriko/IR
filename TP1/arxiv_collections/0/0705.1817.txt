We review the recent developments in the field of photonic lattices
emphasizing their unique properties for controlling linear and nonlinear
propagation of light. We draw some important links between optical lattices and
photonic crystals pointing towards practical applications in optical
communications and computing, beam shaping, and bio-sensing.
