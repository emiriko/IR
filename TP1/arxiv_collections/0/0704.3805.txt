I review the properties of starburst galaxies, compare the properties of the
local ones with more distant starburts and examine their role in the metal
enrichment of the interstellar medium and the intergalactic-intracluster
medium. Metallicity is not an arrow of time and contrary to current belief
metal rich galaxies can also be found at high redshift.
