A variety of host galaxy (bulge) parameters are examined in order to
determine their predictive power in ascertaining the masses of the supermassive
black holes (SMBH) at the centers of the galaxies. Based on a sample of 23
nearby galaxies, comprised of both elliptical galaxies and spiral/lenticular
bulges, we identify a strong correlation between the bulge gravitational
binding energy ($E_g$), as traced by the stellar light profile, and the SMBH
mass ($M_{\bullet}$), such that $M_{\bullet} \propto E_g^{0.6}$. The scatter
about the relationship indicates that this is as strong a predictor of
$M_{\bullet}$ as the velocity dispersion ($\sigma$), for the elliptical galaxy
subsample. Improved mass-to-light ratios, obtained with IFU spectroscopy and
I-band photometry by the SAURON group, were used for those sample galaxies
where available, resulting in an energy predictor with the same slope, but with
reduced scatter. Alternative $M_{\bullet}$ predictors such as the gravitational
potential and the bulge mass are also explored, but these are found to be
inferior when compared with both the bulge gravitational binding energy and
bulge velocity dispersion predictors, for the full galaxy sample.
