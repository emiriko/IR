We give a purely geometric categorification of tensor products of
finite-dimensional simple $U_q(sl_2)$-modules and $R$-matrices on them. The
work is developed in the framework of category of perverse sheaves and the
categorification theorems are understood as consequences of Deligne's theory of
weights.
