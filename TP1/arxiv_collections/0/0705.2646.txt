Motivation: Similarity-measure based clustering is a crucial problem
appearing throughout scientific data analysis. Recently, a powerful new
algorithm called Affinity Propagation (AP) based on message-passing techniques
was proposed by Frey and Dueck \cite{Frey07}. In AP, each cluster is identified
by a common exemplar all other data points of the same cluster refer to, and
exemplars have to refer to themselves. Albeit its proved power, AP in its
present form suffers from a number of drawbacks. The hard constraint of having
exactly one exemplar per cluster restricts AP to classes of regularly shaped
clusters, and leads to suboptimal performance, {\it e.g.}, in analyzing gene
expression data. Results: This limitation can be overcome by relaxing the AP
hard constraints. A new parameter controls the importance of the constraints
compared to the aim of maximizing the overall similarity, and allows to
interpolate between the simple case where each data point selects its closest
neighbor as an exemplar and the original AP. The resulting soft-constraint
affinity propagation (SCAP) becomes more informative, accurate and leads to
more stable clustering. Even though a new {\it a priori} free-parameter is
introduced, the overall dependence of the algorithm on external tuning is
reduced, as robustness is increased and an optimal strategy for parameter
selection emerges more naturally. SCAP is tested on biological benchmark data,
including in particular microarray data related to various cancer types. We
show that the algorithm efficiently unveils the hierarchical cluster structure
present in the data sets. Further on, it allows to extract sparse gene
expression signatures for each cluster.
