We compare the CO 2-1 observations against previously taken CO 4-3
observations and analyze the spatial distribution of young stellar objects
(YSO's) within the cloud using the Spitzer IRAC observations of the 30 Doradus
complex. Both peaks of CO 2-1 and 4-3 emitting clouds coincide with the densest
region of the filaments where multiple shells are colliding. We find that the
YSO's are clustered in the southern ridge of the warm and dense molecular gas
clouds traced by CO J=4-3, indicating a filamentary structure of star formation
throughout the 30 Doradus. We also find that some of Class I YSO's candidates
which are likely to be associated with a high-velocity component of CO 4-3
emitting clouds are present. This is a bona fide place where the triggered star
formation had happened and newly formed stars may have produced such a
high-velocity outflow interacting with the surrounding molecular cloud
material.
