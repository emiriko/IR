Time-of-flight (TOF) cameras are based on a new technology that delivers
distance maps by the use of a modulated light source. In this paper we first
describe a set of experiments that we performed with TOF cameras. We then
propose a noise model which is able to explain some of the phenomena observed
in the experiments. The model is based on assuming a noise source that is
correlated with the light source (shot noise) and an additional additive noise
source (dark current noise). The model predicts well the dependency of the
distance errors on the image intensity and the true distance at an individual
pixel.
