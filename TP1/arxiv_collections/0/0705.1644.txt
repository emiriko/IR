Using analytical methods of statistical mechanics, we analyse the typical
behaviour of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian channel with
binary inputs under LDPC network coding and joint decoding. The saddle point
equations for the replica symmetric solution are found in particular
realizations of this channel, including a small and large number of
transmitters and receivers. In particular, we examine the cases of a single
transmitter, a single receiver and the symmetric and asymmetric interference
channels. Both dynamical and thermodynamical transitions from the ferromagnetic
solution of perfect decoding to a non-ferromagnetic solution are identified for
the cases considered, marking the practical and theoretical limits of the
system under the current coding scheme. Numerical results are provided, showing
the typical level of improvement/deterioration achieved with respect to the
single transmitter/receiver result, for the various cases.
