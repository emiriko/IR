The toy model used by Spekkens [R. Spekkens, Phys. Rev. A 75, 032110 (2007)]
to argue in favor of an epistemic view of quantum mechanics is extended by
generalizing his definition of pure states (i.e. states of maximal knowledge)
and by associating measurements with all pure states. The new toy model does
not allow signaling but, in contrast to the Spekkens model, does violate
Bell-CHSH inequalities. Negative probabilities are found to arise naturally
within the model, and can be used to explain the Bell-CHSH inequality
violations.
