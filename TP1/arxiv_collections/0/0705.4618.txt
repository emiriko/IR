Integer octagonal constraints (a.k.a. ``Unit Two Variables Per Inequality''
or ``UTVPI integer constraints'') constitute an interesting class of
constraints for the representation and solution of integer problems in the
fields of constraint programming and formal analysis and verification of
software and hardware systems, since they couple algorithms having polynomial
complexity with a relatively good expressive power. The main algorithms
required for the manipulation of such constraints are the satisfiability check
and the computation of the inferential closure of a set of constraints. The
latter is called `tight' closure to mark the difference with the (incomplete)
closure algorithm that does not exploit the integrality of the variables. In
this paper we present and fully justify an O(n^3) algorithm to compute the
tight closure of a set of UTVPI integer constraints.
