High precision measurements of the proton elastic form factor ratio have been
made at four-momentum transfers, Q^2, between 0.2 and 0.5 GeV^2. The new data,
while consistent with previous results, clearly show a ratio less than unity
and significant differences from the central values of several recent
phenomenological fits. By combining the new form-factor ratio data with an
existing cross-section measurement, one finds that in this Q^2 range the
deviation from unity is primarily due to GEp being smaller than the dipole
parameterization.
