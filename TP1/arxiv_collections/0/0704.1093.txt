Modulational instability of continuous waves in nonlocal focusing and
defocusing Kerr media with stochastically varying diffraction (dispersion) and
nonlinearity coefficients is studied both analytically and numerically. It is
shown that nonlocality with the sign-definite Fourier images of the medium
response functions suppresses considerably the growth rate peak and bandwidth
of instability caused by stochasticity. Contrary, nonlocality can enhance
modulational instability growth for a response function with negative-sign
bands.
