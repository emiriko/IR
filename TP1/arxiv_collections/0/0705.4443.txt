The formation and suppression dynamics of J/Psi, Chi_c and Psi-Prime mesons
is studied within the HSD transport approach for Au+Au reactions at the top
RHIC energy of sqrt(S)=200 GeV. Two prominent models, which have been discussed
for more than a decade, are incorporated, i.e. the 'hadronic comover absorption
and reformation' model as well as the 'QGP threshold' scenario, and compared to
available experimental data. Our studies demonstrate that both scenarios -
compatible with experimental observation at SPS energies - fail severely at
RHIC energies. This combined analysis - together with the underestimation of
charm elliptic flow - proves that the dynamics of c, c-bar quarks are dominated
by partonic interactions in the strong QGP (sQGP) and can neither be modeled by
'hadronic' interactions nor described appropriately by color screening alone.
