We study the effects of lepton flavour violation (LFV) on the production
processes e+e- --> \chi+_i \chi-_j at a linear collider with longitudinal e+
and e- beam polarizations. In the case of LFV the sneutrino mass eigenstates
have no definite flavour, therefore, in the t-channel more than one sneutrino
mass eigenstate can contribute to the chargino production cross sections. Our
framework is the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) including LFV
terms. We show that in spite of the restrictions on the LFV parameters due to
the current limits on rare lepton decays, the cross section \sigma(e+e- -->
\chi+_1 \chi-_1) can change by a factor of 2 or more when varying the LFV
mixing angles. We point out that even if the present bound on BR(tau- --> e-
gamma) improves by a factor of thousand the influence of LFV on the chargino
production cross section can be significant. These results could have an
important impact on the strategies for determining the underlying model
parameters at the linear collider.
