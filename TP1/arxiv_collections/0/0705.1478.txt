Tables of mean opacities are often used to compute the transfer of radiation
in a variety of astrophysical simulations from stellar evolution models to
proto-planetary disks. Often tables, such as Ferguson et al. (2005), are
computed with a predetermined set of physical assumptions that may or may not
be valid for a specific application. This paper explores the effects of several
assumptions of grain physics on the Rosseland mean opacity in an oxygen rich
environment. We find that changing the distribution of grain sizes, either the
power-law exponent or the shape of the distribution, has a marginal effect on
the total mean opacity. We also explore the difference in the mean opacity
between solid homogenous grains and grains that are porous or conglomorations
of several species. Changing the amount of grain opacity included in the mean
by assuming a grain-to-gas ratio significantly affects the mean opacity, but in
a predictable way.
