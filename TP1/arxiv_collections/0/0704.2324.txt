We consider a social system of interacting heterogeneous agents with learning
abilities, a model close to Random Field Ising Models, where the random field
corresponds to the idiosyncratic willingness to pay. Given a fixed price,
agents decide repeatedly whether to buy or not a unit of a good, so as to
maximize their expected utilities. We show that the equilibrium reached by the
system depends on the nature of the information agents use to estimate their
expected utilities.
