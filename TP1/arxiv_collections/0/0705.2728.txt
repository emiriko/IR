Charging a nano-scale oscillator by single electron tunneling leads to an
effective double-well potential due to image charges. We combine exact
numerical diagonalizations with generalized Master equations and show that the
resulting quantum tunneling of the mechanical degree of freedom can be
visualized in the electronic current noise spectrum.
