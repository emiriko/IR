We consider GL(K|M)-invariant integrable supersymmetric spin chains with
twisted boundary conditions and elucidate the role of Backlund transformations
in solving the difference Hirota equation for eigenvalues of their transfer
matrices. The nested Bethe ansatz technique is shown to be equivalent to a
chain of successive Backlund transformations "undressing" the original problem
to a trivial one.
