This article reports the world averages for measurements on b-hadron
properties obtained by the Heavy Flavor Averaging Group (HFAG) using the
available results at the end of 2006. In the averaging, the input parameters
used in the various analyses are adjusted (rescaled) to common values, and all
known correlations are taken into account. The averages include lifetimes,
neutral meson mixing parameters, parameters of semileptonic decays, branching
fractions of B decays to final states with open charm, charmonium and no charm,
and measurements related to CP asymmetries.
