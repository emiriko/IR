We discuss gravity-like formulations of massive Abelian and non-Abelian gauge
field theories in four space-time dimensions with particular emphasis on the
issue of gauge invariance. Alternative descriptions in terms of antisymmetric
tensor fields and geometric variables, respectively, are analysed. In both
approaches St\"uckelberg degrees of freedom factor out. We also demonstrate, in
the Abelian case, that the massless limit for the gauge propagator, which does
not exist in the vector potential formulation, is well-defined for the
antisymmetric tensor fields.
