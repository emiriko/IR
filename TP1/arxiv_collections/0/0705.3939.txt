We present a detailed analysis of the neutron, deuteron and mercury electric
dipole moment from supersymmetry without R parity, focusing on the quark-scalar
loop contributions. Being proportional to top Yukawa and top mass, such
contributions are often large. Analytical expressions illustrating the explicit
role of the R-parity violating parameters are given following perturbative
diagonalization of mass-squared matrices for the scalars. Dominant
contributions come from the combinations $B_i \lambda^{\prime}_{ij1}$ for which
we obtain robust bounds. It turns out that neutron and deuteron EDMs receive
much stronger contributions than mercury EDM and any null result at the future
deuteron EDM experiment or Los Alamos neutron EDM experiment can lead to
extra-ordinary constraints on RPV parameter space. Even if R-parity violating
couplings are real, CKM phase does induce RPV contribution and for some cases
such a contribution is as strong as contribution from phases in the R-parity
violating couplings.Hence, we have bounds directly on $|B_i
\lambda^{\prime}_{ij1}|$ even if the RPV parameters are all real.
Interestingly, even if slepton mass and/or $\mu_0$ is as high as 1 TeV, it
still leads to neutron EDM that is an order of magnitude larger than the
sensitivity at Los Alamos experiment. Since the results are not much sensitive
to $\tan \beta$, our constraints will survive even if other observables tighten
the constraints on $\tan \beta$.
