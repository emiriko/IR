Magnification of subwavelength field distributions using a wire medium slab
operating in the canalization regime is demonstrated using numerical
simulations. The magnifying slab is implemented by radially enlarging the
distance between adjacent wires, and the operational frequency is tuned to
coincide with the Fabry-Perot resonance condition. The near-field distribution
of a complex-shaped source is canalized over an electrical distance
corresponding roughly to $3\lambda$, and the distribution details are magnified
by a factor of three. The operation of the slab is studied at several
frequencies deviating from the Fabry-Perot resonance.
