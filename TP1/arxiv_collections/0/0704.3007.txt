We study modules over the algebroid stack $\W[\stx]$ of deformation
quantization on a complex symplectic manifold $\stx$ and recall some results:
construction of an algebra for $\star$-products, existence of (twisted) simple
modules along smooth Lagrangian submanifolds, perversity of the complex of
solutions for regular holonomic $\W[\stx]$-modules, finiteness and duality for
the composition of ``good'' kernels. As a corollary, we get that the derived
category of good $\W[\stx]$-modules with compact support is a Calabi-Yau
category. We also give a conjectural Riemann-Roch type formula in this
framework.
