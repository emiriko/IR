We present general relativistic correction terms appearing in Newton's
gravity to the second-order perturbations of cosmological fluids. In our
previous work we have shown that to the second-order perturbations, the density
and velocity perturbation equations of general relativistic zero-pressure,
irrotational, single-component fluid in a flat background coincide exactly with
the ones known in Newton's theory. Here, we present the general relativistic
second-order correction terms arising due to (i) pressure, (ii)
multi-component, (iii) background curvature, and (iv) rotation. In case of
multi-component zero-pressure, irrotational fluids under the flat background,
we effectively do not have relativistic correction terms, thus the relativistic
result again coincides with the Newtonian ones. In the other three cases we
generally have pure general relativistic correction terms. In case of pressure,
the relativistic corrections appear even in the level of background and linear
perturbation equations. In the presence of background curvature, or rotation,
pure relativistic correction terms directly appear in the Newtonian equations
of motion of density and velocity perturbations to the second order. In the
small-scale limit (far inside the horizon), relativistic equations including
the rotation coincide with the ones in Newton's gravity.
