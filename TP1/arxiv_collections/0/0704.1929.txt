Contrary to conventional wisdom, our purified La2-2xSr1+2xMn2O7 crystals
exhibit CE-type orbital and charge order as the low-temperature ground state
for a hole doping level h = 0.5. For small deviations from h = 0.5, the high
temperature CE phase is replaced at low temperatures by an A-type
antiferromagnet without coexistence. Larger deviations result in a lack of CE
order at any temperature. Thus, small inhomogeneities in cation or oxygen
composition could explain why others commonly see this reentrance with
coexistence.
