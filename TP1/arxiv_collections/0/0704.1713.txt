We have searched for the SiO J=1--0 v= 1 and 2 maser lines at ~ 43 GHz in 277
2MASS/MSX/IRAS sources off the Galactic plane (|b|> 3 deg), which resulted in
119 (112 new) detections. Among the new detections, are two very faint objects
with MSX 12 micron flux densities below 2 Jy. These are likely to be O-rich
AGB-stars associated with dwarf-galaxy tidal tails. The sample also includes
medium bright MSX objects at moderately high Galactic latitudes (3 deg<|b|<5
deg) and in the IRAS gap at higher latitudes. A signature of a warp of the
inner Galactic disk is found for a disk subsample. This warp appears relatively
strongly in the area of 0<l<45 deg and 3<|b|<5 deg. We also found a group of
stars that does not follow to the Galactic rotation. This feature appears in
the Galactic disk at l~ 27 deg, and extends more than 15 deg in Galactic
latitude, like a stream of tidal debris from a dwarf galaxy.
