We give a comparison of the spectrum of Yang-Mills theory in $D=3+1$,
recently derived with a strong coupling expansion, with lattice data. We verify
excellent agreement also for 2$^{++}$ glueball. A deep analogy with the $D=2+1$
case is obtained and a full quantum theory of this approach is also given.
