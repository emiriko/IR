The amplitude mode of a fermionic superfluid, analogous to the Higgs Boson,
becomes undamped in the strong coupling regime when its frequency is pushed
inside the BCS energy gap. We argue that this is the case in cold gases due to
the energy dispersion and nonlocality of the pairing interaction, and propose
to use the Feshbach resonance regime for parametric excitation of this mode.
The results presented for the BCS pairing dynamics indicate that even weak
dispersion suppresses dephasing and gives rise to persistent oscillations. The
frequency of oscillations extracted from our simulation of the BCS dynamics
agrees with the prediction of the many-body theory.
