A new formulation of the Electroweak Model with 3-dimensional spherical
geometry in the target space is suggested. The free Lagrangian in the spherical
field space along with the standard gauge field Lagrangian form the full
Higgsless Lagrangian of the model, whose second order terms reproduce the same
fields with the same masses as the Standard Electroweak Model. The vector
bosons and electron masses are generated automatically, so there is no need in
special mechanism.
