Following deep astrometric and photometric study of the cluster NGC2682
(M67), we are able to accurately determine its fundamental parameters. Being an
old and rich cluster, M67 is a relevant object for the analysis of the Galactic
disk evolution. M67 is well studied but the lack of a wide and deep Stromgren
photometric study makes our results worthwhile. The brightest stars of the open
cluster M67 were used as uvby-Hbeta standard stars in our studies of NGC1817
and NGC2548, and the extension of the field covered, as well as the amount of
observations, allowed to obtain the best set of Stromgren data ever published
for this cluster. We discuss the results of our CCD uvby-Hbeta
intermediate-band photometry, covering an area of about 50'x50' down to V 19.
Moreover, a complete membership segregation based on astrometric and
photometric criteria is obtained. The photometric analysis of a selected sample
of stars yields a reddening value of E(b-y)= 0.03\pm0.03, a distance modulus of
V_0-M_V= 9.7\pm0.2 and [Fe/H]= 0.01\pm0.14. Through isochrone fitting we found
an age of log t= 9.6\pm0.1 (4.2\pm0.2 Gyr). A clump of approximately 60 stars
around V= 16, (b-y)= 0.4 could be interpreted as a population of
pre-cataclysmic variable stars (if members), or as a stream of field G-type
stars placed at twice the distance of the cluster (if non-members).
