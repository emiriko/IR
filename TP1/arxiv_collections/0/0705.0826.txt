Integrated light in direct excitation and energy transfer luminescence has
been investigated. In the investigations reported here, monomolecular centers
were taken into account. It was found that the integrated light is equal to the
product of generation rate and time of duration of excitation pulse for both
direct excitation and energy transfer luminescence.
