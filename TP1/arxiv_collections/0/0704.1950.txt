Dielectric micro-cavities are widely used as laser resonators and
characterizations of their spectra are of interest for various applications. We
experimentally investigate micro-lasers of simple shapes (Fabry-Perot, square,
pentagon, and disk). Their lasing spectra consist mainly of almost equidistant
peaks and the distance between peaks reveals the length of a quantized periodic
orbit. To measure this length with a good precision, it is necessary to take
into account different sources of refractive index dispersion. Our experimental
and numerical results agree with the superscar model describing the formation
of long-lived states in polygonal cavities. The limitations of the
two-dimensional approximation are briefly discussed in connection with
micro-disks.
