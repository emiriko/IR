The oxidation state of chromium in glasses melted in an air atmosphere with
and without refining agents was investigated by Cr K-edge X-ray Absorption
Near-Edge Structure (XANES) and optical absorption spectroscopy. A good
agreement in the relative proportion of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) is obtained between
both methods. We show that the chemical dependence of the absorption
coefficient of Cr(III) is less important in XANES than in optical absorption
spectroscopy. The comparison of glasses melted under different conditions
provides an indirect assessment of the molar extinction coefficient of Cr(VI)
in glasses.
