We analyze the dynamics of a forecasting game which exhibits the phenomenon
of information cascades. Each agent aims at correctly predicting a binary
variable and he/she can either look for independent information or herd on the
choice of others. We show that dynamics can be analitically described in terms
of a Langevin equation and its collective behavior is described by the solution
of a Kramers' problem. This provides very accurate results in the region where
the vast majority of agents herd, which corresponds to the most interesting one
from a game theoretic point of view.
