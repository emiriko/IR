To understand the whole set of positive and null data on the
Theta+(1530)-production, we suggest the hypothesis that multiquark hadrons are
mainly generated from many-quark states, which emerge either as short-term
hadron fluctuations, or as hadron remnants in hard processes. This approach
allows us to describe both non-observation of the Theta+ in current null
experiments and peculiar features of its production in positive experiments.
Further, we are able to propose new experiments that might be decisive for the
problem of the Theta+ existence. Distributions of the Theta+ in such
experiments can give important information both on higher Fock components of
conventional hadrons and about structure and hadronization properties of hadron
remnants produced in hard processes. We also explain that description of
multiquark hadrons may require a modified form of the constituent quark model,
with quark masses and couplings being intermediate between their values for the
familiar constituent quarks and the current ones.
