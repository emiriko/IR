We present absolute parallaxes and relative proper motions for five AM CVn
stars, which we obtained using the Fine Guidance Sensors on board the Hubble
Space Telescope. Our parallax measurements translate into distances d(AM
CVn)=606+135-93 pc, d(HP Lib)=197+14-12 pc, d(CR Boo)=337+44-35 pc, d(V803
Cen)=347+32-27 pc, and d(GP Com)=75+2-2 pc. From these distances we estimate
the space density of AM CVn stars and suggest that previous estimates have been
too high by about an order of magnitude. We also infer the mass accretion rates
which allows us to constrain the masses of the donor stars, and we show that
relatively massive, semi-degenerate donor stars are favored in all systems
except GP Com. Finally, we give updated estimates for their gravitational-wave
signals, relevant for future space missions such as the proposed Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), based on their distances and the inferred
masses of the binary components. We show that all systems but GP Com are
excellent candidates for detection with LISA.
