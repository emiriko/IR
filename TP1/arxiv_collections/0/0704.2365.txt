With more intense sources of cold and ultracold neutrons becoming available
and with improved experimental techniques being developed, determination of
|Vud| from neutron beta decay with a similar precision to that from from
superallowed beta decays is within reach. Determination of |Vud| from neutron
beta decay, free from nuclear corrections, hold the most promise for a further
improvement of the determination of |Vud|. The current and future neutron beta
decay correlation experiments including the UCNA experiment at Los Alamos
National Laboratory are reviewed
