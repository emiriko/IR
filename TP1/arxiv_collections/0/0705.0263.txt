Recent experiments on La$_2$CuO$_4$ suggest that indirect resonant inelastic
X-ray scattering (RIXS) might provide a probe for transversal spin dynamics. We
present in detail a systematic expansion of the relevant magnetic RIXS cross
section by using the ultrashort core-hole lifetime (UCL) approximation. We
compute the scattering intensity and its momentum dependence in leading order
of the UCL expansion. The scattering is due to two-magnon processes and is
calculated within a linear spin-wave expansion of the Heisenberg spin model for
this compound, including longer range and cyclic spin interactions. We observe
that the latter terms in the Hamiltonian enhance the first moment of the
spectrum if they strengthen the antiferromagnetic ordering. The theoretical
spectra agree very well with experimental data, including the observation that
scattering intensity vanishes for the transferred momenta ${\bf q} = (0,0)$ and
${\bf q} = (\pi,\pi)$. We show that at finite temperature there is an
additional single-magnon contribution to the scattering with a spectral weight
proportional to $T^3$. We also compute the leading corrections to the UCL
approximation and find them to be small, putting the UCL results on a solid
basis. All this univocally points to the conclusion that the observed low
temperature RIXS intensity in La$_2$CuO$_4$ is due to two-magnon scattering.
