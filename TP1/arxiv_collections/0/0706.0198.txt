We reply to the comment by Jung, Bokes, and Godby (arXiv:0706.0140) on our
paper Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 186810 (2005). We show that the results in their
comment should not be taken as an indication that the viscosity corrections to
the conductance of real nanoscale structures are small. A more accurate
treatment of the density and current density distribution and of the electronic
correlations may yield much larger corrections in realistic systems.
