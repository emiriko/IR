In this article we present a pedagogical introduction of the main ideas and
recent advances in the area of topological quantum computation. We give an
overview of the concept of anyons and their exotic statistics, present various
models that exhibit topological behavior, and we establish their relation to
quantum computation. Possible directions for the physical realization of
topological systems and the detection of anyonic behavior are elaborated.
