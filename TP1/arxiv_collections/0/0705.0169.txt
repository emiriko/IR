Binary microlensing light curves have a variety of morphologies. Many are
indistinguishable from point lens light curves. Of those that deviate from the
point lens form, caustic crossing light curves have tended to dominate
identified binary lens events. Other distinctive signatures of binary lenses
include significant asymmetry, multiple peaks, and repeating events. We have
quantified, using high resolution simulations, the theoretically expected
relative numbers of each type of binary lens event, based on its measurable
characteristics. We find that a microlensing survey with current levels of
photometric uncertainty and sampling should find at least as many non-caustic
crossing binary lens events as caustic crossing events; in future surveys with
more sensitive photometry, the contribution of distinctive non-caustic crossing
events will be even greater. To try to explain why caustic crossing light
curves appear to be so dominant among the published binary lensing events, we
investigate the influence of several physical effects, including blending,
sampling rate, and various binary populations.
