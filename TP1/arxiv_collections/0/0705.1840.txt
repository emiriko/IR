We present a new stationary, asymptotically flat solution of 5D
Einstein-Maxwell gravity describing a Saturn-like black object: a rotating
black hole surrounded by a rotating dipole black ring. The solution is
generated by combining the vacuum black Saturn solution and the vacuum black
ring solution with appropriately chosen parameters. Some basic properties of
the solution are analyzed and the basic quantities are calculated.
