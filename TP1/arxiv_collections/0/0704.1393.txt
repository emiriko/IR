By combining high-resolution (HST-WFPC2) and wide-field ground based (2.2m
ESO-WFI) and space (GALEX) observations, we have collected a multi-wavelength
photometric data base (ranging from the far UV to the near infrared) of the
galactic globular cluster NGC1904 (M79). The sample covers the entire cluster
extension, from the very central regions up to the tidal radius. In the present
paper such a data set is used to study the BSS population and its radial
distribution. A total number of 39 bright ($m_{218}\le 19.5$) BSS has been
detected, and they have been found to be highly segregated in the cluster core.
No significant upturn in the BSS frequency has been observed in the outskirts
of NGC 1904, in contrast to other clusters (M 3, 47 Tuc, NGC 6752, M 5) studied
with the same technique. Such evidences, coupled with the large radius of
avoidance estimated for NGC 1904 ($r_{avoid}\sim 30$ core radii), indicate that
the vast majority of the cluster heavy stars (binaries) has already sunk to the
core. Accordingly, extensive dynamical simulations suggest that BSS formed by
mass transfer activity in primordial binaries evolving in isolation in the
cluster outskirts represent only a negligible (0--10%) fraction of the overall
population.
