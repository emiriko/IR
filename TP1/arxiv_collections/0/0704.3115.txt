We study the effect of impurities in superconducting graphene and discuss
their influence on the local electronic properties. In particular, we consider
the case of magnetic and non-magnetic impurities being either strongly
localized or acting as a potential averaged over one unit cell. The spin
dependent local density of states is calculated and possibilities for
visualizing impurities by means of scanning tunneling experiments is pointed
out. A possibility of identifying magnetic scatters even by non spin-polarized
scanning tunneling spectroscopy is explained.
