A comprehensive picture of high-mass star formation has remained elusive, in
part because examples of high-mass YSOs tend to be relatively distant, deeply
embedded, and confused with other emission sources. These factors have impeded
dynamical investigations within tens of AU of high-mass YSOs--scales that are
critical for probing the interfaces where outflows from accretion disks are
launched and collimated. Using observations of SiO masers obtained with the VLA
and the VLBA, the KaLYPSO project is overcoming these limitations by mapping
the structure and dynamical/temporal evolution of the material 10-1000 AU from
the nearest high-mass YSO: Radio Source I in the Orion BN/KL region. Our data
include ~40 epochs of VLBA observations over a several-year period, allowing us
to track the proper motions of individual SiO maser spots and to monitor
changes in the physical conditions of the emitting material with time.
Ultimately these data will provide 3-D maps of the outflow structure over
approximately 30% of the outflow crossing time. Here we summarize recent
results from the KaLYPSO project, including evidence that high-mass star
formation is occurring via disk-mediated accretion.
