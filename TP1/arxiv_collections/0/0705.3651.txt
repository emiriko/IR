Computations with Barvinok's short rational generating functions are
traditionally being performed in the dual space, to avoid the combinatorial
complexity of inclusion--exclusion formulas for the intersecting proper faces
of cones. We prove that, on the level of indicator functions of polyhedra,
there is no need for using inclusion--exclusion formulas to account for
boundary effects: All linear identities in the space of indicator functions can
be purely expressed using half-open variants of the full-dimensional polyhedra
in the identity. This gives rise to a practically efficient, parametric
Barvinok algorithm in the primal space.
