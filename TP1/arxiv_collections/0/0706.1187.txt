The use of photonic crystal fibers pumped by femtosecond pulses has enabled
the generation of broad optical supercontinua with nano-joule input energies.
This striking discovery has applications ranging from spectroscopy and
metrology to telecommunication and medicine. Amongst the physical principles
underlying supercontinuum generation are soliton fission, a variety of
four-wave mixing processes, Raman induced soliton self-frequency shift, and
dispersive wave generation mediated by solitons. Although all of the above
effects contribute to supercontinuum generation none of them can explain the
generation of blue and violet light from infrared femtosecond pump pulses,
which has been seen already in the first observations of the supercontinuum in
photonic crystal fibers. In this work we argue that the most profound role in
the shaping of the short-wavelength edge of the continuum is played by the
effect of radiation trapping in a gravity-like potential created by
accelerating solitons. The underlying physics of this effect has a
straightforward analogy with the inertial forces acting on an observer moving
with a constant acceleration.
