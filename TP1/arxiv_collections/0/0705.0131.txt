We consider a cubic nonlinear Schroedinger equation with periodic potential.
In a semiclassical scaling the nonlinear interaction of modulated pulses
concentrated in one or several Bloch bands is studied. The notion of closed
mode systems is introduced which allows for the rigorous derivation of a finite
system of amplitude equations describing the macroscopic dynamics of these
pulses.
