We show that the enhancement of the saturation scale in large nuclei relative
to the proton is significantly influenced by the effects of quantum evolution
and the impact parameter dependence of dipole cross sections in high energy
QCD. We demonstrate that there is a strong A dependence in diffractive deeply
inelastic scattering and discuss its sensitivity to the measurement of the
recoil nucleus.
