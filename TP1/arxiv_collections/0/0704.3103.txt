We wish to transmit messages to and from a hypersonic vehicle around which a
plasma sheath has formed. For long distance transmission, the signal carrying
these messages must be necessarily low frequency, typically 2 GHz, to which the
plasma sheath is opaque. The idea is to use the plasma properties to make the
plasma sheath appear transparent.
