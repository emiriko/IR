We present the first high-dispersion spectroscopy of He I 10830 from the
hotspots in the ring around SN1987A, obtained at Gemini South, spatially
resolving the near and far sides of the ring. We compare these line profiles to
similar echelle spectra of H$\alpha$ and [N II] 6583 obtained at the Magellan
Observatory. We find that the He I profiles are much broader than H-alpha or [N
II], but the He I profiles also have different shapes -- they have enhanced
emission at high speeds, with extra blueshifted emission on the north side of
the ring, and extra redshifted emission on the south side. To explain this, we
invoke a simple geometric picture where the extra He I emission traces hotter
gas from faster shocks that strike the apex of the hotspots directly, while the
H-alpha preferentially traces cooler lower-ionization gas from slower
transverse shocks that penetrate into the sides of the ring.
