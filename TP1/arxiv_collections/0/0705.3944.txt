The production of new spin-1 chiral bosons at the hadron colliders, the
Fermilab Tevatron and the CERN LHC, is considered. The masses of the chiral
bosons can be determined on the basis of experimental data of precise
low-energy experiments, which already indicate indirectly their existence. They
can explain, for example, the serious 4.5 sigma discrepancy between the
measured and the predicted two pion branching ratio of the tau decay and the
sign of the 3.3 sigma deviation of the muon (g-2) theoretical prediction from
the experimental value. Quantitative evaluations of the various differential
cross-sections of the chiral boson production at hadron colliders are made
using the CalcHEP package. It is noteworthy that the Tevatron data already hint
the existence of the lightest charged chiral boson with a mass around 500 GeV.
New Tevatron data and the LHC results will definitely confirm or reject this
indication. In the positive case the LHC would be able to discover all
predicted charged and neutral chiral bosons spanning in mass up to 1 TeV.
