We present a compact $^{87}$Rb atomic source for high precision dual atom
interferometers. The source is based on a double-stage magneto-optical trap
(MOT) design, consisting of a 2-dimensional (2D)-MOT for efficient loading of a
3D-MOT. The accumulated atoms are precisely launched in a horizontal moving
molasses. Our setup generates a high atomic flux ($>10^{10}$ atoms/s) with
precise and flexibly tunable atomic trajectories as required for high
resolution Sagnac atom interferometry. We characterize the performance of the
source with respect to the relevant parameters of the launched atoms, i.e.
temperature, absolute velocity and pointing, by utilizing time-of-flight
techniques and velocity selective Raman transitions.
