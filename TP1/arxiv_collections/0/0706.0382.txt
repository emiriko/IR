The properties of the Volume operator in Loop Quantum Gravity, as constructed
by Ashtekar and Lewandowski, are analyzed for the first time at generic
vertices of valence greater than four. The present analysis benefits from the
general simplified formula for matrix elements of the Volume operator derived
in gr-qc/0405060, making it feasible to implement it on a computer as a matrix
which is then diagonalized numerically. The resulting eigenvalues serve as a
database to investigate the spectral properties of the volume operator.
Analytical results on the spectrum at 4-valent vertices are included. This is a
companion paper to arXiv:0706.0469, providing details of the analysis presented
there.
