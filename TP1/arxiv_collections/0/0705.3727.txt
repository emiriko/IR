We present eight new T4.5-T7.5 dwarfs identified in the UKIRT Infrared Deep
Sky Survey (UKIDSS) Large Area Survey (LAS) Data Release 1 (DR1). In addition
we have recovered the T4.5 dwarf SDSS J020742.91+000056.2 and the T8.5 dwarf
ULAS J003402.77-005206.7. Photometric candidates were picked up in two-colour
diagrams over 190 square degrees (DR1) and selected in at least two filters.
All candidates exhibit near-infrared spectra with strong methane and water
absorption bands characteristic of T dwarfs and the derived spectral types
follow the unified scheme of Burgasser et al. (2006). We have found 6 new
T4.5-T5.5 dwarfs, one T7 dwarf, one T7.5 dwarf, and recovered a T4.5 dwarf and
a T8.5 dwarf. We provide distance estimates which lie in the 15-85 pc range;
the T7.5 and T8.5 dwarfs are probably within 25 pc of the Sun. We conclude with
a discussion of the number of T dwarfs expected after completion of the LAS,
comparing these initial results to theoretical simulations.
