In this work we consider the standard model extended with singlet sterile
neutrinos with mass in the eV range and mixed with the active neutrinos. The
active-sterile neutrino mixing renders new contributions to the invisible Z
decay width which, in the case of light sterile neutrinos, depends on the
active-sterile mixing matrix elements only. We then use the current
experimental value of the invisible Z decay width to obtain bounds on these
mixing matrix elements for both (3+1) and (3+2) models.
