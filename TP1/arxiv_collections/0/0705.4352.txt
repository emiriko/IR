We discuss the experimental signal for the Bose condensation of cold atoms in
an optical lattice at finite temperature. Instead of using the visibility of
the interference pattern via the time-of-flight imaging, we show that the
momentum space density profile in the first Brillouin zone, in particular its
bimodal distribution, provides an unambiguous signal for the Bose condensation.
We confirm this point with detailed calculation of the change in the atomic
momentum distribution across the condensation phase transition, taking into
account both the global trapping potential and the atomic interaction effects.
