We present a general scheme for multiparty-controlled teleportation of an
arbitrary m-qudit ($d$-dimensional quantum system) state by using non-maximally
entangled states as the quantum channel. The sender performs m generalized
Bell-state measurements on her 2$m$ particles, the controllers take some
single-particle measurements with the measuring basis $X_{d}$ and the receiver
only need to introduce one auxiliary two-level particle to extract quantum
information probabilistically with the fidelity unit if he cooperates with all
the controllers. All the parties can use some decoy photons to set up their
quantum channel securely, which will forbid some a dishonest party to eavesdrop
freely. This scheme is optimal as the probability that the receiver obtains the
originally unknown m-qudit state equals to the entanglement of the quantum
channel.
