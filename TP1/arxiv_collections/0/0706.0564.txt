The software TrIm offers implementations of tropical implicitization and
tropical elimination, as developed by Tevelev and the authors. Given a
polynomial map with generic coefficients, TrIm computes the tropical variety of
the image. When the image is a hypersurface, the output is the Newton polytope
of the defining polynomial. TrIm can thus be used to compute mixed fiber
polytopes, including secondary polytopes.
