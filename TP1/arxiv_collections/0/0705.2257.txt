In this letter, we elaborate on the identification and construction of the
differential geometric elements underlying Berry's phase. Berry bundles are
built generally from the physical data of the quantum system under study. We
apply this construction to typical and recently investigated systems presenting
Berry's phase to explore their geometric features.
