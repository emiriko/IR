We construct SU(2) calorons, with non-trivial holonomy, instanton charge 2
and magnetic charge 0 or -1; these calorons have two constituent monopoles,
with charges (2,2) or (2,1). Our calorons are U(1)-symmetric and are
constructed via the Nahm transform. They fall into distinct families which can
be classified using representation theory. We consider large scale and large
period limits of these calorons; in particular, the large scale limit may be a
monopole, or a caloron with different topological charges.
