We have recently confirmed SN 1996cr as a late-time type IIn supernova (SN)
via VLT spectroscopy and isolated its explosion date to ~1 yr using archival
optical imaging. We briefly touch upon here the wealth of optical, X-ray, and
radio archival observations available for this enigmatic source. Due to its
relative proximity (3.8 +/-0.6 Mpc), SN 1996cr ranks among the brightest X-ray
and radio SNe ever detected and, as such, may offer powerful insights into the
structure and composition of type IIn SNe. We also find that SN 1996cr is
matched to GRB 4B 960202 at a 2-3 sigma confidence level, making it perhaps the
third GRB to be significantly associated with a type II SN. We speculate on
whether SN 1996cr could be an off-axis or ``failed'' GRB.
