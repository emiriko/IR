The recent finding that the IGIMF (integrated galaxial initial stellar mass
function) composed of all newly formed stars in all young star clusters has, in
dependence of the SFR, a steeper slope in the high mass regime than the
underlying canonical IMF of each star cluster offers new insights into the
galactic star formation process: The classical linear relation between the SFR
and the produced H$\alpha$ luminosity is broken and SFRs are always
underestimated. Our new relation is likely to lead to a revision of the
cosmological SFH.
