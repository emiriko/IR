We present first results on the topological reconstruction of open charm
mesons in p+p collisions at $\snn$ = 200 GeV using electron tagging. The
analysis makes use of the full acceptance of the STAR electromagnetic
calorimeter during Run VI data taking. A clear D$^0$ signal is obtained with a
remarkable signal-to-background ratio of about 1/7 and a signal significance of
about 4. The azimuthal correlation distribution of the subleading electrons
associated with open charm mesons exhibits a two-peak structure. We found first
indications for prompt charm meson pair production. This correlation technique
allows detailed energy loss measurements of open charm mesons in heavy-ion
collisions.
