Conditions for the gluing matrix defining consistent boundary conditions of
two-dimensional nonlinear sigma-models are analyzed and reformulated.
Transformation properties of the right-invariant fields under Poisson-Lie
T-plurality are used to derive a formula for the transformation of the boundary
conditions. Examples of transformation of D-branes in two and three dimensions
are presented. We investigate obstacles arising in this procedure and propose
possible solutions.
