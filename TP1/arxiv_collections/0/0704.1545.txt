We construct a quantum theory of free fermion field based on the generalized
uncertainty principle using supersymmetry as a guiding principle. A
supersymmetric field theory with a real scalar field and a Majorana fermion
field is given explicitly and we also find that the supersymmetry algebra is
deformed from an usual one.
