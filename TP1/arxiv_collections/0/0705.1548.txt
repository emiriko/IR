A major challenge in analyzing animal behavior is to discover some underlying
simplicity in complex motor actions. Here we show that the space of shapes
adopted by the nematode C. elegans is surprisingly low dimensional, with just
four dimensions accounting for 95% of the shape variance, and we partially
reconstruct "equations of motion" for the dynamics in this space. These
dynamics have multiple attractors, and we find that the worm visits these in a
rapid and almost completely deterministic response to weak thermal stimuli.
Stimulus-dependent correlations among the different modes suggest that one can
generate more reliable behaviors by synchronizing stimuli to the state of the
worm in shape space. We confirm this prediction, effectively "steering" the
worm in real time.
