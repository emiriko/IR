A long duration photon beam can induce macroscopic coherent effects on a
plasma by single photon electron scattering if the probability of the
interaction approaches 1 in a volume of unit surface and length equal to the
plasma typical wavelength, and the induced electron oscillations become
relativistic in few plasma cycles. A fraction of the plasma electrons is
accelerated through the Wakefield mechanism by the cavities created by the
photon-electron interactions and radiates through boosted betraton emission in
the same cavities. The resulting emission in this framework is very similar to
the typical GRB radiation. Several comparisons with GRB light curves and
spectral-energy correlations will be presented.
