We analyze several integrable systems in zero-curvature form within the
framework of $SL(2,\R)$ invariant gauge theory. In the Drienfeld-Sokolov gauge
we derive a two-parameter family of nonlinear evolution equations which as
special cases include the Kortweg-de Vries (KdV) and Harry Dym equations. We
find residual gauge transformations which lead to infinintesimal symmetries of
this family of equations. For KdV and Harry Dym equations we find an infinite
hierarchy of such symmetry transformations, and we investigate their relation
with local conservation laws, constants of the motion and the bi-Hamiltonian
structure of the equations. Applying successive gauge transformatinos of Miura
type we obtain a sequence of gauge equivalent integrable systems, among them
the modified KdV and Calogero KdV equations.
