Theoretical as well as experimental progress has been made in the last decade
in describing the properties of baryons. In this review I will mostly report on
the theoretical issues. Two non-perturbative methods are privileged frameworks
for studying these properties in the low energy domain: chiral perturbation
theory, the effective field theory of the Standard Model at energies below 1
GeV and lattice QCD. I will mainly concentrate here on the first one but I will
also discuss the complementarity of the two methods. Chiral extrapolations for
lattice simulations of some nucleon properties will be investigated. I will
then concentrate on processes involving at most two nucleons, describing for
example pion-nucleon and pion-deuteron scattering, pion photo- and
electroproduction off the nucleon and the deuteron and doubly virtual Compton
scattering. Three flavor calculations will also be reviewed.
