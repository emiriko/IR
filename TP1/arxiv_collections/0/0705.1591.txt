The ratio of transverse momentum distribution of thermal photons to dilepton
has been evaluated. It is observed that this ratio reaches a plateau beyond a
certain value of transverse momentum. We argue that this ratio can be used to
estimate the initial temperature of the system by selecting the transverse
momentum and invariance mass windows judiciously. It is demonstrated that if
the radial flow is large then the plateau disappear and hence a deviation from
the plateau can be used as an indicator of large radial flow. The sensitivity
of the results on various input parameters has been studied.
