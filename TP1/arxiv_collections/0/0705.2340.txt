We present results for the dependence of the residual mass of domain wall
fermions (DWF) on the size of the fifth dimension and its relation to the
density and localization properties of low-lying eigenvectors of the
corresponding hermitian Wilson Dirac operator relevant to simulations of 2+1
flavor domain wall QCD. Using the DBW2 and Iwasaki gauge actions, we generate
ensembles of configurations with a $16^3\times 32$ space-time volume and an
extent of 8 in the fifth dimension for the sea quarks. We demonstrate the
existence of a regime where the degree of locality, the size of chiral symmetry
breaking and the rate of topology change can be acceptable for inverse lattice
spacings $a^{-1} \ge 1.6$ GeV.
