The well known FPU phenomenon (lack of attainment of equipartition of the
mode--energies at low energies, for some exceptional initial data) suggests
that the FPU model does not have the mixing property at low energies. We give
numerical indications that this is actually the case. This we show by computing
orbits for sets of initial data of full measure, sampled out from the
microcanonical ensemble by standard Montecarlo techniques. Mixing is tested by
looking at the decay of the autocorrelations of the mode--energies, and it is
found that the high--frequency modes have autocorrelations that tend instead to
positive values. Indications are given that such a nonmixing property survives
in the thermodynamic limit. It is left as an open problem whether mixing
obtains within time--scales much longer than the presently available ones.
