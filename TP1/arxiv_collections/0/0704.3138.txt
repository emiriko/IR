We demonstrate the power of the genetic algorithms to construct the cellular
automata model simulating the growth of 2-dimensional close-to-circular
clusters revealing the desired properties, such as the growth rate and, at the
same time, the fractal behavior of their contours. The possible application of
the approach in the field of tumor modeling is outlined.
