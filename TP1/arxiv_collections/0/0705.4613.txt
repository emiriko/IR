By means of contractions of Lie algebras, we obtain new classes of
indecomposable quasi-classical Lie algebras that satisfy the Yang-Baxter
equations in its reformulation in terms of triple products. These algebras are
shown to arise naturally from non-compact real simple algebras with non-simple
complexification, where we impose that a non-degenerate quadratic Casimir
operator is preserved by the limiting process. We further consider the converse
problem, and obtain sufficient conditions on integrable cocycles of
quasi-classical Lie algebras in order to preserve non-degenerate quadratic
Casimir operators by the associated linear deformations.
