We examine the interplay between size quantization and Landau quantization in
the De Haas-Van Alphen oscillations of clean, metallic nanowires in a
longitudinal magnetic field for `hard' boundary conditions, i.e. those of an
infinite round well, as opposed to the `soft' parabolically confined boundary
conditions previously treated in Alexandrov and Kabanov (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf
95}, 076601 (2005) (AK)). We find that there exist {\em two} fundamental
frequencies as opposed to the one found in bulk systems and the three
frequencies found by AK with soft boundary counditions. In addition, we find
that the additional `magic resonances' of AK may be also observed in the
infinite well case, though they are now damped. We also compare the numerically
generated energy spectrum of the infinite well potential with that of our
analytic approximation, and compare calculations of the oscillatory portions of
the thermodynamic quantities for both models.
