In this paper, site percolation on random $\Phi^{3}$ planar graphs is studied
by Monte-Carlo numerical techniques. The method consists in randomly removing a
fraction $q=1-p$ of vertices from graphs generated by Monte-Carlo simulations,
where $p$ is the occupation probability. The resulting graphs are made of
clusters of occupied sites. By measuring several properties of their
distribution, it is shown that percolation occurs for an occupation probability
above a percolation threshold $p_{c}$=0.7360(5). Moreover, critical exponents
are compatible with those analytically known for bond percolation.
