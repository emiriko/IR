In this paper, we deal with a generalization of the geometry of
parallelizable manifolds, or the absolute parallelism (AP-) geometry, in the
context of generalized Lagrange spaces. All geometric objects defined in this
geometry are not only functions of the positional argument $x$, but also depend
on the directional argument $y$. In other words, instead of dealing with
geometric objects defined on the manifold $M$, as in the case of classical
AP-geometry, we are dealing with geometric objects in the pullback bundle
$\pi^{-1}(TM)$ (the pullback of the tangent bundle $TM$ by $ \pi: T
M\longrightarrow M$). Many new geometric objects, which have no counterpart in
the classical AP-geometry, emerge in this more general context. We refer to
such a geometry as generalized AP-geometry (GAP-geometry). In analogy to
AP-geometry, we define a $d$-connection in $\pi^{-1}(TM)$ having remarkable
properties, which we call the canonical $d$-connection, in terms of the unique
torsion-free Riemannian $d$-connection. In addition to these two
$d$-connections, two more $d$-connections are defined, the dual and the
symmetric $d$-connections. Our space, therefore, admits twelve curvature
tensors (corresponding to the four defined $d$-connections), three of which
vanish identically. Simple formulae for the nine non-vanishing curvatures
tensors are obtained, in terms of the torsion tensors of the canonical
$d$-connection. The different $W$-tensors admitted by the space are also
calculated. All contractions of the $h$- and $v$-curvature tensors and the
$W$-tensors are derived. Second rank symmetric and skew-symmetric tensors,
which prove useful in physical applications, are singled out.
