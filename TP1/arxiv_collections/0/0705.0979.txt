Type Ia supernovae are currently the best known standard candles at
cosmological distances. In addition to providing a powerful probe of dark
energy they are an ideal source of information about the peculiar velocity
field of the local universe. Even with the very small number of supernovae
presently available it has been possible to measure the dipole and quadrupole
of the local velocity field out to z~0.025. With future continuous all-sky
surveys like the LSST project the luminosity distances of tens of thousands of
nearby supernovae will be measured accurately. This will allow for a
determination of the local velocity structure of the universe as a function of
redshift with unprecedented accuracy, provided the redshifts of the host
galaxies are known. Using catalogues of mock surveys we estimate that future
low redshift supernova surveys will be able to probe sigma-8 to a precision of
roughly 5% at 95% C.L. This is comparable to the precision in future galaxy and
weak lensing surveys and with a relatively modest observational effort it will
provide a crucial cross-check on future measurements of the matter power
spectrum.
