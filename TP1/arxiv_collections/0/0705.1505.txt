We have used the light-cone formulation of Chiral-Quark Soliton Model to
estimate the width of the lightest pentaquark Theta+. We have found that the
effect of nonzero momentum transfer is important and reduces drastically the
width to about 0.43 MeV. This means that this effect is a piece of the small
width puzzle of exotic baryons.
