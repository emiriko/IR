We discuss quantum evolution of a decaying state in relation to a recent
experiment of Katz et al. Based on exact analytical and numerical solutions of
a simple model, we identify a regime where qubit retains coherence over a
finite time interval independently of the rates of three competing decoherence
processes. In this regime, the quantum decay process can be continuously
monitored via a ``weak'' measurement without affecting the qubit coherence.
