Temperature dependent impedance spectroscopy enables the many contributions
to the dielectric and resistive properties of condensed matter to be
deconvoluted and characterized separately. We have achieved this for
multiferroic epitaxial thin films of BiFeO3 (BFO) and BiMnO3 (BMO), key
examples of materials with strong magneto-electric coupling. We demonstrate
that the true film capacitance of the epitaxial layers is similar to that of
the electrode interface, making analysis of capacitance as a function of film
thickness necessary to achieve deconvolution. We modeled non-Debye impedance
response using Gaussian distributions of relaxation times and reveal that
conventional resistivity measurements on multiferroic layers may be dominated
by interface effects. Thermally activated charge transport models yielded
activation energies of 0.60 eV +- 0.05 eV (BFO) and 0.25 eV +- 0.03 eV (BMO),
which is consistent with conduction dominated by oxygen vacancies (BFO) and
electron hopping (BMO). The intrinsic film dielectric constants were determined
to be 320 +- 75 (BFO) and 450 +- 100 (BMO).
