Results for the production of charm and beauty quarks in proton anti-proton
collisions at ECM=1.96 TeV (Tevatron) with the two multi purpose experiments
CDF and D0 using an integrated luminosity of up to 1 fb^-1 are presented. With
the data measurement of the production me chanism for charm and beauty quarks
are done. These measurements are leading to a better understanding of the QCD
in the transition region between pertubative a nd nonpertubative QCD. The
charm-charm angular correlation is measured with D me sons at the CDF
experiment. The Quarkonium production for charm and beauty final state at D0
and CDF is discussed.
