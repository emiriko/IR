The existence of neutrino masses strongly suggests that right-handed
neutrinos exist, but the data do not favor any particular scale for the
Majorana mass parameters. Here I explore the possibility that these particles
exist at the electroweak scale along with additional new physics at the TeV
scale . Higher dimension operators involving right-handed neutrinos and the
Higgs boson can introduce new decay modes of the Higgs boson, significantly
modifying its phenomenology if it is light. With minimal flavor violation the
Higgs boson cascade decays to 6 particles containing two highly displaced
vertices. Each displaced vertex produces an odd number of leptons, leading to a
dramatic signature of overall lepton violation at each vertex. I discuss the
limits from the Tevatron, and find that they are close to exploring interesting
regions of parameters, while limiting others. Moving beyond minimal flavor
violation, cascade decays of the Higgs boson into as many as 14 particles can
occur.
