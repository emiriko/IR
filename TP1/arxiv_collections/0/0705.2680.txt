It is well known that the CP violating theta term of QCD can be converted to
a phase in the quark mass term. However, a theory with a complex mass term for
quarks can be regularized so as not to violate CP, for example through a zeta
function. The contradiction is resolved through the recognition of a dependence
on the regularization or measure. The appropriate choice of regularization is
discussed and implications for the strong CP problem are pointed out.
