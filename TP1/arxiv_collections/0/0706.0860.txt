Recent searches for non-SUSY exotics in $p\bar{p}$ collisions at a
center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV at the Tevatron Run II are reported. The
emphasis is put on the results of model-driven analyses which were updated to
the full Run IIA datasets corresponding to integrated luminosities of about 1
$fb^{-1}$.
