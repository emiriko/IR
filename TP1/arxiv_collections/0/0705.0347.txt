We study the interplay between superfluidity and magnetism in a
multicomponent gas of ultracold fermions. Ward-Takahashi identities constrain
possible mean-field states describing order parameters for both pairing and
magnetization. The structure of global phase diagrams arises from competition
among these states as functions of anisotropies in chemical potential, density,
or interactions. They exhibit first and second order phase transition as well
as multicritical points, metastability regions, and phase separation. We
comment on experimental signatures in ultracold atoms.
