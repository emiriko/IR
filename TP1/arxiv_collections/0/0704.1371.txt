We propose a new upper bound for the eavesdropper's information in the direct
and reverse reconciliated coherent states quantum key distribution protocols
with heterodyne detection. This bound is derived by maximizing the leaked
information over the symplectic group of transformations that spans every
physical Gaussian attack on individual pulses. We exhibit four different
attacks that reach this bound, which shows that this bound is tight. Finally,
we compare the secret key rate obtained with this new bound to the homodyne
rate.
