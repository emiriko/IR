A model describing the influence of torsion stress on the giant
magnetoimpedance in amorphous wires with negative magnetostriction is proposed.
The wire impedance is found by means of the solution of Maxwell equations
together with the Landau-Lifshitz equation, assuming a simplified spatial
distribution of the magnetoelastic anisotropy induced by the torsion stress.
The impedance is analyzed as a function of the external magnetic field, torsion
stress and frequency. It is shown that the magnetoimpedance ratio torsion
dependence has an asymmetric shape, with a sharp peak at some value of the
torsion stress. The calculated field and stress dependences of the impedance
are in qualitative agreement with results of the experimental study of the
torsion stress giant magnetoimpedance in Co-based amorphous wires.
