With his General Theory of Relativity, Albert Einstein produced a revolution
in our conception of reality and of the knowledge we can obtain from it. This
revolution can be viewed from philosophy as leading to one of the great
paradigms in the history of thought which, together with the Aristotelian and
the Newtonian paradigms, embodied the different ways of conceiving the universe
and our access to it. The comparison among these three paradigms allows us to
understand how the human being has progressively lost his central place in the
cosmos, not only in physical terms, but also in an epistemic sense, regarding
his power of knowledge about reality.
