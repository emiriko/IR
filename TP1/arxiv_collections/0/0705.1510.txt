The scaling limit of the spin cluster boundaries of the Ising model with
domain wall boundary conditions is SLE with kappa=3. We hypothesise that the
three-state Potts model with appropriate boundary conditions has spin cluster
boundaries which are also SLE in the scaling limit, but with kappa=10/3. To
test this, we generate samples using the Wolff algorithm and test them against
predictions of SLE: we examine the statistics of the Loewner driving function,
estimate the fractal dimension and test against Schramm's formula. The results
are in support of our hypothesis.
