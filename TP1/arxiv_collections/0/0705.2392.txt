Optical microresonators have recently attracted a growing attention in the
photonics community. Their applications range from quantum electro-dynamics to
sensors and filtering devices for optical telecommunication systems, where they
are likely to become an essential building block. The integration of nonlinear
and electro-optical properties in the resonators represents a very stimulating
challenge, as it would incorporate new and more advanced functionality. Lithium
niobate is an excellent candidate material, being an established choice for
electro-optic and nonlinear optical applications. Here we report on the first
realization of optical microring resonators in submicrometric thin films of
lithium niobate. The high index contrast films are produced by an improved
crystal ion slicing and bonding technique using benzocyclobutene. The rings
have radius R=100 um and their transmission spectrum has been tuned using the
electro-optic effect. These results open new perspectives for the use of
lithium niobate in chip-scale integrated optical devices and nonlinear optical
microcavities.
