The Kramers' survival probability has been generalized by using nonextensive
formalism. This nonextensive survival probability is studied in detail and
associated Kramers' rate has been calculated in the high and low viscosity
limit. It has been showed that the proportionality of nonextensive Kramers'
rate to the nonextensive friction term in the high viscosity limit changes to
inverse proportionality in the low viscosity limit. It has also been observed
that friction constant of nonextensive processes is of rescaled form of the
ordinary frictional term. Since the relation between the ordinary rate and
nonextensive rate is found out to be linear, the Arrhenius nature of the
Kramers' rate is preserved. By using experimental results related to CO
rebinding to myoglobin after photodissociation, we conclude that nonextensivity
plays an important role in protein reactions.
