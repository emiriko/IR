It has been established that local lattice spin Hamiltonians can be used for
universal adiabatic quantum computation. However, the 2-local model
Hamiltonians used in these proofs are general and hence do not limit the types
of interactions required between spins. To address this concern, the present
paper provides two simple model Hamiltonians that are of practical interest to
experimentalists working towards the realization of a universal adiabatic
quantum computer. The model Hamiltonians presented are the simplest known
QMA-complete 2-local Hamiltonians. The 2-local Ising model with 1-local
transverse field which has been realized using an array of technologies, is
perhaps the simplest quantum spin model but is unlikely to be universal for
adiabatic quantum computation. We demonstrate that this model can be rendered
universal and QMA-complete by adding a tunable 2-local transverse XX coupling.
We also show the universality and QMA-completeness of spin models with only
1-local Z and X fields and 2-local ZX interactions.
