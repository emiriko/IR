The method of optimized perturbation theory (OPT) is used to study the phase
diagram of the massless Gross-Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions. In the temperature
and chemical potential plane, our results give strong support to the existence
of a tricritical point and line of first order phase transition, previously
only suspected to exist from extensive lattice Monte Carlo simulations. In
addition of presenting these results we discuss how the OPT can be implemented
in conjunction with the Landau expansion in order to determine all the relevant
critical quantities.
