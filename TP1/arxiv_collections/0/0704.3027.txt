We demonstrate a scheme for controlling a large quantum system by acting on a
small subsystem only. The local control is mediated to the larger system by
some fixed coupling Hamiltonian. The scheme allows to transfer arbitrary and
unknown quantum states from a memory on the large system (``upload access'') as
well as the inverse (``download access''). We study sufficient conditions of
the coupling Hamiltonian and give lower bounds on the fidelities for
downloading and uploading.
