We have used Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope to conduct a V- and I-band
imaging survey of fields sampling the spheroid of the Andromeda galaxy along
its south-east minor axis. Our photometric data are deep enough to resolve
stars down to the red clump. Based on a large and reliable sample of red giant
stars available from this deep wide-field imager, we have derived metallicity
distributions vs. radius and a surface brightness profile over projected
distances of R=23-66 kpc from the galaxy's center. The metallicity
distributions across this region shows a clear high mean metallicity and a
broad distribution ([Fe/H] ~ -0.6 +/- 0.5), and indicates no metallicity
gradient within our observed range. The surface brightness profile at R>40 kpc
is found to be flatter than previously thought. It is conceivable that this
part of the halo samples as yet unidentified, metal-rich substructure.
