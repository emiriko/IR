We report the measurement of extremely slow hole spin relaxation dynamics in
small ensembles of self-assembled InGaAs quantum dots. Individual spin
orientated holes are optically created in the lowest orbital state of each dot
and read out after a defined storage time using spin memory devices. The
resulting luminescence signal exhibits a pronounced polarization memory effect
that vanishes for long storage times. The hole spin relaxation dynamics are
measured as a function of external magnetic field and lattice temperature. We
show that hole spin relaxation can occur over remarkably long timescales in
strongly confined quantum dots (up to ~270 us), as predicted by recent theory.
Our findings are supported by calculations that reproduce both the observed
magnetic field and temperature dependencies. The results suggest that hole spin
relaxation in strongly confined quantum dots is due to spin orbit mediated
phonon scattering between Zeeman levels, in marked contrast to higher
dimensional nanostructures where it is limited by valence band mixing.
