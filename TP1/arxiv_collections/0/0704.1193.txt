We propose a novel method for studying the production of anticentauro events
in high energy heavy ion collisions utilizing Chebyshev expansion coefficients.
These coefficients have proved to be very efficient in investigating the
pattern of fluctuations in neutral pion fraction. For the anticentauro like
events, the magnitude of first few coefficients is strongly enhanced (~3 times)
as compared to those of normal HIJING events. Various characteristics of
Chebyshev coefficients are studied in detail and the probability of formation
of exotic events is calculated from the simulated events.
