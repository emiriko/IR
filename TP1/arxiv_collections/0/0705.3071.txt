We consider dijet production at a $e^+ e^-$ collider in a class of effective
theories with the relevant operators being four-fermion contact interaction.
Despite the nonrenormalizable nature of the interaction, we explicitly
demonstrate that calculating QCD corrections is both possible and meaningful.
Calculating the corrections for various differential distributions, we show
that these can be substantial and significantly different from those within the
SM. Furthermore, the corrections have a very distinctive flavor dependence.
