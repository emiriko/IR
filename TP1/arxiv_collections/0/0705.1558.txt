We have performed 2D hydrodynamic simulations of a pulsed astrophysical jet
propagating through a medium that is populated with spherical inhomogeneities,
or "clumps," which are smaller than the jet radius. The clumps are seen to
affect the jet in several ways, such as impeding jet propagation and deflecting
the jet off-axis. While there has been some debate as to the prevalence of
these types of condensations in the ISM or in molecular clouds, the exploration
of this region of parameter space nonetheless both shows the potential for
these clumps to disrupt astrophysical jets and yields results which recover
aspects of recent observations of Herbig-Haro objects. We find that the
propagation of the jet and the vorticity induced in the clump/ambient medium
correlate well with a "dynamic filling function" $f_d$ across all the
simulations.
