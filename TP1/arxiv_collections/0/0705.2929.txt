We study the Josephson current through a ferromagnetic trilayer, both in the
diffusive and clean limits. For colinear (parallel or antiparallel)
magnetizations in the layers, the Josephson current is small due to short range
proximity effect in superconductor/ferromagnet structures. For non colinear
magnetizations, we determine the conditions for the Josephson current to be
dominated by another contribution originating from long range triplet proximity
effect.
