We have used the Very Large Array (VLA) to search for radio emission from the
globular cluster G1 (Mayall-II) in M31. G1 has been reported by Gebhardt et al.
to contain an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) with a mass of ~2 x 10^4
solar masses. Radio emission was detected within an arcsecond of the cluster
center with an 8.4 GHz power of 2 x 10^{15} W/Hz. The radio/X-ray ratio of G1
is a few hundred times higher than that expected for a high-mass X-ray binary
in the cluster center, but is consistent with the expected value for accretion
onto an IMBH with the reported mass. A pulsar wind nebula is also a possible
candidate for the radio and X-ray emission from G1; future high-sensitivity
VLBI observations might distinguish between this possibility and an IMBH. If
the radio source is an IMBH, and similar accretion and outflow processes occur
for hypothesized ~ 1000-solar-mass black holes in Milky Way globular clusters,
they are within reach of the current VLA and should be detectable easily by the
Expanded VLA when it comes on line in 2010.
