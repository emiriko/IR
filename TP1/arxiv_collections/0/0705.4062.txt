Classical population genetics a priori assigns fitness to alleles without
considering molecular or functional properties of proteins that these alleles
encode. Here we study population dynamics in a model where fitness can be
inferred from physical properties of proteins under a physiological assumption
that loss of stability of any protein encoded by an essential gene confers a
lethal phenotype. Accumulation of mutations in organisms containing Gamma genes
can then be represented as diffusion within the Gamma dimensional hypercube
with adsorbing boundaries which are determined, in each dimension, by loss of a
protein stability and, at higher stability, by lack of protein sequences.
Solving the diffusion equation whose parameters are derived from the data on
point mutations in proteins, we determine a universal distribution of protein
stabilities, in agreement with existing data. The theory provides a fundamental
relation between mutation rate, maximal genome size and thermodynamic response
of proteins to point mutations. It establishes a universal speed limit on rate
of molecular evolution by predicting that populations go extinct (via lethal
mutagenesis) when mutation rate exceeds approximately 6 mutations per essential
part of genome per replication for mesophilic organisms and 1 to 2 mutations
per genome per replication for thermophilic ones. Further, our results suggest
that in absence of error correction, modern RNA viruses and primordial genomes
must necessarily be very short. Several RNA viruses function close to the
evolutionary speed limit while error correction mechanisms used by DNA viruses
and non-mutant strains of bacteria featuring various genome lengths and
mutation rates have brought these organisms universally about 1000 fold below
the natural speed limit.
