We find exact solutions to the Dirac equation in D-dimensional de Sitter
spacetime. Using these solutions we analytically calculate the de Sitter
quasinormal (QN) frequencies of the Dirac field. For the massive Dirac field
this computation is similar to that previously published for massive fields of
half-integer spin moving in four dimensions. However to calculate the QN
frequencies of the massless Dirac field we must use distinct methods in odd and
even dimensions, therefore the computation is different from that already known
for other massless fields of integer spin.
