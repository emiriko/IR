We report on FUSE spectra of three U Gem-type, long period, dwarf novae, UU
Aql, BV Cen and CH UMa taken during their quiescence intervals. We discuss the
line identifications in their spectra and attempt to characterize the source(s)
of their FUV flux distribution. Archival IUE spectrum of CH UMa and BV Cen in
quiescence were identified as having a matching flux level with the FUSE
spectra and these were combined with each FUSE spectrum to broaden the
wavelength coverage and further constrain model fits. Multi-component synthetic
spectral fits from our model grids, consisting of single temperature white
dwarfs, two-temperature white dwarfs, accretion disks and white dwarfs plus
accretion disks, were applied to the FUSE spectra alone and to the combined
FUSE + IUE spectra. We present the results of our model analyses and their
implications.
