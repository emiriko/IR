The paper that was here is a preprint that was never turned into a proper
paper. In particular it does not have enough citations to the literature. The
paper "The Slice Algorithm For Irreducible Decomposition of Monomial Ideals"
contains a much better description of the Label algorithm than this preprint
did. If you still wish to read the original preprint then access the arXiv's
version 1 of this paper, instead of version 2 which is what you are reading
now.
