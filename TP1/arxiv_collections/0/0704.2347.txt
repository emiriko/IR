In this paper we study the interaction between two-level atom and quantized
single-mode field, namely, Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM). The field and the atom
are initially prepared in the binomial state and the excited atomic state,
respectively. For this system we prove that the revival-collapse phenomenon
exhibited in the atomic inversion of the standard JCM can be numerically
(naturally) manifested in the evolution of the squeezing factor of the
three-photon (standard) JCM provided that the initial photon-number
distribution of the radiation has a smooth envelope.
