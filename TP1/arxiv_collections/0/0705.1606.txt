The self-propelled motion of microscopic bodies immersed in a fluid medium is
studied using molecular dynamics simulation. The advantage of the atomistic
approach is that the detailed level of description allows complete freedom in
specifying the swimmer design and its coupling with the surrounding fluid. A
series of two-dimensional swimming bodies employing a variety of propulsion
mechanisms -- motivated by biological and microrobotic designs -- is
investigated, including the use of moving limbs, changing body shapes and fluid
jets. The swimming efficiency and the nature of the induced, time-dependent
flow fields are found to differ widely among body designs and propulsion
mechanisms.
