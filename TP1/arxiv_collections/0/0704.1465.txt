The MOJAVE sample is the first large radio-selected, VLBI-monitored AGN
sample for which complete X-ray spectral information is being gathered. We
report on the status of Swift survey observations which complement the
available archival X-ray data at 0.3-10 keV and in the UV with its XRT and UVOT
instruments. Many of these 133 radio-brightest AGN in the northern sky are now
being observed for the first time at these energies. These and complementary
other multi-wavelength observations provide a large statistical sample of
radio-selected AGN whose spectral energy distributions are measured from radio
to gamma-ray wavelengths, available at the beginning of GLAST operations in
2008. Here, we report the X-ray spectral characteristics of 36 of these
previously unobserved MOJAVE sources. In addition, the number of MOJAVE sources
detected by the BAT instrument in the hard X-ray band is growing: we report the
detection of five new blazars with BAT.
