We present high-resolution, multiwavelength continuum and molecular-line
images of the massive star forming region IRAS 18317-0757. The IR through mm
spectral energy distribution can be approximated by a two-temperature model (25
and 63 K) with a total luminosity of approximately log(L/Lsun)=5.2. Previous
submm imaging resolved this region into a cluster of 5 dust cores, one of which
is associated with the UCHII region G23.96+0.15, and another with an H2O maser.
In our new 2.7 mm continuum image, only the UCHII region is detected, with
total flux and morphology in good agreement with the free-free emission in VLA
cm-wave maps. For the other four objects, the nondetections at 2.7 mm and in
the MSX mid-IR bands are consistent with cool dust emission with a temperature
of 13-40K and luminosity of 1000-40000 Lsun. By combining single-dish and
interferometric data, we have identified over two dozen virialized C18O cores
in this region that contain ~40% of the total molecular gas mass present. While
the overall extent of the C18O and dust emission is similar, the emission peaks
do not correlate well in detail. At least 11 of the 123 stars identified by
2MASS in this region are likely to be within the star-forming cluster. Two
stars (both associated with the UCHII region) were previously identified as O
stars via IR spectroscopy. Most of the rest of the reddened stars have no
obvious correlation with the C18O cores or the dust cores. In summary, our
observations indicate that considerable fragmentation of the molecular cloud
has taken place during the time required for the UCHII region to form and the O
stars to become detectable at IR wavelengths. Additional star formation appears
to be ongoing on the periphery of the central region, where up to four B-type
(proto)stars have formed among a substantial number of C18O molecular cores.
