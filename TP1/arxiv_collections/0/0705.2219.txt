This Letter reports on the photometric detection of transits of the
Neptune-mass planet orbiting the nearby M-dwarf star GJ 436. It is by far the
closest, smallest and least massive transiting planet detected so far. Its mass
is slightly larger than Neptune's at M = 22.6 +- 1.9 M_earth. The shape and
depth of the transit lightcurves show that it is crossing the host star disc
near its limb (impact parameter 0.84 +- 0.03) and that the planet size is
comparable to that of Uranus and Neptune, R = 25200 +- 2200 km = 3.95 +- 0.35
R_earth. Its main constituant is therefore very likely to be water ice. If the
current planet structure models are correct, an outer layer of H/He
constituting up to ten percent in mass is probably needed on top of the ice to
account for the observed radius.
