We investigate the effects of relatively rapid variations of the boundaries
of an overmoded cavity on the stochastic properties of its interior acoustic or
electromagnetic field. For quasi-static variations, this field can be
represented as an ideal incoherent and statistically homogeneous isotropic
random scalar or vector field, respectively. A physical model is constructed
showing that the field dynamics can be characterized as a generalized diffusion
process. The Langevin--It\^{o} and Fokker--Planck equations are derived and
their associated statistics and distributions for the complex analytic field,
its magnitude and energy density are computed. The energy diffusion parameter
is found to be proportional to the square of the ratio of the standard
deviation of the source field to the characteristic time constant of the
dynamic process, but is independent of the initial energy density, to first
order. The energy drift vanishes in the asymptotic limit. The time-energy
probability distribution is in general not separable, as a result of
nonstationarity. A general solution of the Fokker--Planck equation is obtained
in integral form, together with explicit closed-form solutions for several
asymptotic cases. The findings extend known results on statistics and
distributions of quasi-stationary ideal random fields (pure diffusions), which
are retrieved as special cases.
