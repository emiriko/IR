We illustrate the main features of a recently proposed method based on
ensemble density functional theory to divide rigorously a complex molecular
system into its parts [M.H. Cohen and A. Wasserman, J. Phys. Chem. A 111, 2229
(2007)]. The illustrative system is an analog of the hydrogen molecule for
which analytic expressions for the densities of the parts (hydrogen "atoms")
are found along with the "reactivity potential" that enters the theory. While
previous formulations of Chemical Reactivity Theory lead to zero, or undefined,
values for the chemical hardness of the isolated parts, we demonstrate they can
acquire a finite and positive hardness within the present formulation.
