The decay $B^0_d \to D^+ D^-$ offers an interesting probe of CP violation,
but requires control of penguin effects, which can be done through $B^0_s \to
D^+_s D^-_s$ by means of the $U$-spin flavour symmetry of strong interactions.
Recently, the Belle collaboration reported indications of large CP violation in
the $B^0_d$ decay, which were, however, not confirmed by BaBar, and first
signals of the $B^0_s$ channel were observed at the Tevatron. In view of these
developments and the quickly approaching start of the LHC, we explore the
allowed region in observable space for CP violation in $B^0_d \to D^+ D^-$,
perform theoretical estimates of the relevant hadronic penguin parameters and
observables, and address questions both about the most promising strategies for
the extraction of CP-violating phases and about the interplay with other
measurements of CP violation and the search for new physics. As far as the
latter aspect is concerned, we point out that the $B^0_{q} \to D_{q}^+ D^-_{q}$
system provides a setting for the determination of the $B^0_q$-$\bar B^0_q$
mixing phases ($q\in\{d,s\}$) that is complementary to the conventional
$B^0_d\to J/\psi K_S$ and $B^0_s\to J/\psi \phi$ modes with respect to possible
new-physics effects in the electroweak penguin sector.
