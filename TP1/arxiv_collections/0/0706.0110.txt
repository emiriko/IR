We have observed resonant energy transfer between cold Rydberg atoms in
spatially separated cylinders. Resonant dipole-dipole coupling excites the 49s
atoms in one cylinder to the 49p state while the 41d atoms in the second
cylinder are transferred down to the 42p state. We have measured the production
of the 49p state as a function of separation of the cylinders (0 - 80 um) and
the interaction time (0 - 25 us). In addition we measured the width of the
electric field resonances. A full many-body quantum calculation reproduces the
main features of the experiments.
