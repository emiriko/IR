Utilizing an eigenfunction decomposition, we study the growth and spectra of
energy in the vortical and wave modes of a 3D rotating stratified fluid as a
function of $\epsilon = f/N$. Working in regimes characterized by moderate
Burger numbers, i.e. $Bu = 1/\epsilon^2 < 1$ or $Bu \ge 1$, our results
indicate profound change in the character of vortical and wave mode
interactions with respect to $Bu = 1$. As with the reference state of
$\epsilon=1$, for $\epsilon < 1$ the wave mode energy saturates quite quickly
and the ensuing forward cascade continues to act as an efficient means of
dissipating ageostrophic energy. Further, these saturated spectra steepen as
$\epsilon$ decreases: we see a shift from $k^{-1}$ to $k^{-5/3}$ scaling for
$k_f < k < k_d$ (where $k_f$ and $k_d$ are the forcing and dissipation scales,
respectively). On the other hand, when $\epsilon > 1$ the wave mode energy
never saturates and comes to dominate the total energy in the system. In fact,
in a sense the wave modes behave in an asymmetric manner about $\epsilon = 1$.
With regard to the vortical modes, for $\epsilon \le 1$, the signatures of 3D
quasigeostrophy are clearly evident. Specifically, we see a $k^{-3}$ scaling
for $k_f < k < k_d$ and, in accord with an inverse transfer of energy, the
vortical mode energy never saturates but rather increases for all $k < k_f$. In
contrast, for $\epsilon > 1$ and increasing, the vortical modes contain a
progressively smaller fraction of the total energy indicating that the 3D
quasigeostrophic subsystem plays an energetically smaller role in the overall
dynamics.
