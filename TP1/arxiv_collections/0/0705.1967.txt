The supercritical series expansion of the survival probability for the
one-dimensional contact process in heterogeneous and disordered lattices is
used for the evaluation of the loci of critical points and critical exponents
$\beta$. The heterogeneity and disorder are modeled by considering binary
regular and irregular lattices of nodes characterized by different recovery
rates and identical transmission rates. Two analytical approaches based on
Nested Pad\'e approximants and Partial Differential approximants were used in
the case of expansions with respect to two variables (two recovery rates) for
the evaluation of the critical values and critical exponents. The critical
exponents in heterogeneous systems are very close to those for the homogeneous
contact process thus confirming that the contact process in periodic
heterogeneous environment belongs to the directed percolation universality
class. The disordered systems, in contrast, seem to have continuously varying
critical exponents.
