We suggest a novel way to use strong Rydberg dipole-dipole interactions in
order to induce non-trivial conditional dynamics in individual-atom systems and
mesoscopic ensembles. Contrary to previous works, we suggest to excite atoms
into different Rydberg states, which results in a potentially richer dynamical
behaviour. Specifically, we investigate systems of individual hydrogen-like
atoms or mesoscopic ensembles excited into high-lying hydrogen-like s, p or d
states and show how to perform three-qubit conditional dynamics on the
information they contain through a proper use of dipole-dipole interaction
induced energy shifts.
