A general method is discussed to obtain Markovian master equations which
describe the interaction with the environment in a microscopic and
non-perturbative fashion. It is based on combining time-dependent scattering
theory with the concept of continuous quantum measurements. The applications to
the case of a Brownian point particle and to the case of a complex molecule,
both in the presence of a gaseous environment, are outlined.
