We show that a semi-classical quantum field theory comes with a versal family
with the property that the corresponding partition function generates all path
integrals and satisfies a system of 2nd order differential equations determined
by algebras of classical observables. This versal family gives rise to a notion
of special coordinates that is analogous to that in string theories. We also
show that for a large class of semi-classical theories, their moduli space has
the structure of a Frobenius super-manifold.
