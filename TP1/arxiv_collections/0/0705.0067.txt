We show that any solution of the 4D Einstein equations of general relativity
in vacuum with a cosmological constant may be embedded in a solution of the 5D
Ricci-flat equations with an effective 4D cosmological "constant" that is a
specific function of the extra coordinate. For unified theories of the forces
in higher dimensions, this has major physical implications.
