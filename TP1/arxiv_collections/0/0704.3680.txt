We report magnetotransport properties of photogenerated electrons in undoped
SrTiO$_3$ single crystals under ultraviolet illumination down to 2 K. By tuning
the light intensity, the steady state carrier density can be controlled, while
tuning the wavelength controls the effective electronic thickness by modulating
the optical penetration depth. At short wavelengths, when the sheet conductance
is close to the two-dimensional Mott minimum conductivity we have observed
critical behavior characteristic of weak localization. Negative
magnetoresistance at low magnetic field is highly anisotropic, indicating
quasi-two-dimensional electronic transport. The high mobility of photogenerated
electrons in SrTiO$_3$ allows continuous tuning of the effective electronic
dimensionality by photoexcitation.
