We provide here an epistemic analysis of arbitrary strategic games based on
the possibility correspondences. Such an analysis calls for the use of
transfinite iterations of the corresponding operators. Our approach is based on
Tarski's Fixpoint Theorem and applies both to the notions of rationalizability
and the iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies.
