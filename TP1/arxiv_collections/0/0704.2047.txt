We point out the evident errors in statistical analysis of the data,
performed by Klapdor-Kleingrothaus et al in recently published paper to
establish a limit on the stability of electron with respect to the decay into
$\nu+\gamma$. We performed the reestimation of the sensitivity of the
experimental setups to the 256 keV gamma emitted in the hypothetical electron
decay, and show that in [1] the limits on the electron stability and charge
nonconservation parameter $\epsilon_{e\nu\gamma}^{2}$ are overestimated by at
least a factor of 5. We have revealed evident errors in the statistical
