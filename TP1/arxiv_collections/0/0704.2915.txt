The energy and system size dependence of pseudorapidity ($\eta$) and
multiplicity distributions of photons are measured in the region -2.3 $\leq$
$\eta$ $\leq$ -3.7 for Cu + Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 and 62.4
GeV. Photon multiplicity measurements at forward rapidity have been carried out
using a Photon Multiplicity Detector (PMD) in the STAR experiment. Photons are
found to follow longitudinal scaling for Cu + Cu collisions for 0-10%
centrality. A Comparison of pseudorapidity distributions with HIIJING model is
also presented.
