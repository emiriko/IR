We study the excitation of spatial patterns by resonant, multi-frequency
forcing in systems undergoing a Hopf bifurcation to spatially homogeneous
oscillations. Using weakly nonlinear analysis we show that for small amplitudes
only stripe or hexagon patterns are linearly stable, whereas square patterns
and patterns involving more than three modes are unstable. In the case of
hexagon patterns up- and down-hexagons can be simultaneously stable. The
third-order, weakly nonlinear analysis predicts stable square patterns and
super-hexagons for larger amplitudes. Direct simulations show, however, that in
this regime the third-order weakly nonlinear analysis is insufficient, and
these patterns are, in fact unstable.
