A probabilistic analysis of the direct simulation of a homogeneous gas is
given. A hierarchy of equations similar to the BBGKY hierarchy for the reduced
probability densities is derived. By invoking the molecular chaos assumption,
an equation similar to the Boltzmann equation for the single particle
probability density and the corresponding H-theorem is derived.
