We study the intrinsic orbital magnetization (OM) in antiferromagnets on the
distorted face-centered-cubic lattice. The combined lattice distortion and spin
frustration induce nontrivial $k$-space Chern invariant, which turns to result
in profound effects on the OM properties. We derive a specific relation between
the OM and the Hall conductivity, according to which it is found that the
intrinsic OM vanishes when the electron chemical potential lies in the Mott
gap. The distinct behavior of the intrinsic OM in the metallic and insulating
regions is shown. The Berry phase effects on the thermoelectric transport is
also discussed.
