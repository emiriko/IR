We consider simple models of tunneling of an object with intrinsic degrees of
freedom. This important problem was not extensively studied until now, in spite
of numerous applications in various areas of physics and astrophysics. We show
possibilities of enhancement for the probability of tunneling due to the
presence of intrinsic degrees of freedom split by weak external fields or by
polarizability of the slow composite object.
