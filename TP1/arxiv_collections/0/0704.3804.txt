Combining the principle of magnetic flux quantization inside a
superconducting loop and existence of rigid platforms (i.e., solids,
non-deformable under the action of gravitational waves) a design for
gravitational wave antenna is suggested. This design could yield a non-resonant
detector, with modest sizes and capability to generate detectable signals for
gravitational waves from astrophysical sources.
