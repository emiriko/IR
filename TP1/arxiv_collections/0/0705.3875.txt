We report 10-ps correlated photon pair generation in periodically-poled
reverse-proton-exchange lithium niobate waveguides with integrated mode
demultiplexer at a wavelength of 1.5-um and a clock of 10 GHz. Using
superconducting single photon detectors, we observed a coincidence to
accidental count ratio (CAR) as high as 4000. The developed photon-pair source
may find broad application in quantum information systems as well as quantum
entanglement experiments.
