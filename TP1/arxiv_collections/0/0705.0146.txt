Aims: In the context of space interferometry missions devoted to the search
of exo-Earths, this paper investigates the capabilities of new single mode
conductive waveguides at providing modal filtering in an infrared and
monochromatic nulling experiment; Methods: A Michelson laser interferometer
with a co-axial beam combination scheme at 10.6 microns is used. After
introducing a Pi phase shift using a translating mirror, dynamic and static
measurements of the nulling ratio are performed in the two cases where modal
filtering is implemented and suppressed. No additional active control of the
wavefront errors is involved. Results: We achieve on average a statistical
nulling ratio of 2.5e-4 with a 1-sigma upper limit of 6e-4, while a best null
of 5.6e-5 is obtained in static mode. At the moment, the impact of external
vibrations limits our ability to maintain the null to 10 to 20 seconds.;
Conclusions: A positive effect of SM conductive waveguide on modal filtering
has been observed in this study. Further improvement of the null should be
possible with proper mechanical isolation of the setup.
