The physical version and equilibrium state version of the first law of
thermodynamics for a black object consisting of n-dimensional charged
stationary axisymmetric black hole surrounded by $a$ black rings, the so-called
black Saturn was derived. The general setting for our derivation is
n-dimensional dilaton gravity with p + 1 strength form fields.
