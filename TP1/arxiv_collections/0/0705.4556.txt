In this paper, we construct a quantization functor, associating a complex
vector space H(V) to a finite dimensional symplectic vector space V over a
finite field of odd characteristic. As a result, we obtain a canonical model
for the Weil representation of the symplectic group Sp(V). The main new
technical result is a proof of a stronger form of the Stone-von Neumann
property for the Heisenberg group. Our result answers, for the case of the
Heisenberg group, a question of Kazhdan about the possible existence of a
canonical vector space attached to a coadjoint orbit of a general unipotent
group over finite field.
