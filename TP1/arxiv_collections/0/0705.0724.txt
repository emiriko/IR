The differential equation for Boltzmann's function is replaced by the
corresponding discrete finite difference equation. The difference equation is,
then, symmetrized so that the equation remains invariant when step d is
replaced by -d. The solutions of this equation come in Boson-Fermion pairs.
Reciprocal symmetric Boltzmann's function, thus, unifies both Bosonic and
Fermionic distributions.
