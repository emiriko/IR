Water vapour inside the mass comparator enclosure is a critical parameter. In
fact, fluctuations of this parameter during mass weighing can lead to errors in
the determination of an unknown mass. To control that, a proposal method is
given and tested. Preliminary results of our observation of water vapour
sorption and desorption processes from walls and mass standard are reported.
