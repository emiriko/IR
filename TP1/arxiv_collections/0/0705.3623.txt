Cylindrically symmetric inhomogeneous string cosmological model of the
universe in presence of electromagnetic field is investigated. We have assumed
that F_{12} is the only non-vanishing component of electromagnetic field tensor
F_{ij}. The Maxwell's equations show that F_{12} is the function of $x$ alone
whereas the magnetic permeability is the function of x and t both. To get the
deterministic solution, it has been assumed that the expansion ($\theta$) in
the model is proportional to the eigen value $\sigma^{1}_{1}$ of the shear
tensor $\sigma^{i}_{j}$. Some physical and geometric prperties of the model are
also discussed.
