In this paper, we investigate a numerical algorithm for the pricing of swing
options, relying on the so-called optimal quantization method. The numerical
procedure is described in details and numerous simulations are provided to
assert its efficiency. In particular, we carry out a comparison with the
Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm.
