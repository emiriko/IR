We propose an interesting model of neutrino masses to realize leptogenesis
and dark matter at the TeV scale. A real scalar is introduced to naturally
realize the Majorana masses of the right-handed neutrinos. We also include a
new Higgs doublet that contributes to the dark matter of the universe. The
neutrino masses come from the vacuum expectation value of the triplet Higgs
scalar. The right-handed neutrinos are not constrained by the neutrino masses
and hence they could generate leptogenesis at the TeV scale without subscribing
to resonant leptogenesis. In our model, all new particles could be observable
at the forthcoming Large Hardon Collider or the proposed future International
Linear Collider.
