The antiferromagnetic molecular finite chain Cr6 was studied by inelastic
neutron scattering. The observed magnetic excitations at 2.6 and 4.3 meV
correspond, due to the open boundaries of a finite chain, to standing spin
waves. The determined energy spectrum revealed an essentially classical spin
structure. Hence, various spin-wave theories were investigated in order to
assess their potential for describing the elementary excitations of finite spin
systems.
