Although taste violations significantly affect the results of staggered
calculations of pseudoscalar and heavy-light mesonic quantities, those entering
staggered calculations of baryonic quantities have not been quantified. Here I
develop staggered chiral perturbation theory in the light-quark baryon sector
by mapping the Symanzik action into heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory.
For 2+1 dynamical quark flavors, the masses of flavor-symmetric nucleons are
calculated to third order in partially quenched and fully dynamical staggered
chiral perturbation theory. To this order the expansion includes the leading
chiral logarithms, which come from loops with virtual decuplet-like states, as
well as terms the order of the cubed pion mass, which come from loops with
virtual octet-like states. Taste violations enter through the meson propagators
in loops and tree-level terms the order of the squared lattice spacing. The
pattern of taste symmetry breaking and the resulting degeneracies and mixings
are discussed in detail. The resulting chiral forms are appropriate to lattice
results obtained with operators already in use and could be used to study the
restoration of taste symmetry in the continuum limit. I assume that the fourth
root of the fermion determinant can be incorporated in staggered chiral
perturbation theory using the replica method.
