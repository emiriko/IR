We investigate the possibility to perform a Quantum Non Demolition
measurement of the collective alignment of an atomic ensemble in the case of a
$F\geq 1$ spin. We compare the case of purely vectorial and purely tensorial
Hamiltonians and show how to achieve conditional squeezing or entanglement of
atomic alignment components.
