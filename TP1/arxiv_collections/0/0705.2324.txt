We study stimulated light scattering off a superfluid Fermi gas of atoms at
finite temperature. We derive response function that takes into account vertex
correction due to final state interactions; and analyze finite temperature
effects on collective and quasiparticle excitations of a uniform superfluid
Fermi gas. Light polarization is shown to play an important role in
excitations. Our results suggest that it is possible to excite
Bogoliubov-Anderson phonon at a large scattering length by light scattering.
