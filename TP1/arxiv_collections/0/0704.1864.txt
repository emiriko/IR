Using cavity-enhanced non-degenerate parametric downconversion, we have built
a frequency tunable source of heralded single photons with a narrow bandwidth
of 8 MHz, making it compatible with atomic quantum memories. The photon state
is 70% pure single photon as characterized by a tomographic measurement and
reconstruction of the quantum state, revealing a clearly negative Wigner
function. Furthermore, it has a spectral brightness of ~1,500 photons/s per MHz
bandwidth, making it one of the brightest single photon sources available. We
also investigate the correlation function of the down-converted fields using a
combination of two very distinct detection methods; photon counting and
homodyne measurement.
