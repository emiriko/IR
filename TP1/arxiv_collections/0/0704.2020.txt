We propose a new model to explain the neutrino masses, the dark energy and
the baryon asymmetry altogether. In this model, neutrinos naturally acquire
small Majorana masses via type-II seesaw mechanism, while the
pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated with the neutrino mass-generation
mechanism provide attractive candidates for dark energy. The baryon asymmetry
of the universe is produced from the Higgs triplets decay with CP-violation.
