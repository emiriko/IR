We suggest an annular waveguide coupler for switching the angular momentum of
light. We study linear and nonlinear coupling of both power and momentum of an
optical vortex beam launched into one of the ring cores, and demonstrate that
the switching takes place well below the collapse threshold. The switching is
more effective for the inner-ring excitation since it triggers more sharply and
for the lower power enough to avoid the beam azimuthal instability.
