We report on anomalous conductance in a resistively and capacitively shunted
Josephson junction which is simultaneously driven by ac and dc currents. The
dependence of the voltage across the junction on the frequency of the ac
current shows windows of absolute negative conductance regimes, i.e. for a
positive (negative) dc current, the voltage is negative (positive).
