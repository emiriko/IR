In this paper I am presenting an overview on several topics related to
nonequilibrium fluctuations in small systems. I start with a general discussion
about fluctuation theorems and applications to physical examples extracted from
physics and biology: a bead in an optical trap and single molecule force
experiments. Next I present a general discussion on path thermodynamics and
consider distributions of work/heat fluctuations as large deviation functions.
Then I address the topic of glassy dynamics from the perspective of
nonequilibrium fluctuations due to small cooperatively rearranging regions.
Finally, I conclude with a brief digression on future perspectives.
