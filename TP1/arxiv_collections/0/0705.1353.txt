We have produced a catalog of line identifications and equivalent width
measurements for all absorption features in eight ultraviolet echelle quasar
spectra. These spectra were selected as having the highest signal-to-noise
among the HST/STIS spectra obtained with the E230M grating. We identify 56
metal-line systems toward the eight quasars, and present plots of detected
transitions, aligned in velocity-space. We found that about 1/4 - 1/3 of the
features in the Lya forest region, redward of the incidence of the Lyb forest,
are metal lines. High ionization transitions are common. We see both O VI and C
IV in 88 - 90% of the metal-line systems for which the spectra cover the
expected wavelength. Si III is seen in 58%, while low ionization absorption in
C II, Si II, and/or Al II is detected in 50% of the systems for which they are
covered. This catalog will facilitate future studies of the Lya forest and of
metal-line systems of various types.
