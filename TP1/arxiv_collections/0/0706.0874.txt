An intrinsically stable type-I optical parametric oscillator was built with a
periodically poled KTiOPO4 (PPKTP) crystal to generate a stable bright,
continuous-wave, broadband phase-squeezed beam. A 3.2 dB sensitivity
enhancement of optical interferometry was demonstrated on weak electrooptic
modulation signals within a 20 MHz squeezing bandwidth. This also realized a
channel capacity increase beyond that of coherent optical communication.
