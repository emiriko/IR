We study the vortex pinning effect in a Bose-Einstein Condensate in the
presence of a rotating lattice potential by numerically solving the
time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We consider a triangular lattice
potential created by blue-detuned laser beams. By rotating the lattice
potential, we observe a transition from the Abrikosov vortex lattice to the
pinned vortex lattice. We investigate the transition of the vortex lattice
structure by changing conditions such as angular velocity, strength, and
lattice constant of a rotating lattice potential. Our simulation results
clearly show that the lattice potential has a strong vortex pinning effect when
the vortex density coincides with the density of the pinning points.
