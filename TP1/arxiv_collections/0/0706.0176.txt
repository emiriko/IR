We study the effect of the curved ripples observed in the free standing
graphene samples on the electronic structure of the system. We model the
ripples as smooth curved bumps and compute the Green's function of the Dirac
fermions in the curved surface. Curved regions modify the Fermi velocity that
becomes a function of the point on the graphene surface and induce energy
dependent oscillations in the local density of states around the position of
the bump. The corrections are estimated to be of a few percent of the flat
density at the typical energies explored in local probes such as scanning
tunnel microscopy that should be able to observe the predicted correlation of
the morphology with the electronics. We discuss the connection of the present
work with the recent observation of charge anisotropy in graphene and propose
that it can be used as an experimental test of the curvature effects.
