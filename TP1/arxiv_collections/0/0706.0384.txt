In this work, we study the isospin-violating decay of $\phi\to \omega\pi^0$
and quantify the electromagnetic (EM) transitions and intermediate meson
exchanges as two major sources of the decay mechanisms. In the EM decays, the
present datum status allows a good constraint on the EM decay form factor in
the vector meson dominance (VMD) model, and it turns out that the EM transition
can only account for about $1/4\sim 1/3$ of the branching ratio for $\phi\to
\omega\pi^0$. The intermediate meson exchanges, $K\bar{K}(K^*)$ (intermediate
$K\bar{K}$ interaction via $K^*$ exchanges), $K\bar{K^*}(K)$ (intermediate
$K\bar{K^*}$ rescattering via kaon exchanges), and $K\bar{K^*}(K^*)$
(intermediate $K\bar{K^*}$ rescattering via $K^*$ exchanges), which evade the
naive Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) rule, serve as another important contribution to
the isospin violations. They are evaluated with effective Lagrangians where
explicit constraints from experiment can be applied. Combining these three
contributions, we obtain results in good agreement with the experimental data.
This approach is also extended to $J/\psi(\psi^\prime)\to \omega\pi^0$, where
we find contributions from the $K\bar{K}(K^*)$, $K\bar{K^*}(K)$ and
$K\bar{K^*}(K^*)$ loops are negligibly small, and the isospin violation is
likely to be dominated by the EM transition.
