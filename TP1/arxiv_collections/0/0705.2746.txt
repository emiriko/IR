Using examples of the square- and triangular-lattice Heisenberg models we
demonstrate that the density matrix renormalization group method (DMRG) can be
effectively used to study magnetic ordering in two-dimensional lattice spin
models. We show that local quantities in DMRG calculations, such as the on-site
magnetization M, should be extrapolated with the truncation error, not with its
square root, as previously assumed. We also introduce convenient sequences of
clusters, using cylindrical boundary conditions and pinning magnetic fields,
which provide for rapidly converging finite-size scaling. This scaling behavior
on our clusters is clarified using finite-size analysis of the effective
sigma-model and finite-size spin-wave theory. The resulting greatly improved
extrapolations allow us to determine the thermodynamic limit of M for the
square lattice with an error comparable to quantum Monte Carlo. For the
triangular lattice, we verify the existence of three-sublattice magnetic order,
and estimate the order parameter to be M = 0.205(15).
