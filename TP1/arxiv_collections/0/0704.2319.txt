As an alternative to commonly used electrical methods, we have investigated
the optical pumping of charged exciton complexes addressing impurity related
transitions with photons of the appropriate energy. Under these conditions, we
demonstrate that the pumping fidelity can be very high while still maintaining
a switching behavior between the different excitonic species. This mechanism
has been investigated for single quantum dots of different size present in the
same sample and compared with the direct injection of spectator electrons from
nearby donors.
