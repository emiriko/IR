We study the effects, to all orders in the Planck length from a generalized
uncertainty principle (GUP), on the statistical entropy of massive scalar bulk
fields in the Randall-Sundrum black brane world. We show that the
Bekenstein-Hawking area law is not preserved, and contains small corrections
terms proportional to the black hole inverse area.
