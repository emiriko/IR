In various neurological disorders spatio-temporal excitation patterns
constitute examples of excitable behavior emerging from pathological pathways.
During migraine, seizure, and stroke an initially localized pathological state
can temporarily spread indicating a transition from non-excitable to excitable
behavior. We investigate these transient wave forms in the generic
FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) system of excitable media. Our goal is to define an
efficient control minimizing the volume of invaded tissue. The general point of
such a therapeutic optimization is how to apply control theory in the framework
of structures in differential geometry by regarding parameter plane M of the
FHN system as a differential manifold endowed with a metric. We suggest to
equip M with a metric given by pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models of drug
receptor interaction.
