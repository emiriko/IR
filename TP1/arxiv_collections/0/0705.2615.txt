Microwave penetration depth $\lambda$ and surface resistance at 27 GHz are
measured in high quality crystals of KOs$_2$O$_6$. Firm evidence for
fully-gapped superconductivity is provided from $\lambda(T)$. Below the second
transition at $T_{\rm p}\sim 8$ K, the superfluid density shows a step-like
change with a suppression of effective critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$.
Concurrently, the extracted quasiparticle scattering time shows a steep
enhancement, indicating a strong coupling between the anomalous rattling motion
of K ions and quasiparticles. The results imply that the rattling phonons help
to enhance superconductivity, and that K sites freeze to an ordered state with
long quasiparticle mean free path below $T_{\rm p}$.
