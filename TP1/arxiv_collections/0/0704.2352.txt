We study the competition between antiferromagnetic order and valence bond
solid formation in a two-dimensional frustrated spin-1/2 model. The J1-J2 model
on the square lattice is further frustrated by introducing products of
three-spin projectors which stabilize four dimer-product states as degenerate
ground states. These four states are reminiscent of the dimerized singlet
ground state of the Shastry-Sutherland model. Using exact diagonalizations, we
study the evolution of the ground state by varying theratio of interactions.
For a large range of parameters (J2 > 0.25J1), our model shows a direct
transition between the valence-bond-solid phase and the collinear
antiferromagnetic phase. For small values of J2, several intermediate phases
appear which are also analyzed.
