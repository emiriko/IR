We discuss various methods of all-optical spin control in semiconductor
quantum dots. We present different ways of rotating a single confined electron
spin by optical coupling to a trion state. We also discuss a method for
controlling the polarization of a confined exciton via a two-photon transition.
Finally, we analyze the effect of phonon-induced decoherence on the fidelity of
these optical spin control protocols.
