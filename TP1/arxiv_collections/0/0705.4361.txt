By using Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) technique we study the
1D extended anisotropic Heisenberg model. We find that starting from the
ferromagnetic phase, the system undergoes two quantum phase transitions (QPTs)
induced by frustration. By increasing the next-nearest-neighbor (NNN)
interaction, the ground state of the system changes smoothly from a completely
polarized state to a NNN correlated one. On the contrary, letting the in-plane
interaction to be greater than the out-of-plane one, the ground state changes
abruptly.
