We consider the question of deriving initial conditions for scalar fields in
driving both an early and late quintessence phase. The dark energy field
presents an unresolved uniformity problem. Further difficulties with initial
conditions for assisted, kinetic and phantom inflation are presented. We review
the use of the canonical measure and find the negative conclusions of Gibbons
and Hawking can be allayed by means of a reasonable quantum cosmological input.
We remark upon some attempts at incorporating inflationary schemes into cyclic
and bouncing models.
