new defect-assisted mechanism of multiphonon intraband carrier relaxation in
semiconductor quantum dots, where the carrier is found in a coherent
superposition of the initial, final, and defect states, is proposed. It is
shown that this mechanism is capable of explaining the observed trends in
temperature dependences of the intraband relaxation rates for PbSe and CdSe
colloidal nanocrystal quantum dots.
