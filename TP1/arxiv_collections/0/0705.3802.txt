We review the theoretical status of the lifetime ratios $\tau_{B^+} /
\tau_{B_d}$, $\tau_{B_s} / \tau_{B_d}$, $\tau_{\Lambda_b} / \tau_{B_d}$ and
$\tau_{B_c}$ and of the mixing quantities $\Delta M_s$, $\Delta \Gamma_s$ and
$\phi_s$. $\Delta M_s$ and $\Delta \Gamma_s$ suffer from large uncertainties
due to the badly known decay constants, while the ratio $\Delta \Gamma_s /
\Delta M_s$ can be determined with almost no non-perturbative uncertainties,
therefore it can be used perfectly to find possible new physics contributions
in the mixing parameters. We suggest a very clear method of visualizing the
bounds on new physics and demonstrate this by combining the latest experimental
numbers on the mixing quantities quantities with theory - one already gets some
hints for new physics contributions, but more precise experimental numbers are
needed to draw some definite conclusions. We conclude with a ranking list of
all the discussed quantities according to their current theoretical
uncertainties and point out possible improvements.
