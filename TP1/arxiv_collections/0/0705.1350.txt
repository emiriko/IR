Building on the well-known Unruh-Davies effect, we examine the effects of
projective measurements and quantum communications between accelerated and
stationary observers. We find that the projective measurement by a uniformly
accelerated observer can excite real particles from the vacuum in the inertial
frame, even if no additional particles are created by the measurement process
in the accelerating frame. Furthermore, we show that the particles created by
this accelerating measurement can be highly entangled in the inertial frame,
and it is also possible to use this process to generate even maximally
entangled two-qubit states by a certain arrangement of measurements. As a
byproduct of our analysis, we also show that a single qubit of information can
be perfectly transmitted from the accelerating observer to the inertial one. In
principle, such an effect could be exploited in designing an entangled state
generator for quantum communication.
