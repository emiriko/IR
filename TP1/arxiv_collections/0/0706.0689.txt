We report x-ray scattering studies of the c-axis lattice parameter in
Ca3Ru2O7 as a function of temperature and magnetic field. These structural
studies complement published transport and magnetization data, and therefore
elucidate the spin-charge-lattice coupling near the metal-insulator transition.
Strong anisotropy of the structural change for field applied along orthogonal
in-plane directions is observed. Competition between a spin-polarized phase
that does not couple to the lattice, and an antiferromagnetic metallic phase,
which does, gives rise to rich behavior for B $\parallel$ b.
