In this letter, a theoretical method for the analysis of diffusive
flux/current to limited scale self-affine random fractals is presented and
compared with experimentally measured electrochemical current for such
roughness. The theory explains the several experimental findings of the
temporal scale invariance as well as deviation from this of current transients
in terms of three dominant fractal parameters for the limited-length scales of
roughness. This theoretical method is based on limited scale power-law
characterization of the interfacial roughness spectrum and the solution of
diffusion equation under the diffusion-limited boundary conditions on rough
interfaces. More broadly, these calculations challenges the earlier belief that
the anomalous behavior is solely dependent on fractal dimension of roughness
and highlight the potential to apply this equation for the scale invariant
roughness determination. Finally, the validity of theoretical result is tested
with extensive experimental data.
