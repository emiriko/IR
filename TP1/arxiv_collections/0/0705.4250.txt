We present ultrafast optical switching experiments on 3D photonic band gap
crystals. Switching the Si inverse opal is achieved by optically exciting free
carriers by a two-photon process. We probe reflectivity in the frequency range
of second order Bragg diffraction where the photonic band gap is predicted. We
find good experimental switching conditions for free-carrier plasma frequencies
between 0.3 and 0.7 times the optical frequency: we thus observe a large
frequency shift of up to D omega/omega= 1.5% of all spectral features including
the peak that corresponds to the photonic band gap. We deduce a corresponding
large refractive index change of Dn'_Si/n'_Si= 2.0% and an induced absorption
length that is longer than the sample thickness. We observe a fast decay time
of 21 ps, which implies that switching could potentially be repeated at GHz
rates. Such a high switching rate is relevant to future switching and
modulation applications.
