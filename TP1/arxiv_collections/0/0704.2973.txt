The entanglement fidelity provides a measure of how well the entanglement
between two subsystems is preserved in a quantum process. By using a simple
model we show that in some cases this quantity in its original definition fails
in the measurement of the entanglement preserving. On the contrary, the
modified entanglement fidelity, obtained by using a proper local unitary
transformation on a subsystem, is shown to exhibit the behavior similar to that
of the concurrence in the quantum evolution.
