Riemannian metric on real 2n-dimensional space associated with the equation
governing complex diffusion of pure states of an open quantum system is
introduced and studied. Examples of a qubit under the influence of dephasing
and thermal environments are used to show that the curvature of the diffusion
metric is a good indicator of the properties of the environment dominated
evolution and its stability.
