It was shown by micromagnetic simulation that a current-driven in-plane
magnetized magnetic nano-contact, besides a quasi-linear propagating
("Slonczewski") spin wave mode, can also support a nonlinear self-localized
spin wave "bullet" mode that exists in a much wider range of bias currents. The
frequency of the "bullet" mode lies below the spectrum of linear propagating
spin waves, which makes this mode evanescent and determines its spatial
localization. The threshold current for the excitation of the self-localized
"bullet" is substantially lower than for the linear propagating mode, but
finite-amplitude initial perturbations of magnetization are necessary to
generate a "bullet" in our numerical simulations, where thermal fluctuations
are neglected. Consequently, in these simulations the hysteretic switching
between the propagating and localized spin wave modes is found when the bias
current is varied.
