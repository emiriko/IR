We present a method of using a nuclear magnetic resonance computer to solve
the Deutsch-Jozsa problem in which: (1) the number of molecules in the NMR
sample is irrelevant to the number of qubits available to an NMR quantum
computer, and (2) the initial state is chosen to be the state of thermal
equilibrium, thereby avoiding the preparation of pseudopure states and the
resulting exponential loss of signal as the number of qubits increases. The
algorithm is described along with its experimental implementation using four
active qubits. As expected, measured spectra demonstrate a clear distinction
between constant and balanced functions.
