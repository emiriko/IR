We present magnetotransport evidence for antiferromagnetism in films of the
electron-doped cuprates Pr$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$. Our results show clear
signature of static antiferromagnetism up to optimal doping x=0.15, with a
quantum phase transition close to x=0.16, and a coexistence of static
antiferromagnetism and superconductivity for 0.12$\le$x$\le$0.15.
