The compact form of the electroweak chiral Lagrangian is a reformulation of
its original form and is expressed in terms of chiral rotated electroweak gauge
fields, which is crucial for relating the information of underlying theories to
the coefficients of the low-energy effective Lagrangian. However the compact
form obtained in previous works is not complete. In this letter we add several
new chiral invariant terms to it and discuss the contributions of these terms
to the original electroweak chiral Lagrangian.
