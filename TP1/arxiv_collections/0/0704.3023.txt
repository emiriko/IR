The pseudoparticle approach is a numerical technique to compute path
integrals without discretizing spacetime. The basic idea is to integrate over
those field configurations, which can be represented by a sum of a fixed number
of localized building blocks (pseudoparticles). In a couple of previous papers
we have successfully applied the pseudoparticle approach to pure SU(2)
Yang-Mills theory. In this work we discuss how to incorporate fermionic fields
in the pseudoparticle approach. To test our method, we compute the phase
diagram of the 1+1-dimensional Gross-Neveu model in the large-N limit.
