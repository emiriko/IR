The Landau-Lifshitz equation reliably describes magnetization dynamics using
a phenomenological treatment of damping. This paper presents first-principles
calculations of the damping parameters for Fe, Co, and Ni that quantitatively
agree with existing ferromagnetic resonance measurements. This agreement
establishes the dominant damping mechanism for these systems and takes a
significant step toward predicting and tailoring the damping constants of new
materials.
