Having already reported on the first photometric study of the
intermediate-age open cluster NGC 1883 (Carraro et al. 2003), we present in
this paper the first spectroscopic multi-epoch investigation of a sample of
evolved stars in the same cluster. The aim is to derive the cluster membership,
velocity and metallicity, and discuss recent claims in the literature (Tadross
2005) that NGC 1883 is as metal poor as globular clusters in the Halo. Besides,
being one of the few outer Galactic disk intermediate-age open clusters known
so far, it is an ideal target to improve our knowledge of the Galactic disk
radial abundance gradient, that is a basic ingredient for any chemical
evolution model of the Milky Way. The new data we obtained allow us to put NGC
1883's basic parameters more reliable. We find that the cluster has a mean
metallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.20$\pm$0.22, from which we infer an age
(650$^{+70}_{-70}$ Myr) close to the Hyades one and a Galactocentric distance
of 12.3$^{+0.4}_{-0.2}$ kpc. The metal abundance, kinematics, and position make
NGC 1883 a genuine outer disk intermediate-age open cluster. We confirm that in
the outer Galactic disk the abundance gradient is shallower than in the solar
vicinity.
