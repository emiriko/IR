Given a finite set of lattice points, we compare its sumsets and lattice
points in its dilated convex hulls. Both of these are known to grow as
polynomials. Generally, the former are subsets of the latter. In this paper, we
will see that sumsets occupy all the central lattice points in convex hulls,
giving us a kind of approximation to lattice points in polytopes.
