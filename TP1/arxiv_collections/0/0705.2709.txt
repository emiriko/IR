The search for the Higgs boson is one of the main physics goals of the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) and its two multi-purpose experiments, ATLAS and CMS.
Vector boson fusion is the second largest production process for a standard
model Higgs boson at the LHC and offers excellent means for background
suppression. This paper gives an overview of the prospects of Higgs boson
searches using vector boson fusion at the LHC. For a standard model Higgs
boson, the decay channels H->tautau, H->WW and H->gammagamma are discussed. The
discovery potential in the framework of the MSSM is summarized.
