The mean life of the positive muon has been measured to a precision of 11 ppm
using a low-energy, pulsed muon beam stopped in a ferromagnetic target, which
was surrounded by a scintillator detector array. The result, tau_mu =
2.197013(24) us, is in excellent agreement with the previous world average. The
new world average tau_mu = 2.197019(21) us determines the Fermi constant G_F =
1.166371(6) x 10^-5 GeV^-2 (5 ppm). Additionally, the precision measurement of
the positive muon lifetime is needed to determine the nucleon pseudoscalar
coupling g_P.
