This article gives an overview of the recent searches and measurements of
$b\to d$ penguin transitions with the BaBar experiment. The branching fraction
of these decays in the Standard Model (SM) is expected to be a factor of 10 or
more lower than the corresponding $b\to s$ penguin transitions, but a deviation
from the SM prediction would be an equally striking sign of new physics. The
exclusive decay $B\to\pi\ell\ell$ is searched by BaBar with no excess over the
background found. The BaBar measurement of $B\to(\rho,\omega)\gamma$ provides
the first evidence of $B^+\to\rho^+\gamma$, is in good agreement with the
previous Belle results and provides a measurement of $|V_{td}/V_{ts}|$
independent of the one from $B_s$ mixing. No deviation from the SM is found.
