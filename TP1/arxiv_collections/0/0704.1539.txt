We describe a novel switching algorithm based on a ``reverse'' Monte Carlo
method, in which the potential is stochastically modified before the system
configuration is moved. This new algorithm facilitates a generalized
formulation of cluster-type Monte Carlo methods, and the generalization makes
it possible to derive cluster algorithms for systems with both discrete and
continuous degrees of freedom. The roughening transition in the sine-Gordon
model has been studied with this method, and high-accuracy simulations for
system sizes up to $1024^2$ were carried out to examine the logarithmic
divergence of the surface roughness above the transition temperature, revealing
clear evidence for universal scaling of the Kosterlitz-Thouless type.
