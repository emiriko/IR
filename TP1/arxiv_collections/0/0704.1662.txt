We present a systematic approach to solve analytically for the right-handed
quark mixings in the minimal left-right symmetric model which generally has
both explicit and spontaneous CP violations. The leading-order result has the
same hierarchical structure as the left-handed CKM mixing, but with additional
CP phases originating from a spontaneous CP-violating phase in the Higgs vev.
We explore the phenomenology entailed by the new right-handed mixing matrix,
particularly the bounds on the mass of $W_R$ and the CP phase of the Higgs vev.
