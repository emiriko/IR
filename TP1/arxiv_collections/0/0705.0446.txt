Based on the SDSS catalog, we have found new close quasar-galaxy pairs.
Quasars projected onto the halos of nearer galaxies are encountered among the
multitude of quasars observed at various distances from us. Among them there
are quasars that are close to the galaxies not only in angular separation, but
also in redshift. Such quasar-galaxy pairs are called close pairs. We developed
further the hypothesis that such pairs appear, because the fluxer on the
nucleus of the more distant galaxy passes through halo globular clusters of the
nearer galaxy,resulting in magnification and splitting of the image of the
source that we interpret as a quasar. To corroborate this hypothesis, we
analyzed the distribution of quasars in the plane of the halos of these
galaxies. The quasars from close pairs were found to follow the density profile
of globular clusters in the halos of elliptical and spiral galaxies with slopes
of -1.5 and -2.4 for elliptical and spiral galaxies, respectively. This
suggests that quasars do not appear near galaxies by chance and that quasars
are associated with galaxies via halo globular clusters.
