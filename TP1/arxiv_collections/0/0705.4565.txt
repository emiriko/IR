The renormalization of the NN interaction with the Chiral Two Pion Exchange
Potential computed using relativistic baryon chiral perturbation theory is
considered. The short distance singularity reduces the number of counter-terms
to about a half as those in the heavy-baryon expansion. Phase shifts and
deuteron properties are evaluated and a general overall agreement is observed.
