Indirect information about the possible scale of supersymmetry (SUSY)
breaking is provided by B-physics observables (BPO) as well as electroweak
precision observables (EWPO). We combine the constraints imposed by recent
measurements of the BPO BR(b -> s gamma), BR(B_s -> mu^+ mu^-), BR(B_u -> tau
nu_tau) and Delta M_{B_s} with those obtained from the experimental
measurements of the EWPO M_W, sin^2 theta_eff, Gamma_Z, (g-2)_mu and M_h,
incorporating the latest theoretical calculations of these observables within
the Standard Model and supersymmetric extensions. We perform a chi^2 fit to the
parameters of the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard
Model (CMSSM), in which the SUSY-breaking parameters are universal at the GUT
scale, and the non-universal Higgs model (NUHM), in which this constraint is
relaxed for the soft SUSY-breaking contributions to the Higgs masses. Assuming
that the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) provides the cold dark matter
density preferred by WMAP and other cosmological data, we scan over the
remaining parameter space. Within the CMSSM, we confirm the preference found
previously for a relatively low SUSY-breaking scale, though there is some
slight tension between the EWPO and the BPO. In studies of some specific NUHM
scenarios compatible with the cold dark matter constraint we investigate
M_A-tan_beta planes and find preferred regions that have values of chi^2
somewhat lower than in the CMSSM.
