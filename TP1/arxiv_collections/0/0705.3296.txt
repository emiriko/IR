We propose a dielectrophoresis model for phase-separated manganites. Without
increase of the fraction of metallic phase, an insulator-metal transition
occurs when a uniform electric field applied across the system exceeds a
threshold value. Driven by the dielectrophoretic force, the metallic clusters
reconfigure themselves into stripes along the direction of electric field,
leading to the filamentous percolation. This process, which is time-dependent,
irreversible and anisotropic, is a probable origin of the colossal
electroresistance in manganites.
