We have imaged the enigmatic radio source-I (Orion-I) in the Orion-KL nebula
with the VLA at 43 GHz with 34 mas angular resolution. The continuum emission
is highly elongated and is consistent with that expected from a nearly edge-on
disk. The high brightness and lack of strong molecular lines from Orion-I can
be used to argue against emission from dust. Collisional ionization and H-minus
free-free opacity, as in Mira variables, require a central star with >10^5
Lsun, which is greater than infrared observations allow. However, if
significant local heating associated with accretion occurs, lower total
luminosities are possible. Alternatively, photo-ionization from an early B-type
star and p+/e- bremsstrahlung can explain our observations, and Orion-I may be
an example of ionized accretion disk surrounding a forming massive star. Such
accretion disks may not be able to form planets efficiently.
