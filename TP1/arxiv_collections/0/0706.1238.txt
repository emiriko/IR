In this paper we present new analytic solutions of pure Type IIB supergravity
plus D7-branes describing the addition of an arbitrary number of flavors to the
Klebanov-Tseytlin and Klebanov-Strassler backgrounds. We provide a precise
field theory dual and a detailed analysis of the duality cascade which
describes its RG flow. Matchings of beta functions and anomalies between the
field theory and the string setup are presented. We give an understanding of
Seiberg duality as a large gauge transformation on the RR and NSNS potentials.
We also analyze the UV behavior of the field theory, that as suggested by the
string background can be associated with a duality wall.
