We prove a non-standard functional limit theorem for a two dimensional simple
random walk on some randomly oriented lattices. This random walk, already known
to be transient, has different horizontal and vertical fluctuations leading to
different normalizations in the functional limit theorem, with a non-Gaussian
horizontal behavior. We also prove that the horizontal and vertical components
are not asymptotically independent.
