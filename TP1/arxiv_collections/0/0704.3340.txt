The Kaluza-Klein excitations of the Higgs bosons of the universal extra
dimension model are extremely challenging to detect. We discuss the production
and possible detection mechanisms of such excited scalars at the LHC. The
dominant production mechanism of such scalars is from the decay of the excited
third generation quarks. In particular, the charged Higgs boson has a large
production cross-section over most of the parameter space. We highlight how one
may detect these excited scalars. We also comment on the production and
detection of excited neutral scalars.
