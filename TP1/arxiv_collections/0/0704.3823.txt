We study the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well
potential in the mean-field approximation. Decoherence effects are considered
by analyzing the couplings of the condensate to environments. Two kinds of
coupling are taken into account. With the first kind of coupling dominated, the
decoherence can enhance the self-trapping by increasing the damping of the
oscillations in the dynamics, while the decoherence from the second kind of
condensate-environment coupling leads to spoiling of the quantum tunneling and
self-trapping.
