We show that direct feedback based on quantum jump detection can be used to
generate entangled steady states. We present a strategy that is insensitive to
detection inefficiencies and robust against errors in the control Hamiltonian.
This feedback procedure is also shown to overcome spontaneous emission effects
by stabilising states with high degree of entanglement.
