We present the results of a search for ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) in
six different galaxy groups: Dorado, NGC1400, NGC0681, NGC4038, NGC4697 and
NGC5084. We searched in the apparent magnitude range 17.5 < b_j < 20.5 (except
NGC5084: 19.2 < b_j < 21.0). We found 1 definite plus 2 possible UCD candidates
in the Dorado group and 2 possible UCD candidates in the NGC1400 group. No UCDs
were found in the other groups. We compared these results with predicted
luminosities of UCDs in the groups according to the hypothesis that UCDs are
globular clusters formed in galaxies. The theoretical predictions broadly agree
with the observational results, but deeper surveys are needed to fully test the
predictions.
