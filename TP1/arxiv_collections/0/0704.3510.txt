We investigate the influence of the spin-phonon coupling in the triangular
antiferromagnet where the coupling is of the exchange-striction type. The
magnon dispersion is shown to be modified significantly at wave vector (2pi,0)
and its symmetry-related points, exhibiting a roton-like minimum and an
eventual instability in the dispersion. Various correlation functions such as
equal-time phonon correlation, spin-spin correlation, and local magnetization
are calculated in the presence of the coupling.
