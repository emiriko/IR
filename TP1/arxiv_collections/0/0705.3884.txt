We have carried out a calculation of the inclusive electron scattering cross
section off oxygen in the kinematical region corresponding to beam energies
between 700 and 1200 MeV, where quasielastic scattering and single pion
production are the dominant reaction mechanisms. The formalism developed and
successfully applied to describe quasielastic scattering has been extended to
include both delta production and non-resonant pion production. The results are
in fairly good agreement with experimental data over the whole range of energy
transfer, including the dip region between the quasielastic peak and the first
resonance.
