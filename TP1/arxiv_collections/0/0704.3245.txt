n the present work we investigate one possible variation on the usual
electrically neutral pulsars: the inclusion of electric charge. We study the
effect of electric charge in pulsars assuming that the charge distribution is
proportional to the energy density. All calculations were performed for zero
temperature and fixed entropy equations of state.
