We compare results of the $k_t$-factorization approach and the
next-to-leading order collinear-factorization approach for photon-jet
correlations in $pp$ and $p \bar p$ collisions at RHIC and Tevatron energies.
We discuss correlations in the azimuthal angle as well as in the
two-dimensional space of transverse momentum of photon and jet. Different
unintegrated parton distributions (UPDF) are included in the
$k_t$-factorization approach. The results depend on UPDFs used. The standard
collinear approach gives cross section comparable to the $k_t$-factorization
approach. For correlations of the photon and any jet the NLO contributions
dominate at relatively small azimuthal angles as well as for asymmetric
transverse momenta. For correlations of the photon with the leading jet (the
one having the biggest transverse momentum) the NLO approach gives zero
contribution at $\phi_{-} < \pi/2$ which opens a possibility to study
higher-order terms and/or UPDFs in this region.
