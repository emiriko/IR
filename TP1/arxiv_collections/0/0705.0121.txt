The magnitude of the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) and the longitudinal
resistance in compressively strained (Ga0.95, Mn0.05)As epilayers were measured
for the first time down to temperatures as low as 30 mK. Below temperatures of
3K the conductivity decreases ~ T^1/3 over two orders of magnitude in
temperature. The conductivity can be well described within the framework of a
3D scaling theory of Anderson's transition in the presence of spin scattering
in semiconductors. It is shown that the samples are on the metallic side but
very close to the metal-insulator transition (MIT). At lowest temperatures a
decrease in the AMR effect is observed, which is assigned to changes in the
coupling between the remaining itinerant carriers and the local Mn 5/2-spin
moments.
