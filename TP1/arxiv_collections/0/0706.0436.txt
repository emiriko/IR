The dynamics of temperature fluctuations of a gas of Brownian particles in
local equilibrium with a nonequilibrium heat bath, are described using an
approach consistent with Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics (BG). We use mesoscopic
nonequilibrium thermodynamics (MNET) to derive a Fokker-Planck equation for the
probability distribution in phase space including the local intensive variables
fluctuations. We contract the description to obtain an effective probability
distribution (EPD) from which the mass density, van Hove's function and the
dynamic structure factor of the system are obtained. The main result is to show
that in the long time limit the EPD exhibits a similar behavior as the
superstatistics distribution of nonextensive statistical mechanics (NESM),
therfore implying that the coarse-graining procedure is responsible for the so
called nonextensive effects.
