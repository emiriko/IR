We present the results of spectral energy distribution analysis for 162 of
the 405 sources reported in the SIMBA survey of Hill et al. (2005). The fits
reveal source specific parameters including: the luminosity, mass, temperature,
H$_2$ number density, the surface density and the luminosity-to-mass ratio.
Each of these parameters are examined with respect to the four classes of
source present in the sample. Obvious luminosity and temperature distinctions
exist between the mm-only cores and those cores with methanol maser and/or
radio continuum emission, with the former cooler and less luminous than the
latter. The evidence suggests that the mm-only cores are a precursor to the
methanol maser in the formation of massive stars. The mm-only cores comprise
two distinct populations distinguished by temperature. Analysis and conclusions
about the nature of the cool-mm and warm-mm cores comprising the mm-only
population are drawn.
