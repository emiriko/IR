An important goal for digital libraries is to enable researchers to more
easily explore related work. While citation data is often used as an indicator
of relatedness, in this paper we demonstrate that digital access records (e.g.
http-server logs) can be used as indicators as well. In particular, we show
that measures based on co-access provide better coverage than co-citation, that
they are available much sooner, and that they are more accurate for recent
papers.
