We conducted extensive numerical experiments of equal mass three-body systems
until they became disrupted. The system lifetimes, as a bound triple, and the
Lyapunov times show a correlation similarto what has been earlier obtained for
small bodies in the Solar System. Numerical integrations of several sets of
differently randomised initial conditions produced the same relationship of the
instability time and Lyapunov time. Marginal probability densities of the
various times in the three-body experiments are also discussed. Our high
accuracy numerical method for three-body orbit computations and Lyapunov time
determinations is concisely described.
