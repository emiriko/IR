In the present work we study the effects of an unparticle $\unpart$ as the
possible source of missing energy in the decay $B \to K (K^*) + {\rm missing
energy}$. We find that the dependence of the differential branching ratio on
the $K$($K^*$)-meson's energy in the presence of the vector unparticle
operators is very distinctive from that of the SM. Moreover, in using the
existing upper bound on $B \to K (K^*) + {\rm missing energy}$ decays, we have
been able to put more stringent constraints on the parameters of unparticle
stuff.
