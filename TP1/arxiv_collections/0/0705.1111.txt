We present a robust strategy to \emph{veto} certain classes of instrumental
glitches that appear at the output of interferometric gravitational-wave (GW)
detectors.This veto method is `physical' in the sense that, in order to veto a
burst trigger, we make use of our knowledge of the coupling of different
detector subsystems to the main detector output. The main idea behind this
method is that the noise in an instrumental channel X can be \emph{transferred}
to the detector output (channel H) using the \emph{transfer function} from X to
H, provided the noise coupling is \emph{linear} and the transfer function is
\emph{unique}. If a non-stationarity in channel H is causally related to one in
channel X, the two have to be consistent with the transfer function. We
formulate two methods for testing the consistency between the burst triggers in
channel X and channel H. One method makes use of the \emph{null-stream}
constructed from channel H and the \emph{transferred} channel X, and the second
involves cross-correlating the two. We demonstrate the efficiency of the veto
by `injecting' instrumental glitches in the hardware of the GEO 600 detector.
The \emph{veto safety} is demonstrated by performing GW-like hardware
injections. We also show an example application of this method using 5 days of
data from the fifth science run of GEO 600. The method is found to have very
high veto efficiency with a very low accidental veto rate.
