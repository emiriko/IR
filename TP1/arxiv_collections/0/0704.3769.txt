A Fokker action for post-Minkowski approximation with the first
post-Newtonian correction is introduced in our previous paper, and a solution
for the helically symmetric circular orbit is obtained. We present supplemental
results for the circular solution of two unequal mass point-particles. Circular
solutions for selected mass ratios are found numerically, and analytic formulas
in the extreme mass ratio limit are derived. The leading terms of the analytic
formulas agree with the first post-Newtonian formulas in this limit.
