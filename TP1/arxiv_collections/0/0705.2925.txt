A new measurement is presented of elastic deeply virtual Compton scattering
(DVCS) based on data taken by the H1 detector during the complete HERA II
period. The data are well described by QCD based calculations. For the first
time, a beam charge asymmetry is obtained in a colliding mode, using data
recorded in $e^-p$ and $e^+p$. A significant non zero value is measured,
related to the interference of QCD and QED processes, namely the DVCS and
Bethe-Heitler reactions.
