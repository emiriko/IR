Period-luminosity sequences have been shown to exist among the Semi-Regular
Variables (SRVs) in the Magellanic Clouds (Wood et al, 1999), the Bulge of the
Milky Way galaxy (Glass & Schultheis, 2003) and elsewhere. Using modern period
and revised Hipparcos parallax data, this paper demonstrates that they also
appear among the M-giant SRVs of the Solar Neighbourhood. Their distribution in
the K, log P diagram resembles that of Bulge stars more closely than those in
the Magellanic Clouds. The prevalence of mass-loss among local M-type SRVs and
its dependence on period and spectral sub-type are also discussed. K -- [12], a
measure of circumstellar dust emission, increases clearly with V amplitude, M
giant sub-type and log P.
