Reinforcement of elastomers by colloidal nanoparticles is an important
application where microstructure needs to be understood - and if possible
controlled - if one wishes to tune macroscopic mechanical properties. Here the
three-dimensional structure of big aggregates of nanometric silica particles
embedded in a soft polymeric matrix is determined by Small Angle Neutron
Scattering. Experimentally, the crowded environment leading to strong
reinforcement induces a strong interaction between aggregates, which generates
a prominent interaction peak in the scattering. We propose to analyze the total
signal by means of a decomposition in a classical colloidal structure factor
describing aggregate interaction and an aggregate form factor determined by a
Reverse Monte Carlo technique. The result gives new insights in the shape of
aggregates and their complex interaction in elastomers. For comparison, fractal
models for aggregate scattering are also discussed.
