We derive the exact solution for the optical conductivity $\sigma(\omega)$ of
one hole in the Holstein-t-J model in the framework of dynamical mean-field
theory (DMFT). We investigate the magnetic and phonon features associated with
polaron formation as a function of the exchange coupling $J$, of the
electron-phonon interaction $\lambda$ and of the temperature. Our solution
directly relates the features of the optical conductivity to the excitations in
the single-particle spectral function, revealing two distinct mechanisms of
closing and filling of the optical pseudogap that take place upon varying the
microscopic parameters. We show that the optical absorption at the polaron
crossover is characterized by a coexistence of a magnon peak at low frequency
and a broad polaronic band at higher frequency. An analytical expression for
$\sigma(\omega)$ valid in the polaronic regime is presented.
