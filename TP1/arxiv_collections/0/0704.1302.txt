Aims: We present a photometric study of the deeply eclipsing SW Sex-type
nova-like cataclysmic variable star BH Lyn
  Methods: Time-resolved V-band CCD photometry was obtained for seven nights
between 1999 and 2004.
  Results: We determined 11 new eclipse timings of BH Lyn and derived a refined
orbital ephemeris with an orbital period of 0.155875577(14) day. During the
observations, BH Lyn was in high-state with V~15.5 mag. The star presents ~1.5
mag deep eclipses with mean full-width at half-flux of 0.0683(+/-0.0054)P_orb.
  The eclipse shape is highly variable, even changing form cycle to cycle. This
is most likely due to accretion disc surface brightness distribution
variations, most probably caused by strong flickering. Time-dependent accretion
disc self-occultation or variations of the hot spot(s) intensity are also
possible explanations. Negative superhumps with period of ~0.145 day are
detected in two long runs in 2000. A possible connection between SW Sex and
negative superhump phenomena through the presence of tilted accretion disc is
discussed, and a way to observationally test this is suggested.
