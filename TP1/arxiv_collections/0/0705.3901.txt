We report on the development of a technique for precise radial-velocity
measurements of cool stars and brown dwarfs in the near infrared. Our technique
is analogous to the Iodine (I2) absorption cell method that has proven so
successful in the optical regime. We rely on telluric CH4 absorption features
to serve as a wavelength reference, relative to which we measure Doppler shifts
of the CO and H2O features in the spectra of our targets. We apply this
technique to high-resolution (R~50,000) spectra near 2.3 micron of nine L
dwarfs taken with the Phoenix instrument on Gemini-South and demonstrate a
typical precision of 300 m/s. We conduct simulations to estimate our expected
precision and show our performance is currently limited by the signal-to-noise
of our data. We present estimates of the rotational velocities and systemic
velocities of our targets. With our current data, we are sensitive to
companions with M sin i > 2MJ in orbits with periods less than three days. We
identify no companions in our current data set. Future observations with
improved signal-to-noise should result in radial-velocity precision of 100 m/s
for L dwarfs.
