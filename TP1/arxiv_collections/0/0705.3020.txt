Using both numerical and variational minimization of the bending and adhesion
energy of two-dimensional lipid vesicles, we study their aggregation, and we
find that the stable aggregates include an infinite number of vesicles and that
they arrange either in a columnar or in a sheet-like structure. We calculate
the stability diagram and we discuss the modes of transformation between the
two types of aggregates, showing that they include disintegration as well as
intercalation.
