In this work we show that for every $d < \infty$ and the Ising model defined
on $G(n,d/n)$, there exists a $\beta_d > 0$, such that for all $\beta <
\beta_d$ with probability going to 1 as $n \to \infty$, the mixing time of the
dynamics on $G(n,d/n)$ is polynomial in $n$. Our results are the first
polynomial time mixing results proven for a natural model on $G(n,d/n)$ for $d
> 1$ where the parameters of the model do not depend on $n$. They also provide
a rare example where one can prove a polynomial time mixing of Gibbs sampler in
a situation where the actual mixing time is slower than $n \polylog(n)$. Our
proof exploits in novel ways the local treelike structure of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
random graphs, comparison and block dynamics arguments and a recent result of
Weitz.
  Our results extend to much more general families of graphs which are sparse
in some average sense and to much more general interactions. In particular,
they apply to any graph for which every vertex $v$ of the graph has a
neighborhood $N(v)$ of radius $O(\log n)$ in which the induced sub-graph is a
tree union at most $O(\log n)$ edges and where for each simple path in $N(v)$
the sum of the vertex degrees along the path is $O(\log n)$. Moreover, our
result apply also in the case of arbitrary external fields and provide the
first FPRAS for sampling the Ising distribution in this case. We finally
present a non Markov Chain algorithm for sampling the distribution which is
effective for a wider range of parameters. In particular, for $G(n,d/n)$ it
applies for all external fields and $\beta < \beta_d$, where $d \tanh(\beta_d)
= 1$ is the critical point for decay of correlation for the Ising model on
$G(n,d/n)$.
