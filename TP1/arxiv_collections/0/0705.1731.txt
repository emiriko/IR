The nature of the pseudogap state, observed above the superconducting
transition temperature TC in many high temperature superconductors, is the
center of much debate. Recently, this discussion has focused on the number of
energy gaps in these materials. Some experiments indicate a single energy gap,
implying that the pseudogap is a precursor state. Others indicate two,
suggesting that it is a competing or coexisting phase. Here we report on
temperature dependent scanning tunneling spectroscopy of Pb-Bi2Sr2CuO6+x. We
have found a new, narrow, homogeneous gap that vanishes near TC, superimposed
on the typically observed, inhomogeneous, broad gap, which is only weakly
temperature dependent. These results not only support the two gap picture, but
also explain previously troubling differences between scanning tunneling
microscopy and other experimental measurements.
