Recent results from the HESS gamma ray telescope have shown the presence of
both a diffuse, extended, flux of gamma rays above ~0.4 TeV and discrete
sources in and near the Galactic Centre. Here, we put forward a possible
explanation in terms of the diffusion of cosmic ray protons from a succession
of supernova remnants (SNR) in the SgrA* region of the Galaxy plus a
contribution from SNR in the rest of the Galactic Centre Region, to be called
the Galactic Centre Ridge (GCR). Protons are favoured over electrons because
the mG magnetic fields in the Region will attenuate energetic electrons
severely. Prominent features are the need for 'anomalous diffusion' of the
protons in the whole region and the adoption of low efficiency for SNR
acceleration in the high density regions. The latter is related by us to the
well-known low 'cosmic ray gradient' in the Galaxy. A corroborating feature is
the close correlation of inferred cosmic ray intensity with the smoothed
intensity of 5 GHZ radio radiation. We attribute this to the presence of the
SNR in the GCR.
