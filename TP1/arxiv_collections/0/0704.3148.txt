The new formulation of the causal completion of spacetimes suggested in [1],
and modified later in [2], is tested by computing the causal boundary for
product spacetimes of a Lorentz interval and a Riemannian manifold. This is
particularized for two important families of spacetimes, conformal to the
previous ones: (standard) static spacetimes and Generalized Robertson-Walker
spacetimes. As consequence, it is shown that this new approach essentially
reproduces the structure of the conformal boundary for multiple classical
spacetimes: Reissner-Nordstrom (including Schwarzschild), Anti-de Sitter, Taub
and standard cosmological models as de Sitter and Einstein Universe.
