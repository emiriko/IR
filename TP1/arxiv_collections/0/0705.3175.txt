The nature of polyamorphism and amorphous-to-amorphous transition is
investigated by means of an exactly solvable model with quenched disorder, the
spherical s+p multi-spin interaction model. The analysis is carried out in the
framework of Replica Symmetry Breaking theory and leads to the identification
of low temperature glass phases of different kinds. Besides the usual
`one-step' solution, known to reproduce all basic properties of structural
glasses, also a physically consistent `two-step' solution arises. More
complicated phases are found as well, as temperature is further decreased,
expressing a complex variety of metastable states structures for amorphous
systems.
