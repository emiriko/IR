This paper describes the appearance of abnormal film thickness features
formed in elastohydrodynamic contacts lubricated by a fatty alcohol.
Experiments were conducted by varying the slide to roll ratio between a steel
ball and a glass disk in a ball-on-disk type device. Lauric alcohol was used as
lubricant and film thickness was measured in the contact area by optical
interferometry. Experimental results showed that the film thickness
distributions under pure rolling conditions remained classical whereas the film
shape changed when the slide to roll ratio was increased. The thickness in the
central contact area increased and in the same time inlet and exit film
thicknesses were modified. In addition, the film shapes observed when the ball
surface was moving faster than the disk one and those obtained in the opposite
case were different, i.e. when opposite signs but equal absolute values of the
slide to roll ratio were applied.
