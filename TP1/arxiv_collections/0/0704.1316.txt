We report the results of our first-principles investigation on the
interaction of the nucleobases adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine
(T), and uracil (U) with graphene, carried out within the density functional
theory framework, with additional calculations utilizing Hartree--Fock plus
second-order Moeller-Plesset perturbation theory. The calculated binding energy
of the nucleobases shows the following hierarchy: G > T ~ C ~ A > U, with the
equilibrium configuration being very similar for all five of them. Our results
clearly demonstrate that the nucleobases exhibit significantly different
interaction strengths when physisorbed on graphene. The stabilizing factor in
the interaction between the base molecule and graphene sheet is dominated by
the molecular polarizability that allows a weakly attractive dispersion force
to be induced between them. The present study represents a significant step
towards a first-principles understanding of how the base sequence of DNA can
affect its interaction with carbon nanotubes, as observed experimentally.
