We employ the formalism of bond currents, expressed in terms of the
nonequilibrium Green functions, to image the charge flow between two sites of
the honeycomb lattice of graphene ribbons of few nanometers width. In sharp
contrast to nonrelativistic electrons, current density profiles of quantum
transport at energies close to the Dirac point in clean zigzag graphene
nanoribbons (ZGNR) differs markedly from the profiles of charge density peaked
at the edges due to zero-energy localized edge states. For transport through
the lowest propagating mode induced by these edge states, edge vacancies do not
affect current density peaked in the center of ZGNR. The long-range potential
of a single impurity acts to reduce local current around it while concurrently
increasing the current density along the zigzag edge, so that ZGNR conductance
remains perfect $G=2e^2/h$.
