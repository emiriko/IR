We carefully analyze the renormalization group equations in the type I + II
seesaw scenario in the extended standard model (SM) and minimal supersymmetric
standard model (MSSM). Furthermore, we present analytic formulae of the mixing
angles and phases and discuss the RG effect on the different mixing parameters
in the type II seesaw scenario. The renormalization group equations of the
angles have a contribution which is proportional to the mass squared difference
for a hierarchical spectrum. This is in contrast to the inverse proportionality
to the mass squared difference in the effective field theory case.
