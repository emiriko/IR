Starting from the full many body Hamiltonian we derive the leading order
energy and density asymptotics for the ground state of a dilute, rotating Bose
gas in an anharmonic trap in the ` Thomas Fermi' (TF) limit when the
Gross-Pitaevskii coupling parameter and/or the rotation velocity tend to
infinity. Although the many-body wave function is expected to have a
complicated phase, the leading order contribution to the energy can be computed
by minimizing a simple functional of the density alone.
