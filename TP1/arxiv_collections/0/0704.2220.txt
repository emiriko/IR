We present the results of detailed spectroscopic abundance analyses for 18
elements in 31 nearby stars with planets. The resulting abundances are combined
with other similar studies of nearby stars with planets and compared to a
sample of nearby stars without detected planets. We find some evidence for
abundance differences between these two samples for Al, Si and Ti. Some of our
results are in conflict with a recent study of stars with planets in the SPOCS
database. We encourage continued study of the abundance patterns of stars with
planets to resolve these discrepancies.
