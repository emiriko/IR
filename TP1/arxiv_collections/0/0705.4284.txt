Recently, strong AGN outbursts at the centers of galaxy clusters have been
found. Using a simple model, we study particle acceleration around a shock
excited by an outburst and estimate nonthermal emission from the accelerated
particles. We show that emission from secondary electrons is consistent with
the radio observations of the minihalo in the Perseus cluster, if there was a
strong AGN outburst >~10^8 yrs ago with an energy of ~1.8x10^62 erg. The
validity of our model depends on the frequency of the large outbursts. We also
estimate gamma-ray emission from the accelerated particles and show that it
could be detected with GLAST.
