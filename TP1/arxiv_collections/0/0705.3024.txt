Black holes behave as thermodynamic systems, and a central task of any
quantum theory of gravity is to explain these thermal properties. A statistical
mechanical description of black hole entropy once seemed remote, but today we
suffer an embarrassment of riches: despite counting very different states, many
inequivalent approaches to quantum gravity obtain identical results. Such
``universality'' may reflect an underlying two-dimensional conformal symmetry
near the horizon, which can be powerful enough to control the thermal
characteristics independent of other details of the theory. This picture
suggests an elegant description of the relevant degrees of freedom as
Goldstone-boson-like excitations arising from symmetry breaking by the
conformal anomaly.
