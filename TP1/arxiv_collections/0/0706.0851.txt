The increasing size of the data samples recorded by the CDF and DO
experiments at the Tevatron enables studies of a wide range of processes
involving the electroweak bosons W and Z. Single boson production is now looked
at in terms of differential cross sections such as rapidity or transverse
momentum dependence. Diboson production cross-sections are several orders of
magnitude smaller than single boson production cross-sections, but all
combinations Wgamma, Zgamma, WW and WZ have been observed. ZZ production is
expected at a rate just below the observation threshold with current data
sample sizes, but this channel is expected to be accessible to the Tevatron
experiments soon.
