The CDF collaboration has analyzed ~200/pb of Tevatron Run II data taken
between February 2002 and September 2003 to measure the W boson mass. With a
sample of 63964 W->e nu decays and 51128 W->mu nu decays, we measure M_W =
80413+-34(stat)+-34(syst) MeV. The total measurement uncertainty of 48 MeV
makes this result the most precise single measurement of the W boson mass to
date.
