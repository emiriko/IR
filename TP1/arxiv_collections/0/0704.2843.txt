We use the linear $\delta$ expansion, or optimized perturbation theory, to
evaluate the effective potential for the two dimensional Gross-Neveu model at
finite temperature and density obtaining analytical equations for the critical
temperature, chemical potential and fermionic mass which include finite $N$
corrections. Our results seem to improve over the traditional large-N
predictions.
