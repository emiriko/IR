Optical gap solitons, which exist due to a balance of nonlinearity and
dispersion due to a Bragg grating, can couple to acoustic waves through
electrostriction. This gives rise to a new species of ``gap-acoustic'' solitons
(GASs), for which we find exact analytic solutions. The GAS consists of an
optical pulse similar to the optical gap soliton, dressed by an accompanying
phonon pulse. Close to the speed of sound, the phonon component is large. In
subsonic (supersonic) solitons, the phonon pulse is a positive (negative)
density variation. Coupling to the acoustic field damps the solitons'
oscillatory instability, and gives rise to a distinct instability for
supersonic solitons, which may make the GAS decelerate and change direction,
ultimately making the soliton subsonic.
