We study occurrences of patterns on clusters of size n in random fields on
Z^d. We prove that for a given pattern, there is a constant a>0 such that the
probability that this pattern occurs at most an times on a cluster of size n is
exponentially small. Moreover, for random fields obeying a certain Markov
property, we show that the ratio between the numbers of occurrences of two
distinct patterns on a cluster is concentrated around a constant value. This
leads to an elegant and simple proof of the ratio limit theorem for these
random fields, which states that the ratio of the probabilities that the
cluster of the origin has sizes n+1 and n converges as n tends to infinity.
Implications for the maximal cluster in a finite box are discussed.
