Hyper-Luminous Infrared Galaxies (HLIRGs) are the most luminous persistent
objects in the Universe. They exhibit extremely high star formation rates, and
most of them seem to harbour an AGN. They are unique laboratories to
investigate utmost star formation, and its connection to super-massive black
hole growth. X-ray studies of HLIRGs have the potential to unravel the AGN
contribution to the bolometric output from these bright objects.
  We have selected a sample of 14 HLIRGs observed by XMM-Newton (type 1, type 2
AGN and starburst), 5 of which are candidates to be Compton-thick objects. This
is the first time that a systematic study of this type of objects is carried
out in the X-ray spectral band. Their X-ray spectral properties have been
correlated with their IR luminosities, estimated by IRAS, ISO and sub-mm data.
  The X-ray spectra of HLIRGs present heterogeneous properties. All our X-ray
detected HLIRGs (10) have AGN-dominated X-ray spectra. The hard X-ray
luminosity of 8 of them is consistent with a pure AGN contribution, while in
the remaining 2 sources both an AGN and a starburst seem to contribute to the
overall emission. We found soft excess emission in 5 sources. In one of them it
is consistent with a pure starburst origin, while in the other 4 sources it is
consistent with an AGN origin. The observed X-ray emission is systematically
below the one expected for a standard local QSO of the same IR luminosity,
suggesting the possible presence of absorption in type 2 objects and/or a
departure from a standard spectral energy distribution of QSO. The
X-ray-to-IR-luminosity ratio is constant with redshift, indicating similar
evolutions for the AGN and starburst component, and that their respective power
sources could be physically related.
