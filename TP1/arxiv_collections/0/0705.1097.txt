The emergence of magnetic flux from the convection zone into the corona is an
important process for the dynamical evolution of the coronal magnetic field. In
this paper we extend our previous numerical investigations, by looking at the
process of flux interaction as an initially twisted flux tube emerges into a
plane parallel, coronal magnetic field. Significant differences are found in
the dynamical appearance and evolution of the emergence process depending on
the relative orientation between the rising flux system and any preexisting
coronal field. When the flux systems are nearly anti-parallel, the experiments
show substantial reconnection and demonstrate clear signatures of a high
temperature plasma located in the high velocity outflow regions extending from
the reconnection region. However, the cases that have a more parallel
orientation of the flux systems show very limited reconnection and none of the
associated features. Despite the very different amount of reconnection between
the two flux systems, it is found that the emerging flux that is still
connected to the original tube, reaches the same height as a function of time.
As a compensation for the loss of tube flux, a clear difference is found in the
extent of the emerging loop in the direction perpendicular to the main axis of
the initial flux tube. Increasing amounts of magnetic reconnection decrease the
volume, which confines the remaining tube flux.
