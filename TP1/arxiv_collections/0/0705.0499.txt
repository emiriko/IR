The feasibility of chalcogenide rib waveguides working at lambda = 10.6
microns has been demonstrated. The waveguides comprised a several microns thick
Te2As3Se5 film deposited by thermal evaporation on a polished As2S3 glass
substrate and further etched by physical etching in Ar or CF4/O2 atmosphere.
Output images at 10.6 microns and some propagation losses roughly estimated at
10dB/cm proved that the obtained structures behaved as channel waveguides with
a good lateral confinement of the light. The work opens the doors to the
realisation of components able to work in the mid and thermal infrared up to 20
microns and even more.
