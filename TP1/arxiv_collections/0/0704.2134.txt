The X-ray transient XMMU J174716.1-281048 was serendipitously discovered with
XMM-Newton in 2003. It lies about 0.9 degrees off the Galactic Centre and its
spectrum shows a high absorption (~8 x 10E22 cm^(-2)). Previous X-ray
observations of the source field performed in 2000 and 2001 did not detect the
source, indicative of a quiescent emission at least two orders of magnitude
fainter. The low luminosity during the outburst (~5 x 10E34 erg/s at 8 kpc)
indicates that the source is a member of the ``very faint X-ray transients''
class. On 2005 March 22nd the INTEGRAL satellite caught a possible type-I X-ray
burst from the new INTEGRAL source IGR J17464-2811, classified as fast X-ray
transient. This source was soon found to be positionally coincident, within the
uncertainties, with XMMU J174716.1-281048. Here we report data analysis of the
X-ray burst observed with the IBIS and JEM-X telescopes and confirm the type-I
burst nature. We also re-analysed XMM-Newton and Chandra archival observations
of the source field. We discuss the implications of these new findings,
particularly related to the source distance as well as the source
classification.
