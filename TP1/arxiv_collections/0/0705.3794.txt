We study some examples of Bridgeland-Douglas stability conditions on
triangulated categories. From one side we give a complete description of the
stability manifolds for smooth projective curves of positive genus. From the
other side we study stability conditions on triangulated categories generated
by an exceptional collection. In the case of the projective line this leads to
the connectedness and simply-connectedness of the stability manifold.
