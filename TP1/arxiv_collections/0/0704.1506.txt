We put forward an approach to estimate the amount of bipartite spatial
entanglement of down-converted photon states correlated in orbital angular
momentum and the magnitude of the transverse (radial) wave vectors. Both
degrees of freedom are properly considered in our framework, which only
requires azimuthal local linear optical transformations and mode selection
analysis with two fiber detectors. The coincidence distributions predicted by
our approach give an excellent fit to the distributions measured in a recent
experiment aimed to show the very high-dimensional transverse entanglement of
twin photons from a down-conversion source. Our estimate for the Schmidt number
is substantially lower but still confirms the presence of high-dimensional
entanglement.
