We introduce an approach to implement full coherent control on nanometer
length scales. It is based on spatio-temporal modulation of the surface plasmon
polariton (SPP) fields at the thick edge of a nanowedge. The SPP wavepackets
propagating toward the sharp edge of this nanowedge are compressed and
adiabatically concentrated at a nanofocus, forming an ultrashort pulse of local
fields. The one-dimensional spatial profile and temporal waveform of this pulse
are completely coherently controlled.
