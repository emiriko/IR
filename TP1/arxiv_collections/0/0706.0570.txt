We define the concept of weighted lattice polynomial functions as lattice
polynomial functions constructed from both variables and parameters. We provide
equivalent forms of these functions in an arbitrary bounded distributive
lattice. We also show that these functions include the class of discrete Sugeno
integrals and that they are characterized by a median based decomposition
formula.
