Detection of a separator line that connects magnetic nulls and the
determination of the dynamics and plasma environment of such a structure can
improve our understanding of the three-dimensional (3D) magnetic reconnection
process. However, this type of field and particle configuration has not been
directly observed in space plasmas. Here we report the identification of a pair
of nulls, the null-null line that connects them, and associated fans and spines
in the magnetotail of Earth using data from the four Cluster spacecraft. With
di and de designating the ion and electron inertial lengths, respectively, the
separation between the nulls is found to be ~0.7di and an associated
oscillation is identified as a lower hybrid wave with wavelength ~ de. This in
situ evidence of the full 3D reconnection geometry and associated dynamics
provides an important step toward to establishing an observational framework of
3D reconnection.
