Recent calculations of collisionless, Case-B, He I emissivities were
performed by Bauman et al. (2005). The source code used in the calculation has
been freely available online since that paper was published. A number of
changes have been made to simplify the use of the code by third parties. Here I
provide details on how to obtain, compile, and execute the program and
interpret the results.
