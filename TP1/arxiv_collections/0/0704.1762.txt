We present the first high-resolution, ground-based observations of HCN and
C2H2 toward the T Tauri binary star system GV Tau. We detected strong
absorption due to HCN nu_3 and weak C2H2 (nu_3 and nu_2 + (nu_4 + nu_5)^0_+)
absorption toward the primary (GV Tau S) but not the infrared companion. We
also report CO column densities and rotational temperatures, and present
abundances relative to CO of HCN/CO ~0.6% and C2H2/CO ~1.2% and an upper limit
for CH4/CO < 0.37% toward GV Tau S. Neither HCN nor C2H2 were detected toward
the infrared companion and results suggest that abundances may differ between
the two sources.
