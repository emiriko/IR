This paper studies the problem of maximizing the expected utility of terminal
wealth for a financial agent with an unbounded random endowment, and with a
utility function which supports both positive and negative wealth. We prove the
existence of an optimal trading strategy within a class of permissible
strategies -- those strategies whose wealth process is a supermartingale under
all pricing measures with finite relative entropy. We give necessary and
sufficient conditions for the absence of utility-based arbitrage, and for the
existence of a solution to the primal problem.
  We consider two utility-based methods which can be used to price contingent
claims. Firstly we investigate marginal utility-based price processes
(MUBPP's). We show that such processes can be characterized as local
martingales under the normalized optimal dual measure for the utility
maximizing investor. Finally, we present some new results on utility
indifference prices, including continuity properties and volume asymptotics for
the case of a general utility function, unbounded endowment and unbounded
contingent claims.
