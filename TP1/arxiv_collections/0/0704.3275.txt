We discuss the time evolution and matter-wave interference of Fermi
condensates on the BEC side of Feshbach resonances for s and p-wave
superfluids, upon release from harmonic traps. In swave systems, where the
order parameter is a complex scalar, we find that the interference patterns
depend on the relative phase of the order parameters of the condensates. In
p-wave systems involving the mixture of two-hyperfine states, we show that the
interference pattern exhibits a polarization effect depending on the relative
orientation of the two vector order parameters. Lastly, we also point out that
p-wave Fermi condensates exhibit an anisotropic expansion, reflecting the
spatial anisotropy of the underlying interaction between fermions and the
orbital nature of the vector order parameter. Potential applications of our
results include systems of ultra-cold atoms that exhibit p-wave Feshbach
resonances such as 6Li or 40K.
