We have investigated pumping in quantum dots from the perspective of
non-Abelian (matrix) Berry phases by solving the time dependent Schr{\"o}dinger
equation exactly for adiabatic changes. Our results demonstrate that a pumped
charge is related to the presence of a finite matrix Berry phase. When
consecutive adiabatic cycles are performed the pumped charge of each cycle is
different from the previous ones.
