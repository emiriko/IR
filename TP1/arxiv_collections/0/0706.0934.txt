Using the spin wave approximation, we study the decoherence dynamics of a
central spin coupled to an antiferromagnetic environment under the application
of an external global magnetic field. The external magnetic field affects the
decoherence process through its effect on the antiferromagnetic environment. It
is shown explicitly that the decoherence factor which displays a Gaussian decay
with time depends on the strength of the external magnetic field and the
crystal anisotropy field in the antiferromagnetic environment. When the values
of the external magnetic field is increased to the critical field point at
which the spin-flop transition (a first-order quantum phase transition) happens
in the antiferromagnetic environment, the decoherence of the central spin
reaches its highest point. This result is consistent with several recent
quantum phase transition witness studies. The influences of the environmental
temperature on the decoherence behavior of the central spin are also
investigated.
