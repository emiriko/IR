A general scheme for controlled teleportation of an arbitrary multi-qudit
state with d-dimensional Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states is proposed.
For an arbitrary m-qudit state, the sender Alice performs m generalized
Bell-state projective measurements on her 2m qudits and the controllers need
only take some single-particle measurements. The receiver Charlie can
reconstruct the unknown m-qudit state by performing some single-qudit unitary
operations on her particles if she cooperates with all the controllers. As the
quantum channel is a sequence of maximally entangled GHZ states, the intrinsic
efficiency for qudits in this scheme approaches 100% in principle.
