We propose that recent transport experiments revealing the existence of an
energy gap in graphene nanoribbons may be understood in terms of Coulomb
blockade. Electron interactions play a decisive role at the quantum dots which
form due to the presence of necks arising from the roughness of the graphene
edge. With the average transmission as the only fitting parameter, our theory
shows good agreement with the experimental data.
