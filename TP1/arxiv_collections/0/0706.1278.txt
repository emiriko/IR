Recent preliminary results obtained by the CDF and D0 Collaborations on
searches for the Higgs boson in proton anti-proton collisions at Sqrt(s)=1.96
TeV at the Fermilab Tevatron collider are discussed. The data, corresponding to
integrated luminosities of about 1 fb-1, show no excess of a signal above the
expected background in any of the decay channels examined. Instead, upper
limits at 95% Confidence Level on the cross section are established. Further, a
combined Standard Model Tevatron cross section limit is presented.
