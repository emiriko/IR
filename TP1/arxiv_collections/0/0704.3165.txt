Graphene - a single atomic layer of graphite - is a recently-found
two-dimensional form of carbon, which exhibits high crystal quality and
ballistic electron transport at room temperature. Soft magnetic NiFe electrodes
have been used to inject polarized spins into graphene and a 10% change in
resistance has been observed as the electrodes switch from the parallel to the
antiparallel state. This coupled with the fact that a field effect electrode
can modulate the conductivity of these graphene films makes them exciting
potential candidates for spin electronic devices.
