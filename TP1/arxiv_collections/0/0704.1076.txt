We propose an extension of the principle of virtual work of mechanics to
random dynamics of mechanical systems. The total virtual work of the
interacting forces and inertial forces on every particle of the system is
calculated by considering the motion of each particle. Then according to the
principle of Lagrange-d'Alembert for dynamical equilibrium, the vanishing
ensemble average of the virtual work gives rise to the thermodynamic
equilibrium state with maximization of thermodynamic entropy. This approach
establishes a close relationship between the maximum entropy approach for
statistical mechanics and a fundamental principle of mechanics, and constitutes
an attempt to give the maximum entropy approach, considered by many as only an
inference principle based on the subjectivity of probability and entropy, the
status of fundamental physics law.
