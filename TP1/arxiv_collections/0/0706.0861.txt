We study theoretically the nonlinear four wave mixing (FWM) response of an
ensemble of coupled pairs of quantum dots (quantum dot molecules). We discuss
the shape of the FWM echo signal depending on the parameters of the ensemble:
the statistics of transition energies and the degree of size correlations
between the dots forming the molecules.
