We present the SFI++ dataset, a homogeneously derived catalog of photometric
and rotational properties and the Tully-Fisher distances and peculiar
velocities derived from them. We make use of digital optical images, optical
long-slit spectra, and global HI line profiles to extract parameters of
relevance to disk scaling relations, incorporating several previously published
datasets as well as a new photometric sample of some 2000 objects. According to
the completeness of available redshift samples over the sky area, we exploit
both a modified percolation algorithm and the Voronoi-Delaunay method to assign
individual galaxies to groups as well as clusters, thereby reducing scatter
introduced by local orbital motions. We also provide corrections to the
peculiar velocities for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous Malmquist bias,
making use of the 2MASS Redshift Survey density field to approximate large
scale structure. We summarize the sample selection criteria, corrections made
to raw observational parameters, the grouping techniques, and our procedure for
deriving peculiar velocities. The final SFI++ peculiar velocity catalog of 4861
field and cluster galaxies is large enough to permit the study not just of the
global statistics of large scale flows but also of the {\it details} of the
local velocity field.
