In wireless data networks, communication is particularly susceptible to
eavesdropping due to its broadcast nature. Security and privacy systems have
become critical for wireless providers and enterprise networks. This paper
considers the problem of secret communication over the Gaussian broadcast
channel, where a multi-antenna transmitter sends independent confidential
messages to two users with perfect secrecy. That is, each user would like to
obtain its own message reliably and confidentially. First, a computable
Sato-type outer bound on the secrecy capacity region is provided for a
multi-antenna broadcast channel with confidential messages. Next, a dirty-paper
secure coding scheme and its simplified version are described. For each case,
the corresponding achievable rate region is derived under the perfect secrecy
requirement. Finally, two numerical examples demonstrate that the Sato-type
outer bound is consistent with the boundary of the simplified dirty-paper
coding secrecy rate region.
