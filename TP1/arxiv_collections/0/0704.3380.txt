We present the results of spectroscopic and imaging observations of the FRII
radio galaxies PKS2250-41 and PKS1932-46. Both sources display very extensive
emission line regions, and appear to be undergoing interactions with companion
bodies. In addition to disturbed gas kinematics associated with interactions
with the radio source, the more distant emitting material displays simple,
narrow emission line profiles, often at significant velocity offsets from the
system rest-frame, and may be associated with tidal debris.
