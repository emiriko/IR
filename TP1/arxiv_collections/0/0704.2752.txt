We present a segregrated strain model that describes the thickness-dependent
dielectric properties of ferroelectric films. Using a phenomenological Landau
approach, we present results for two specific materials, making comparison with
experiment and with first-principles calculations whenever possible. We also
suggest a "smoking gun" benchtop probe to test our elastic scenario.
