During the last three decades, evidence has mounted that star and planet
formation is not an isolated process, but is influenced by current and previous
generations of stars. Although cool stars form in a range of environments, from
isolated globules to rich embedded clusters, the influences of other stars on
cool star and planet formation may be most significant in embedded clusters,
where hundreds to thousands of cool stars form in close proximity to OB stars.
At the cool stars 14 meeting, a splinter session was convened to discuss the
role of environment in the formation of cool stars and planetary systems; with
an emphasis on the ``hot'' environment found in rich clusters. We review here
the basic results, ideas and questions presented at the session. We have
organized this contribution into five basic questions: what is the typical
environment of cool star formation, what role do hot star play in cool star
formation, what role does environment play in planet formation, what is the
role of hot star winds and supernovae, and what was the formation environment
of the Sun? The intention is to review progress made in addressing each
question, and to underscore areas of agreement and contention.
