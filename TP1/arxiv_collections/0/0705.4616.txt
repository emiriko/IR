During 2006 March the first confirmed superoutburst of the dwarf nova SDSS
J080434.20+510349.2 was observed using unfiltered CCD photometry. Time-series
photometry revealed superhumps with a period of 0.0597 +/- 0.0011 d and an
amplitude of 0.2 magnitude, thereby independently establishing its UGSU
classification. Following the decline from a peak magnitude of 13.1, at least
two rebrightening events were observed. Evidence is presented which is
consistent with the star being a member of the UGWZ sub-class.
