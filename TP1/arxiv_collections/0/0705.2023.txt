Particle statistics plays a crucial role in a strongly interacting quantum
many-body system. Here, we study the Hubbard model for distinguishable
particles at unit filling. Starting from the superfluid-like state in the
strong tunneling limit and gradually reducing the tunneling so that the on-site
repulsive interaction dominates, the state ends up in a symmetric superposition
of Mott insulator states. This result can be experimentally confirmed by the
recovery of interference patterns in the density correlation functions. We also
show that this state is a maximally entangled state, in contrast to the
standard picture.
