We calculate spectra of radiation produced by a relativistic particle in the
presence of one-dimensional Langmuir turbulence which might be generated by a
streaming instability in the plasma, in particular, in the shock front or at
the shock-shock interactions. The shape of the radiation spectra is shown to
depend sensitively on the angle between the particle velocity and electric
field direction. The radiation spectrum in the case of exactly transverse
particle motion is degenerate and similar to that of spatially uniform Langmuir
oscillations. In case of oblique propagation, the spectrum is more complex, it
consists of a number of power-law regions and may contain a distinct
high-frequency spectral peak. %at $\omega=2\omega\pe \gamma^2$. The emission
process considered is relevant to various laboratory plasma settings and for
astrophysical objects as gamma-ray bursts and collimated jets.
