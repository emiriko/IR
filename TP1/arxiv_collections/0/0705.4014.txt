We consider a thick brane model supported by two interacting scalar fields in
7D and 8D general relativity. Using the special type of a potential energy, we
obtain numerically the regular asymptotically flat vacuum solutions. A
possibility of obtaining the similar solutions for an arbitrary number of the
extra spatial dimensions is estimated.
