We study fusion reactions of the $^{64}$Ni+$^{132}$Sn system using the
recently introduced density constrained time-dependent Hartree-Fock formalism.
In this formalism the fusion barriers are directly obtained from TDHF dynamics.
In addition, we incorporate the entrance channel alignment of the deformed
(oblate) $^{64}$Ni nucleus due to dynamical Coulomb excitation. We discuss the
influence of particle transfer and other dynamical effects on the fusion cross
sections. Calculated cross sections are in very good agreement with data and
other calculations.
