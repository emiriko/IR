Fragmentation functions are determined for the pion, kaon, and proton by
analyzing charged-hadron production data in electron-positron annihilation. It
is important that uncertainties of the determined fragmentation functions are
estimated in this analysis. Analysis results indicate that gluon and
light-quark functions have large uncertainties especially at small Q^2. We find
that next-to-leading-order (NLO) uncertainties are significantly reduced in
comparison with leading-order (LO) ones in the pion and kaon. The fragmentation
functions are very different in various analysis groups. However, all the
recent functions are roughly within the estimated uncertainties, which
indicates that they are consistent with each other. We provide a code for
calculating the fragmentation functions and their uncertainties at a given
kinematical point of z and Q^2 by a user.
