We have determined the physical ground state properties of the compounds
CeRuPO and CeOsPO by means of magnetic susceptibility chi(T), specific heat
C(T), electrical resistivity rho(T), and thermopower S(T) measurements. chi(T)
reveals a trivalent 4f1 cerium state in both compounds. For CeRuPO a pronounced
decrease of rho(T) below 50K indicates the onset of coherent Kondo scattering
which is confirmed by enhanced S(T). The temperature and magnetic field
dependence of chi(T) and C(T) evidence ferromagnetic (FM) order at TC=15K.
Thus, CeRuPO seems to be one of the rare example of a FM Kondo lattice. In
contrast, CeOsPO shows antiferromagnetic order at TN=4.4K despite only minor
changes in lattice parameters and electronic configuration. Additional 31P NMR
results support these scenarios. LSDA+U calculations evidence a quasi two
dimensional electronic band structure, reflecting a strong covalent bonding
within the CeO and RuP layers and a weak ionic like bonding between the layers.
