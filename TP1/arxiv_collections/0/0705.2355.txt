Both short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) mediate the
repression of specific sequences of mRNA through the RNA interference pathway.
In the last years several experiments have supported the hypothesis that siRNAs
and miRNAs may be functionally interchangeable, at least in cultured cells. In
this work we verify that this hypothesis is also supported by a computational
evidence. We show that a method specifically trained to predict the activity of
the exogenous siRNAs assigns a high silencing level to experimentally
determined human miRNAs. This result not only supports the idea of siRNAs and
miRNAs equivalence but indicates that it is possible to use computational tools
developed using synthetic small interference RNAs to investigate endogenous
miRNAs.
