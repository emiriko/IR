We study the Casimir force in piston-like geometries semiclassically. The
force on the piston is finite and physical, but to leading semiclassical
approximation depends strongly on the shape of the surrounding cavity. Whereas
this force is attractive for pistons in a parallelepiped with flat cylinder
head, for which the semiclassical approximation by periodic orbits is exact,
this approximation to the force on the piston vanishes for a semi-cylindrical
head and becomes repulsive for a cylinder of circular cross section with a
hemispherical head. In leading semiclassical approximation the sign of the
force is related to the generalized Maslov index of short periodic orbits
between the piston and its casing.
