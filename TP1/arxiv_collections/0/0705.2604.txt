Condition monitoring techniques are described in this chapter. Two aspects of
condition monitoring process are considered: (1) feature extraction; and (2)
condition classification. Feature extraction methods described and implemented
are fractals, Kurtosis and Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients. Classification
methods described and implemented are support vector machines (SVM), hidden
Markov models (HMM), Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and extension neural
networks (ENN). The effectiveness of these features were tested using SVM, HMM,
GMM and ENN on condition monitoring of bearings and are found to give good
results.
