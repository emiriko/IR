We first present chemodynamical simulations to investigate how stellar winds
of massive stars influence early dynamical and chemical evolution of forming
globular clusters (GCs). In our numerical models, GCs form in
turbulent,high-density giant molecular clouds (GMCs), which are embedded in a
massive dark matter halo at high redshifts. We show how high-density, compact
stellar systems are formed from GMCs influenced both by physical processes
associated with star formation and by tidal fields of their host halos. We also
show that chemical pollution of GC-forming GMCs by stellar winds from massive
stars can result in star-to-star abundance inhomogeneities among light elements
(e.g., C, N, and O) of stars in GCs. The present model with a canonical initial
mass function (IMF) also shows a C-N anticorrelation that stars with smaller
[C/Fe] have larger [N/Fe] in a GC. Although these results imply that
``self-pollution'' of GC-forming GMCs by stellar winds from massive stars can
cause abundance inhomogeneities of GCs, the present models with different
parameters and canonical IMFs can not show N-rich stars with [N/Fe] ~ 0.8
observed in some GCs (e.g., NGC 6752). We discuss this apparent failure in the
context of massive star formation preceding low-mass one within GC-forming GMCs
(``bimodal star formation scenario''). We also show that although almost all
stars (~97%) show normal He abundances (Y) of ~0.24 some stars later formed in
GMCs can have Y as high as ~0.3 in some models. The number fraction of He-rich
stars with Y >0.26 is however found to be small (~10^-3) for most models.
