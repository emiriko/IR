The compatibility of the pure power law infrared solution of QCD and lattice
data for the gluon and ghost propagators in Landau gauge is discussed. For the
gluon propagator, the lattice data is well described by a pure power law with
an infrared exponent $\kappa \sim 0.53$, in the Dyson-Schwinger notation.
$\kappa$ is measured using a technique that suppresses finite volume effects.
This value implies a vanishing zero momentum gluon propagator, in agreement
with the Gribov-Zwanziger confinement scenario. For the ghost propagator, the
lattice data seem not to follow a pure power law, at least for the range of
momenta accessed in our simulation.
