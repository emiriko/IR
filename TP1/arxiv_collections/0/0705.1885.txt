The dipole form of the gluon part of the colour singlet BFKL kernel in the
next-to-leading order (NLO) is obtained in the coordinate representation by
direct transfer from the momentum representation, where the kernel was
calculated before. With this paper the transformation of the NLO BFKL kernel to
the dipole form, started a few months ago with the quark part of the kernel, is
completed.
