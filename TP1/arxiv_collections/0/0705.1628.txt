A spectral analysis of the nearby isolated neutron star RX J1856.5-3754 is
presented. Applying the kinetic approach, the distribution functions of
emitting electrons are derived and the entire spectra is fitted. It is found
that waves excited by the cyclotron mechanism, come in the radio domain. We
confirm that the cyclotron instability is quite efficient, since the
estimations show that the time of wave-particle interaction is long enough for
particles to acquire perpendicular momentum and generate observed radiation.
The lack of rotational modulation is discussed and the pulsar spin period is
estimated.
