We measure the relative abundances of strange mesons, baryons, and
anti-baryons correlated with high-$p_T$ trigger particles in $^{197}$Au +
$^{197}$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Particle yields and ratios
are extracted on the near-side and away-side of the trigger particle. The
associate-particle ratios are studied as a function of the angle relative to
the trigger particle azimuth $\Delta\phi$. Such studies should help elucidate
the origin of the previously observed correlations and their strong
modifications in Au+Au collisions relative to p+p collisions. We discuss how
these measurements might be related to several scenarios for interactions of
fast partons with the medium in Au+Au collision.
