For the 1-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation with random forcing term,
existence and uniqueness of solutions is proved. Then, the Markovian semigroup
is well defined; its properties are analyzed, in order to provide sufficient
conditions for existence and uniqueness of invariant measures for this
stochastic equation. Finally, regularity results are presented.
