In this paper, an analysis of the undetected error probability of ensembles
of binary matrices is presented. The ensemble called the Bernoulli ensemble
whose members are considered as matrices generated from i.i.d. Bernoulli source
is mainly considered here. The main contributions of this work are (i)
derivation of the error exponent of the average undetected error probability
and (ii) closed form expressions for the variance of the undetected error
probability. It is shown that the behavior of the exponent for a sparse
ensemble is somewhat different from that for a dense ensemble. Furthermore, as
a byproduct of the proof of the variance formula, simple covariance formula of
the weight distribution is derived.
