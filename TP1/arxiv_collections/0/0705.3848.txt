A comprehensive statistical model is developed for vertical profiles of the
horizontal wind and temperature throughout the troposphere based on
several-years radiosonde measurements of strong winds. The profiles measured
under quite different atmospheric conditions exhibit qualitative similarity. A
proper choice of the reference scales for the wind, temperature and altitude
levels allow us to consider the measurement data as realizations of a random
process with universal characteristics: means, the basic functions and
parameters of standard distributions for transform coefficients of the
Principal Component Analysis. The features of the atmospheric conditions are
described by statistical characteristics of the wind-temperature ensemble of
dimensional reference scales. The model can be useful for air pollution and
safety in high-risk areas such as chemical and nuclear plants.
