We demonstrate coherent control of two logical qubits encoded in a
decoherence free subspace (DFS) of four dipolar-coupled protons in an NMR
quantum information processor. A pseudo-pure fiducial state is created in the
DFS, and a unitary logical qubit entangling operator evolves the system to a
logical Bell state. The four-spin molecule is partially aligned by a liquid
crystal solvent, which introduces strong dipolar couplings among the spins.
Although the system Hamiltonian is never fully specified, we demonstrate high
fidelity control over the logical degrees of freedom. In fact, the DFS encoding
leads to higher fidelity control than is available in the full four-spin
Hilbert space.
