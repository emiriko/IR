The Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy in the sense of Tsallis under Bernoulli shifts
was obtained by Meson and Vericat [J. Math. Phys. 37, 4480(1996)]. In this
paper, we propose a revised generalized Kolmogorov-Sinai-q entropy under Markov
shifts. The form of this generalized entropy with factor q is nonextensive. The
new generalized entropy contains the classical Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy and
Renyi entropy as well as Bernoulli shifts as special cases. Applying the
generalized entropy we discuss its approximate behavior qualitatively, the
entropy rate and the sensitive value q^* of the nonextensive parameter q, which
may exit in the interval (-2,2) nearby where the generalized entropy return to
the classical K-S entropy.
