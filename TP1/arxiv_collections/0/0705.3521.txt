This paper shows experimental evidence of photorefractive steady state
self-focusing in InP:Fe for a wide range of intensities, at both 1.06 and
1.55$\mu$m. To explain those results, it is shown that despite the bi-polar
nature of InP:Fe where one photocarrier and one thermal carrier are to be
considered, the long standing one photocarrier model for photorefractive
solitons can be usefully applied. The relationship between the dark irradiance
stemming out of this model and the known resonance intensity is then discussed.
