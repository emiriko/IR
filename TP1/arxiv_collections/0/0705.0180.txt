We numerically investigate gauge field instabilities in anisotropic SU(2)
plasmas using weak field initial conditions. The growth of unstable modes is
stopped by non-abelian effects for moderate anisotropy. If we increase the
anisotropy the growth continues beyond the non-abelian saturation bound. We
find strong indications that the continued growth is not due to over-saturation
of infrared field modes, but instead due to very rapid growth of high momentum
modes which are not unstable in the weak field limit. The saturation amplitude
strongly depends on the initial conditions. For strong initial fields we do not
observe the sustained growth.
