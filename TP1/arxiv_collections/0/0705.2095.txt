Polyadic arithmetics is a branch of mathematics related to $p$--adic theory.
The aim of the present paper is to show that there are very close relations
between polyadic arithmetics and the classic theory of commutative Banach
algebras. Namely, let $\ms A$ be the algebra consisting of all complex periodic
functions on $\Z$ with the uniform norm. Then the polyadic topological ring can
be defined as the ring of all characters $\ms A\to\C$ with convolution
operations and the Gelfand topology.
