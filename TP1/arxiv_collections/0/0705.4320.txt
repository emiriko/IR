We present a CAD framework for CMOL, a hybrid CMOS/ molecular circuit
architecture. Our framework first transforms any logically synthesized circuit
based on AND/OR/NOT gates to a NOR gate circuit, and then maps the NOR gates to
CMOL. We encode the CMOL cell assignment problem as boolean conditions. The
boolean constraint is satisfiable if and only if there is a way to map all the
NOR gates to the CMOL cells. We further investigate various types of static
defects for the CMOL architecture, and propose a reconfiguration technique that
can deal with these defects through our CAD framework. This is the first
automated framework for CMOL cell assignment, and the first to model several
different CMOL static defects. Empirical results show that our approach is
efficient and scalable.
