A complete proof of the recursive gradient approach is presented. It gives a
construction of all the hierarchy structures of N=1 Super KdV, including the
non-local one. A precise definition of the ring of superfields involved in the
non-local construction is given. In particular, new non-local conserved
quantities of N=1 Super KdV are found.
