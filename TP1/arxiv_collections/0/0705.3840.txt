We perform charge-induced absorption and electroluminescence spectroscopy in
a polyfluorene organic magnetoresistive device. Our experiments allow us to
measure the singlet exciton, triplet exciton and polaron densities in a live
device under an applied magnetic field, and to distinguish between three
different models that were proposed to explain organic magnetoresistance. These
models are based on different spin-dependent interactions, namely exciton
formation, triplet exciton-polaron quenching and bipolaron formation. We show
that the singlet exciton, triplet exciton and polaron densities and
conductivity all increase with increasing magnetic field. Our data are
inconsistent with the exciton formation and triplet-exciton polaron quenching
models.
