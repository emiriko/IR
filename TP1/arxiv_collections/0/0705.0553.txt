We introduce an approach to determining the required waveforms to coherently
control the optical energy localization in plasmonic nanosystems. This approach
is based on the impulsive localized excitation of the nanosystem and time
reversal of the generated far-zone field at a single point with one
polarization. Despite strong interaction and significant dephasing and
dissipation in metal plasmonic systems, and incompleteness of this time
reversal, the proposed approach proves to be very efficient in controlling the
nanoscale optical fields. Possible applications include nanoscale spectroscopy
and photomodification, ultradense memory, and information processing on the
nanoscale.
