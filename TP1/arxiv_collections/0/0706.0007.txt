We construct a calculable model of electroweak symmetry breaking in which the
Higgs doublet emerges from the meta-stable SUSY breaking sector as a pseudo
Nambu-Goldstone boson. The Higgs boson mass is further protected by the little
Higgs mechanism, and naturally suppressed by a two-loop factor from the SUSY
breaking scale of 10 TeV. Gaugino and sfermion masses arise from standard gauge
mediation, but the Higgsino obtains a tree-level mass at the SUSY breaking
scale. At 1 TeV, aside from new gauge bosons and fermions similar to other
little Higgs models and their superpartners, our model predicts additional
electroweak triplets and doublets from the SUSY breaking sector.
