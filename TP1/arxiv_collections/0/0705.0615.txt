Theoretical axion models state that axions are very weakly interacting
particles. In order to experimentally detect them, the use of colorful and
inspired techniques becomes mandatory. There is a wide variety of experimental
approaches that were developed during the last 30 years, most of them make use
of the Primakoff effect, by which axions convert into photons in the presence
of an electromagnetic field. We review the experimental techniques used to
search for axions and will give an outlook on experiments planned for the near
future.
