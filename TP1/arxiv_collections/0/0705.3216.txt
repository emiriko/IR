Dynamical properties of complex networks are related to the spectral
properties of the Laplacian matrix that describes the pattern of connectivity
of the network. In particular we compute the synchronization time for different
types of networks and different dynamics. We show that the main dependence of
the synchronization time is on the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of the Laplacian
matrix, in contrast to other proposals in terms of the spectrum of the
adjacency matrix. Then, this topological property becomes the most relevant for
the dynamics.
