We presented a detailed experimental study on lasing in GaAs microstadium
with various shapes. Unlike most deformed microcavities, the lasing threshold
varies non-monotonically with the major-to-minor-axis ratio of the stadium.
Under spatially uniform optical pumping, the first lasing mode corresponds to a
high-quality scar mode consisting of several unstable periodic orbits. By
tuning the shape of GaAs stadium, we are able to minimize the lasing threshold.
This work demonstrates the possibility of controlling chaotic microcavity
laser.
