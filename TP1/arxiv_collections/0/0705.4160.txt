We construct an extension of the supersymmetric standard model where both CP
symmetry and R-parity are spontaneously broken. We study the electroweak
symmetry breaking sector of the model and find minima consistent with the
experimental bounds on Higgs boson masses. Neutrino masses and mixing angles
are generated through both seesaw and bilinear R-parity violation. We show that
the hierarchical mass pattern is obtained, and mixings are consistent with
measured values. Due to the spontaneous CP and R-parity violation, the neutrino
sector is CP violating, and we calculate the corresponding phase. We further
restrict the parameter space to agree with the limits on the electric dipole
moment of the neutron. Finally, we study the CP violation parameter epsilon_K
in the kaon system and show that we obtain results consistent with the
experimental value.
