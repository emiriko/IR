This paper reports on work aimed at supporting knowledge and expertise
finding within a large Research and Development (R&D) organisation. The paper
first discusses the nature of knowledge important to R&D organisations and
presents a prototype information system developed to support knowledge and
expertise finding. The paper then discusses a trial of the system within an R&D
organisation, the implications and limitations of the trial, and discusses
future research questions.
