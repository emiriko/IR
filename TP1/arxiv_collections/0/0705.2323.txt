We discuss the notion of the orbifold transform, and illustrate it on simple
examples. The basic properties of the transform are presented, including
transitivity and the exponential formula for symmetric products. The connection
with the theory of permutation orbifolds is addressed, and the general results
illustrated on the example of torus partition functions.
