We consider a three dimensional system consisting of a large number of small
spherical particles, distributed in a range of sizes and heights (with uniform
distribution in the horizontal direction). Particles move vertically at a
size-dependent terminal velocity. They are either allowed to merge whenever
they cross or there is a size ratio criterion enforced to account for collision
efficiency. Such a system may be described, in mean field approximation, by the
Smoluchowski kinetic equation with a differential sedimentation kernel, used to
study e.g. rain initiation and particle distributions in the atmosphere. We
solve the kinetic equation analytically to obtain steady state and self-similar
solutions in time and in height, using methods borrowed from weak turbulence
theory. Analytical results are compared with direct numerical simulations (DNS)
of moving and merging particles, and a good agreement is found.
