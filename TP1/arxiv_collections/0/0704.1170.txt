We report Spitzer Space Telescope photometry of eleven externally-polluted
white dwarfs. Of the nine stars for which we have IRAC photometry, we find that
GD 40, GD 133 and PG 1015+161 each has an infrared excess that can be
understood as arising from a flat, opaque, dusty disk. GD 56 also has an
infrared excess characteristic of circumstellar dust, but a flat-disk model
cannot reproduce the data unless there are grains as warm as 1700 K and perhaps
not even then. Our data support the previous suggestion that the metals in the
atmosphere of GD 40 are the result of accretion of a tidally-disrupted asteroid
with a chondritic composition.
