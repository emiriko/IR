Electronic properties of heterostructures in which a finite number of
Mott-insulator layers are sandwiched by semi-infinite metallic leads are
investigated by using the dynamical-mean-field method combined with the Keldysh
Green's function technique to account for the finite bias voltage between the
leads. Current across the junction is computed as a function of bias voltage.
Electron spectral functions in the interacting region are shown to evolve by an
applied bias voltage. This effect is measurable by photoemission spectroscopy
and scanning tunneling microscopy. Further predictions are made for the optical
conductivity under a bias voltage as a possible tool to detect a deformed
density of states. A general discussion of correlated-electron based
heterostructures and future prospect is given.
