Some nonperturbative aspects of Euclidean Yang-Mills theories in four
dimensions, quantized in the Landau gauge, are analytically studied. In
particular, we investigate the dynamical mass generation for the gluons due to
the presence of dimension two condensates. This study is performed in the
framework of the local composite operator technique in the case of the
Yang-Mills action as well as in the case of the Gribov-Zwanziger action.
Further, an investigation of the Gribov ambiguities in the linear covariant
gauges is presented.
