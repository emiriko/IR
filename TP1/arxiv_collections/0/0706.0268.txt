Given a Hamiltonian $H$ on a Hilbert space $\mathcal H$ it is shown that,
under the assumption that $\sigma(H)=\sigma_{ac}(H)=R^+$, there exist unique
positive operators $T_F$ and $T_B$ registering the Schr\"odinger time evolution
generated by $H$ in the forward (future) direction and backward (past)
direction respectively. These operators may be considered as time observables
for the quantum evolution. Moreover, it is shown that the same operators may
serve as time observables in the construction of quantum stochastic
differential equations and quantum stochastic processes in the framework of the
Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic calculus. The basic mechanism enabling
for the definition of the time observables originates from the recently
developed semigroup decomposition formalism used in the description of the time
evolution of resonances in quantum mechanical scattering problems.
