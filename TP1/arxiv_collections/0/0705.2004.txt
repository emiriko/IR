We describe the discovery of a massive transiting hot Jupiter with a very
short orbital period (1.30619 d), which we name TrES-3. From spectroscopy of
the host star GSC 03089-00929, we measure T_eff = 5720 +- 150 K, logg=4.6 +-
0.3, and vsini < 2 km/s, and derive a stellar mass of 0.90 +- 0.15 M_sun. We
estimate a planetary mass of 1.92 +- 0.23 M_Jup, based on the sinusoidal
variation of our high-precision radial velocity measurements. This variation
has a period and phase consistent with our transit photometry. Our spectra show
no evidence of line bisector variations that would indicate a blended eclipsing
binary star. From detailed modeling of our B and z photometry of the 2.5%-deep
transits, we determine a stellar radius 0.802 +- 0.046 R_sun and a planetary
radius 1.295 +- 0.081 R_Jup. TrES-3 has one of the shortest orbital periods of
the known transiting exoplanets, facilitating studies of orbital decay and mass
loss due to evaporation, and making it an excellent target for future studies
of infrared emission and reflected starlight.
