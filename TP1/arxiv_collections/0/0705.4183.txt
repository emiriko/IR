Recent results from the experiments NA48, NA48/1 and NA48/2 are presented,
including: direct CP-violation and Dalitz plot slopes measurements for K+- -->
3 pi decays; pi pi scattering effects in K+- --> pi+- pi0 pi0 and Ke4 decays,
as well as Ke4 form factors and branching fraction; measurements on radiative
charged kaons and hyperon decays, semileptonic decays of neutral and charged
kaons; KL --> pi+ pi- branching ratio and |eta+-| measurement; lepton
universality check with Kl2 decays.
