Motivated by a proposal to create an optical helix-shaped waveguides for cold
atoms and molecules, we discuss local perturbations which can create bound
states in such a setting. This is known about a local slowdown of the twist; we
show that a similar effect can result from a local tube protrusion or a change
of the helix radius in correlation with its pitch angle.
