Heavy-flavour jets enter many of today's collider studies, yet NLO
predictions for these quantities are subject to large uncertainties, larger
than the corresponding experimental errors. We propose a new, infrared safe
definition of heavy-quark jets which allows one to reduce theoretical
uncertainties by a factor of three.
