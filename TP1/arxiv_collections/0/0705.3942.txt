The electromagnetic field in an anisotropic and inhomogeneous
magnetodielectric is quantized by modelling the medium with two independent
quantum fields. Some coupling tensors coupling the electromagnetic field with
the medium are introduced. Electric and magnetic polarizations are obtained in
terms of the ladder operators of the medium and the coupling tensors
explicitly. Using a minimal coupling scheme for electric and magnetic
interactions, the Maxwell equations and the constitutive equations of the
medium are obtained. The electric and magnetic susceptibility tensors of the
medium are calculated in terms of the coupling tensors. Finally the efficiency
of the approach is elucidated by some examples.
