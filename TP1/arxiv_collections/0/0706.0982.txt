Dielectric measurements on 0.65[Pb(Ni_1/3Nb_2/3)O_3]-0.35PbTiO_3 ceramic in
the temperature range 90K to 470K shows a relaxor ferroelectric transition
around 350K with a Vogel-Fulcher freezing temperature of 338K and appearance of
a non-ergodic relaxor ferroelectric phase of tetragonal structure at room
temperature. This non-ergodic phase reenters into the relaxor state at low
temperatures as evidenced by the appearance of a frequency dependent anomaly in
the imaginary part of the dielectric constant around 160K, similar to those
reported in other relaxor ferroelectric based morphotropic phase boundary
ceramics. The polarization relaxation time for the 160K anomaly also follows
Vogel-Fulcher type temperature dependence. Temperature dependent magnetization
measurements show that this low temperature anomaly is not linked with any
magnetic transition. Elastic modulus and low temperature x-ray diffraction
(XRD) measurements reveal a tetragonal to monoclinic phase transition around
225K. It is argued that the low temperature dielectric dispersion around 160K
results from the freezing of mesoscopic conformally miniaturized monoclinic
domains formed inside the parent tetragonal domains below the structural phase
transition temperature of 225K.
