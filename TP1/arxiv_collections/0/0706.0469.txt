We analyze the spectral properties of the volume operator of Ashtekar and
Lewandowski in Loop Quantum Gravity, which is the quantum analogue of the
classical volume expression for regions in three dimensional Riemannian space.
Our analysis considers for the first time generic graph vertices of valence
greater than four. Here we find that the geometry of the underlying vertex
characterizes the spectral properties of the volume operator, in particular the
presence of a `volume gap' (a smallest non-zero eigenvalue in the spectrum) is
found to depend on the vertex embedding. We compute the set of all
non-spatially diffeomorphic non-coplanar vertex embeddings for vertices of
valence 5--7, and argue that these sets can be used to label spatial
diffeomorphism invariant states. We observe how gauge invariance connects
vertex geometry and representation properties of the underlying gauge group in
a natural way. Analytical results on the spectrum on 4-valent vertices are
included, for which the presence of a volume gap is proved. This paper presents
our main results; details are provided by a companion paper arXiv:0706.0382v1.
