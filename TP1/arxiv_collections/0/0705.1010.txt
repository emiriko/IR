Halo samples that have no kinematic bias have been successfully isolated by
photometric observations. We show that the near-UV (NUV) magnitude of the GALEX
All-Sky Survey can be used, together with Johnson BV magnitudes in a (NUV-V)_0
vs. (B-V)_0 plot, to distinguish blue horizontal branch (BHB) from other A
stars of the same B-V color for 12<V<18. In addition, we use SDSS gr magnitudes
in a (NUV - r)_0 vs. (g-r)_0 plot for 14<r<18. The faint limit will be extended
by ~3 magnitudes for the GALEX Medium-Deep Survey. Attempts to use NUV in
conjunction with 2MASS magnitudes and ROTSE m_r magnitudes did not prove
useful. The (NUV - V)_0 vs. (B-V)_0 plot was used to examine BHB star
candidates of varying quality near the South Galactic Pole. We conclude that
the addition of the GALEX NUV significantly adds to the reliabilty with which
these stars can be identified.
