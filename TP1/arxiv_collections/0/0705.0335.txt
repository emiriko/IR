We present the structure of the fully relaxed (001) surface of the
half-metallic manganite La0.7Sr0.3MnO3, calculated using density functional
theory within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Two relevant
ferroelastic order parameters are identified and characterized: The tilting of
the oxygen octahedra, which is present in the bulk phase, oscillates and
decreases towards the surface, and an additional ferrodistortive Mn
off-centering, triggered by the surface, decays monotonically into the bulk.
The narrow d-like energy band that is characteristic of unrelaxed manganite
surfaces is shifted down in energy by these structural distortions, retaining
its uppermost layer localization. The magnitude of the zero-temperature
magnetization is unchanged from its bulk value, but the effective spin-spin
interactions are reduced at the surface.
