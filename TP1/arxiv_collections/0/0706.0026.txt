We discuss how Anderson's ideas of nominal and real valence can be
incorporated into the current discussion of heavy electron quantum criticality.
In the heavy electron phase, the nominal valence of a screened magnetic ion
differs from its real valence by one unit. We identify this discrepancy with
the formation of a positively charged background we call the Kondo
pseudo-potential. At the quantum critical point, the sudden collapse of the
heavy electron Fermi surface can be identified with the return of the nominal
to the real valence. This leads to the interesting idea that the heavy electron
quantum critical point may involve locally critical charge degrees of freedom.
We discuss how this might come about within a large N Schwinger boson scheme.
