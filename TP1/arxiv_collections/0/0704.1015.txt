We propose a new topological field theory on generalized complex geometry in
two dimension using AKSZ formulation. Zucchini's model is $A$ model in the case
that the generalized complex structuredepends on only a symplectic structure.
Our new model is $B$ model in the case that the generalized complex structure
depends on only a complex structure.
