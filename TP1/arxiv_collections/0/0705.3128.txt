The study of a self-consistent system of nonlinear spinor and Bianchi type I
gravitational fields in presence of a viscous fluid and $\Lambda$ term with the
spinor field nonlinearity being some arbitrary functions of the invariants $I$
an $J$ constructed from bilinear spinor forms $S$ and $P$, generates a
multi-parametric system of ordinary differential equations
\cite{saharrp,grqcnlsp}. A qualitative analysis of the system in question has
been thoroughly carried out. A complete qualitative classification of the mode
of evolution of the universe given by the corresponding dynamic system has been
illustrated.
