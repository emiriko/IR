An experiment is described which proves, using single photons only, that the
standard hidden variables assumptions (commonly used to derive Bell
inequalities) are inconsistent with quantum mechanics. The analysis is very
simple and transparent. In particular, it demonstrates that a classical wave
model for quantum mechanics is not ruled out by experiments demonstrating the
violation of the traditional hidden variable assumptions.
