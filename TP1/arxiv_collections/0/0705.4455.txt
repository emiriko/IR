Quantum mechanics (QM) clearly violates Newton's First Law of Motion (NFLM)
in the quantum domain for one of the simplest problems, yielding an effect in a
force-free region much like the Aharonov-Bohm effect. In addition, there is an
incompatibility between the predictions of QM in the classical limit, and that
of classical mechanics (CM) with respect to NFLM. A general argument is made
that such a disparity may be found commonly for a wide variety of quantum
predictions in the classical limit. Alternatives to the Schrodinger equation
are considered that might avoid this problem. The meaning of the classical
limit is examined. Critical views regarding QM by Schrodinger, Bohm, Bell,
Clauser, and others are presented to provide a more complete perspective.
