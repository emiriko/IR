The electronic density of states of graphene is equivalent to that of
relativistic electrons. In the absence of disorder or external doping the Fermi
energy lies at the Dirac point where the density of states vanishes. Although
transport measurements at high carrier densities indicate rather high
mobilities, many questions pertaining to disorder remain unanswered. In
particular, it has been argued theoretically, that when the average carrier
density is zero, the inescapable presence of disorder will lead to electron and
hole puddles with equal probability. In this work, we use a scanning single
electron transistor to image the carrier density landscape of graphene in the
vicinity of the neutrality point. Our results clearly show the electron-hole
puddles expected theoretically. In addition, our measurement technique enables
to determine locally the density of states in graphene. In contrast to
previously studied massive two dimensional electron systems, the kinetic
contribution to the density of states accounts quantitatively for the measured
signal. Our results suggests that exchange and correlation effects are either
weak or have canceling contributions.
