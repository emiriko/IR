We present a simple implementation of the dynamical mean-field theory
approach to the electronic structure of strongly correlated materials. This
implementation achieves full self-consistency over the charge density, taking
into account correlation-induced changes to the total charge density and
effective Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. A linear muffin-tin orbital basis-set is used,
and the charge density is computed from moments of the many body
momentum-distribution matrix. The calculation of the total energy is also
considered, with a proper treatment of high-frequency tails of the Green's
function and self-energy. The method is illustrated on two materials with
well-localized 4f electrons, insulating cerium sesquioxide Ce2O3 and the
gamma-phase of metallic cerium, using the Hubbard-I approximation to the
dynamical mean-field self-energy. The momentum-integrated spectral function and
momentum-resolved dispersion of the Hubbard bands are calculated, as well as
the volume-dependence of the total energy. We show that full self-consistency
over the charge density, taking into account its modification by strong
correlations, can be important for the computation of both thermodynamical and
spectral properties, particularly in the case of the oxide material.
