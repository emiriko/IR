We show that the same physical mechanism is fundamental for two seemingly
different phenomena such as the formation of two-level systems in glasses and
the Boson peak in the reduced density of low-frequency vibrational states
g(w)/w^2. This mechanism is the vibrational instability of weakly interacting
harmonic modes. Below some frequency w_c << w_0 (where w_0 is of the order of
Debye frequency) the instability, controlled by the anharmonicity, creates a
new stable universal spectrum of harmonic vibrations with a Boson peak feature
as well as double-well potentials with a wide distribution of barrier heights.
Both are determined by the strength of the interaction I ~ w_c between the
oscillators. Our theory predicts in a natural way a small value for the
important dimensionless parameter C ~ 10^{-4} for two-level systems in glasses.
We show that C ~ I^{-3} and decreases with increasing of the interaction
strength I. We show that the number of active two-level systems is very small,
less than one per ten million of oscillators, in a good agreement with
experiment. Within the unified approach developed in the present paper the
density of the tunneling states and the density of vibrational states at the
Boson peak frequency are interrelated.
