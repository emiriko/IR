Results from a phenomenological analysis for diffractive hadroproduction of
heavy flavors at high energies are reported. Diffractive production of charm,
bottom and top are calculated using Regge factorization, taking into account
recent experimental determination of the diffractive parton density functions
in Pomeron by the H1 Collaboration at DESY-HERA. In addition, multiple-Pomeron
corrections are considered through the rapidity gap survival probability
factor. We give numerical predictions for single diffractive as well as double
Pomeron exchange (DPE) cross sections, which agree with the available data for
diffractive production of charm and beauty. We make estimates which could be
compared to future measurements at the LHC.
