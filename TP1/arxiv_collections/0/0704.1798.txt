A conclusive demonstration has been provided that the nature of the
shear-thinning, that affects both film thickness and traction in EHL contacts,
follows the ordinary power-law rule that has been described by many empirical
models of which Carreau is but one example. This was accomplished by accurate
measurements in viscometers of the shear response of a PAO that possesses a
very low critical stress for shear-thinning and accurate measurements
in-contact of film thickness and traction under conditions which accentuate the
shear-thinning effect. The in-contact central film thickness and traction were
entirely predictable from the rheological properties obtained from viscometers
using simple calculations. These data should be invaluable to researchers
endeavoring to accurately simulate Hertz zone behavior since the shear-thinning
rheology is extensively characterized and accurate in-contact data are
available to test. In addition, a new model has been introduced that may be
useful for the rheological characterization of mixtures.
