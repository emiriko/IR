Caution is suggested on the comparison of the spin-singlet charmonium P-state
with the centre of gravity of triplet states, when the mass splitting is of the
order of a few MeV. The physics of new hidden-charm states X and Y is briefly
reviewed. Perspectives for producing double-charm baryons and double-charm
exotic mesons are discussed.
