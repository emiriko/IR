Biologists are leading current research on genome characterization
(sequencing, alignment, transcription), providing a huge quantity of raw data
about many genome organisms. Extracting knowledge from this raw data is an
important process for biologists, using usually data mining approaches.
However, it is difficult to deals with these genomic information using actual
bioinformatics data mining tools, because data are heterogeneous, huge in
quantity and geographically distributed. In this paper, we present a new
approach between data mining and virtual reality visualization, called visual
data mining. Indeed Virtual Reality becomes ripe, with efficient display
devices and intuitive interaction in an immersive context. Moreover, biologists
use to work with 3D representation of their molecules, but in a desktop
context. We present a software solution, Genome3DExplorer, which addresses the
problem of genomic data visualization, of scene management and interaction.
This solution is based on a well-adapted graphical and interaction paradigm,
where local and global topological characteristics of data are easily visible,
on the contrary to traditional genomic database browsers, always focused on the
zoom and details level.
