Phase shifts for single-channel elastic electron-atom scattering are derived
from time-dependent density functional theory. The H$^-$ ion is placed in a
spherical box, its discrete spectrum found, and phase shifts deduced.
Exact-exchange yields an excellent approximation to the ground-state Kohn-Sham
potential, while the adiabatic local density approximation yields good singlet
and triplet phase shifts.
