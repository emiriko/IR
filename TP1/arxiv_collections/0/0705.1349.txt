A theoretical scheme for the calculation of the full phase diagram (including
cloud and shadow curves, binodals and distribution functions of the coexisting
phases) for colloid-polymer mixtures with polymer chain length polydispersity
and hard-sphere colloidal and polymeric monomer sizes polydispersity is
proposed. The scheme combines thermodynamic perturbation theory for associating
fluids and recently developed method used to determine the phase diagram of
polydisperse spherical shape colloidal fluids (L.Bellier-Castella {\it et al.},
{\it J.Chem.Phys.} {\bf 113}, 8337(2000)). By way of illustration we present
and discuss the full phase diagram for the mixture with polydispersity in the
size of the hard-sphere colloidal particles.
