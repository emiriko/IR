Alternating layers of granular Iron (Fe) and Titanium dioxide
(TiO$_{2-\delta}$) were deposited on (100) Lanthanum aluminate (LaAlO$_3$)
substrates in low oxygen chamber pressure using a controlled pulsed laser
ablation deposition technique. The total thickness of the film was about 200
nm. The films show ferromagnetic behavior for temperatures ranging from 4 to
$400 ^oK$. The layered film structure was characterized as p-type magnetic
semiconductor at $300 ^oK$ with a carrier density of the order of $10^{20}
/cm^3$. The undoped pure TiO$_{2-\delta}$ film was characterized as an n-type
magnetic semiconductor. The hole carriers were excited at the interface between
the granular Fe and TiO$_{2-\delta}$ layers similar to holes excited in the
metal/n-type semiconductor interface commonly observed in
Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) devices. The holes at the interface were
polarized in an applied magnetic field raising the possibility that these
granular MOS structures can be utilized for practical spintronic device
applications.
