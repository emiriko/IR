We consider two seemingly very different self-assembly processes: formation
of viral capsids, and crystallization of sticky discs. At low temperatures,
assembly is ineffective, since there are many metastable disordered states,
which are a source of kinetic frustration. We use fluctuation-dissipation
ratios to extract information about the degree of this frustration. We show
that our analysis is a useful indicator of the long term fate of the system,
based on the early stages of assembly.
