Western thinking underwent a turning point between 1885 and 1925. Einstein in
1905 symbolizes the emblematic hinge of this change of direction. To find an
equivalent phenomenon in the past we need to go back to the period from the XV
century to the XVII century. It was not a mere reform of codes but a new code.
In 1905 the perception of reality changed through the introduction of
relativism in three levels of the reference systems: the ego-other relation,
the world perceived by the senses, and the 'ideal' universe of the concepts. We
will try to identify how this change was expressed and developed in the cited
levels, both in the physic and nature based sciences, in the social sciences,
and in literature and fine arts. Today, 100 years after, the 1905's generation
still proposes us two options: to live sheltered by the dogma that reassures us
with its only and exclusive viewpoint claimed objective, or to dare to live
with the multiple, the transient, the relative. The first way led to the worst
regimes and intolerant ideas of the XX century, the second option throws us
into the uncertainty of the creative adventure, but also leads us to the
possibility of a fairer society in the XXI century.
