A remarkably high saturation magnetization of ~0.4mu_B/Fe along with room
temperature ferromagnetic hysteresis loop has been observed in nanoscale (4-40
nm) multiferroic BiFeO_3 which in bulk form exhibits weak magnetization
(~0.02mu_B/Fe) and an antiferromagnetic order. The magnetic hysteresis loops,
however, exhibit exchange bias as well as vertical asymmetry which could be
because of spin pinning at the boundaries between ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic domains. Interestingly, like in bulk BiFeO_3, both the
calorimetric and dielectric permittivity data in nanoscale BiFeO_3 exhibit
characteristic features at the magnetic transition point. These features
establish formation of a true ferromagnetic-ferroelectric system with a
coupling between the respective order parameters in nanoscale BiFeO_3.
