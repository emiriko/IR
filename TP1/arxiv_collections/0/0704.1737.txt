Matter-light quantum interface and quantum memory for light are important
ingredients of quantum information protocols, such as quantum networks,
distributed quantum computation, etc. In this Letter we present a spatially
multimode scheme for quantum memory for light, which we call a quantum
hologram. Our approach uses a multi-atom ensemble which has been shown to be
efficient for a single spatial mode quantum memory. Due to the multi-atom
nature of the ensemble it is capable of storing many spatial modes, a feature
critical for the present proposal. A quantum hologram has a higher storage
capacity compared to a classical hologram, and is capable of storing quantum
features of an image, such as multimode superposition and entangled quantum
states, something that a standard hologram is unable to achieve. Due to optical
parallelism, the information capacity of the quantum hologram will obviously
exceed that of a single-mode scheme.
