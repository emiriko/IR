J. Angulo and J. F. Montenegro (J. Differential Equations 174 (2001), no. 1,
181-199) published a paper about nonlinear stability of solitary waves for an
interaction system between a long internal wave and a short surface wave in a
two layer fluid considering that the fluid depth of the lower layer is
sufficiently large in comparison with the wavelength of the internal wave. In
this note, we show that in a critical step during the proof of Lemma 2.4 in the
above mentioned paper, there is a claim used by the authors which fails to be
true. Lemma 2.4 is crucial for the proof of Lemma 2.7, and for the proof of
stability in Theorem 2.1 in the paper before mentioned.
