The SuperWASP-I instrument observed 6.7 million stars between 8-15 mag from
La Palma during the 2004 May-September season. Our transit-hunting algorithm
selected 11,626 objects from the 184,442 stars within the range RA 18hr-21hr.
We describe our thorough selection procedure whereby catalogue information is
exploited along with careful study of the SuperWASP data to filter out, as far
as possible, transit mimics. We have identified 35 candidates which we
recommend for follow-up observations.
