We use the Einstein, Bergmann-Thomson, Landau-Lifshitz and Papapetrou
energy-momentum complexes to calculate the energy and momentum distributions of
Kantowski and Sachs space-time. We show that the Einstein and Bergmann-Thomson
definitions furnish a consistent result for the energy distribution, but the
definition of Landau-Lifshitz do not agree with them. We show that a signature
switch should affect about everything including energy distribution in the case
of Einstein and Papapetrou prescriptions but not in Bergmann-Thomson and
Landau-Lifshitz prescriptions.
