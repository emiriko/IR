The paper presents probabilistic extensions of interval temporal logic (ITL)
and duration calculus (DC) with infinite intervals and complete Hilbert-style
proof systems for them. The completeness results are a strong completeness
theorem for the system of probabilistic ITL with respect to an abstract
semantics and a relative completeness theorem for the system of probabilistic
DC with respect to real-time semantics. The proposed systems subsume
probabilistic real-time DC as known from the literature. A correspondence
between the proposed systems and a system of probabilistic interval temporal
logic with finite intervals and expanding modalities is established too.
