The Grothendieck rings of finite dimensional representations of the basic
classical Lie superalgebras are explicitly described in terms of the
corresponding generalised root systems. We show that they can be interpreted as
the subrings in the weight group rings invariant under the action of certain
groupoids called Weyl groupoids.
