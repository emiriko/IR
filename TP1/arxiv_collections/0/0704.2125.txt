The method of self-similar factor approximants is applied to calculating the
critical exponents of the O(N)-symmetric phi^4 theory and of the Ising glass.
It is demonstrated that this method, being much simpler than other known
techniques of series summation in calculating the critical exponents, at the
same time, yields the results that are in very good agreement with those of
other rather complicated numerical methods. The principal advantage of the
method of self-similar factor approximants is the combination of its
extraordinary simplicity and high accuracy.
