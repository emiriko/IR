We show how, using different decompositions of E(11), one can calculate the
representations under the duality group of the so--called "de-form" potentials.
Evidence is presented that these potentials are in one-to-one correspondence to
the embedding tensors that classify the gaugings of all maximal gauged
supergravities. We supply the computer program underlying our calculations.
