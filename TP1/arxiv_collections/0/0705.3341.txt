Using the Kubo formalism, we demonstrate fractional quantum Hall features in
a rotating Bose-Einstein condensate in a co-rotating two-dimensional optical
lattice. The co-rotating lattice and trap potential allow for an effective
magnetic field and compensation of the centrifugal potential. Fractional
quantum Hall features are seen for the single-particle system and for few
strongly interacting many-particle systems.
