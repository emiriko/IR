High Tc Josephson nanoJunctions (HTc JnJ) made by ion irradiation have
remarkable properties for technological applications. However, the spread in
their electrical characteristics increases with the ion dose. We present a
simple model to explain the JnJ inhomogeneities, which accounts quantitatively
for experimental data. The spread in the slit's width of the irradiation mask
is the limiting factor.Monte Carlo simulations have been performed using
different irradiation conditions to study their influence on the spread of the
JnJ charcateristics. A "universal" behavior has been evidenced, which allows to
propose new strategies to optimize JnJ reproducibility.
