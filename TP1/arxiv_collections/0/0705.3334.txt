It is investigated whether a massive Abelian vector field, whose gauge
kinetic function is growing during inflation, can be responsible for the
generation of the curvature perturbation in the Universe. Particle production
is studied and it is shown that the vector field can obtain a scale invariant
superhorizon spectrum of perturbations with a reasonable choice of kinetic
function. After inflation the vector field begins coherent oscillations, during
which it corresponds to pressureless isotropic matter. When the vector field
dominates the Universe its perturbations give rise to the observed curvature
perturbation following the curvaton scenario. It is found that this is possible
if, after the end of inflation, the mass of the vector field increases at a
phase transition at temperature of order 1 TeV or lower. Inhomogeneous
reheating, whereby the vector field modulates the decay rate of the inflaton,
is also studied.
