Based on the results of numerical modeling, it is shown that dipole-dipole
interactions among atoms in the active medium influences strongly the character
of the associated superradiation. The main effect is to make the nuclear
subsystem behave chaotically. Its strength increases with the atom density, and
leads to the suppression of distant collective correlations and superradiation.
Near correlations between the atoms are established, causing a confinement
effect: a shielding of radiation in the active medium.
