Quantum corrections to transport through a chaotic ballistic cavity are known
to be universal. The universality not only applies to the magnitude of quantum
corrections, but also to their dependence on external parameters, such as the
Fermi energy or an applied magnetic field. Here we consider such parameter
dependence of quantum transport in a ballistic chaotic cavity in the
semiclassical limit obtained by sending Planck's constant to zero without
changing the classical dynamics of the open cavity. In this limit quantum
corrections are shown to have a universal parametric dependence which is not
described by random matrix theory.
