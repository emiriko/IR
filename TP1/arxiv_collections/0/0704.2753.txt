A structure with a massive group in its center and a cool expansion outflow
outside is studied around the Cen A galaxy with the use of the Hubble Space
Telescope observations. It is demonstrated that the dynamics of the flow is
dominated by the antigravity of the dark energy background. The density of dark
energy in the cell is estimated to be near the global cosmological density.
This agrees with our previous result from the neighborhood of the Local group.
A notion of the ``Hubble cell'' is introduced as a building block of the local
structure of the universe.
