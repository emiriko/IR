Erwin Schrodinger (1939) proved that quantum wave functions coevolve with the
curved spacetime of the Friedmann universe. Schrodinger's derivation explains
the Hubble redshift of photons in an expanding universe, the energy changes of
moving particles, and establishes the coevolution of atoms and other quantum
systems with spacetime geometry. The assumption often made that small quantum
systems are isolated and that their properties remain constant as the Friedmann
universe evolves is incompatible with relativistic quantum mechanics and with
general relativity.
