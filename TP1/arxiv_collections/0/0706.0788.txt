We introduce a class of polynomial maps that we call polynomial roots of
powerseries, and show that automorphisms with this property generate the
automorphism group in any dimension. In particular we determine generically
which polynomial maps that preserve the origin are roots of powerseries. We
study the one-dimensional case in greater depth.
