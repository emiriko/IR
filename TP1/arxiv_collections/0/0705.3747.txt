Radial tidal forces can be compressive instead of disruptive, a possibility
that is frequently overlooked in high level physics courses. For example,
radial tidal compression can emerge in extended stellar systems containing a
smaller stellar cluster. For particular conditions the tidal field produced by
this extended mass distribution can exert on the cluster it contains
compressive effects instead of the common disruptive forces. This interesting
aspect of gravity can be derived from standard relations given in many
textbooks and introductory courses in astronomy and can serve as an opportunity
to look closer at some aspects of gravitational physics, stellar dynamics, and
differential geometry. The existence of compressive tides at the center of huge
stellar systems might suggest new evolutionary scenarios for the formation of
stars and primordial galactic formation processes.
