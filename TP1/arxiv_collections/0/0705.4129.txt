In this work we examine the Fat-Link Irrelevant Clover (FLIC) overlap quark
propagator and the gluon propagator on both dynamical and quenched lattices.
The tadpole-improved Luscher-Weisz gauge action is used in both cases. The
dynamical gauge fields use the FLIC fermion action for the sea quark
contribution. We observe that the presence of sea quarks causes a suppression
of the mass function, quark renormalization function and gluon dressing
function in the infrared. The ultraviolet physics is unaffected.
