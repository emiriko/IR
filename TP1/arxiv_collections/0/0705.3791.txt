Integrable and non-integrable systems have very different transport
properties. In this work, we highlight these differences for specific one
dimensional models of interacting lattice fermions using numerical exact
diagonalization. We calculate the finite temperature adiabatic stiffness (or
Drude weight) and isothermal stiffness (or ``Meissner'' stiffness) in
electrical and thermal transport and also compute the complete momentum and
frequency dependent dynamical conductivities $\sigma(q,\omega)$ and
$\kappa(q,\omega)$. The Meissner stiffness goes to zero rapidly with system
size for both integrable and non-integrable systems. The Drude weight shows
signs of diffusion in the non-integrable system and ballistic behavior in the
integrable system. The dynamical conductivities are also consistent with
ballistic and diffusive behavior in the integrable and non-integrable systems
respectively.
