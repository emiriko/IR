In this paper, we indicate the theoretical possibility of using the decay of
polarized muons at rest as a source of the transversely polarized electron
antineutrino beam. Such a beam can be used to probe new effects beyond standard
model. We mean here new tests concerning CP violation, Lorentz structure and
chirality structure of the charged current weak interactions. The main goal is
to show how the energy and angular distribution of the electron antineutrinos
in the muon rest frame depends on the transverse components of the antineutrino
beam polarization. Our analysis is model-independent and consistent with the
current upper limits on the non-standard couplings. The results are presented
in a limit of infinitesimally small mass for all particles produced in the
decay.
