We explore the full counting statistics of single electron tunneling through
a quantum dot using a quantum point contact as non-invasive high bandwidth
charge detector. The distribution of counted tunneling events is measured as a
function of gate and source-drain-voltage for several consecutive electron
numbers on the quantum dot. For certain configurations we observe
super-Poissonian statistics for bias voltages at which excited states become
accessible. The associated counting distributions interestingly show a bimodal
characteristic. Analyzing the time dependence of the number of electron counts
we relate this to a slow switching between different electron configurations on
the quantum dot.
