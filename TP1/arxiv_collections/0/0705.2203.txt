Quantum Weak Energy Inequalities (QWEIs) are results which limit the extent
to which the smeared renormalised energy density of a quantum field can be
negative. On globally hyperbolic spacetimes the massive quantum Dirac field is
known to obey a QWEI in terms of a reference state chosen arbitrarily from the
class of Hadamard states; however, there exist spacetimes of interest on which
state-dependent bounds cannot be evaluated. In this paper we prove the first
QWEI for the massive quantum Dirac field on four dimensional globally
hyperbolic spacetime in which the bound depends only on the local geometry;
such a QWEI is known as an absolute QWEI.
