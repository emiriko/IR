Cold dark clouds are nearby members of the densest and coldest phase in the
galactic interstellar medium, and represent the most accessible sites where
stars like our Sun are currently being born. In this review we discuss recent
progress in their study, including the newly discovered infrared dark clouds
that are likely precursors to stellar clusters. At large scales, dark clouds
present filamentary mass distributions with motions dominated by supersonic
turbulence. At small, sub-parsec scales, a population of subsonic starless
cores provides a unique glimpse of the conditions prior to stellar birth.
Recent studies of starless cores reveal a combination of simple physical
properties together with a complex chemical structure dominated by the
freeze-out of molecules onto cold dust grains. Elucidating this combined
structure is both an observational and theoretical challenge whose solution
will bring us closer to understanding how molecular gas condenses to form
stars.
