In this paper, we discuss the observation of exclusive events using the dijet
mass fraction as measured by the CDF collaboration at the Tevatron. We compare
the data to pomeron exchange inspired models as well as Soft color interaction
ones. We also provide the prediction on dijet mass fraction at the LHC using
both exclusive and inclusive diffractive events.
