We study the late evolution of solar metallicity stars in the transition
region between white dwarf formation and core collapse. This includes the
super-asymptotic giant branch (super-AGB, SAGB) stars, which have massive
enough cores to ignite carbon burning and form an oxygen-neon (ONe) core. The
most massive SAGB stars have cores that may grow to the Chandrasekhar mass
because of continued shell-burning. Their cores collapse, triggering a so
called electron capture supernovae (ECSN). From stellar evolution models we
find that the initial mass range for SAGB evolution is 7.5 ... 9.25\msun. We
perform calculations with three different stellar evolution codes to
investigate the sensitivity of this mass range to some of the uncertainties in
current stellar models. The mass range significantly depends on the treatment
of semiconvective mixing and convective overshooting. To consider the effect of
a large number of thermal pulses, as expected in SAGB stars, we construct
synthetic SAGB models that include a semi-analytical treatment of dredge-up,
hot-bottom burning, and thermal pulse properties. This synthetic model enables
us to compute the evolution of the main properties of SAGB stars from the onset
of thermal pulses until the core reaches the Chandrasekhar mass or is uncovered
by the stellar wind. Thereby, we determine the stellar initial mass ranges that
produce ONe-white dwarfs and electron-capture supernovae. The latter is found
to be 9.0 ... 9.25\msun for our fiducial model, implying that electron-capture
supernovae would constitute about 4% of all supernovae in the local universe.
Our synthetic approach allows us to explore the uncertainty of this number
imposed by uncertainties in the third dredge-up efficiency and ABG mass loss
rate. We find for ECSNe a upper limit of ~20% of all supernovae (abridged).
