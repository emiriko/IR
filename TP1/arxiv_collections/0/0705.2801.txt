Results are presented on the discovery potential for MSSM neutral Higgs
bosons in the Mh-{max}scenario. The region of large tan beta, between 15 and
50, and mass between ~ 95 and 130 GeV is considered in the framework of the
ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), for a centre-of-mass
energy = 14 TeV. This parameter region is not fully covered by the present data
either from LEP or from Tevatron. The h/A bosons, supposed to be very close in
mass in that region, are studied in the channel h/A -> mu+mu- accompanied by
two b-jets. The study includes a method to control the most copious background,
Zo -> mu+mu- accompanied by two b-jets. A possible contribution of the H boson
to the signal is also considered.
