We study ion condensation onto a patterned surface of alternating charges.
The competition between self-energy and ion-surface interactions leads to the
formation of ionic crystalline structures at low temperatures. We consider
different arrangements of underlying ionic crystals, including single ion
adsorption, as well as the formation of dipoles at the interface between
charged domains. Molecular dynamic simulation illustrates existence of single
and mixed phases. Our results contribute to understanding pattern recognition,
and molecular separation and synthesis near patterned surfaces.
