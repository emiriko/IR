We study the effect of a one dimensional optical superlattice on the
superfluid fraction, number squeezing, dynamic structure factor and the
quasi-momentum distribution of the Mott-insulator. We show that due to the
secondary lattice,there is a decrease in the superfluid fraction and the number
fluctuation. The dynamic structure factor which can be measured by Bragg
spectroscopy is also suppressed due to the addition of the secondary lattice.
The visibility of the interference pattern (the quasi-momentum distribution)of
the Mott-insulator is found to decrease due to the presence of the secondary
lattice. Our results have important implications in atom interferometry and
quantum computation in optical lattices.
