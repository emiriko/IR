We propose the improved decoy state quantum key distribution incorporating
finite statistics due to the finite code length and report on its
demonstration. In our experiment, four different intensities including the
vacuum state for optimal pulses are used and the key generation rate of 200 bps
is achieved in the 20 km telecom optical fiber transmission keeping the
eavesdropper's mutual information with the final key less than 2^{-9}.
