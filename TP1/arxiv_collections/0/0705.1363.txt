In this paper I discuss Enrico Fermi's view of identical particles, taking a
lecture that he gave in 1933 as a starting point. Fermi used his lecture as a
basis for a paper that was published in 1934: the paper is in italian and is
not easily accessible to a wide audience, and for this reason its translation
is also given in a section of the present paper.
