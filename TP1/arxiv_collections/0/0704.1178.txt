We study a five dimensional nonsupersymmetric SU(3) gauge theory compactified
on $M^4\times S^1/Z_2$. The gauge hierarchy is discussed in the scenario of the
gauge-Higgs unification. We present two models in which the large gauge
hierarchy is realized, that is, the weak scale is naturally is obtained from an
unique large scale such as a GUT and the Planck scale. We also study the Higgs
mass in each model.
