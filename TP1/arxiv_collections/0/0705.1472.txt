We report Cu- and F-NMR studies on a four-layered high-temperature
superconductor Ba2Ca3Cu4O8F2(0234F(2.0)) with apical fluorine (F-1), an undoped
55 K-superconductor with a nominal Cu2+ valence on average. We reveal that this
compound exhibits the antiferromagnetism (AFM) with a Neel temperature TN=100 K
despite being a Tc= 55 K-superconductor. Through a comparison with a related
tri-layered cuprate Ba2Ca2Cu3O6F2 (0223F(2.0)), it is demonstrated that
electrons are transferred from the inner plane (IP) to the outer plane (OP) in
0234F(2.0) and 0223F(2.0), confirming the self-doped high-temperature
superconductivity (HTSC) having electron and hole doping in a single compound.
Remarlably, uniform mixing of AFM and HTSC takes place in both the
electron-doped OPs and the hole-doped IPs in 0234F(2.0).
