We carried out low resolution spectroscopic observations in the wavelength
range 3400-4700 A of 20 He-weak and 8 He-strong stars to determine their
fundamental parameters by means of the Divan-Chalonge-Barbier (BCD)
spectrophotometric system. For a few He-weak stars we also estimate the
effective temperatures and the angular diameters by integrating absolute fluxes
observed over a wide spectral range. Non-LTE model calculations are carried out
to study the influence of the He/H abundance ratio on the emergent radiation of
He-strong stars and on their Teff determination. We find that the effective
temperatures, surface gravities and bolometric absolute magnitudes of He-weak
stars estimated with the BCD system and the integrated flux method are in good
agreement between each other, and they also agree with previous determinations
based on several different methods. The mean discrepancy between the visual
absolute magnitudes derived using the Hipparcos parallaxes and the BCD values
is on average 0.3 mag for He-weak stars, while it is 0.5 mag for He-strong
stars. For He-strong stars, we note that the BCD calibration, based on stars in
the solar environment, leads to overestimated values of Teff. By means of model
atmosphere calculations with enhanced He/H abundance ratios we show that larger
He/H ratios produce smaller BD which naturally explains the Teff
overestimation. We take advantage of these calculations to introduce a method
to estimate the He/H abundance ratio in He-strong stars. The BD of HD 37479
suggests that the Teff of this star remains fairly constant as the star
spectrum undergoes changes in the intensity of H and He absorption lines. Data
for the He-strong star HD 66765 are reported for the first time.
