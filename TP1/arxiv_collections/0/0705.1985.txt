We study the motion of two non-interacting quantum particles performing a
random walk on a line and analyze the probability that the two particles are
detected at a particular position after a certain number of steps (meeting
problem). The results are compared to the corresponding classical problem and
differences are pointed out. Analytic formulas for the meeting probability and
its asymptotic behavior are derived. The decay of the meeting probability for
distinguishable particles is faster then in the classical case, but not
quadratically faster. Entangled initial states and the bosonic or fermionic
nature of the walkers are considered.
