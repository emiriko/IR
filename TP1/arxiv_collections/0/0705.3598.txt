We study here a heat-type differential equation of order n greater than two,
in the case where the time-derivative is supposed to be fractional. The
corresponding solution can be described as the transition function of a
pseudoprocess (coinciding with the one governed by the standard,
non-fractional, equation) with a time argument T which is itself random. The
distribution of T is presented together with some features of the solution
(such as analytic expressions for its moments).
