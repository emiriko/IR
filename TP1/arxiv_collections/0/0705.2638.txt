In this work linear stability analysis of a four-fluid optically thin plasma
consisting of electrons, ions, neutral atoms, and charged dust particles is
performed with respect to the radiation-condensation (RC) instability. The
energy budget of the plasma involves the input from heating through
photo-electron emission by dust particles under external ultraviolet radiation
as well as radiative losses in inelastic electron-neutral, electron-ion,
neutral-neutral collisions. It is shown that negatively charged particles
stimulate the RC instability in the sense that the conditions for the
instability to hold are wider than similar conditions in a single-fluid
description.
