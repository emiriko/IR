Room temperature ferromagnetism is observed in undoped TiO2 films deposited
on Si substrates using pulsed laser deposition (PLD). The ferromagnetic
properties of the samples depend on the oxygen partial pressure during the PLD
synthesis. The appearance of higher binding energy component (HBEC) in the
oxygen 1s core peak from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) suggests the
presence of oxygen vacancies in these samples. The amount of oxygen during the
synthesis determines the vacancy concentration in the samples which is directly
related to the magnetic behavior of the samples. The magnetic moment decreases
with oxygen vacancy concentration in the samples. Valence band measurements
were performed to study the electronic structure of both stoichometric and
reduced TiO2. The analyses show the presence of Ti 3d band near the Fermi level
in reduced TiO2 samples. These bands are otherwise empty in stoichiometric TiO2
and reside in the conduction band which makes them unobservable by XPS. The
existence of this Ti 3d band near the Fermi level can possibly lead to Stoner
splitting of the band.
