The early Solar System contained short-lived radionuclides such as 60Fe (t1/2
= 1.5 Myr) whose most likely source was a nearby supernova. Previous models of
Solar System formation considered a supernova shock that triggered the collapse
of the Sun's nascent molecular cloud. We advocate an alternative hypothesis,
that the Solar System's protoplanetary disk had already formed when a very
close (< 1 pc) supernova injected radioactive material directly into the disk.
We conduct the first numerical simulations designed to answer two questions
related to this hypothesis: will the disk be destroyed by such a close
supernova; and will any of the ejecta be mixed into the disk? Our simulations
demonstrate that the disk does not absorb enough momentum from the shock to
escape the protostar to which it is bound. Only low amounts (< 1%) of mass loss
occur, due to stripping by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities across the top of the
disk, which also mix into the disk about 1% of the intercepted ejecta. These
low efficiencies of destruction and injectation are due to the fact that the
high disk pressures prevent the ejecta from penetrating far into the disk
before stalling. Injection of gas-phase ejecta is too inefficient to be
consistent with the abundances of radionuclides inferred from meteorites. On
the other hand, the radionuclides found in meteorites would have condensed into
dust grains in the supernova ejecta, and we argue that such grains will be
injected directly into the disk with nearly 100% efficiency. The meteoritic
abundances of the short-lived radionuclides such as 60Fe therefore are
consistent with injection of grains condensed from the ejecta of a nearby (< 1
pc) supernova, into an already-formed protoplanetary disk.
