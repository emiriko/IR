5972 independent and cumulative yields of radioactive residuals nuclei have
been measured in 55 thin 206,207,208,nat-Pb and 209-Bi targets irradiated by
0.04, 0.07, 0.10, 0.15, 0.25, 0.6, 0.8, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, and 2.6 GeV protons.
Besides, 219 yields have been measured in 0.3, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.6 GeV
proton-irradiated 56-Fe target. The protons were extracted from the ITEP U-10
synchrotron. The measured data are compared with experimental results obtained
elsewhere and with theoretical calculations by LAHET, MCNPX, CEM03, LAQGSM03,
CASCADE, CASCADO, and LAHETO codes. The predictive power was found to be
different for each of the codes tested, but was satisfactory on the whole in
the case of spallation products. At the same time, none of the codes can
de-scribe well the product yields throughout the whole product mass range, and
all codes must be further improved.
