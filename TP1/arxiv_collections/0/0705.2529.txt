Surface optical plasmons on metal-dielectric boundaries of various shapes are
studied. The study features by the exploration of plasmons of the frequency
that is larger than $\omega_{pl}/\sqrt{2}$ and approximately equal to $\omega
_{pl}$. These plasmons exist on thin films, thin cylinders, and on spheres.
Such a plasmon does not exist on a single surface. For applications the use of
plasmons of the ~$\omega_{pl}$ frequency means the promotion of nanophotonics
devices into a short wavelength range. For Ag this means the promotion to the
wavelength of 140 nm.
