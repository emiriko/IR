We investigate the energy dependence of hadron production and of stopping
power based on HIJING/BBbar v2.0 model calculations. Pseudorapidity spectra and
transverse momentum distributions for produced charged particles as well as net
baryons (per pair of partcipants) and their rapidity loss are compared to data
at RHIC and predictions for LHC energies are discussed.
