We propose a geometric method to measure the wild ramification of a smooth
etale sheaf along the boundary. Using the method, we study the graded quotients
of the logarithmic ramification groups of a local field of positive
characteristic with arbitrary residue field. We also define the characteristic
cycle of an l-adic sheaf, satisfying certain conditions, as a cycle on the
logarithmic cotangent bundle and prove that the intersection with the 0-section
computes the characteristic class, and hence the Euler number.
