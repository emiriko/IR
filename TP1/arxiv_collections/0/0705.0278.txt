This paper presents a geometric description of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
systems on Lie affgebroids subject to affine nonholonomic constraints. We
define the notion of nonholonomically constrained system, and characterize
regularity conditions that guarantee that the dynamics of the system can be
obtained as a suitable projection of the unconstrained dynamics. It is shown
that one can define an almost aff-Poisson bracket on the constraint AV-bundle,
which plays a prominent role in the description of nonholonomic dynamics.
Moreover, these developments give a general description of nonholonomic systems
and the unified treatment permits to study nonholonomic systems after or before
reduction in the same framework. Also, it is not necessary to distinguish
between linear or affine constraints and the methods are valid for explicitly
time-dependent systems.
