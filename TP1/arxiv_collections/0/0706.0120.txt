We consider a metric graph $\mathcal{G}$ made of two graphs $\mathcal{G}_1$
and $\mathcal{G}_2$ attached at one point. We derive a formula relating the
spectral determinant of the Laplace operator
$S_\mathcal{G}(\gamma)=\det(\gamma-\Delta)$ in terms of the spectral
determinants of the two subgraphs. The result is generalized to describe the
attachment of $n$ graphs. The formulae are also valid for the spectral
determinant of the Schr\"odinger operator $\det(\gamma-\Delta+V(x))$.
