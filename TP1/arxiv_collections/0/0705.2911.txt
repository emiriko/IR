Recent results on baryonic B decays from the two b-factories, BABAR and
Belle, are presented. These include studies of B+ to p pbar pi+, B+ to p
Lambdabar gamma and B0 to p Lambdabar pi-; observations of B+ to p Lambdabar
pi0, B to Lambda_c+ Lambda_c- K, and B+ to Xibar0_c Lambda_c+; and study of the
inclusive B decays to Lambda_c.
