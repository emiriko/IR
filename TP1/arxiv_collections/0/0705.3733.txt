Final states including leptons are most promising to detect early signs of
new physics processes when the Large Hadron Collider will start proton-proton
collisions at the centre of mass energy of 14\TeV. The reach for Supersymmetry
and Extra Dimension models for integrated luminosities ranging from 1 to 10/fb
is reported. Preliminary results indicate that already with 1/fb of data new
phenomena can be detected.
