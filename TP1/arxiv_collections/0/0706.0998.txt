We analyse the phase transition between the Bragg Glass and the Disordered
phase in the vortex lattice in type-II superconductors, both by analytical
computations and experimental investigations. It is known that if the Peak
Effect can be detected, a Bragg Glass/Disordered phase transition takes place.
We show that, in some conditions, this transition can occur without the
observation of the Peak Effect Phenomenon. We introduce a method based on the
3rd harmonics of the AC magnetic susceptibility to detect the transition also
in these cases. Using this method, we obtain an experimental confirmation of
the theoretical predictions on sphere shaped V3Si single crystals, in the high
fields/low temperatures range too, where previous experimental studies failed
to detect the Bragg/Disordered phase transition.
