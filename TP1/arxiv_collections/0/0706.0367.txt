We have observed the giant radio galaxy Centaurus A and the globular cluster
$\omega$ Centauri in the TeV energy region using the CANGAROO-III stereoscopic
system. The system has been in operation since 2004 withan array of four
Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACT) with $\sim$100-m spacings. The
observations were carried out in March and April 2004. In total, approximately
10 hours data were obtained for each target.No statistically significant
gamma-ray signal has been found above 420 GeV over a wide angular region (a
one-degree radius from thepointing center) and we derive flux upper limits
using all of the field of view.Implications for the total energy of cosmic rays
and the density of the cold dark matter are considered.
