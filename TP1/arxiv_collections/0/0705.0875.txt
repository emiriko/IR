In many real-world oscillator systems, the phase response curves are highly
heterogeneous. However, dynamics of heterogeneous oscillator networks has not
been seriously addressed. We propose a theoretical framework to analyze such a
system by dealing explicitly with the heterogeneous phase response curves. We
develop a novel method to solve the self-consistent equations for order
parameters by using formal complex-valued phase variables, and apply our theory
to networks of in vitro cortical neurons. We find a novel state transition that
is not observed in previous oscillator network models.
