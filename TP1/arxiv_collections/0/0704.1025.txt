The CORSIKA program, usually used to simulate extensive cosmic ray air
showers, has been adapted to work in a water or ice medium. The adapted CORSIKA
code was used to simulate hadronic showers produced by neutrino interactions.
The simulated showers have been used to study the spatial distribution of the
deposited energy in the showers. This allows a more precise determination of
the acoustic signals produced by ultra high energy neutrinos than has been
possible previously. The properties of the acoustic signals generated by such
showers are described.
