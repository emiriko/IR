In this paper, we propose a way of assigning static type information to
unmarshalling functions and we describe a verification technique for
unmarshalled data that preserves the execution safety provided by static type
checking. This technique, whose correctness is proven, relies on singleton
types whose values are transmitted to unmarshalling routines at runtime, and on
an efficient checking algorithm able to deal with sharing and cycles.
