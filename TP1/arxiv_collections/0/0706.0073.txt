This paper presents a dynamic linear model for modeling hourly ozone
concentrations over the eastern United States. That model, which is developed
within an Bayesian hierarchical framework, inherits the important feature of
such models that its coefficients, treated as states of the process, can change
with time. Thus the model includes a time--varying site invariant mean field as
well as time varying coefficients for 24 and 12 diurnal cycle components. This
cost of this model's great flexibility comes at the cost of computational
complexity, forcing us to use an MCMC approach and to restrict application of
our model domain to a small number of monitoring sites. We critically assess
this model and discover some of its weaknesses in this type of application.
