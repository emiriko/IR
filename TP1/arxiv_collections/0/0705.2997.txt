Coulomb drag experiments in which the inter-layer resistivity is measured are
important as they provide information on the Coulomb interactions in bilayer
systems. When the layer densities are low correlation effects become
significant to account for the quantitative description of experimental
results. We investigate systematically various models of effective inter-layer
interactions in a bilayer system and compare our results with recent
experiments. In the low density regime, the correlation effects are included
via the intra- and inter-layer local-field corrections. We employ several
theoretical approaches to construct static local-field corrections. Our
comparative study demonstrates the importance of including the correlation
effects accurately in the calculation of drag resistivity. Recent experiments
performed at low layer densities are adequately described by effective
inter-layer interactions incorporating static correlations.
