A new scanning Fabry-Perot system will soon be available at the Nasmyth focus
of the 4,2m William Hershell Telescope (WHT). It has been designed by the
Laboratoire d'Astrophysique Experimentale (LAE) in Montreal and is being built
in collaboration with astronomers at the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias
(IAC). The instrument will see first light at the beginning of July 2007.
