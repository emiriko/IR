We present the results of a uniform analysis of the soft X-ray spectra of
fifteen type I AGN observed with the high resolution X-ray gratings on board
\emph{Chandra}. We found that ten of the fifteen AGN exhibit signatures of an
intrinsic ionized absorber. The absorbers are photoionized and outflowing, with
velocities in the range $\sim 10^{1}-10^{3}$ km $\rm{s}^{-1}$. The column
density of the warm absorbing gas is $\sim 10^{20-23} \rm{cm}^{-2}$. Nine of
the ten AGN exhibiting warm absorption are best--fit by multiple ionization
components and three of the ten AGN \emph{require} multiple kinematic
components. The warm absorbing gas in our AGN sample has a wide range of
ionization parameter, spanning roughly four orders of magnitude ($\xi \sim
10^{0-4}$ ergs cm $\rm{s}^{-1}$) in total, and often spanning three orders of
magnitude in the same gas. Warm absorber components with ionization parameter
$\xi<10$ generate an unresolved transition array due to Fe in seven of the ten
AGN exhibiting warm absorption. These low ionization state absorbers may also
carry away the largest mass outflows from the AGN. The mass outflow rate
depends critically on the volume filling factor of the gas, which cannot yet be
directly measured. However, upper limits on the mass outflow ratesfor filling
factors of unity can be much greater than the expected accretion rate onto the
central supermassive black hole and filling factors as small as 1% can give
outflow rates comparable to the accretion rate. There appears to be a gap in
the outflow velocities in our sample between $\sim 300-500$ km $\rm{s}^{-1}$,
the origin of which is not clear. The outflow components with velocities below
this gap tend to be associated with lower column densities than those with
velocities above the gap.
