BES Collaboration measured the $R$ values at 3.650, 3.6648 and 3.773 GeV, the
$R$ values at 68 energy points in the energy region between 3.650 and 3.872
GeV, the resonance parameters of $\psi(3686)$ and $\psi(3770)$, the branching
fractions for $\psi(3770)\to D^0\bar D^0, D^+D^-, D\bar D$ and non-$D\bar D$,
and the observed cross sections for some exclusive light hadron final states at
3.773 and 3.650 GeV. These measurements are made by analyzing the data sets
collected with the BESII detector at the BEPC collider.
