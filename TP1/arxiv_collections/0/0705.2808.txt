In this paper we analyse the spectra of D-type SS H1-36 within a
colliding-wind scenario. We aim to analyse the properties of this object taking
into account the observational data along the whole electromagnetic spectrum,
in order to derive a self-consistent picture able to interpret the nature of
the system as a whole. After constraining the relative physical conditions by
modelling more than 40 emission lines from radio to UV, we are able to explain
the continuum spectral energy distribution by taking into account all the
emitting contributions arising from both the stars, the dust shells and the
gaseous nebulae. A comprehensive model of the radio spectra allows to reproduce
the different slopes of the radio profile and the turnover frequency, as well
as the different size of the observed shocked envelope at different frequencies
in the light of the different contributions from the expanding and reverse
nebulae. The IR continuum unveils the presence of two dust shells with
different radii and temperatures, which might be a distinctive feature of
D-type symbiotic systems as a class of objects. The broad profiles of IR lines
direct us to investigate whether an X-ray jet may be present. This insight
leads us to indicate H1-36 as a promising X-ray target and to encourage
observations and studies which consistently take into account the complex
nature of symbiotic stars throughout the whole electromagnetic spectrum.
