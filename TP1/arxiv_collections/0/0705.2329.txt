A search for the production of neutral Higgs bosons decaying into tau tau
final states is presented. One of the two tau leptons is required to decay into
a muon. The data were collected by the D0 detector and correspond to an
integrated luminosity of about 1.0 fb-1. No excess is observed above the
expected backgrounds. The results are interpreted in the Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model. In the mass range 90<mA<200 GeV values of tan(beta) larger than
40-60 are excluded for the no-mixing and the mhmax benchmark scenarios.
