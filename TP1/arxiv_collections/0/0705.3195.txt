The behavior of interacting populations typically displays irregular temporal
and spatial patterns that are difficult to reconcile with an underlying
deterministic dynamics. A classical example is the heterogeneous distribution
of plankton communities, which has been observed to be patchy over a wide range
of spatial and temporal scales. Here, we use plankton communities as prototype
systems to present theoretical approaches for the analysis of the combined
effects of turbulent advection and stochastic growth in the spatiotemporal
dynamics of the population. Incorporation of these two factors into
mathematical models brings an extra level of realism to the description and
leads to better agreement with experimental data than that of previously
proposed models based on reaction-diffusion equations.
