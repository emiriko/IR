We consider the size and structure of the automorphism groups of a variety of
empirical `real-world' networks and find that, in contrast to classical random
graph models, many real-world networks are richly symmetric. We relate
automorphism group structure to network topology and discuss generic forms of
symmetry and their origin in real-world networks.
