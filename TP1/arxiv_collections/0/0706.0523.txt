In predicate abstraction, exact image computation is problematic, requiring
in the worst case an exponential number of calls to a decision procedure. For
this reason, software model checkers typically use a weak approximation of the
image. This can result in a failure to prove a property, even given an adequate
set of predicates. We present an interpolant-based method for strengthening the
abstract transition relation in case of such failures. This approach guarantees
convergence given an adequate set of predicates, without requiring an exact
image computation. We show empirically that the method converges more rapidly
than an earlier method based on counterexample analysis.
