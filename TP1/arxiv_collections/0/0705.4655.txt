The MINOS long baseline experiment has been collecting neutrino beam data
since March 2005 and has accumulated 3 x 10^{20} protons-on-target (POT) to
date. MINOS uses Fermilab's NuMI neutrino beam which is measured by two
steel-scintillator tracking calorimeters, one at Fermilab and the other 735 km
downstream, in northern Minnesota. By observing the oscillatory structure in
the neutrino energy spectrum, MINOS can precisely measure the neutrino
oscillation parameters in the atmospheric sector. From analysis of the first
year of data, corresponding to 1.27 x 10^{20} POT, these parameters were
determined to be |\Delta m^2_{32}|=2.74^{+0.44}_{-0.26} x 10^{-3} eV^2 and
sin^2(2\theta_{23})>0.87 (68% C.L.). MINOS is able to measure the neutrino
velocity by comparing the arrival times of the neutrino beam in its two
detectors. Using a total of 473 Far Detector events, (v-c)/c = (5.1 +/- 2.9) x
10^{-5} (68% C.L.) was measured. In addition, we report recent progress in the
analysis of neutral current events and give an outline of experimental goals
for the future.
