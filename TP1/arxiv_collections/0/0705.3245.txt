We compute the effect of local electrons on the CMB temperature anisotropies.
The number density and distribution of free electrons in our Galaxy has been
accurately measured from pulsar dispersion measurements. Because of their
distribution, the dynamics of our Galaxy and the Galaxy peculiar velocity with
respect to the Hubble flow, these free electrons leave a frequency-independent
imprint on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In particular, the coherent
motion of the free electrons respect to us and to the CMB rest frame produce a
kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich signal. We compute this effect and we note that the
large-scale antisymmetry of the signal gives it an angular power spectrum with
a sawtooth pattern where even multipoles are suppressed with respect to the odd
ones. We find the signal to be small (~ 2 uK) and sub-dominant compared to the
primary CMB and other foreground signals. However, since there are no free
parameters in the modeling of this signal, it can be taken into account if more
precise measurements of the primordial signal are required.
