Based on the recently proposed SUSY quantum Hall effect, we show that
Laughlin and Moore-Read states are related by a hidden SUSY transformation.
Regarding the SUSY Laughlin wavefunction as a master wavefunction, Laughlin and
Moore-Read states appear as two extreme limits of component wavefunctions.
Realizations of topological excitations on Laughlin and Moore-Read states are
also discussed in the SUSY formalism. We develop a streographically projected
formulation of the SUSY quantum Hall effect. With appropriate interpretation of
Grassmann odd coordinates, we illustrate striking analogies between SUSY
quantum Hall effect and superfluidity.
