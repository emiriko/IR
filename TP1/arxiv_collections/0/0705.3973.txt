Two new equatorially antisymmetric solutions recently published by Ernst et
al are studied. For both solutions the full set of metric functions is derived
in explicit analytic form and the behavior of the solutions on the symmetry
axis is analyzed. It is shown in particular that two counter-rotating equal
Kerr-Newman-NUT objects will be in equilibrium when the condition
m^2+\nu^2=q^2+b^2 is verified, whereas two counter-rotating equal masses
endowed with arbitrary magnetic and electric dipole moments cannot reach
equilibrium under any choice of the parameters, so that a massless strut
between them will always be present.
