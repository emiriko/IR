The aim of this contribution is to give the explicit formulas for the
eigenvectors of the transfer-matrix of Baxter-Bazhanov-Stroganov (BBS) model
(N-state spin model) with fixed-spin boundary conditions. These formulas are
obtained by a limiting procedure from the formulas for the eigenvectors of
periodic BBS model. The latter formulas were derived in the framework of the
Sklyanin's method of separation of variables. In the case of fixed-spin
boundaries the corresponding T-Q Baxter equations for the functions of
separated variables are solved explicitly. As a particular case we obtain the
eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian of Ising-like Z_N quantum chain model.
