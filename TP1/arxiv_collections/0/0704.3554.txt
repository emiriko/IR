We present the basic equations and sample solutions for the steady-state
global transonic solutions of the advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs)
with a causal viscosity prescription. The procedures for the stable numerical
calculations and all explicit formula for obtaining the solutions of ADAFs are
also presented. We solve the transonic solutions of ADAFs by using the explicit
numerical integrations, as in the Runge-Kutta method. In this calculation
method, we first solve the physical values at the sonic radius where
L'Hopital's rule is used. Then, we numerically solve the coupled differential
equations of the radial velocity, the angular momentum, and the sound speed
from the sonic radius in the inward and outward directions. By the calculation
procedures presented in this paper, we can cover all parameter spaces of the
transonic solutions of ADAFs. Sample transonic solutions for ADAF-thick disk
and ADAF-thin disk are presented. The explicit formula for the analytical
expansion around the singular points, the sonic and the viscous points, are
presented. If we set the diffusion timescale to null, the formalism in this
study becomes the formalism of the acausal viscosity that is usually used in
past studies for calculating of the ADAF structure.
