We find solutions of supersymmetric string field theory that correspond to
the photon marginal deformation in the boundary conformal field theory. We
revisit the bosonic string marginal deformation and generate a real solution
for it. We find a map between the solutions of bosonic and supersymmetric
string field theories and suggest a universal solution to superstring field
theory.
