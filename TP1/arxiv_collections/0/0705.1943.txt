Author details research on the new, very prospective, electrostatic Space
Elevator climber based on a new electrostatic linear engine previously offered
at the 42nd Joint Propulsion Conference (AIAA-2006-5229) and published in AEAT,
Vol.78, No.6, 2006, pp. 502-508. The electrostatic climber discussed can have
any speed (and braking), the energy for climber movement is delivered by a
lightweight high-voltage line into a Space Elevator-holding cable from Earth
electric generator. This electric line also can be used for delivery electric
energy to a Geosynchronous Space Station. At present, the best solution of the
climber problem (announced by NASA as one important awarding problem of Space
Elevator) is problematic.
  Author also shows the linear electrostatic engine may be used as realistic
power space launcher at the present time. Two projects illustrate these new
devices.
  Key words: Space elevator, Electrostatic climber for space elevator,
Electrostatic space launcher, Electrostatic accelerator.
