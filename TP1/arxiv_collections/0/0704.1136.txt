In this paper we construct spherical thin-shell wormholes supported by a
Chaplygin gas. For a rather general class of geometries we introduce a new
approach for the stability analysis of static solutions under perturbations
preserving the symmetry. We apply this to wormholes constructed from
Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild-de Sitter, Schwarzschild-anti de Sitter and
Reissner-Nordstrom metrics. In the last two cases, we find that there are
values of the parameters for which stable static solutions exist.
