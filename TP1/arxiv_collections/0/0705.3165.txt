We present an analysis of the X-ray data of a magnetic cataclysmic variable,
BG CMi, obtained with ROSAT in March 1992 and with ASCA in April 1996. We show
that four peaks clearly exist in the X-ray pulse profile, unlike a single peak
found in the optical profile. The fluxes of two major pulses are $\sim 2 - 5$
times larger than those of two minor pulses. The fraction of the total pulsed
flux increases from 51% to 85% with increasing energy in 0.1 $-$ 2.0 keV,
whereas it decreases from 96% to 22% in 0.8 $-$ 10 keV. We discuss the
implications of our findings for the origin of the pulse profile and its energy
dependence.
