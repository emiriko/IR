We consider the influence of the inclusion of interatomic interactions on the
delta-kicked accelerator model. Our analysis concerns in particular quantum
accelerator modes, namely quantum ballistic transport near quantal resonances.
The atomic interaction is modelled by a Gross-Pitaevskii cubic nonlinearity,
and we address both attractive (focusing) and repulsive (defocusing) cases. The
most remarkable effect is enhancement or damping of the accelerator modes,
depending on the sign of the nonlinear parameter. We provide arguments showing
that the effect persists beyond mean-field description, and lies within the
experimentally accessible parameter range.
