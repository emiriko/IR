Bayesian neural networks were used to model the relationship between input
parameters, Democracy, Allies, Contingency, Distance, Capability, Dependency
and Major Power, and the output parameter which is either peace or conflict.
The automatic relevance determination was used to rank the importance of input
variables. Control theory approach was used to identify input variables that
would give a peaceful outcome. It was found that using all four controllable
variables Democracy, Allies, Capability and Dependency; or using only
Dependency or only Capabilities avoids all the predicted conflicts.
