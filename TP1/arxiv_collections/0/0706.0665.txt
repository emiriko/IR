The model to simulate rescattering and partonic energy loss in
ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions is presented. The full heavy ion event
is obtained as a superposition of a soft hydro-type state and hard multi-jets.
This model is capable of reproducing main features of the jet quenching pattern
at RHIC, and is applied to probe jet quenching in various novel channels at
LHC.
