There are several exciting results for the hadronic B decays of Belle and
BaBar recently. My report focuses on the ratios of branching fractions and $CP$
asymmetry for $B \to hh$ decays at Belle and BaBar where $h$ denotes $\pi$ or
$K$. The observations of $B^+ \to K^+ \bar{K}{}^0$, $B^0 \to K^0 \bar{K}{}^0$
are published both by Belle and BaBar and shown here. We also report the
observation of $B^+ \to \rho^+ K^0$ and search of $B^+ \to \bar{K}{}^{* 0}
K^+$, $B^0 \to \rho^0 \rho^0$, $B^0 \to a_0^- \pi^+$ and $B^0 \to a_0^- K^+$ at
BaBar. Finally, we will show the results of amplitude analysis of the decays
$B^0 \to \phi K^*_2(1430)^0$, $\phi K^*(892)^0$ and $\phi (K\pi)^0_{\rm
S-wave}$ at BaBar.}
