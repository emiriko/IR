(Abridged) Luminous Compact Galaxies (LCGs) (M_B < -20, R_{1/2} < 4.5kpc and
EW_{0}(OII) >15\AA) constitute one of the most rapidly evolving galaxy
populations over the last ~8 Gyr history of the universe. Due to their
inherently compact sizes, any detailed quantitative analysis of their
morphologies has proved to be difficult in the past. In this work we use the
high angular resolution imaging data, from the HST/ACS GOODS survey, to study
the quantitative morphology of a complete sample of LCGs in the redshift range
0.5 < z < 1.2. We have derived structural parameters for a representative
sample of 39 LCGs selected from the GOODS-S field, using full 2-dimensional
surface brightness profile fitting of the galaxy images in each of the four
filters available. B-z color maps are used as an aid in the morphological
classification. We then use the rest frame B band bulge flux fraction (B/T) to
determine the morphological class of the galaxies. Mergers were essentially
identified visually by the presence of multiple maxima of comparable intensity
in the rest frame B band images, aided by the color maps to distinguish them
from HII regions. We derive the following morphological mix for our sample of
intermediate redshift LCGs: Mergers: ~36%, Disk dominated: ~22%, S0: ~20%,
Early types: ~7%, Irr/tadpole: ~15%. We establish that our sample LCGs are
intermediate mass objects with a median stellar mass of Log(M/M_{\odot})=10.32.
We also derive dust enshrouded SFR values ranging from a few to ~65
$M_{\odot}$/year using Spitzer 24$\mu m$ data. We estimate a factor ~11 fall in
the comoving number density of blue LCGs from redshifts 0.5 < z < 1.2 to the
current epoch. We finally discuss the evolutionary scenario of these LCGs which
might give us some clues regarding their descendants in the local universe.
