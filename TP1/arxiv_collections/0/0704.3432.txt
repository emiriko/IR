The general problem of finding the ground state energy of lattice
Hamiltonians is known to be very hard, even for a quantum computer. We show
here that this is the case even for translationally invariant systems. We also
show that a quantum computer can be built in a 1D chain with a fixed,
translationally invariant Hamitonian consisting of nearest--neighbor
interactions only. The result of the computation is obtained after a prescribed
time with high probability.
