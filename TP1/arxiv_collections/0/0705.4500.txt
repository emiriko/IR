$R$ measurement data taken with the BESII detector at center-of-mass energies
between 3.7 and 5.0 GeV is fitted to determine resonance parameters (mass,
total width, electron width) of the high mass charmonium states, $\psi(3770)$,
$\psi(4040)$, $\psi(4160)$ and $\psi(4415)$. Various effects, including the
relative phases between the resonances, interferences, the energy-dependence of
the full widths, and the initial state radiative correction, are examined. The
results are compared to previous studies.
