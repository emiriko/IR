The security of lattice-based cryptosystems such as NTRU, GGH and Ajtai-Dwork
essentially relies upon the intractability of computing a shortest non-zero
lattice vector and a closest lattice vector to a given target vector in high
dimensions. The best algorithms for these tasks are due to Kannan, and, though
remarkably simple, their complexity estimates have not been improved since more
than twenty years. Kannan's algorithm for solving the shortest vector problem
is in particular crucial in Schnorr's celebrated block reduction algorithm, on
which are based the best known attacks against the lattice-based encryption
schemes mentioned above. Understanding precisely Kannan's algorithm is of prime
importance for providing meaningful key-sizes. In this paper we improve the
complexity analyses of Kannan's algorithms and discuss the possibility of
improving the underlying enumeration strategy.
