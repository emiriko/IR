We propose an experiment to obtain the phase diagram of the fermionic Hubbard
model, for any dimensionality, using cold atoms in optical lattices. It is
based on measuring the total energy for a sequence of trap profiles. It
combines finite-size scaling with an additional `finite-curvature scaling'
necessary to reach the homogeneous limit. We illustrate its viability in the 1D
case, simulating experimental data in the Bethe-Ansatz local density
approximation. Including experimental errors, the filling corresponding to the
Mott transition can be determined with better than 3% accuracy.
