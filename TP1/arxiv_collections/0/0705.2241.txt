The solution to fine tuning is one of the principal motivations for Beyond
the Standard Model (BSM) Studies. However constraints on new physics indicate
that many of these BSM models are also fine tuned (although to a much lesser
extent). To compare these BSM models it is essential that we have a reliable,
quantitative measure of tuning. We review the measures of tuning used in the
literature and propose an alternative measure. We apply this measure to several
toy models and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.
