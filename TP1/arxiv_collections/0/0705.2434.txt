Heterogeneous materials abound in nature and man-made situations. Examples
include porous media, biological materials, and composite materials. Diverse
and interesting properties exhibited by these materials result from their
complex microstructures, which also make it difficult to model the materials.
In this first part of a series of two papers, we collect the known necessary
conditions on the standard two-point correlation function S2(r) and formulate a
new conjecture. In particular, we argue that given a complete two-point
correlation function space, S2(r) of any statistically homogeneous material can
be expressed through a map on a selected set of bases of the function space. We
provide new examples of realizable two-point correlation functions and suggest
a set of analytical basis functions. Moreover, we devise an efficient and
isotropy- preserving construction algorithm, namely, the Lattice-Point
algorithm to generate realizations of materials from their two- point
correlation functions based on the Yeong-Torquato technique. Subsequent
analysis can be performed on the generated images to obtain desired macroscopic
properties. These developments are integrated here into a general scheme that
enables one to model and categorize heterogeneous materials via two-point
correlation functions.
