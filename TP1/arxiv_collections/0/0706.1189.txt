Centered finite volume methods are considered in the context of Numerical
Relativity. A specific formulation is presented, in which third-order space
accuracy is reached by using a piecewise-linear reconstruction. This
formulation can be interpreted as an 'adaptive viscosity' modification of
centered finite difference algorithms. These points are fully confirmed by 1D
black-hole simulations. In the 3D case, evidence is found that the use of a
conformal decomposition is a key ingredient for the robustness of black hole
numerical codes.
