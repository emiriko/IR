We present a method for generating new deformed solutions starting from
systems of two real scalar fields for which defect solutions and orbits are
known. The procedure generalizes the approach introduced in a previous work
[Phys. Rev. D 66, 101701(R) (2002)], in which it is shown how to construct new
models altogether with its defect solutions, in terms of the original model and
solutions. As an illustration, we work out an explicit example in detail.
