We study the phenomenon of nonlinear stochastic resonance (SR) in a complex
noisy system formed by a finite number of interacting subunits driven by
rectangular pulsed time periodic forces. We find that very large SR gains are
obtained for subthreshold driving forces with frequencies much larger than the
values observed in simpler one-dimensional systems. These effects are explained
using simple considerations.
