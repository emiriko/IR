Diskoseismology, the theoretical study of small adiabatic hydrodynamical
global perturbations of geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disks
around black holes (and other compact objects), is a potentially powerful probe
of the gravitational field. For instance, the frequencies of the normal mode
oscillations can be used to determine the elusive angular momentum parameter of
the black hole. The general formalism developed by diskoseismologists for
relativistic systems can be readily applied to the Newtonian case of
cataclysmic variables (CVs). Some of these systems (e.g., the dwarf nova SS
Cygni) show rapid oscillations in the UV with periods of tens of seconds and
high coherence. In this paper, we assess the possibility that these dwarf nova
oscillations (DNOs) are diskoseismic modes. Besides its importance in
investigating the physical origin of DNOs, the present work could help us to
answer the following question. To what extent are the similarities in the
oscillation phenomenology of CVs and X-ray binaries (XRBs) indicative of a
common physical mechanism?
