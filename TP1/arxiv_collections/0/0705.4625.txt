Recent results on spectroscopy and the measurement of hadronic final states
in ep collisions from the H1 and ZEUS collaborations are presented using data
sets with an integrated luminosity between 44 and 121 pb^-1 collected during
the HERA I running period. Besides a search for resonant states which could be
interpreted as pentaquarks, a study of charged particle momentum spectra in the
Breit frame and a measurement of neutral strange hadron production is shown.
Furthermore two recent measurements of prompt photons are presented and
compared with pQCD calculations. The measurements are performed in
photoproduction with a four-momentum transfer squared Q^2\sim 0 GeV^2 or in
deep inelastic scattering at Q^2>1 GeV^2.
