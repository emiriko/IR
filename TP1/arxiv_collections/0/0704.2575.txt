We show, that photon non-linearities in electromagnetically induced
transparency can be at least one order of magnitude larger than predicted in
all previous approaches. As an application we demonstrate that, in this regime
they give rise to very strong photon - photon interactions which are strong
enough to make an experimental realization of a photonic Mott insulator state
feasible in arrays of coupled ultra high-Q micro-cavities.
