We present results of the first-principles calculation of Cs dipole static
polarizabilities for the Ns (N = 6 - 12), Np_j (N = 6 - 10), and Nd_j (N = 5 -
10) states using the relativistic all-order method. In our implementation of
the all-order method, single and double excitations of Dirac-Fock wave
functions are included to all orders in perturbation theory. Additional
calculations are carried out for the dominant terms and the uncertainties of
our final values are estimated for all states. A comprehensive review of the
existing theoretical and experimental studies of the Cs polarizabilities is
also carried out. Our results are compared with other values where they are
available. These calculations provide a theoretical benchmark for a large
number of Cs polarizabilities.
