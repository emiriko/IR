We show that a strongly correlated quantum dot embedded in an Aharonov-Bohm
interferometer can be used to filter both charge and spin at zero voltage bias.
The magnitude with which the Aharonov-Bohm arm is coupled to the system
controls the many-body effects on the quantum dot. When the quantum dot is in
the Kondo regime the flow of charge through the system can be tuned by the
phase of the Aharonov-Bohm arm, $\phi_{AB}$. Furthermore when a spin-orbit
interaction is present on a Kondo quantum dot we can control the flow of spin
by the spin-orbit phase, $\phi_{SO}$. The existence of the Kondo peak at the
Fermi energy makes it possible to control the flow of both charge and spin in
the zero voltage bias limit.
