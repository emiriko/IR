In the present work, the non-spherical grain characteristics of comet Halley
are analysed using the T-matrix method at $\lambda = 0.365, 0.485$ and
$0.684\mu m$ respectively. In order to analyse the polarisation data of comet
Halley, the dust size distribution function derived by Das et al. (2004) for
comet Halley is used in the present work. The size range of the grains is taken
to be 0.01$\mu m \le$ s $\le 3\mu m$. Using the T-matrix method, the best fit
values of complex refractive indices $(n, k)$ and aspect ratio ($E$) are
determined at three different wavelengths $ 0.365, 0.485$ and $0.684\mu m$ and
the corresponding values are given by $(1.380, 0.043, 0.962), (1.378, 0.049,
0.962)$ and $(1.377, 0.058,0.962)$ respectively. After comparing the above
result with Mie theory result, it is found that prolate grains give the best
fit to the observed polarisation data of comet Halley. Also the negative
polarisation behaviour of comet Halley is discussed thereafter.
