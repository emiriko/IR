OO Serpentis is a deeply embedded pre-main sequence star that went into
outburst in 1995 and gradually faded afterwards. Its eruption resembled the
well-known FU Orionis-type or EX Lupi-type outbursts. Since very few such
events have ever been documented at infrared wavelengths, our aim is to study
the temporal evolution of OO Ser in the infrared. OO Ser was monitored with the
Infrared Space Observatory starting 4 months after peak brightness and covering
20 months. In 2004-2006 we again observed OO Ser from the ground and
complemented this dataset with archival Spitzer obsevations also from 2004. We
analysed these data with special attention to source confusion and constructed
light curves at 10 different wavelengths as well as spectral energy
distributions. The outburst caused brightening in the whole infrared regime.
According to the infrared light curves, OO Ser started a wavelength-independent
fading after peak brightness. Later the flux decay became slower but stayed
wavelength-independent. The fading is still ongoing, and current fading rates
indicate that OO Ser will not return to quiescent state before 2011. The
outburst timescale of OO Ser seems to be shorter than that of FUors, but longer
than that of EXors. The outburst timescale and the moderate luminosity suggest
that OO Ser is different from both FUors and EXors, and shows similarities to
the recently erupted young star V1647 Ori. Based on its spectral energy
distribution and bolometric temperature, OO Ser seems to be an early class I
object, with an age of < 10^5 yr. The object is probably surrounded by an
accretion disc and a dense envelope. Due to the shorter outburst timescales,
the viscosity in the circumstellar disc of OO Ser is probably an order of
magnitude higher than usual for FUors.
