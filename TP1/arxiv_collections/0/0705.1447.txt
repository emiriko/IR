Wakes created by a parton moving through a static and infinitely extended
quark-gluon plasma are considered. In contrast to former investigations
collisions within the quark-gluon plasma are taken into account using a
transport theoretical approach (Boltzmann equation) with a
Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook collision term. Within this model it is shown that the
wake structure changes significantly compared to the collisionless case.
