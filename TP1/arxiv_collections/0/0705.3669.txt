Composite fabrication technologies now provide the means for producing
high-strength, low-weight panels, plates, spars and other structural components
which use embedded fiber optic sensors and piezoelectric transducers. These
materials, often referred to as smart structures, make it possible to sense
internal characteristics, such as delaminations or structural degradation. In
this effort we use neural network based techniques for modeling and analyzing
dynamic structural information for recognizing structural defects. This yields
an adaptable system which gives a measure of structural integrity for composite
structures.
