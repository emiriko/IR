We present the first calculation of saltation transport and dune formation on
Mars and compare it to real dunes. We find that the rate at which grains are
entrained into saltation on Mars is one order of magnitude higher than on
Earth. With this fundamental novel ingredient, we reproduce the size and
different shapes of Mars dunes, and give an estimate for the wind velocity on
Mars.
