The analysis of images (of obtained in various ranges of the lengths of
waves) of luminous objects in the Universe by means of a method of multilevel
dynamic contrasting led author to the conclusions: a) the structures of all
observable galaxies represents a complicated constructions which have the
tendency to self-similarity and made of separate (basic) blocks, which are a
coaxially tubular structures and a cartwheel-like structures; b) the majority
of observable objects in the Universe are luminous butt-ends of almost
invisible (of almost completely transparent) of filamentary formations which
structures are seen only near to their luminous butt-ends; c) the result of
analysis of images of cosmic objects show the structure of many pairs of
cooperating galaxies point to opportunity of their formation at butt-ends
generated in a place of break of the similar filament; d) the interacting
galaxies (M 81 and M 82) show they are butt-ends of sawed off of two branches
of a treelike filament and their interaction is coming out through this
filament; e) as our Universe is in dynamics the processes of formation of
stars, galaxies and their congestions can go presently by means of a fracturing
of filaments with a corresponding diameters and of the time for their such
formation is necessary much less, than along existing standard model.
