Capacitance-voltage characteristics of individual germanium nanowire field
effect transistors were directly measured and used to assess carrier mobility
in nanowires for the first time; thereby removing uncertainties in calculated
mobility due to device geometries, surface and interface states and gate
dielectric constants and thicknesses. Direct experimental evidence showed that
surround-gated nanowire transistors exhibit higher capacitance and better
electrostatic gate control than top-gated devices, and are the most promising
structure for future high performance nanoelectronics.
