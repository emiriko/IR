This note presents a comparative study of various options to reduce the
errors coming from the discretization of a Quantum Field Theory in a lattice
with hypercubic symmetry. We show that it is possible to perform an
extrapolation towards the continuum which is able to eliminate systematically
the artifacts which break the O(4) symmetry.
