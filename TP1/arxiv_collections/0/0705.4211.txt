We calculate the multiple scattering effect on single hadron production in
semi-inclusive lepton-nucleus deeply inelastic scattering. We show that the
quantum interference of multiple scattering amplitudes leads to suppression in
hadron productions. At the leading power in medium length, the suppression can
be approximately expressed in terms of a shift in $z$ of the fragmentation
function $D(z)$, and could be therefore interpreted as the collisional energy
loss. We compare our calculation with existing experimental data. We also
discuss the effect of quark mass on the suppression. Our approach can be
extended to other observables in hadronic collisions.
