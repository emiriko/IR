Recently it was found that dark energy in the form of phantom generalized
Chaplygin gas may lead to a new form of the cosmic doomsday, the big freeze
singularity. Like the big rip singularity, the big freeze singularity would
also take place at a finite future cosmic time, but unlike the big rip
singularity it happens for a finite scale factor.Our goal is to test if a
universe filled with phantom generalized Chaplygin gas can conform to the data
of astronomical observations. We shall see that if the universe is only filled
with generalized phantom Chaplygin gas with equation of state
$p=-c^2s^2/\rho^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha<-1$, then such a model cannot be matched
to the data of astronomical observations. To construct matched models one
actually need to add dark matter. This procedure results in cosmological
scenarios which do not contradict the data of astronomical observations and
allows one to estimate how long we are now from the future big freeze doomsday.
