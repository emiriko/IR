We investigate a cosmological model with a big-brake singularity in the
future: while the first time derivative of the scale factor goes to zero, its
second time derivative tends to minus infinity. Although we also discuss the
classical version of the model in some detail, our main interest lies in its
quantization. We formulate the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and derive solutions
describing wave packets. We show that all such solutions vanish in the region
of the classical singularity, a behaviour which we interpret as singularity
avoidance. We then discuss the same situation in loop quantum cosmology. While
this leads to a different factor ordering, the singularity is there avoided,
too.
