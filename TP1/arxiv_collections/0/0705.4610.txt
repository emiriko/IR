The two--dimensional diffusive dynamics of test particles in a random
electromagnetic field is studied. The synthetic electromagnetic fluctuations
are generated through randomly placed magnetised ``clouds'' oscillating with a
frequency $\omega$. We investigate the mean square displacements of particles
in both position and velocity spaces. As $\omega$ increases the particles
undergo standard (Brownian--like) motion, anomalous diffusion and ballistic
motion in position space. Although in general the diffusion properties in
velocity space are not trivially related to those in position space, we find
that energization is present only when particles display anomalous diffusion in
position space. The anomalous character of the diffusion is only in the
non--standard values of the scaling exponents while the process is Gaussian.
