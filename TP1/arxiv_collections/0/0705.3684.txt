We present the results of a search for faint HI 21-cm emission line wings at
velocities forbidden by Galactic rotation in the Galactic plane using the
Leiden/Dwingeloo HI Survey data and the HI Southern Galactic Plane Survey data.
These ``forbidden-velocity wings (FVWs)'' appear as protruding excessive
emission in comparison with their surroundings in limited (< 2 deg) spatial
regions over velocity extent more than ~20 km/s in large-scale (l-v) diagrams.
Their high-velocities imply that there should be some dynamical phenomena
associated. We have identified 87 FVWs. We present their catalog, and discuss
their distribution and statistical properties. We found that 85% of FVWs are
not coincident with known supernova remnants (SNRs), galaxies, or high-velocity
clouds. Their natures are currently unknown. We suspect that many of them are
fast-moving HI shells and filaments associated with the oldest SNRs that are
essentially invisible except via their HI line emission. We discuss other
possible origins.
