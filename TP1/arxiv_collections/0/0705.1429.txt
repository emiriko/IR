The role of isospin in quasielastic electron scattering and charge-changing
neutrino reactions is investigated in the relativistic impulse approximation.
We analyze proton and neutron scaling functions making use of various
theoretical descriptions for the final-state interactions, focusing on the
effects introduced by the presence of strong scalar and vector terms in the
relativistic mean field approach. An explanation for the differences observed
in the scaling functions evaluated from $(e,e')$ and $(\nu,\mu)$ reactions is
provided by invoking the differences in isoscalar and isovector contributions.
