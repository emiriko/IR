We present two triaxial analytical potential-density pairs that can be viewed
as generalized versions of the axisymmetric Miyamoto and Nagai and Satoh
galactic models. These potential-density pairs may be useful models for
galaxies with box-shaped bulges. The resulting mass density distributions are
everywhere non-negative and free from singularities. Also, a few numerically
calculated orbits for the Miyamoto and Nagai-like triaxial potential are
presented.
