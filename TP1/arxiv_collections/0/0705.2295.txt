Photoinduced circular dichroism experiments in an oblique magnetic field
allow measurements of Larmor precession frequencies, and so give a precise
determination of the electron Lande g factor and its anisotropy in
self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots emitting at 1.32 eV. In good agreement
with recent theoretical results, we measure g perp= 0.397 +_ 0.003 and g par =
0.18 +- 0.02.
