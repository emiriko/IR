One-time pad encrypted files can be sent through Internet channels using
current Internet protocols. However, the need for renewing shared secret keys
make this method unpractical. This work shows how users can use a fast physical
random generator based on fluctuations of a light field and the Internet
channel to directly boost key renewals. The transmitted signals are
deterministic but carries imprinted noise that cannot be eliminated by the
attacker. Thus, a one-time pad for Internet can be made practical. Security is
achieved without third parties and not relying on the difficulty of factoring
numbers in primes. An informational fragility to be avoided is discussed.
Information-theoretic analysis is presented and bounds for secure operation are
determined.
