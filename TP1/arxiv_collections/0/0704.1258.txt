GD 362 is a massive white dwarf with a spectrum suggesting a H-rich
atmosphere which also shows very high abundances of Ca, Mg, Fe and other
metals. However, for pure H-atmospheres the diffusion timescales are so short
that very extreme assumptions have to be made to account for the observed
abundances of metals. The most favored hypothesis is that the metals are
accreted from either a dusty disk or from an asteroid belt. Here we propose
that the envelope of GD 362 is dominated by He, which at these effective
temperatures is almost completely invisible in the spectrum. This assumption
strongly alleviates the problem, since the diffusion timescales are much larger
for He-dominated atmospheres. We also propose that the He-dominated atmosphere
of GD 362 is likely to be the result of the merger of a binary white dwarf.
