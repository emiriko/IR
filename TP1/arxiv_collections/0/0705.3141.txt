In this chapter of the book "Planets in binaries" we summarize our recent
work on the statistical properties of planets in binaries and the differences
with respect to planets orbiting single stars. We then present the radial
velocity planet search on moderately wide binaries with similar components
(twins) ongoing at TNG using the high resolution spectrograph SARG. We discuss
the sample selection, the observing and analysis procedures, and the
preliminary results of the radial velocity monitoring. We also discuss the
second major science goal of the SARG survey, the search for abundance
anomalies caused by the ingestion of planetary material by the central star,
considering the two samples of twins and the planet hosts in binaries with
similar components. Finally, we present some preliminary conclusions on the
frequency of planets in binary systems.
