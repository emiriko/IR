We present an analysis of the quantum state resulting from the dissociation
of diatomic molecules prepared in a condensate vortex state. The many-body
state preserves the rotational symmetry of the system in quantum correlated
states by having two equally populated components with angular momentum adding
to unity. A simple two-mode analysis and a full quantum field analysis is
presented for the case of non-interacting atoms and weak depletion of the
molecular condensate.
