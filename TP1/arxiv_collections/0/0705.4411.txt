A plane-symmetric inhomogeneous cosmological model of perfect fluid
distribution with electro-magnetic field is obtained. The source of the
magnetic field is due to an electric current produced along the z-axis.
$F_{12}$ is the non-vanishing component of electromagnetic field tensor. To get
a deterministic solution, we assume the free gravitational field is Petrov
type-II non-degenerate. The behaviour of the electro-magnetic field tensor
together with some physical aspects of the model are also discussed.
