The magneto-rotational instability is presently the most promising source of
turbulent transport in accretion disks. However, some important issues still
need to be addressed to quantify the role of MRI in disks; in particular no
systematic investigation of the role of the physical dimensionless parameters
of the problem on the dimensionless transport has been undertaken yet. First,
we complete existing investigations on the field strength dependence by showing
that the transport in high magnetic pressure disks close to marginal stability
is highly time-dependent and surprisingly efficient. Second, we bring to light
a significant dependence of the global transport on the magnetic Prandtl
number, with $\alpha\propto Pm^\delta$ for the explored range: $0.12<Pm<8$ and
$200<Re<6400$ ($\delta$ being in the range 0.25 to 0.5). We show that the
dimensionless transport is not correlated to the dimensionless linear growth
rate, contrarily to a largely held expectation. More generally, these results
stress the need to control dissipation processes in astrophysical simulations.
