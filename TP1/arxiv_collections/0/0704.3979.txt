The physical interpretation of the spectral line polarization produced by the
joint action of the Hanle and Zeeman effects offers a unique opportunity to
obtain empirical information about hidden aspects of solar and stellar
magnetism. To this end, it is important to achieve a complete understanding of
the sensitivity of the emergent spectral line polarization to the presence of a
magnetic field. Here we present a detailed theoretical investigation on the
role of resonance scattering and magnetic fields on the polarization signals of
the Ba II D1 and D2 lines of the Fraunhofer spectrum, respectively at 4934 \AA\
and 4554 \AA. We adopt a three-level model of Ba II, and we take into account
the hyperfine structure that is shown by the $^{135}$Ba and $^{137}$Ba
isotopes. Despite of their relatively small abundance (18%), the contribution
coming from these two isotopes is indeed fundamental for the interpretation of
the polarization signals observed in these lines. We consider an optically thin
slab model, through which we can investigate in a rigorous way the essential
physical mechanisms involved (resonance polarization, Zeeman, Paschen-Back and
Hanle effects), avoiding complications due to radiative transfer effects. We
assume the slab to be illuminated from below by the photospheric solar
continuum radiation field, and we investigate the radiation scattered at 90
degrees, both in the absence and in the presence of magnetic fields,
deterministic and microturbulent. We show in particular the existence of a
differential magnetic sensitivity of the three-peak Q/I profile that is
observed in the D2 line in quiet regions close to the solar limb, which is of
great interest for magnetic field diagnostics.
