We use the Gutzwiller variational many-body theory to investigate the
stability of orbitally ordered states in a two-band Hubbard-model without spin
degrees of freedom. Our results differ significantly from earlier Hartree-Fock
calculations for this model. The Hartree-Fock phase diagram displays a large
variety of orbital orders. In contrast, in the Gutzwiller approach orbital
order only appears for densities in a narrow region around half filling.
