In the density functional (DF) theory of Kohn and Sham, the kinetic energy of
the ground state of a system of noninteracting electrons in a general external
field is calculated using a set of orbitals. Orbital free methods attempt to
calculate this directly from the electron density by approximating the
universal but unknown kinetic energy density functional. However simple local
approximations are inaccurate and it has proved very difficult to devise
generally accurate nonlocal approximations. We focus instead on the kinetic
potential, the functional derivative of the kinetic energy DF, which appears in
the Euler equation for the electron density. We argue that the kinetic
potential is more local and more amenable to simple physically motivated
approximations in many relevant cases, and describe two pathways by which the
value of the kinetic energy can be efficiently calculated. We propose two
nonlocal orbital free kinetic potentials that reduce to known exact forms for
both slowly varying and rapidly varying perturbations and also reproduce exact
results for the linear response of the density of the homogeneous system to
small perturbations. A simple and systematic approach for generating accurate
and weak ab-initio local pseudopotentials which produce a smooth slowly varying
valence component of the electron density is proposed for use in orbital free
DF calculations of molecules and solids. The use of these local
pseudopotentials further minimizes the possible errors from the kinetic
potentials. Our theory yields results for the total energies and ionization
energies of atoms, and for the shell structure in the atomic radial density
profiles that are in very good agreement with calculations using the full
Kohn-Sham theory.
