The Parameter-Less Self-Organizing Map (PLSOM) is a new neural network
algorithm based on the Self-Organizing Map (SOM). It eliminates the need for a
learning rate and annealing schemes for learning rate and neighbourhood size.
We discuss the relative performance of the PLSOM and the SOM and demonstrate
some tasks in which the SOM fails but the PLSOM performs satisfactory. Finally
we discuss some example applications of the PLSOM and present a proof of
ordering under certain limited conditions.
