We study the statefinder parameter in the five-dimensional big bounce model,
and apply it to differentiate the attractor solutions of quintessence and
phantom field. It is found that the evolving trajectories of these two
attractor solutions in the statefinder parameters plane are quite different,
and that are different from the statefinder trajectories of other dark energy
models.
