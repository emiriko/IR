We study the long distance interaction for hybrid hadrons, with a static
gluon, a quark and an antiquark with lattice QCD techniques. A Wilson loop
adequate to the static hybrid three-body system is developed and, using a 24^3
x 48 periodic lattice with beta=6.2 and a ~ 0.075 fm, two different geometries
for the gluon-quark segment and the gluon-antiquark segment are investigated.
When these segments are perpendicular, the static potential is compatible with
confinement realized with a pair of fundamental strings, one linking the gluon
to the quark and another linking the same gluon to the antiquark. When the
segments are parallel and superposed, the total string tension is larger and
agrees with the Casimir Scaling measured by Bali. This can be interpreted with
a type-II superconductor analogy for the confinement in QCD, with repulsion of
the fundamental strings and with the string tension of the first topological
excitation of the string (the adjoint string) larger than the double of the
fundamental string tension.
