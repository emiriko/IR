As part of an effort to enlarge the number of well-studied Magellanic-type
galaxies, we obtained broadband optical imaging and neutral hydrogen radio
synthesis observations of the dwarf irregular galaxy ESO 364-G 029. The optical
morphology characteristically shows a bar-like main body with a one-sided
spiral arm, an approximately exponential light distribution, and offset
photometric and kinematic centers. The HI distribution is mildly asymmetric
and, although slightly offset from the photometric center, roughly follows the
optical brightness distribution, extending to over 1.2 Holmberg radii (where
mu_B = 26.5 mag/arcsec^2). In particular, the highest HI column densities
closely follow the bar, one-arm spiral, and a third optical extension. The
rotation is solid-body in the inner parts but flattens outside of the optical
extent. The total HI flux F_HI = 23.1 pm 1.2 Jy km/s, yielding a total HI mass
M_HI= (6.4 pm 1.7) x 10^8 Msun (for a distance D = 10.8 pm 1.4 Mpc) and a total
HI mass-to-blue-luminosity ratio M_HI/L_B = (0.96 pm 0.14) Msun / Lsun,B
(distance independent). The HI data suggest a very complex small-scale HI
structure, with evidence of large shells and/or holes, but deeper observations
are required for a detailed study. Follow-up observations are also desirable
for a proper comparison with the Large Magellanic Cloud, where despite an
optical morphology very similar to ESO 364-G 029 the HI bears little
resemblance to the optical.
