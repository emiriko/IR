We demonstrate how the observed H2O ice column densities toward three dense
globules in the Southern Coalsack could be used to constrain the ages of these
sources. We derive ages of ~10^5 yr, in agreement with dynamical studies of
these objects. We have modelled the chemical evolution of the globules, and
show how the molecular abundances are controlled by both the gas density and
the initial chemical conditions as the globules formed. Based on our derived
ages, we predict the column densities of several species of interest. These
predictions should be straightforward to test by performing molecular line
observations
