My object in the present paper is to: (1) introduce physicists to the life
and work of Whitehead; (2) outline the content of his book "The Principle of
Relativity"; (3) present Whitehead's basic criticism of the General Theory of
Relativity which, to my mind, has never been rebutted or properly appreciated,
even by GTR specialists; (4) propose a significant relevant research problem;
and (5) summarize some of the rather radical implications of the acceptance of
Whitehead's observations, including that spacetime is not curved.
