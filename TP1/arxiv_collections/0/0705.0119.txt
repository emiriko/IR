A recent radio survey of globular clusters has increased the number of
millisecond pulsars drastically. M28 is now the globular cluster with the third
largest population of known pulsars, after Terzan 5 and 47 Tuc. This prompted
us to revisit the archival Chandra data on M28 to evaluate whether the newly
discovered millisecond pulsars find a counterpart among the various X-ray
sources detected in M28 previously. The radio position of PSR J1824-2452H is
found to be in agreement with the position of CXC 182431-245217 while some
faint unresolved X-ray emission near to the center of M28 is found to be
coincident with the millisecond pulsars PSR J1824-2452G, J1824-2452J,
J1824-2452I and J1824-2452E.
