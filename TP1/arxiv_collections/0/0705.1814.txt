We show that in principle, $N$-partite unitary transformations can be
perfectly discriminated under local measurement and classical communication
(LOCC) despite of their nonlocal properties. Based on this result, some related
topics, including the construction of the appropriate quantum circuit together
with the extension to general completely positive trace preserving operations,
are discussed.
