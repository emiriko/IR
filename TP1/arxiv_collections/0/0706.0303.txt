A hybrid model where the tunneling probability is estimated based on both
sudden and adiabatic approaches has been proposed to understand the heavy ion
fusion phenomena at deep sub-barrier energies. It is shown that under certain
approximations, it amounts to tunneling through two barriers: one while
overcoming the normal Coulomb barrier (which is of sudden nature) along the
radial direction until the repulsive core is reached and thereafter through an
adiabatic barrier along the neck degree of freedom while making transition from
a di-nuclear to a mono-nuclear regime through shape relaxation. A general
feature of this hybrid model is a steep fall-off of the fusion cross section,
sharp increase of logarithmic derivative L(E) with decreasing energy and the
astrophysical S-factor showing a maxima at deep sub-barrier energies
particularly for near symmetric systems. The model can explain the experimental
fusion measurements for several systems ranging from near symmetric systems
like $^{58}Ni+^{64}Ni, ^{58}Ni+^{58}Ni$ and $ ^{58}Ni+^{69}Y$ to asymmetric one
like $^{16}O+^{208}Pb$ where the experimental findings are very surprising.
Since the second tunneling is along the neck co-ordinate, it is further
conjectured that deep sub-barrier fusion supression may not be observed for the
fusion of highly asymmetric projectile target combinations where adiabatic
transition occurs automatically without any hindrance. The recent deep
sub-barrier fusion cross section measurements of $^{6}Li+^{198}Pt$ system
supports this conjecture.
