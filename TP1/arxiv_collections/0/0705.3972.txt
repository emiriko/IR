We investigate the long-term dynamics of the three-dimensional
Navier-Stokes-Voight model of viscoelastic incompressible fluid. Specifically,
we derive upper bounds for the number of determining modes for the 3D
Navier-Stokes-Voight equations and for the dimension of a global attractor of a
semigroup generated by these equations. Viewed from the numerical analysis
point of view we consider the Navier-Stokes-Voight model as a non-viscous
(inviscid) regularization of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations.
Furthermore, we also show that the weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes-Voight
equations converge, in the appropriate norm, to the weak solutions of the
inviscid simplified Bardina model, as the viscosity coefficient $\nu \to 0$.
