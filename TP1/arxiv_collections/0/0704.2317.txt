The Method of Invariant Grid (MIG) is an iterative procedure for model
reduction in chemical kinetics which is based on the notion of Slow Invariant
Manifold (SIM) [1-4]. Important role, in that method, is played by the initial
grid which, once refined, gives a description of the invariant manifold: the
invariant grid. A convenient way to get a first approximation of the SIM is
given by the Spectral Quasi Equilibrium Manifold (SQEM) [1-2]. In the present
paper, a flexible numerical method to construct the discrete analog of a Quasi
Equilibrium Manifold, in any dimension, is presented. That object is named
Quasi Equilibrium Grid (QEG), while the procedure Quasi Equilibrium Grid
Algorithm. Extensions of the QEM notion are also suggested. The QEG is a
numerical tool which can be used to find a grid-based approximation for the
locus of minima of a convex function under some linear constraints. The method
is validated by construction of one and two-dimensional grids for model
hydrogen oxidation reaction.
