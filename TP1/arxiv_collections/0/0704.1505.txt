We examine the effects of new physics effecting the Higgs sector of the
standard model, focusing on the effects on the Higgs self couplings. We
demonstrate that a low mass higgs, m_h < 2 m_t, can have a strong effective
self coupling due to the effects of a new interaction at a TeV. We investigate
the possibility that the first evidence of such an interaction could be a
higgs-higgs bound state. To this end, we construct an effective field theory
formalism to examine the physics of such a low mass higgs boson. We explore the
possibility of a non relativistic bound state of the higgs field (Higgsium) at
LHC and construct a non relativistic effective field theory of the higgs sector
that is appropriate for such studies (NRHET).
