We evaluate the doping dependence of the quasiparticle current and low
temperature superfluid density in two slave-particle theories of the tt't''J
model -- the slave-boson theory and doped-carrier theory. In the slave-boson
theory, the nodal quasiparticle current renormalization factor $\alpha$
vanishes proportionally to the zero temperature superfluid density $\rho_S(0)$;
however, we find that away from the $\rho_S(0) \to 0$ limit $\alpha$ displays a
much weaker doping dependence than $\rho_S(0)$. A similar conclusion applies to
the doped-carrier theory, which differentiates the nodal and antinodal regions
of momentum space. Due to its momentum space anisotropy, the doped-carrier
theory enhances the value of $\alpha$ in the hole doped regime, bringing it to
quantitative agreement with experiments, and reproduces the asymmetry between
hole and electron doped cuprate superconductors. Finally, we use the
doped-carrier theory to predict a specific experimental signature of local
staggered spin correlations in doped Mott insulator superconductors which, we
propose, should be observed in STM measurements of underdoped high-Tc
compounds. This experimental signature distinguishes the doped-carrier theory
from other candidate mean-field theories of high-Tc superconductors, like the
slave-boson theory and the conventional BCS theory.
