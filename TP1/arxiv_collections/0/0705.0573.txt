An integrable self-adjoint 7-point scheme on the triangular lattice and an
integrable self-adjoint scheme on the honeycomb lattice are studied using the
sublattice approach. The star-triangle relation between these systems is
introduced, and the Darboux transformations for both linear problems from the
Moutard transformation of the B-(Moutard) quadrilateral lattice are obtained. A
geometric interpretation of the Laplace transformations of the self-adjoint
7-point scheme is given and the corresponding novel integrable discrete 3D
system is constructed.
