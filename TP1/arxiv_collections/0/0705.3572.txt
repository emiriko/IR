We define and study symmetrized and antisymmetrized multivariate exponential
functions. They are defined as determinants and antideterminants of matrices
whose entries are exponential functions of one variable. These functions are
eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator on corresponding fundamental domains
satisfying certain boundary conditions. To symmetric and antisymmetric
multivariate exponential functions there correspond Fourier transforms. There
are three types of such Fourier transforms: expansions into corresponding
Fourier series, integral Fourier transforms, and multivariate finite Fourier
transforms. Eigenfunctions of the integral Fourier transforms are found.
