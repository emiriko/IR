A survey of Galactic gamma-ray sources at a median energy of ~20 TeV has been
performed using the Milagro Gamma Ray Observatory. Eight candidate sources of
TeV emission are detected with pre-trials significance $>4.5\sigma$ in the
region of Galactic longitude $l\in[30^\circ,220^\circ]$ and latitude
$b\in[-10^\circ,10^\circ]$. Four of these sources, including the Crab nebula
and the recently published MGRO J2019+37, are observed with significances
$>4\sigma$ after accounting for the trials involved in searching the 3800
square degree region. All four of these sources are also coincident with EGRET
sources. Two of the lower significance sources are coincident with EGRET
sources and one of these sources is Geminga. The other two candidates are in
the Cygnus region of the Galaxy. Several of the sources appear to be spatially
extended. The fluxes of the sources at 20 TeV range from ~25% of the Crab flux
to nearly as bright as the Crab.
