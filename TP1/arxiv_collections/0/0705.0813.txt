The conductance of a junction between a normal metal and a superconductor
having the symmetry proposed by Berezinskii is studied theoretically. The main
feature of this symmetry is the odd frequency dependence of the anomalous Green
function, which makes possible the s-wave triplet superconducting state (the
Berezinskii superconductor). The Andreev reflection (which links positive and
negative energies) is sensitive to the energetic symmetry; as a result, the
conductance of the junction involving the Berezinskii superconductor is
qualitatively different from the case of a conventional superconductor.
Experimentally, the obtained results can be employed to test the possibility of
the Berezinskii superconductivity proposed for Na$_x$CoO$_2$ and to identify
the odd-omega component predicted for superconductor-ferromagnet junctions.
