One of the basic assumptions of the string model is that as a result of a DIS
in nucleus a single string arises, which then breaks into hadrons. However the
pomeron exchange considered in this work, leads to the production of two
strings in the one event. The hadrons produced in these events have smaller
formation lengths, than those with the same energy produced in the single
string events. As a consequence, they undergo more substantial absorption in
the nuclear matter.
