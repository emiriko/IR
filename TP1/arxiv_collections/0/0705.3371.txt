Multi-strange baryon azimuthal correlations were observed in d+Au and Au+Au
data taken by the STAR detector at RHIC. We extract the same-side per-trigger
yields for a variety of strange particle species and trigger pt, but do not
observe any species dependence. We also report the observation of an elongation
in the Delta-eta; direction of the Xi correlation peak, the ridge. Comparing
the same-side yields in d+Au and Au+Au data, we conclude that the same-side
yield of the azimuthal-only Xi correlations is greatly enhanced by the ridge
yield. We also report the first observation of a strong same-side peak in the
Omega baryon triggered azimuthal correlations.
