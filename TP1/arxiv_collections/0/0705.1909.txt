Strong dense many-spin interactions have been proposed to organize novel
orbital dynamics (the Little Effect) for novel chemical and catalytic
phenomena. The recent determinations of the relativistic and quantum Hall
effects of carriers in graphene under strong magnetic confinement have
substantiated the Little Effect. Moreover such nonclassical phenomena under the
stronger magnetic confinement of ferro-nanocatalysts are here shown to organize
reverse beta processes and possibly pycnonuclear reactions under high
temperature and high-pressure conditions. Such processes have implications for
reverse beta reactions and nuclear reactions within the interior of the earth
and new technologies for carbon nanotube-ferrometal and nanographene-ferrometal
composites.
