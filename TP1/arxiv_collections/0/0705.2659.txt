Moeller's energy-momentum complex is employed in order to determine the
energy and momentum distributions for a spacetime described by a "generalized
Schwarzschild" geometry in (3+1)-dimensions on a noncommutative curved D3-brane
in an effective, open bosonic string theory. The geometry considered is
obtained by an effective theory of gravity coupled with a nonlinear
electromagnetic field and depends only on the generalized (effective) mass and
charge which incorporate corrections of first order in the noncommutativity
parameter.
