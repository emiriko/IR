Semantic network research has seen a resurgence from its early history in the
cognitive sciences with the inception of the Semantic Web initiative. The
Semantic Web effort has brought forth an array of technologies that support the
encoding, storage, and querying of the semantic network data structure at the
world stage. Currently, the popular conception of the Semantic Web is that of a
data modeling medium where real and conceptual entities are related in
semantically meaningful ways. However, new models have emerged that explicitly
encode procedural information within the semantic network substrate. With these
new technologies, the Semantic Web has evolved from a data modeling medium to a
computational medium. This article provides a classification of existing
computational modeling efforts and the requirements of supporting technologies
that will aid in the further growth of this burgeoning domain.
