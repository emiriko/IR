We report on Kerr nonlinearity and dispersive optical bistability of a
Fabry-Perot optical resonator due to the displacement of ultracold atoms
trapped within. In the driven resonator, such collective motion is induced by
optical forces acting upon up to $10^5$ $^{87}$Rb atoms prepared in the lowest
band of a one-dimensional intracavity optical lattice. The longevity of atomic
motional coherence allows for strongly nonlinear optics at extremely low cavity
photon numbers, as demonstrated by the observation of both branches of optical
bistability at photon numbers below unity.
