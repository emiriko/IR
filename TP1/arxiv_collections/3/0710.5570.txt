The matrix elements of the quadrupole variables and canonic conjugate
momenta, emerging from collective nuclear models are calculated within a
$SU(1,1)\times O(5)$ basis. Using a harmonic oscillator implementation of the
SU(1,1) degree of freedom, it can be shown that the matrix elements of the
quadrupole phonon creation and annihilation operators can be calculated in a
pure algebraic way, making use of an intermediate state method.
