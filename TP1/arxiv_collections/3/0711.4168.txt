The human society is a very complex system; still, there are several
non-trivial, general features. One type of them is the presence of power-law
distributed quantities in temporal statistics. In this Letter, we focus on the
origin of power-laws in rating of movies. We present a systematic empirical
exploration of the time between two consecutive ratings of movies (the
interevent time). At an aggregate level, we find a monotonous relation between
the activity of individuals and the power-law exponent of the interevent-time
distribution. At an individual level, we observe a heavy-tailed distribution
for each user, as well as a negative correlation between the activity and the
width of the distribution. We support these findings by a similar data set from
mobile phone text-message communication. Our results demonstrate a significant
role of the activity of individuals on the society-level patterns of human
behavior. We believe this is a common character in the interest-driven human
dynamics, corresponding to (but different from) the universality classes of
task-driven dynamics.
