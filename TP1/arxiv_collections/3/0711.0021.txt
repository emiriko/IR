The MILC collaboration's simulations with improved staggered quarks are being
extended with runs at a lattice spacing of 0.06 fm with quark masses down to
one tenth the strange quark mass. We give a brief introduction to these new
simulations and the determination of the lattice spacing. Then we combine these
new runs with older results to study the masses of the nucleon and the Omega
minus in the continuum and chiral limits.
