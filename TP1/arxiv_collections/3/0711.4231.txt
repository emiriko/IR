In this paper we give a re-normalization of the supertrace on the category of
representations of Lie superalgebras of type I, by a kind of modified
superdimension. The genuine superdimensions and supertraces are generically
zero. However, these modified superdimensions are non-zero and lead to a kind
of supertrace which is non-trivial and invariant. As an application we show
that this new supertrace gives rise to a non-zero bilinear form on a space of
invariant tensors of a Lie superalgebra of type I. The results of this paper
are completely classical results in the theory of Lie superalgebras but
surprisingly we can not prove them without using quantum algebra and
low-dimensional topology.
