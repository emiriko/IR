The Minimal Flavor Violation hypothesis (MFV) is extended to the R-parity
violating MSSM, supplemented with a simple seesaw mechanism. The requirement of
MFV is shown to suppress lepton and baryon-number violating couplings
sufficiently to pass all experimental bounds, in particular those for proton
decay, and is thus a viable alternative to R-parity. The phenomenological
consequences for FCNC, LFV and colliders are briefly discussed. Typically, MFV
predicts sizeable baryon-number violation in some characteristic channels, like
single stop resonant production.
