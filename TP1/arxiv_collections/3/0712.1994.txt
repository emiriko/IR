After the concept of industry cluster was tangibly applied in many countries,
SMEs trended to link to each other to maintain their competitiveness in the
market. The major key success factors of the cluster are knowledge sharing and
collaboration between partners. This knowledge is collected in form of tacit
and explicit knowledge from experts and institutions within the cluster. The
objective of this study is about enhancing the industry cluster with knowledge
management by using knowledge engineering which is one of the most important
method for managing knowledge. This work analyzed three well known knowledge
engineering methods, i.e. MOKA, SPEDE and CommonKADS, and compares the
capability to be implemented in the cluster context. Then, we selected one
method and proposed the adapted methodology. At the end of this paper, we
validated and demonstrated the proposed methodology with some primary result by
using case study of handicraft cluster in Thailand.
