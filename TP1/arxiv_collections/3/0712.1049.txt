We estimate the bounds on Higgs and sparticle masses and discuss their
correlations in the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM).
In our analysis we have applied the present constraints from collider and low
energy experiments, as well as the experimental bound on cold dark matter from
WMAP. For a given lightest Higgs boson mass, which is expected to be measured
with good precision at the LHC, we find important correlations between the
Higgs and sparticle masses which allows one to delineate the MSSM model
parameters and particle spectra. We have also demonstrated an important
complementarity between the LHC and direct dark matter detection experiments
emphasizing that by including the experimental input both from collider physics
and from dark matter detection experiments, one would significantly improve the
measurement of the SUSY spectrum and the underlying parameter space.
