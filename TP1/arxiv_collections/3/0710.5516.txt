These are the substantially expanded notes of the lectures of JK at the
summer school "Higher-Dimensional Geometry over Finite Fields" in G\"ottingen,
June 2007. The first part gives an overview of the methods. The main new result
is the construction of rational curves passing through a given collection of
points on smooth cubic hypersurfaces over finite fields.
