Finite-size (FS) effects are a major source of error in many-body (MB)
electronic structure calculations of extended systems. A method is presented to
correct for such errors. We show that MB FS effects can be effectively included
in a modified local density approximation calculation. A parametrization for
the FS exchange-correlation functional is obtained. The method is simple and
gives post-processing corrections that can be applied to any MB results.
Applications to a model insulator (P$_2$ in a supercell), to semiconducting Si,
and to metallic Na show that the method delivers greatly improved FS
corrections.
