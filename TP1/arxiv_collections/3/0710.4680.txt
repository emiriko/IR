The problem of determining lower bounds for the energy cost of a given
nanoscale design is addressed via a complexity theory-based approach. This
paper provides a theoretical framework that is able to assess the trade-offs
existing in nanoscale designs between the amount of redundancy needed for a
given level of resilience to errors and the associated energy cost. Circuit
size, logic depth and error resilience are analyzed and brought together in a
theoretical framework that can be seamlessly integrated with automated
synthesis tools and can guide the design process of nanoscale systems comprised
of failure prone devices. The impact of redundancy addition on the switching
energy and its relationship with leakage energy is modeled in detail. Results
show that 99% error resilience is possible for fault-tolerant designs, but at
the expense of at least 40% more energy if individual gates fail independently
with probability of 1%.
