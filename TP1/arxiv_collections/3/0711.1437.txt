In the paper, we show that quantum logic of linear subspaces can be used for
recognition of random signals by a Bayesian energy discriminant classifier. The
energy distribution on linear subspaces is described by the correlation matrix
of the probability distribution. We show that the correlation matrix
corresponds to von Neumann density matrix in quantum theory. We suggest the
interpretation of quantum logic as a fuzzy logic of fuzzy sets. The use of
quantum logic for recognition is based on the fact that the probability
distribution of each class lies approximately in a lower-dimensional subspace
of feature space. We offer the interpretation of discriminant functions as
membership functions of fuzzy sets. Also we offer the quality functional for
optimal choice of discriminant functions for recognition from some class of
discriminant functions.
