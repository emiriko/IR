We construct a new class of positive indecomposable maps in the algebra of `d
x d' complex matrices. These maps are characterized by the `weakest' positivity
property and for this reason they are called atomic. This class provides a new
reach family of atomic entanglement witnesses which define important tool for
investigating quantum entanglement. It turns out that they are able to detect
states with the `weakest' quantum entanglement.
