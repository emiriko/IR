In this paper we present an overview of recent progress made in the
understanding of the spin-torque induced magnetization dynamics in nanodevices
using mesoscopic micromagnetic simulations. We first specify how a spin-torque
term may be added to the usual Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation of
magnetization motion and detail its physical meaning. After a brief description
of spin-torque driven dynamics in the macrospin approximation, we discuss the
validity of this approximation for various experimentally relevant geometries.
Next, we perform a detailed comparison between accurate experimental data
obtained from nanopillar devices and corresponding numerical modelling. We show
that, on the one hand, many qualitatively important features of the observed
magnetization dynamics (e.g., non-linear frequency shift and frequency jumps
with increasing current) can be satisfactory explained by sophisticated
micromagnetic models, but on the other hand, understanding of these experiments
is still far from being complete. We proceed with the numerical analysis of
point-contact experiments, where an even more complicated magnetization
dynamics is observed. Simulations reveal that such a rich behaviour is due to
the formation of several strongly non-linear oscillation modes. In the last
part of the paper we emphasize the importance of sample characterization and
conclude with some important remarks concerning the relation between
micromagnetic modelling and real experiments.
