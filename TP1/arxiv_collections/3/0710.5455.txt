A large number of analog chaos-based secure communication systems have been
proposed since the early 1990s exploiting the technique of chaos
synchronization. A brief survey of these chaos-based cryptosystems and of
related cryptanalytic results is given. Some recently proposed countermeasures
against known attacks are also introduced.
