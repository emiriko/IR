We suggest one redefinition of common clusters of questions used to analyze
student responses on the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation (FMCE). Our
goal is to move beyond the expert/novice analysis of student learning based on
pre-/post-testing and the correctness of responses (either on the overall test
or on clusters of questions defined solely by content). We use a resources
framework, taking special note of the contextual and representational
dependence of questions with seemingly similar physics content. We analyze
clusters in ways that allow the most common incorrect answers to give as much,
or more, information as the correctness of responses in that cluster.
Furthermore, we show that false positives can be found, especially on questions
dealing with Newton's Third Law.
