This document introduces PlDoc, a literate programming system for Prolog.
Starting point for PlDoc was minimal distraction from the programming task and
maximal immediate reward, attempting to seduce the programmer to use the
system. Minimal distraction is achieved using structured comments that are as
closely as possible related to common Prolog documentation practices. Immediate
reward is provided by a web interface powered from the Prolog development
environment that integrates searching and browsing application and system
documentation. When accessed from localhost, it is possible to go from
documentation shown in a browser to the source code displayed in the user's
editor of choice.
