We have recently introduced the notion of a q-quaternion bialgebra and shown
its strict link with the SO_q(4)-covariant quantum Euclidean space R_q^4.
Adopting the available differential geometric tools on the latter and the
quaternion language we have formulated and found solutions of the
(anti)selfduality equation [instantons and multi-instantons] of a would-be
deformed su(2) Yang-Mills theory on this quantum space. The solutions depend on
some noncommuting parameters, indicating that the moduli space of a complete
theory should be a noncommutative manifold. We summarize these results and add
an explicit comparison between the two SO_q(4)-covariant differential calculi
on R_q^4 and the two 4-dimensional bicovariant differential calculi on the bi-
(resp. Hopf) algebras M_q(2),GL_q(2),SU_q(2), showing that they essentially
coincide.
