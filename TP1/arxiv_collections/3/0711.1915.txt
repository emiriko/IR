We analyze the signum-generation method for creating random dichotomic
sequences with prescribed correlation properties. The method is based on a
binary mapping of the convolution of continuous random numbers with some
function originated from the Fourier transform of a binary correlator. The goal
of our study is to reveal conditions under which one can construct binary
sequences with a given pair correlator. Our results can be used in the
construction of superlattices and waveguides with selective transport
properties.
