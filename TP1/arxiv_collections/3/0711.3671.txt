Based on 14 million psi(2S) and 58 million J/psi events collected by the
BESII detector, the leptonic decay of psi(2S) into $\tau^+\tau^-$, psi(2S)
multi-body decays, chi_cJ decays, and J/psi hadronic decays are studied, and
the branching fractions of these decays are reported. These results may shed
light on the understanding of QCD.
