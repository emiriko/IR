We study how to assign the recently observed $D_{sJ}(2700)$ meson to an
appropriate level of the $c \bar s$ spectrum by the analysis of its decay modes
in final states comprising a light pseudoscalar meson. We use an effective
lagrangian approach with heavy quark and chiral symmetries, obtaining that the
measurement of the $D^* K$ decay width would allow to distinguish between two
possible assignments.
