The anisotropic effect of a hcp 4He solid matrix on cesium atoms has been
proposed as a tool to reveal the parity violating anapole moment of its
nucleus. It should also result in splitting the D2 optical excitation line in a
way depending on the light polarization. An experimental investigation has been
set up using oriented hcp helium crystals in which cesium metal grains are
embedded. Atoms are created by laser sputtering from this grains. Optical
absorption spectra of the D2 line have been recorded in the temperature range
of 1.0 to 1.4 K at liquid/solid coexistence pressure by monitoring the
fluorescence on the D2 line at 950 nm. No significant effect of the light
polarization has been found, suggesting a statistically isotropic disordered
solid environment for the cesium atoms.
