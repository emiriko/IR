A simple study of the relationship between the QBO and the number of
hurricanes in the Atlantic, both in the Basin and hitting the U.S. coastline,
demonstrates that the QBO is not a particularly useful index to help predict
hurricane numbers on five-year time scales. It is shown that there is very
little difference between the number of hurricanes following easterly winds in
the equatorial stratosphere and the number that follow westerly winds. Given
this it is reasonable one would make better predictions just using the mean
number of hurricanes in lieu of using the QBO and this is also simply
demonstrated here.
