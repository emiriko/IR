We study the directed and weighted network in which the wards of London are
vertices and two vertices are connected whenever there is at least one person
commuting to work from a ward to another. Remarkably the in-strength and
in-degree distribution tail is a power law with exponent around -2, while the
out-strength and out-degree distribution tail is exponential. We propose a
simple square lattice model to explain the observed empirical behaviour.
