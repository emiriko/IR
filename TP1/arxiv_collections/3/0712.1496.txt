We construct a linear basis for the polynomial eigenfunctions of a family of
deformed Calogero-Moser-Sutherland operators naturally associated with
hypergeometric polynomials. In our construction the eigenfunctions are obtained
as linear combinations of polynomials which generalise the (super) Schur
polynomials. As a byproduct, we obtain explicit series representations for the
super Jack polynomials.
