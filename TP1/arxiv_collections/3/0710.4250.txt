We discuss in detail the derivation of the leading four-nucleon force in
chiral effective field theory using the method of unitary transformation. The
resulting four-nucleon force is given in both momentum and configuration space.
It does not contain any unknown parameters and can be used in few- and
many-nucleon studies.
