It is generally believed that superconductivity and magnetism are two
antagonistic long-range phenomena. However, as it was preliminarily highlighted
in D. Stamopoulos et al. [Phys. Rev. B 75, 014501 (2007)] and extensively
studied in this work under specific circumstances these phenomena instead of
being detrimental to each other may even become cooperative so that their
synergy may promote the superconducting properties of a hybrid structure.
  Here, we have studied systematically the magnetic and transport behavior of
such exchange biased hybrids that are comprised of ferromagnetic (FM) Ni80Fe20
and low-Tc superconducting (SC) Nb for the case where the magnetic field is
applied parallel to the specimens. Two structures have been studied: FM-SC-FM
trilayers (TLs) and FM-SC bilayers (BLs). Detailed magnetization data on the
longitudinal and transverse magnetic components are presented for both the
normal and superconducting states. These data are compared to systematic
transport measurements including I-V characteristics. The comparison of the
exchange biased BLs and TLs that are studied here with the plain ones studied
in D. Stamopoulos et al. [Phys. Rev. B 75, 184504 (2007)] enable us to reveal
an underlying parameter that may falsify the interpretation of the transport
properties of relevant FM-SC-FM TLs and FM-SC BLs investigated in the recent
literature: the underlying mechanism motivating the extreme magnetoresistance
peaks in the TLs relates to the suppression of superconductivity mainly due to
the magnetic coupling of the two FM layers as the out-of-plane rotation of
their magnetizations takes place across the coercive field where stray fields
emerge in their whole surface owing to the multidomain magnetic state that they
acquire.
