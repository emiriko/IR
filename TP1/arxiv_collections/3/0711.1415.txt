We calculate the far-field stress-energy tensor of a quark gluon plasma due
to a heavy-quark meson moving through it, using a semi-classical description in
string theory of the meson as a string hanging into anti-de Sitter space. We
find that these mesons create a shock wave but no diffusion wake, in contrast
to single heavy quarks described via a trailing string, where the diffusion
wake is strong. If thermal QCD responds similarly to heavy quarks and heavy
quarkonia, the presence or suppression of the diffusion wake constitutes a
prediction which can in principle be checked in heavy-ion collisions.
