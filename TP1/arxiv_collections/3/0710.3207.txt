This contribution presents the most recent mid-rapidity inclusive jet results
from 3 pb^-1 of data collected from longitudinally polarized proton collisions
at sqrt(s)=200 GeV during the 2005 RHIC run. The inclusive jet asymmetry, a_LL,
with it's increased transverse momentum range and precision, provides strong
constraints on the gluon helicity distribution when compared with existing
next-to-leading order perturbative QCD evaluations.
