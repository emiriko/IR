We analyze the effect of Coulomb interaction on the noise of electric current
through an open quantum dot. We demonstrate that the ensemble average value of
the noise power acquires an interaction correction even for a dot coupled to
the leads by reflectionless point contacts, when the ensemble average
conductance is known to have no interaction corrections. To leading order, the
correction to the noise originates from the formation of a nonequilibrium state
of the Coulomb field describing the interaction between electrons. We find the
dependence of the current noise power on the electron temperature, the applied
voltage bias, and the strength of the Coulomb interaction.
