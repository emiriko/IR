We consider the Kondo tunneling induced by multiphonon emission/absorption
processes in magnetic molecular complexes with low-energy singlet-triplet spin
gap and show that the number of assisting phonons may be changed by varying the
Zeeman splitting of excited triplet state. As a result, the structure of
multiphonon Kondo resonances may be scanned by means of magnetic field tuning.
