This paper provides an analysis of the effects of attrition and non-response
on employment and wages using the Canadian Survey of Labour and Income
Dynamics. We consider a structural model composed of three freely correlated
equations for nonattrition/response, employment and wages. The model is
estimated using microdata from 22,990 individuals who provided sufficient
information in the first wave of the 1996-2001 panel. The main findings of the
paper are that attrition is not random. Attritors and non-respondents likely
are less attached to employment and come from low-income population. The
correlation between non-attrition and employment is positive and statistically
significant, though small. Also, wage estimates are biased upwards. Observed
wages are on average higher than wages that would be observed if all the
individuals initially selected in the panel remained in the sample.
