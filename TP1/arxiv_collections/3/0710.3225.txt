The observation of the nature and world represents the main source of human
knowledge on the basis of our reason. At the present it is also the use of
precise measurement approaches, which may contribute significantly to the
knowledge of the world but cannot substitute fully the knowledge of the whole
reality obtained also with the help of our senses. It is not possible to omit
the ontological nature of matter world. However, any metaphysical consideration
was abandoned when mainly under the influence of positivistic philosophy
phenomenological models started to be strongly preferred and any intuitive
approach based on human senses has been refused. Their success in application
region has seemed to provide decisive support for such preference. However, it
is limited practically to the cases when only interpolation between measured
data is involved. When the extrapolation is required the ontological models are
much more reliable and practically indispensable in realistic approach.
