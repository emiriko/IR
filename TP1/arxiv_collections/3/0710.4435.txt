An influence of spin-orbit interaction on the tunneling between two 2D
electron layers is considered. Particular attention is addressed to the
relation between the contribution of Rashba and Dresselhaus types. It is shown
that without scattering of the electrons, the tunneling conductance can either
exhibit resonances at certain voltage values or be substantially suppressed
over the whole voltage range. The dependence of the conductance on voltage
turns out to be very sensitive to the relation between Rashba and Dresselhaus
contributions even in the absence of magnetic field. The elastic scattering
broadens the resonances in the first case and restores the conductance to a
larger magnitude in the latter one. These effects open possibility to determine
the parameters of spin-orbit interaction and electrons scattering time in
tunneling experiments with no necessity of external magnetic field.
