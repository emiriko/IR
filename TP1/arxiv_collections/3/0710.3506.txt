We study the one-dimensional $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model with a uniform and a
staggered magnetic fields, using the dynamical density-matrix renormalization
group (DDMRG) technique. The DDMRG enables us to investigate the dynamical
properties of chain with lengths up to a few hundreds, and the results are
numerically exact in the same sense as 'exact diagonalization' results are.
Thus, we can analyze the low-energy spectrum almost in the thermodynamic limit.
In this work, we calculate the dynamical spin structure factor and demonstrate
the performance of the DDMRG method applying the open-end boundary condition as
well as the periodic boundary condition.
