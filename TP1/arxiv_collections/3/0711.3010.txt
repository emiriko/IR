The electromagnetic bremsstrahlung produced by a quark interacting with
nucleons or nuclei is azimuthally asymmetric. In the light-cone dipole approach
this effect is related to the orientation dependent dipole cross section. Such
a radiation anisotropy is expected to contribute to the azimuthal asymmetry of
direct photons in pA and AA collisions, as well as in DIS and in the production
of dileptons.
