We survey the recent developments in the reaction $NN \to NN\pi$ in effective
field theory. We show that the proper construction of the production operator
needs a careful separation of irreducible pieces from reducible ones. The
result of this consideration is a complete cancellation of all loops in the
production operator at NLO. Moreover, we show that this procedure brings the
leading Weinberg-Tomozawa vertex on-shell, thus enhancing the corresponding
contribution to the transition amplitude by a factor of 4/3 as compared to the
commonly used value. We also discuss the role of the $\Delta(1232)$ for the
s-wave pion production. Being relatively sizable individually the direct and
rescattering mechanisms of the $\Delta$ excitation at NLO cancel each other to
a large extent. Thus, we conclude that the net effect of the $\Delta$ at NLO is
very small.
