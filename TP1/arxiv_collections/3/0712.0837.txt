A representation of SL(2,Z) by integer matrices acting on the space of
analytic ordinary Dirichlet series is constructed, in which the standard
unipotent element acts as multiplication by the Riemann zeta function. It is
then shown that the Dirichlet series in the orbit of the zeta function are
related to it by algebraic equations.
