We study general properties of the restriction of the representations of the
finite complex reflection groups $G(de,e,r+1)$ to their maximal parabolic
subgroups of type $G(de,e,r)$, and focus notably on the multiplicity of
components. In combinatorial terms, this amounts to the following question :
which symmetries arise or disappear when one changes (exactly) one pearl in a
combinatorial necklace ?
