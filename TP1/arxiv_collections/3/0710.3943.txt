We probe the short-range pinning properties with the application of microwave
currents at very high driving frequencies (47.7 GHz) on
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ films with and without sub-micrometer BaZrO$_3$
inclusions. We explore the temperature and field ranges 60 K$<T<T_c$ and
0$<\mu_0H<$0.8 T, with the field applied along the c-axis. The magnetic field
induces a much smaller increase of the microwave resistivity, $\Delta
\rho_1(H)+\mathrm{i}\Delta \rho_2(H)$, in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$/BaZrO$_3$
with respect to pure YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$. $\Delta \rho_1(H)$ is
slightly superlinear in pure YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (suggesting a possible
contribution of thermal activation), but linear or sublinear in
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$/BaZrO$_3$ (suggesting a possible suppression of
thermal activation as a consequence of BaZrO$_3$ inclusions). These features
persist up to close to $T_c$. We discuss our data in terms of the ratio
$r=\Delta X_s'(H)/\Delta R_s'(H)$ in the framework of the models for the
microwave surface impedance in the mixed state. Large $r$ are found in
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$/BaZrO$_3$, with little field dependence. By
contrast, smaller values and stronger field dependences are found in pure
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$. We discuss the different field dependence of the
pinning constant.
