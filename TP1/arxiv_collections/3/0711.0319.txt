We report the direct observation of the excited L=1 state B_{s2}* in fully
reconstructed decays to B+K-. The mass of the B_{s2}* meson is measured to be
{5839.6 +- 1.1 (stat.) +- 0.7 (syst.) MeV/c^2, and its production rate relative
to the B+ meson is measured to be [1.15 +- 0.23 (stat.) +- 0.13 (syst.)] %.
