We propose a class of schemes for robust population transfer between quantum
states that utilize trains of coherent pulses and represent a generalized
adiabatic passage via a wave packet. We study piecewise Stimulated Raman
Adiabatic Passage with pulse-to-pulse amplitude variation, and piecewise
chirped Raman passage with pulse-to-pulse phase variation, implemented with an
optical frequency comb. In the context of production of ultracold ground-state
molecules, we show that with almost no knowledge of the excited potential,
robust high-efficiency transfer is possible
