Non-equilibrium processes following the irradiation of atomic clusters with
short pulses of vacuum ultraviolet radiation are modelled using kinetic
Boltzmann equations. The dependence of the ionization dynamics on the cluster
size is investigated. The predictions on: (i) the maximal and average ion
charge created, (ii) ion charge state distribution, (iii) average energy
absorbed per atom, (iv) spatial charge distribution, and (v) thermalization
scales are obtained for spherical xenon clusters containing: 20, 70, 2500 and
90000 atoms. These clusters were exposed to single rectangular pulses of vacuum
ultraviolet radiation of various pulse intensities, I ~ 10^{12}-10^{14} W/cm^2
and durations < 50 fs, at a fixed integrated radiation flux of F=0.4 J/cm^2.
The results obtained are found to be in good agreement with the available
experimental data, especially the dependence on the cluster size, if it is
assumed that the ions from the positively charged outer layer of the cluster
constitute the dominant contribution to the experimentally measured ion charge
state distribution.
