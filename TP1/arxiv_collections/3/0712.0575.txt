The interaction of externally applied currents with persistent currents
induced by magnetic field in a mesoscopic triangle is investigated. As a
consequence of the superposition of these currents, clear voltage rectification
effects are observed. We demonstrate that the amplitude of the rectified signal
strongly depends on the configurations of the current leads with the lowest
signal obtained when the contacts are aligned along a median of the triangle.
When the contacts are aligned off-centered compared to the geometrical center,
the voltage response shows oscillations as a function of the applied field,
whose sign can be controlled by shifting the contacts. These results are in
full agreement with theoretical predictions for an analogous system consisting
of a closed loop with a finite number of identical Josephson junctions.
