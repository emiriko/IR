We compute the complete one-loop finite temperature effective potential for
electroweak symmetry breaking in the Standard Model with a Higgs potential
supplemented by higher dimensional operators as generated for instance in
composite Higgs and Little Higgs models. We detail the resolution of several
issues that arise, such as the cancellation of infrared divergences at higher
order and imaginary contributions to the potential. We follow the dynamics of
the phase transition, including the nucleation of bubbles and the effects of
supercooling. We characterize the region of parameter space consistent with a
strong first-order phase transition which may be relevant to electroweak
baryogenesis. Finally, we investigate the prospects of present and future
gravity wave detectors to see the effects of a strong first-order electroweak
phase transition.
