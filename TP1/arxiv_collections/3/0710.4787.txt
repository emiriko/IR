Final states with leptons, jets and missing transverse energy are a promising
way to detect Supersymmetry at the Large Hadron Collider. Results of simulation
studies performed by the CMS and ATLAS collaborations are presented. The
discovery of new physics is shown to be possible within the first fb^-1 of
collected integrated luminosity.
