We present a complete top-down design of a low-power multi-channel clock
recovery circuit based on gated current-controlled oscillators. The flow
includes several tools and methods used to specify block constraints, to design
and verify the topology down to the transistor level, as well as to achieve a
power consumption as low as 5mW/Gbit/s. Statistical simulation is used to
estimate the achievable bit error rate in presence of phase and frequency
errors and to prove the feasibility of the concept. VHDL modeling provides
extensive verification of the topology. Thermal noise modeling based on
well-known concepts delivers design parameters for the device sizing and
biasing. We present two practical examples of possible design improvements
analyzed and implemented with this methodology.
