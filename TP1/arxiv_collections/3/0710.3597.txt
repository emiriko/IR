I describe the use of chiral effective theory (ChiET) to compute
electromagnetic reactions in two- and three-nucleon systems. I first explain
how chiral perturbation theory can be extended to the few-nucleon sector. I
then explain the predictions of the resulting ChiET for electron-deuteron
scattering, and how they will be tested by forthcoming data from BLAST. I
conclude by displaying predictions for elastic Compton scattering from
deuterium and Helium-3 nuclei. These computations, in concert with future data
from MAX-Lab and HIGS, should give significant new information on neutron
polarizabilities, and hence yield insight into the structure of the nucleon.
