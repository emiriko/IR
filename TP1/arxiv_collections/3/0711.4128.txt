This article proposes the construction of Wigner measures in the infinite
dimensional bosonic quantum field theory, with applications to the derivation
of the mean field dynamics. Once these asymptotic objects are well defined, it
is shown how they can be used to make connections between different kinds of
results or to prove new ones.
