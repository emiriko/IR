We give a new heuristic for all of the main terms in the quotient of products
of L-functions averaged over a family. These conjectures generalize the recent
conjectures for mean values of L-functions. Comparison is made to the analogous
quantities for the characteristic polynomials of matrices averaged over a
classical compact group.
