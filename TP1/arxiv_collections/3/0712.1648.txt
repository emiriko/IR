The Causal Set Theory (CST) approach to quantum gravity is motivated by the
observation that, associated with any causal spacetime (M,g) is a poset (M,<),
with the order relation < corresponding to the spacetime causal relation.
Spacetime in CST is assumed to have a fundamental atomicity or discreteness,
and is replaced by a locally finite poset, the causal set. In order to obtain a
well defined continuum approximation, the causal set must possess the requisite
intrinsic topological and geometric properties that characterise a continuum
spacetime in the large. The continuum approximation thus sets the stage for the
study of topology in CST. We review the status of causal set topology and
present some new results relating poset and spacetime topologies. The hope is
that in the process, some of the ideas and questions arising from CST will be
made accessible to the larger community of computer scientists and
mathematicians working on posets.
