In a previous paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 014501 (2003)], the mechanism of
"revolving rivers" for sandpile formation is reported: as a steady stream of
dry sand is poured onto a horizontal surface, a pile forms which has a river of
sand on one side owing from the apex of the pile to the edge of the base. For
small piles the river is steady, or continuous. For larger piles, it becomes
intermittent. In this paper we establish experimentally the "dynamical phase
diagram" of the continuous and intermittent regimes, and give further details
of the piles topography, improving the previous kinematic model to describe it
and shedding further light on the mechanisms of river formation. Based on
experiments in Hele-Shaw cells, we also propose that a simple dimensionality
reduction argument can explain the transition between the continuous and
intermittent dynamics.
