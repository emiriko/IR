We probe through magnetization and resistivity measurements a kinetically
arrested glass-like but long-range ordered magnetic state. The transformation
kinetics of the magnetic field-temperature induced broad first-order transition
from ferromagnetic-metallic (FMM) to antiferromagnetic-insulating (AFI) state
gets hindered at low temperature in a La(0.5)Ca(0.5)MnO3 sample. A fraction of
high-temperature FMM phase persists to the lowest temperature, albeit as a
non-ergodic state. We present a phenomenology for this glass-like but
long-range order FMM phase which devitrifies on heating and converts to
equilibrium AFI phase. The residual kinetically arrested FMM phase can be
`recrystallized' to AFI state by annealing and more efficiently by successive
annealing, presumably by heterogeneous nucleation. This glass-like state shows
a stimulating feature that when the fraction of glass is larger the
`recrystallization' is easier.
