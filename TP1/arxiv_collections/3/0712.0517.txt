Quantum key distribution is among the foremost applications of quantum
mechanics, both in terms of fundamental physics and as a technology on the
brink of commercial deployment. Starting from principal schemes and initial
proofs of unconditional security for perfect systems, much effort has gone into
providing secure schemes which can cope with numerous experimental
imperfections unavoidable in real world implementations. In this paper, we
provide a comparison of various schemes and protocols. We analyse their
efficiency and performance when implemented with imperfect physical components.
We consider how experimental faults are accounted for using effective
parameters. We compare various protocols and provide guidelines as to which
components propose best advances when being improved.
