In this paper, we propose an adaptive algorithm that iteratively updates both
the weights and component parameters of a mixture importance sampling density
so as to optimise the importance sampling performances, as measured by an
entropy criterion. The method is shown to be applicable to a wide class of
importance sampling densities, which includes in particular mixtures of
multivariate Student t distributions. The performances of the proposed scheme
are studied on both artificial and real examples, highlighting in particular
the benefit of a novel Rao-Blackwellisation device which can be easily
incorporated in the updating scheme.
