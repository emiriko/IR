Recently, there has been a lot of interest in the integration of Description
Logics and rules on the Semantic Web.We define guarded hybrid knowledge bases
(or g-hybrid knowledge bases) as knowledge bases that consist of a Description
Logic knowledge base and a guarded logic program, similar to the DL+log
knowledge bases from (Rosati 2006). G-hybrid knowledge bases enable an
integration of Description Logics and Logic Programming where, unlike in other
approaches, variables in the rules of a guarded program do not need to appear
in positive non-DL atoms of the body, i.e. DL atoms can act as guards as well.
Decidability of satisfiability checking of g-hybrid knowledge bases is shown
for the particular DL DLRO, which is close to OWL DL, by a reduction to guarded
programs under the open answer set semantics. Moreover, we show
2-EXPTIME-completeness for satisfiability checking of such g-hybrid knowledge
bases. Finally, we discuss advantages and disadvantages of our approach
compared with DL+log knowledge bases.
