We analyze the phase diagram of a quantum particle confined to a finite
chain, subject to a dissipative environment described by an Ohmic spectral
function. Analytical and numerical techniques are employed to explore both the
perturbative and non-perturbative regime of the model. For small dissipation
the coupling to the environment leads to a narrowing of the density
distribution, and to a displacement towards the center of the array of
accessible sites. For large values of the dissipation, we find a phase
transition to a doubly degenerate phase which reflects the formation of an
inhomogeneous effective potential within the array.
