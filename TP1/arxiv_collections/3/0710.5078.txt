Doppler laser cooling of a three-level ladder system using two near-resonant
laser fields is analyzed in the case of the intermediate level being metastable
while the upper level is short-lived. Analytical as well as numerical results
for e.g. obtainable scattering rates and achievable temperatures are presented.
When appropriate, comparisons with two-level single photon Doppler laser
cooling is made. These results are relevant to recent experimental Doppler
laser cooling investigations addressing intercombination lines in alkali-earth
metal atoms and quadrupole transitions in alkali-earth metal ions.
