We investigate an extension to the phase shift formalism for calculating
one-loop determinants. This extension is motivated by requirements of the
computation of Z-string quantum energies in D=3+1 dimensions. A subtlety that
seems to imply that the vacuum polarization diagram in this formalism is
(erroneously) finite is thoroughly investigated.
