A special vapour cell has been built, that allows the measurement of the
atom-surface van der Waals interaction exerted by a CaF2 window at the
interface with Cs vapour. Mechanical and thermal fragility of fluoride windows
make common designs of vapour cells unpractical, so that we have developed an
all-sapphire sealed cell with an internal CaF2 window. Although impurities were
accidentally introduced when filling-up the prototype cell, leading to a
line-broadening and shift, the selective reflection spectrum on the Cs D1 line
(894 nm) makes apparent the weak van der Waals surface interaction. The
uncertainties introduced by the effects of these impurities in the van der
Waals measurement are nearly eliminated when comparing the selective reflection
signal at the CaF2 interface of interest, and at a sapphire window of the same
cell. The ratio of the interaction respectively exerted by a sapphire interface
and a CaF2 interface is found to be 0.55 $\pm$ 0.25, in good agreement with the
theoretical evaluation of ~0.67.
