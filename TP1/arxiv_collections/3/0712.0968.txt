We show that grafting any fixed hyperbolic surface defines a homeomorphism
from the space of measured laminations to Teichmuller space, complementing a
result of Scannell-Wolf on grafting by a fixed lamination. This result is used
to study the relationship between the complex-analytic and geometric coordinate
systems for the space of complex projective ($\CP^1$) structures on a surface.
  We also study the rays in Teichmuller space associated to the grafting
coordinates, obtaining estimates for extremal and hyperbolic length functions
and their derivatives along these grafting rays.
