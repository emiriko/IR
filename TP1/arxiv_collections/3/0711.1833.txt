A novel formulation to dope organic liquid scintillators (OLS) with indium at
concentrations up to 10% is presented: it is based on specific indium
carboxylate compounds adequately synthesized. The produced In-OLS has been
characterized: it has light yield 8500 ph/MeV at indium concentration 5.5% and
light attenuation length of 2,5 m at wavelength of 430 nm. The scintillator
properties were stable during all time of investigation (~ 1 years). The
produced In-OLS is compared to other In-OLS formulations and shows superior
performances. The developed methodic to metal dope OLS can be easily extended
to other metals as Gd, Nd, Cd.
