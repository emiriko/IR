We study the phase space dynamics of multi--dimensional symplectic maps,
using the method of the Generalized Alignment Index (GALI). In particular, we
investigate the behavior of the GALI for a system of N=3 coupled standard maps
and show that it provides an efficient criterion for rapidly distinguishing
between regular and chaotic motion.
