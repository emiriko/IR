In a previous report, we have shown that the rhodium lattice consisting of
resonant nuclei is an ideal photonic crystal in nature. Plenty of extraordinary
observations are attributed to the collective down conversion of the multipolar
nuclear transition; in particular the spontaneous open up of photonic band gap.
Emissions of directionality depending on the macroscopic geometry manifest that
the standing wave is global in the polycrystalline sample. In this work,
further observations of the directional emissions are summarized. By applying
an external magnetic field at room temperature, not only the predicted
macroscopic nuclear polarization but also its strong directionality are
demonstrated. The standing wave lasts for more than hundred hours at room
temperature in the single crystal despite its natural half-life of one hour.
The so-called nuclear Raman Effect between two M4 transitions of 193mIr and
195mPt and the E3 transition of 103mRh is discovered, which gives the brand new
aspects to detect gravitational waves.
