The meson-cloud model of the nucleon consisting of a system of three valence
quarks surrounded by a meson cloud is applied to study the electroweak
structure of the proton and neutron. The electroweak nucleon form factors are
calculated within a light-front approach, by obtaining an overall good
description of the experimental data. Charge densities as a function of the
transverse distance with respect to the direction of the three-momentum
transfer are also discussed.
