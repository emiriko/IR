The correlated behavior of electrons determines the structure and optical
properties of molecules, semiconductor and other systems. Valuable information
on these correlations is provided by measuring the response to femtosecond
laser pulses, which probe the very short time period during which the excited
particles remain correlated. The interpretation of four-wave-mixing techniques,
commonly used to study the energy levels and dynamics of many-electron systems,
is complicated by many competing effects and overlapping resonances. Here we
propose a coherent optical technique, specifically designed to provide a
background-free probe for electronic correlations in many-electron systems. The
proposed signal pulse is generated only when the electrons are correlated,
which gives rise to an extraordinary sensitivity. The peak pattern in
two-dimensional plots, obtained by displaying the signal vs. two frequencies
conjugated to two pulse delays, provides a direct visualization and specific
signatures of the many-electron wavefunctions.
