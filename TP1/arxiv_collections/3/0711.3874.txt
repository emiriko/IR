A viscous thread falling from a nozzle onto a surface exhibits the famous
rope-coiling effect, in which the thread buckles to form loops. If the surface
is replaced by a belt moving with speed $U$, the rotational symmetry of the
buckling instability is broken and a wealth of interesting states are observed
[See S. Chiu-Webster and J. R. Lister, J. Fluid Mech., {\bf 569}, 89 (2006)].
We experimentally studied this "fluid mechanical sewing machine" in a new, more
precise apparatus. As $U$ is reduced, the steady catenary thread bifurcates
into a meandering state in which the thread displacements are only transverse
to the motion of the belt. We measured the amplitude and frequency $\omega$ of
the meandering close to the bifurcation. For smaller $U$, single-frequency
meandering bifurcates to a two-frequency "figure eight" state, which contains a
significant $2\omega$ component and parallel as well as transverse
displacements. This eventually reverts to single-frequency coiling at still
smaller $U$. More complex, highly hysteretic states with additional frequencies
are observed for larger nozzle heights. We propose to understand this zoology
in terms of the generic amplitude equations appropriate for resonant
interactions between two oscillatory modes with frequencies $\omega$ and
$2\omega$. The form of the amplitude equations captures both the axisymmetry of
the U=0 coiling state and the symmetry-breaking effects induced by the moving
belt.
