In this paper, we give complete classifications of linear $\infty$-harmonic
maps between Euclidean and Heisenberg spaces, between Nil and Sol spaces. We
also classify all $\infty$-harmonic linear endomorphisms of Sol space and show
that there is a subgroup of $\infty$-harmonic linear automorphisms in the group
of linear automorphisms of Sol space.
