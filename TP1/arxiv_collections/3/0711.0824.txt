We consider modified dispersion relations in quantum field theory on curved
space-time. Such relations, despite breaking the local Lorentz invariance at
high energy, are considered in several phenomenological approaches to quantum
gravity. Their existence involves a modification of the formalism of quantum
field theory, starting from the problem of finding the scalar Green's functions
up to the renormalization of various quantum expectation values. In this work
we consider a simple example of such modifications, in the case of ultra-static
metric. We show how to overcome the lack of Lorentz invariance by introducing a
preferred frame, with respect to which we can express the Green's functions as
an integral over all frequencies of a space-dependent function. The latter can
be expanded in momentum space, and by integrating over all frequencies, we
finally find the expansion of the Green's function up to four derivatives of
the metric tensor. The relation with the proper-time formalism is also
discussed.
