A possibility and properties of spontaneous magnetization in quark matter are
investigated. Magnetic susceptibility is evaluated within Fermi liquid theory,
taking into account of the screening effect of gluons. Spin wave in the
polarized quark matter, as the Nambu-Goldstone mode, is formulated by way of
the coherent-state path integral.
