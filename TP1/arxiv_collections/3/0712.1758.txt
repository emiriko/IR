We analyze two recent reactions of Belle, producing $D\bar D$ and $D\bar D^*$
states that have an enhancement of the invariant $D\bar D$, $D\bar D^*$ mass
distribution close to threshold, from the point of view that they might be
indicative of the existence of a hidden charm scalar and an axial vector meson
states below $D\bar D$ or $D\bar D^*$ thresholds, respectively. We conclude
that the data is compatible with the existing prediction of a hidden charm
scalar meson with mass around 3700 MeV, though other possibilities cannot be
discarded. The peak seen in the $D\bar D^*$ spectrum above threshold is,
however, unlikely to be due to a threshold enhancement produced by the
presence, below threshold, of the hidden charm axial vector meson X(3872).
