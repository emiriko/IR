We describe the evolution of a paraxial electromagnetic wave characterizing
by a non-uniform polarization distribution with singularities and propagating
in a weakly anisotropic medium. Our approach is based on the Stokes vector
evolution equation applied to a non-uniform initial polarization field. In the
case of a homogeneous medium, this equation is integrated analytically. This
yields a 3-dimensional distribution of the polarization parameters containing
singularities, i.e. C-lines of circular polarization and L-surfaces of linear
polarization. The general theory is applied to specific examples of the
unfolding of a vectorial vortex in birefringent and dichroic media.
