Magnetic hysteresis loops below 300 mK on single crystals of the Mn(II) -
nitronyl nitroxide free radical chain (Mn(hfac)_2({\it R})-3MLNN) present
abrupt reversals of the magnetization, or avalanches. We show that, below 200
mK, the avalanches occur at a constant field, independent of the sample and so
propose that this avalanche field is an intrinsic property. We compare this
field to the energy barrier existing in the sample and conclude that the
avalanches are provoked by multiple nucleation of domain-walls along the
chains. The different avalanche field observed in the zero field cooled
magnetization curves suggests that the avalanche mechanisms are related to the
competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order in this compound.
