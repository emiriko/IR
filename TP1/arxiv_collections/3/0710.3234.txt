The SU(2) gluon propagator in Landau gauge is studied on the lattice. Our
gauge fixing procedure employs simulated annealing and Z(2)-flips. It finds
higher maxima of the gauge functional compared with those obtained with the
standard overrelaxation and leads to systematic deviations of the gluon
propagator in the infrared region. In particular, finite-size effects for
lattice sizes from (1.7 fm)^4 up to (6.5 fm)^4 become weak. The propagator
shows a plateau at p \approx 300 MeV.
