We construct frieze patterns of type D_N with entries which are numbers of
matchings between vertices and triangles of corresponding triangulations of a
punctured disc. For triangulations corresponding to orientations of the Dynkin
diagram of type D_N, we show that the numbers in the pattern can be interpreted
as specialisations of cluster variables in the corresponding Fomin-Zelevinsky
cluster algebra.
