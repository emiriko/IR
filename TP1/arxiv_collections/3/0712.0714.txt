The explicit computation of arXiv:hep-th/0112157 and arXiv:hep-th/0108106
prove that all the cubic alpha-prime corrections to the backgrounds composed of
metric, NS two-form and dilaton can not be written in term of the modified
Riemann tensor where the field strength of the NS two form plays the role of
torsion. So the outcome of this writing has been trivial.
