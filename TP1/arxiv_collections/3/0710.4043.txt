Detailed magnetic properties of the compound Sr2YbRuO6 are presented here.
The compound belongs to the family of double perovskites forming a monoclinic
structure. Magnetization meas-urements reveal clear evidence for two components
of magnetic ordering aligned opposite to each other, leading to a magnetization
reversal, compensation temperature (T* = 34 K) and neg-ative magnetization at
low temperatures and low magnetic fields. Heat capacity measurements
corroborate the presence of two components in the magnetic ordering and a
noticeable third anomaly at low temperatures (~15 K) which cannot be attributed
the Schottky effect. The calcu-lated magnetic entropy is substantially lower
than that expected for the ground states of the or-dered moments of Ru5+ and
Yb3+, indicating the presence of large crystal field effects and/ or
in-complete magnetic ordering and/or magnetic frustrations well above the
magnetic ordering. An attempt is made to explain the magnetization reversal
within the frameworks of available models.
