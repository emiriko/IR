The Lorentz nature of confinement in a heavy-light quarkonium is
investigated. It is demonstrated that an effective scalar interaction is
generated selfconsistently as a result of chiral symmetry breaking, and this
effective scalar interaction is responsible for the QCD string formation
between the quark and the antiquark.
