We measure the time dependence of the ratio of decay rates for the rare decay
D0->K+pi- to the Cabibbo-favored decay D0->K-pi+. We use a signal of 12.7 x10^3
D0->K+pi decays with proper decay times between 0.75 and 10 mean D0 lifetimes.
The data sample was recorded with the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron
and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 1.5 fb-1 of p-pbar collisions at
sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV. We search for D0-D0bar mixing and measure the mixing
parameters to be Rd = (3.04 +/- 0.55) x10^{-3}, y' = (8.5 +/- 7.6) x10^{-3},
and x'^2 = (-0.12 +/- 0.35) x10^{-3}. We report Bayesian probability contours
in the x'^2-y' plane and find that the data are inconsistent with the no-mixing
hypothesis with a probability equivalent to 3.8 Gaussian standard deviations.
