The thirty years old programme of Griffiths and Harris of understanding
higher-dimensional analogues of Poncelet-type problems and synthetic approach
to higher genera addition theorems has been settled and completed in this
paper. Starting with the observation of the billiard nature of some classical
constructions and configurations, we construct the billiard algebra, that is a
group structure on the set T of lines in $R^d$ simultaneously tangent to d-1
quadrics from a given confocal family. Using this tool, the related results of
Reid, Donagi and Knoerrer are further developed, realized and simplified. We
derive a fundamental property of T: any two lines from this set can be obtained
from each other by at most d-1 billiard reflections at some quadrics from the
confocal family. We introduce two hierarchies of notions: s-skew lines in T and
s-weak Poncelet trajectories, s = -1,0,...,d-2. The interrelations between
billiard dynamics, linear subspaces of intersections of quadrics and
hyperelliptic Jacobians developed in this paper enabled us to obtain
higher-dimensional and higher-genera generalizations of several classical genus
1 results: the Cayley's theorem, the Weyr's theorem, the Griffiths-Harris
theorem and the Darboux theorem.
