A construction method for duplex cage structures with icosahedral sym- metry
made out of single-stranded DNA molecules is presented and applied to an
icosidodecahedral cage. It is shown via a mixture of analytic and computer
techniques that there exist realisations of this graph in terms of two circular
DNA molecules. These blueprints for the organisation of a cage structure with a
noncrystallographic symmetry may assist in the design of containers made from
DNA for applications in nanotechnology.
