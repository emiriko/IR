This talk is based on results obtained for masses and wave functions of heavy
quarkonia in a light-front Hamiltonian formulation of QCD with just one flavor
of quarks using an ansatz for the mass-gap for gluons. Since the calculated
spectra compare reasonably well with data, some further steps one can make are
discussed.
