This is a review article about the most recent developments on the field of
neutrino mass. The first part of the review introduces the idea of neutrino
masses and mixing angles, summarizes the most recent experimental data then
discusses the experimental prospects and challenges in this area. The second
part of the review discusses the implications of these results for particle
physics and cosmology, including the origin of neutrino mass, the see-saw
mechanism and sequential dominance, and large extra dimensions and cosmology.
