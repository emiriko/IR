To obtain an exact solution of a four-body system containing two quarks and
two antiquarks interacting through two-body terms is a cumbersome task that has
been tackled with more or less success during the last decades. We present an
exact method for the study of four-quark systems based on the hyperspherical
harmonics formalism that allows us to solve it without resorting to further
approximations, like for instance the existence of diquark components. We apply
it to systems containing two heavy and two light quarks using different
quark-quark potentials. While $QQ\bar n \bar n$ states may be stable in nature,
the stability of $Q\bar Qn \bar n$ states would imply the existence of quark
correlations not taken into account by simple quark dynamical models.
