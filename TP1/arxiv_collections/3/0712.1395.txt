Within the framework of the Drude dispersive model, we predict an unusual
non-monotonous temperature dependence of the Casimir force for thin metal
films. For certain conditions, this force decreases with temperature due to the
decrease of the metallic conductivity, whereas the force increases at high
temperatures due to the increase of the thermal radiation pressure. We consider
the attraction of a film to: either (i) a bulk ideal metal with a planar
boundary, or (ii) a bulk metal sphere (lens). The experimental observation of
the predicted non-monotonous temperature dependence of the Casimir force can
put an end to the long-standing discussion on the role of the electron
relaxation in the Casimir effect.
