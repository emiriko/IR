In this paper, we prove the existence of two degrees of freedom that govern
the movement of light in an expanding universe. The use of the fractal manifold
model leads to reciprocal causality between variation of geometry and gravity,
which both play a complementary role in the universe architecture. This study
unravels new facts about the distribution of matter in the universe, and
provides a new interpretation of Dark Matter and Dark Energy.
