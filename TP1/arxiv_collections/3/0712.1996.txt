In the constraint database model, spatial and spatio-temporal data are stored
by boolean combinations of polynomial equalities and inequalities over the real
numbers. The relational calculus augmented with polynomial constraints is the
standard first-order query language for constraint databases. Although the
expressive power of this query language has been studied extensively, the
difficulty of the efficient evaluation of queries, usually involving some form
of quantifier elimination, has received considerably less attention. The
inefficiency of existing quantifier-elimination software and the intrinsic
difficulty of quantifier elimination have proven to be a bottle-neck for for
real-world implementations of constraint database systems. In this paper, we
focus on a particular query, called the \emph{alibi query}, that asks whether
two moving objects whose positions are known at certain moments in time, could
have possibly met, given certain speed constraints. This query can be seen as a
constraint database query and its evaluation relies on the elimination of a
block of three existential quantifiers. Implementations of general purpose
elimination algorithms are in the specific case, for practical purposes, too
slow in answering the alibi query and fail completely in the parametric case.
The main contribution of this paper is an analytical solution to the parametric
alibi query, which can be used to answer this query in the specific case in
constant time. We also give an analytic solution to the alibi query at a fixed
moment in time. The solutions we propose are based on geometric argumentation
and they illustrate the fact that some practical problems require creative
solutions, where at least in theory, existing systems could provide a solution.
