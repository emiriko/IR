Existing syntactic grammars of natural languages, even with a far from
complete coverage, are complex objects. Assessments of the quality of parts of
such grammars are useful for the validation of their construction. We evaluated
the quality of a grammar of French determiners that takes the form of a
recursive transition network. The result of the application of this local
grammar gives deeper syntactic information than chunking or information
available in treebanks. We performed the evaluation by comparison with a corpus
independently annotated with information on determiners. We obtained 86%
precision and 92% recall on text not tagged for parts of speech.
