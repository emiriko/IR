MEMS devices are typical systems where multiphysics simulations are
unavoidable. In this work, we present possible applications of 3-D
self-assembled SOI (Silicon-on-Insulator) MEMS such as, for instance, thermal
actuators and flow sensors. The numerical simulations of these microsystems are
presented. Structural and thermal parts have to be strongly coupled for
correctly describing the fabrication process and for simulating the behavior of
these 3-D SOI MEMS.
