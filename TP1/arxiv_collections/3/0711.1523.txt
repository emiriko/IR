Six-dimensional ionization cooling of muons is essential for muon colliders
and possibly beneficial for neutrino factories. An experiment to demonstrate
six-dimensional ionization cooling using practical apparatus is presented. It
exploits recent innovative ideas that may lead to six-dimensional muon-cooling
channels with emittance reduction approaching that needed for high-luminosity
muon colliders.
