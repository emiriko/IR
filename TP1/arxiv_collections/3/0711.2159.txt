A generalized algebra of quantum observables, depending on extra dimensional
constants, is considered. Some limiting forms of the algebra are investigated
and their possible applications to the descriptions of interactions of
fundamental particles are proposed. A relation between current and constituent
quark masses is found using a modified quark equation of Dirac-Gursey-Lee type
and restrictions on the results of simultaneous measurements of momentum
components are pointed out.
