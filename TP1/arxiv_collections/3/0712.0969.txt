Neutral Ytterbium (YbI) and singly ionized Ytterbium (YbII) is widely used in
experiments in quantum optics, metrology and quantum information science. We
report on the investigation of isotope selective two-photoionisation of YbI
that allows for efficient loading of ion traps with YbII. Results are presented
on two-colour (399 nm and 369 nm) and single-colour (399 nm) photoionisation
and their efficiency is compared to electron impact ionisation. Nearly
deterministic loading of a desired number of YbII ions into a linear Paul trap
is demonstrated.
