Higgs boson productions at the LHC will serve as a sensitive probe of various
little Higgs models. In this work we comparatively study two littlest Higgs
models with different T-parity constructions through examining their effects in
three production processes of the Higgs boson at the LHC, namely the
productions of a single Higgs, a Higgs-pair, as well as a Higgs boson
associated with a pair of top and anti-top quarks. The two models are
characterized by predicting a top partner canceling the Higgs mass quadratic
divergence contributed by the top quark with even and odd T-parity,
respectively. We find that both models can alter the SM cross sections sizably
and their corrections also differ significantly. Therefore, the Higgs boson
productions at the LHC may shed some light on these two models or even
distinguish them.
