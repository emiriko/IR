By making use of previous analysis of CNI for pp and pC scattering, the
spin-flip factor for np scattering is determined as a function of energy and
then used to calculate the p He3 asymmetry A_N(s)' arising in p He 3 elastic
scattering. It is found to be comparable to A_N(s) for pp scattering, but of
the opposite sign. It seems that this method could be a practical for measuring
the polarization of a He3 beam.
