We consider single particle Schrodinger operators with a gap in the en ergy
spectrum. We construct a complete, orthonormal basis function set for the inv
ariant space corresponding to the spectrum below the spectral gap, which are
exponentially localized a round a set of closed surfaces of monotonically
increasing sizes. Estimates on the exponential dec ay rate and a discussion of
the geometry of these surfaces is included.
