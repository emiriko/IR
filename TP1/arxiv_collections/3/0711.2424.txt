Exact solutions of traversable wormholes were recently found under the
assumption of spherical symmetry and the existence of a non-static conformal
symmetry. In this paper, we verify that in the case of the conformally
symmetric spacetimes with a non-static vector field generating the symmetry,
the conformal factor $\psi$ can be physically interpreted in terms of a
measurable quantity, namely, the tangential velocity of a massive test particle
moving in a stable circular orbit in the spacetime. Physical properties of the
rotational velocity of test particles and of the redshift of radiation emitted
by ultra-relativistic particles rotating around these hypothetical general
relativistic objects are further discussed. Finally, specific characteristics
and properties of gravitational bremsstrahlung emitted by charged particles in
geodesic motion in conformally symmetric wormhole geometries are also explored.
