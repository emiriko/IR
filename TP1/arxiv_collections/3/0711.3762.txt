Quantum walks with long-range steps $R^{-\gamma}$ ($R$ being the distance
between sites) on a discrete line behave in similar ways for all $\gamma\geq2$.
This is in contrast to classical random walks, which for $\gamma >3$ belong to
a different universality class than for $\gamma \leq 3$. We show that the
average probabilities to be at the initial site after time $t$ as well as the
mean square displacements are of the same functional form for quantum walks
with $\gamma=2$, 4, and with nearest neighbor steps. We interpolate this result
to arbitrary $\gamma\geq2$.
