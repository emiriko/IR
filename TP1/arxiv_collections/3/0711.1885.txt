The electronic and vibrational contributions to the static dipole
polarizability of C70 fullerene are determined using the finite-field method
within the density functional formalism. Large polarized Gaussian basis sets
augmented with diffuse functions are used and the exchange-correlation effects
are described within the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient
approximation (PBE-GGA). The calculated polarizability of C70 is 103
Angstrom^3, in excellent agreement with the experimental value of 102
Angstrom^3, and is completely determined by the electronic part, vibrational
contribution being negligible. The ratio of polarizabilities of C70 and C60 is
1.26. The comparison of polarizability calculated with only local terms (LDA)
in the PBE functional to that obtained with PBE-GGA shows that LDA is
sufficient to determine the static dipole polarizability of C70.
