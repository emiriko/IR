It is shown that the combinatorics of commutation relations is well suited
for analyzing the convergence rate of certain Markov chains. Examples studied
include random walk on irreducible representations, a local random walk on
partitions whose stationary distribution is the Ewens distribution, and some
birth-death chains.
