We study slip boundary conditions for simple fluids at surfaces with
nanoscale chemical heterogeneities. Using a perturbative approach, we examine
the flow of a Newtonian fluid far from a surface described by a heterogeneous
Navier slip boundary condition. In the far-field, we obtain expressions for an
effective slip boundary condition in certain limiting cases. These expressions
are compared to numerical solutions which show they work well when applied in
the appropriate limits. The implications for experimental measurements and for
the design of surfaces that exhibit large slip lengths are discussed.
