We study adiabatic population transfer between discrete positions. Being
closely related to STIRAP in optical systems, this transport is coherent and
robust against variations of experimental parameters. Thanks to these
properties the scheme is a promising candidate for transport of quantum
information in quantum computing. We study the effects of spatially registered
noise sources on the quantum transport and in particular model Markovian
decoherence via non-local coupling to nearby quantum point contacts which serve
as information readouts. We find that the rate of decoherence experienced by a
spatial superposition initially grows with spatial separation but surprisingly
then plateaus. In addition we include non-Markovian effects due to couplings to
nearby two level systems and we find that although the population transport
exhibits robustness in the presence of both types of noise sources, the
transport of a spatial superposition exhibits severe fragility.
