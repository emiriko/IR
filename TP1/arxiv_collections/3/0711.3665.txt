Ideas from deformation quantization applied to algebras with one generator
lead to methods to treat a nonlinear flat connection. It provides us elements
of algebras to be parallel sections. The moduli space of the parallel sections
is studied as an example of bundle-like objects with discordant (sogo)
transition functions, which suggests us to treat movable branching
singularities.
