We have performed MD simulations of a highly charged colloid in a solution of
3:1 and additional 1:1 salt. The dependency of the colloid's inverted charge on
the concentration of the additional 1:1 salt has been studied. Most theories
predict, that the inverted charge increases when the concentration of
monovalent salt grows, up to what is called "giant overcharging", while
experiments and simulational studies observe the opposite. Our simulations
agree with the experimental findings and shed light onto the weaknesses of the
theories.
