OBJECTIVE: The TER system is a robot-based tele-echography system allowing
remote ultrasound examination. The specialist moves a mock-up of the ultrasound
probe at the master site, and the robot reproduces the movements of the real
probe, which sends back ultrasound images and force feedback. This tool could
be used to perform ultrasound examinations in small health care centers or from
isolated sites. The objective of this study was to prove, under real
conditions, the feasibility and reliability of the TER system in detecting
abdominal aortic and iliac aneurysms. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients were
included in 2 centers in Brest and Grenoble, France. The remote examination was
compared with the reference standard, the bedside examination, for aorta and
iliac artery diameter measurement, detection and description of aneurysms,
detection of atheromatosis, the duration of the examination, and acceptability.
RESULTS: All aneurysms (8) were detected by both techniques as intramural
thrombosis and extension to the iliac arteries. The interobserver correlation
coefficient was 0.982 (P < .0001) for aortic diameters. The rate of concordance
between 2 operators in evaluating atheromatosis was 84% +/- 11% (95% confidence
interval). CONCLUSIONS: Our study on 58 patients suggests that the TER system
could be a reliable, acceptable, and effective robot-based system for
performing remote abdominal aortic ultrasound examinations. Research is
continuing to improve the equipment for general abdominal use.
