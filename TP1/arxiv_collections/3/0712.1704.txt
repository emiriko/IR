Symmetry and spin dephasing of in (110)-grown GaAs quantum wells (QWs) are
investigated applying magnetic field induced photogalvanic effect (MPGE) and
time-resolved Kerr rotation. We show that MPGE provides a tool to probe the
symmetry of (110)-grown quantum wells. The photocurrent is only observed for
asymmetric structures but vanishes for symmetric QWs. Applying Kerr rotation we
prove that in the latter case the spin relaxation time is maximal, therefore
these structures set upper limit of spin dephasing in GaAs QWs. We also
demonstrate that structure inversion asymmetry can be controllably tuned to
zero by variation of delta-doping layer position.
