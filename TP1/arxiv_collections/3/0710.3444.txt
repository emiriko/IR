Several parameters characterizing the strangeness content of the nucleon have
been calculated in the chiral constituent quark model with configuration mixing
(\chiCQM_{config}) which is known to provide a satisfactory explanation of the
``proton spin problem'' and related issues. In particular, we have calculated
the strange spin polarization \Delta s, the strangeness contribution to the
weak axial vector couplings \Delta_8 etc., strangeness contribution to the
magnetic moments \mu(p)^s etc., the strange quark flavor fraction f_s, the
strangeness dependent quark ratios \frac{2 \bar s}{u+d} and \frac{2 \bar
s}{\bar u+\bar d} etc.. Our results show in general excellent agreement with
the recent experimental observations.
