Single-electron occupation is an essential component to measurement and
manipulation of spin in quantum dots, capabilities that are important for
quantum information processing. Si/SiGe is of interest for semiconductor spin
qubits, but single-electron quantum dots have not yet been achieved in this
system. We report the fabrication and measurement of a top-gated quantum dot
occupied by a single electron in a Si/SiGe heterostructure. Transport through
the quantum dot is directly correlated with charge-sensing from an integrated
quantum point contact, and this charge-sensing is used to confirm
single-electron occupancy in the quantum dot.
