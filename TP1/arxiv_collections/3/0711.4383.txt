We present results from ab initio calculations of the mechanical properties
of the rhombohedral phase (beta) of vanadium metal reported in recent
experiments, and other predicted high-pressure phases (gamma and bcc), focusing
on properties relevant to dynamic experiments. We find that the volume change
associated with these transitions is small: no more than 0.15% (for beta -
gamma). Calculations of the single crystal and polycrystal elastic moduli
(stress-strain coefficients) reveal a remarkably small discontinuity in the
shear modulus and other elastic properties across the phase transitions even at
zero temperature where the transitions are first order.
