We provide a covariant derivation of plasma physics coupled to gravitation by
utilizing the 3+1 formulation of general relativity, including a discussion of
the Lorentz force law. We then reduce the system to the spherically symmetric
case and show that all regions of the spacetime can be represented in a single
coordinate system, thus revoking the need for junction conditions. We further
show that the region exterior to the collapsing region is naturally described
by the charged Vaidya spacetime in non-null coordinates.
