Systematic observations of student gestures can not only fill in gaps in
students' verbal expressions, but can also offer valuable information about
student ideas, including their source, their novelty to the speaker, and their
construction in real time. This paper provides a review of the research in
gesture analysis that is most relevant to physics education researchers and
illustrates gesture analysis for the purpose of better understanding student
thinking about physics.
