In this paper, we present a scheme to generate an entangled coherent state by
considering a three-level \Lambda - type atom interacting with a two-mode
cavity driven by classical fields. The two-mode entangled coherent state can be
obtained under large detuning conditions. Considering the cavity decay, an
analytical solution is deduced.
