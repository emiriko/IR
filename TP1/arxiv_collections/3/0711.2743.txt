A complete calculation of the corrections to pion-deuteron scattering length
up to order $\chi^{3/2}$ with $\chi=m_{\pi}/M_{N}$ is performed. The
calculation includes the dispersive contributions and corrections due to the
explicit treatment of the $\Delta$ resonance. s-wave pion-nucleon scattering
parameters are extracted from a combined analysis of modern experimental data.
