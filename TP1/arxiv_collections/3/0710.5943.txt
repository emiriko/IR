We present a communication protocol for the erasure channel assisted by
backward classical communication, which achieves a significantly better rate
than the best prior result. In addition, we prove an upper bound for the
capacity of the channel. The upper bound is smaller than the capacity of the
erasure channel when it is assisted by two-way classical communication. Thus,
we prove the separation between quantum capacities assisted by backward
classical communication and two-way classical communication.
