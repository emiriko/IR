The impact of environmental fluctuation on species diversity is studied with
a model of the evolutionary ecology of microorganisms. We show that
environmental fluctuation induces evolutionary branching and assures the
consequential coexistence of multiple species. Pairwise invasibility analysis
is applied to illustrate the speciation process. We also discuss how
fluctuation affects species diversity.
