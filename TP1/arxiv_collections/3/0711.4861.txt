We use effective magnetic SU(N) pure gauge theory with cutoff M and fixed
gauge coupling g_m to calculate non-perturbative magnetic properties of the
deconfined phase of SU(N) Yang-Mills theory. We obtain the response to an
external closed loop of electric current by reinterpreting and regulating the
calculation of the one loop effective potential in Yang-Mills theory. This
effective potential gives rise to a color magnetic charge density, the
counterpart in the deconfined phase of color magnetic currents introduced in
effective dual superconductor theories of the confined phase via magnetically
charged Higgs fields. The resulting spatial Wilson loop has area law behavior.
Using values of M and g_m determined in the confined phase, we find SU(3)
spatial string tensions compatible with lattice simulations in the temperature
interval 1.5T_c < T < 2.5T_c. Use of the effective theory to analyze
experiments on heavy ion collisions will provide applications and further tests
of these ideas.
