A one-coordinate gaseous detector of soft X-ray photons for wide-angle X-ray
scattering (WAXS) studies is being developed. The detector operates in counting
mode and is based on multi-stage Gas Electron Multiplier(GEM). Full size
detector is assembled and has 67 degrees aperture with 350mm distance to the
source, readout multi-strip structure with 2048 strips at 0.2mm pitch and is
partially equipped with readout electronics in the central part. Main
parameters of the detector have been measured with 8keV X-ray beam at VEPP-3
synchrotron ring. Spatial resolution of 470 um (FWHM) has been demonstrated
that will allow to distinguish diffraction spots at 0.1 degrees.
