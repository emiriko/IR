We present a mini-review on charm spectroscopy at the BaBar experiment. We
first report on the $c\bar{s}$ meson spectrum, and present precise measurements
of the $D_{s1}(2536)$ meson as well as the properties of the many new states
discovered since 2003 ($D_{s0}^*(2317)$, $D_{s1}(2460)$, $D_{sJ}^*(2860)$, and
$D_{sJ}(2700)$ mesons). We then discuss about charmed baryons observed recently
in the BaBar experiment: $\Omega_c^0$ and $\Omega_c^{*0}$ $css$ baryons,
$\Lambda_c(2940)^+$ $udc$ baryon and the $\Xi_c$ $usc/dsc$ baryons.
