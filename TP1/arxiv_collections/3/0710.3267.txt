This is a collection of examples showing how the GAP system can be used to
compute information about the probabilistic generation of finite almost simple
groups. It includes all examples that were needed for the computational results
in the paper "Probabilistic generation of finite simple groups, II" by Thomas
Breuer, Robert M. Guralnick, and William M. Kantor.
  The purpose of this writeup is twofold. On the one hand, the computations are
documented this way. On the other hand, the GAP code shown for the examples can
be used as test input for automatic checking of the data and the functions
used.
