Using a microscopic many-particle theory, we propose all-optical switching in
planar semiconductor microcavities where a weak beam switches a stronger
signal. Based on four-wave-mixing instabilities, the general scheme is a
semiconductor adaptation of a recently demonstrated switch in an atomic vapor
[Dawes et al., Science 308, 672 (2005)].
