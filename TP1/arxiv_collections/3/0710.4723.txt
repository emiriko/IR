This paper reports a novel simulation methodology for analysis and prediction
of substrate noise impact on analog / RF circuits taking into account the role
of the parasitic resistance of the on-chip interconnect in the impact
mechanism. This methodology allows investigation of the role of the separate
devices (also parasitic devices) in the analog / RF circuit in the overall
impact. This way is revealed which devices have to be taken care of (shielding,
topology change) to protect the circuit against substrate noise. The developed
methodology is used to analyze impact of substrate noise on a 3 GHz LC-tank
Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) designed in a high-ohmic 0.18 $\mu$m 1PM6
CMOS technology. For this VCO (in the investigated frequency range from DC to
15 MHz) impact is mainly caused by resistive coupling of noise from the
substrate to the non-ideal on-chip ground interconnect, resulting in analog
ground bounce and frequency modulation. Hence, the presented test-case reveals
the important role of the on-chip interconnect in the phenomenon of substrate
noise impact.
