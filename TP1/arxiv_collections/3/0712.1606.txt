We present a computer simulation model of Wheeler's delayed choice experiment
that is a one-to-one copy of an experiment reported recently (V. Jacques {\sl
et al.}, Science 315, 966 (2007)). The model is solely based on experimental
facts, satisfies Einstein's criterion of local causality and does not rely on
any concept of quantum theory. Nevertheless, the simulation model reproduces
the averages as obtained from the quantum theoretical description of Wheeler's
delayed choice experiment. Our results prove that it is possible to give a
particle-only description of Wheeler's delayed choice experiment which
reproduces the averages calculated from quantum theory and which does not defy
common sense.
