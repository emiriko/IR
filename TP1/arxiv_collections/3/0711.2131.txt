We perform the first study of treating b, c, and s quarks as Dirac fermions
in lattice QCD with exact chiral symmetry. On a 32^3 60 lattice with 1/a ~ 7.68
GeV, we compute point-to-point quark propagators, and measure the
time-correlation functions for mesons with quark contents b_bbar, c_bbar,
s_bbar, and c_cbar. The lowest-lying meson mass spectra, the pseudoscalar decay
constants, and the b and c quark masses are determined.
