We investigate medium-induced change of mass and width of J/psi and eta_c
across the phase transition in hot gluonic matter using QCD sum rules. In the
QCD sum rule approach, the medium effect on heavy quarkonia is induced by the
change of both scalar and twist-2 gluon condensates, whose temperature
dependences are extracted from the lattice calculations of energy density and
pressure. Although the stability of the operator product expansion side seems
to break down at T > 1.06Tc for the vector channel and T>1.04Tc for the
pseudoscalar channel, we find a sudden change of the spectral property across
the critical temperature Tc, which originates from an equally rapid change of
the scalar gluon condensate characterized by e-3p. By parameterizing the ground
state of the spectral density by the Breit-Wigner form, we find that for both
J/psi and eta_c, the masses suddenly decrease maximally by a few hundreds of
MeV and the widths broaden to ~100 MeV slightly above Tc. Implications for
recent and future heavy ion experiments are discussed.
  We also carry out a similar analysis for charmonia in nuclear matter, which
could serve as a testing ground for observing the precursor phenomena of the
QCD phase transition. We finally discuss the possibility of observing the mass
shift at nuclear matter at the FAIR project at GSI.
