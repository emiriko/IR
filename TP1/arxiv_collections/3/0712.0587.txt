We present results on the first excited states for the random-field Ising
model. These are based on an exact algorithm, with which we study the
excitation energies and the excitation sizes for two- and three-dimensional
random-field Ising systems with a Gaussian distribution of the random fields.
Our algorithm is based on an approach of Frontera and Vives which, in some
cases, does not yield the true first excited states. Using the corrected
algorithm, we find that the order-disorder phase transition for three
dimensions is visible via crossings of the excitations-energy curves for
different system sizes, while in two-dimensions these crossings converge to
zero disorder. Furthermore, we obtain in three dimensions a fractal dimension
of the excitations cluster of d_s=2.42(2). We also provide analytical droplet
arguments to understand the behavior of the excitation energies for small and
large disorder as well as close to the critical point.
