Bailey showed that the general pointwise forecasting for stationary and
ergodic time series has a negative solution. However, it is known that for
Markov chains the problem can be solved. Morvai showed that there is a stopping
time sequence $\{\lambda_n\}$ such that
$P(X_{\lambda_n+1}=1|X_0,...,X_{\lambda_n}) $ can be estimated from samples
$(X_0,...,X_{\lambda_n})$ such that the difference between the conditional
probability and the estimate vanishes along these stoppping times for all
stationary and ergodic binary time series. We will show it is not possible to
estimate the above conditional probability along a stopping time sequence for
all stationary and ergodic binary time series in a pointwise sense such that if
the time series turns out to be a Markov chain, the predictor will predict
eventually for all $n$.
