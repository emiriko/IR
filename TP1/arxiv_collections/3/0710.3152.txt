Building on work by Geiss-Leclerc-Schroer and by Buan-Iyama-Reiten-Scott we
investigate the link between certain cluster algebras with coefficients and
suitable 2-Calabi-Yau categories. These include the cluster-categories
associated with acyclic quivers and certain Frobenius subcategories of module
categories over preprojective algebras. Our motivation comes from the
conjectures formulated by Fomin and Zelevinsky in `Cluster algebras IV:
Coefficients'. We provide new evidence for Conjectures 5.4, 6.10, 7.2, 7.10 and
7.12 and show by an example that the statement of Conjecture 7.17 does not
always hold.
