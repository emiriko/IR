The analysis method proposed in Ref. \cite{rotival07a} is applied to
characterize halo properties in finite many-fermion systems. First, the
versatility of the method is highlighted by applying it to light and
medium-mass nuclei as well as to atom-positron and ion-positronium complexes.
Second, the dependence of nuclear halo properties on the characteristics of the
energy density functional used in self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov
calculations is studied. It is found that (a) the low-density behavior of the
pairing functional and the regularization/renormalization scheme must be chosen
coherently and with care to provide meaningful predictions, (b) the impact of
pairing correlations on halo properties is significant and is the result of two
competing effects, (c) the detailed characteristics of the pairing functional
has however only little importance, (d) halo properties depend significantly on
any ingredient of the energy density functional that influences the location of
single-particle levels; i.e. the effective mass, the tensor terms and the
saturation density of nuclear matter. The latter dependencies give insights to
how experimental data on medium-mass drip-line nuclei can be used in the
distant future to constrain some characteristics of the nuclear energy density
functional. Last but not least, large scale predictions of halos among all
spherical even-even nuclei are performed using specific sets of particle-hole
and particle-particle energy functionals. It is shown that halos in the ground
state of medium-mass nuclei will only be found at the very limit of neutron
stability and for a limited number of elements.
