In these lectures I will show some results obtained with the chiral unitary
approach applied to the photo and electroproduction of mesons. The results for
photoproduction of $\eta \pi^0 p$ and $K^0 \pi^0 \Sigma^+$, together with
related reactions will be shown, having with common denominator the excitation
of the $\Delta(1700)$ resonance which is one of those dynamically generated in
the chiral unitary approach. Then I will show results obtained for the $e^+ e^-
\to \phi f_0(980)$ reaction which reproduce the bulk of the data except for a
pronounced peak, giving support to a new mesonic resonance, X(2175). Results
will also be shown for the electromagnetic form factors of the $N^*(1535)$
resonance, also dynamically generated in this approach. Finally, I will show
some results on the photoproduction of the $\omega$ in nuclei, showing that
present experimental results claiming a shift of the $\omega$ mass in the
medium are tied to a particular choice of background and are not conclusive.
One the other hand, the same experimental results show unambiguously a huge
increase of the $\omega$ width in the nuclear medium.
