In this paper we have shall generalize Shearer's entropy inequality and its
recent extensions by Madiman and Tetali, and shall apply projection
inequalities to deduce extensions of some of the inequalities concerning sums
of sets of integers proved recently by Gyarmati, Matolcsi and Ruzsa. We shall
also discuss projection and entropy inequalities and their connections.
