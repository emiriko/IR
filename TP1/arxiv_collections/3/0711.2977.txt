We discuss several recent measurements of rare charmed hadron decays. Focus
is placed on radiative and annihilation topologies highlighting their
sensitivity to new physics and pointing out the strengths and weaknesses of
different channels. We compare the different measurement techniques employed at
fixed target and $e^+e^-$ dedicated charm experiments, B-factories, and the
Tevatron experiments. Comparisons are also made to similar topologies in the
beauty, strange, and top systems where appropriate.
