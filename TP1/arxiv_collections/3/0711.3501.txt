We investigate the properties of the hadron-quark mixed phase in compact
stars using a Brueckner-Hartree-Fock framework for hadronic matter and the MIT
bag model for quark matter. We find that the equation of state of the mixed
phase is similar to that given by the Maxwell construction. The composition of
the mixed phase, however, is very different from that of the Maxwell
construction; in particular, hyperons are completely suppressed.
