We obtain criteria for entanglement and the EPR paradox for spin-entangled
particles and analyse the effects of decoherence caused by absorption and state
purity errors. For a two qubit photonic state, entanglement can occur for all
transmission efficiencies. In this case, the state preparation purity must be
above a threshold value. However, Bohm's spin EPR paradox can be achieved only
above a critical level of loss. We calculate a required efficiency of 58%,
which appears achievable with current quantum optical technologies. For a
macroscopic number of particles prepared in a correlated state, spin
entanglement and the EPR paradox can be demonstrated using our criteria for
efficiencies {\eta} > 1/3 and {\eta} > 2/3 respectively. This indicates a
surprising insensitivity to loss decoherence, in a macroscopic system of
ultra-cold atoms or photons.
