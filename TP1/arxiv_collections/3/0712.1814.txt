A phenomenological analysis of radiative $V\to P\gamma$ and $P\to V\gamma$
decays is performed in order to determine the gluonic content of the
$\eta^\prime$ wave function. Our result shows that there is no evidence for
such a gluonium contribution, $Z_{\eta^\prime}^2=0.04\pm 0.09$. In terms of a
mixing angle description this corresponds to $\phi_P=(41.4\pm 1.3)^\circ$ and
$|\phi_{\eta^\prime G}|=(12\pm 13)^\circ$.
