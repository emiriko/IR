This paper proposes an unsupervised learning technique by using Multi-layer
Mirroring Neural Network and Forgy's clustering algorithm. Multi-layer
Mirroring Neural Network is a neural network that can be trained with
generalized data inputs (different categories of image patterns) to perform
non-linear dimensionality reduction and the resultant low-dimensional code is
used for unsupervised pattern classification using Forgy's algorithm. By
adapting the non-linear activation function (modified sigmoidal function) and
initializing the weights and bias terms to small random values, mirroring of
the input pattern is initiated. In training, the weights and bias terms are
changed in such a way that the input presented is reproduced at the output by
back propagating the error. The mirroring neural network is capable of reducing
the input vector to a great degree (approximately 1/30th the original size) and
also able to reconstruct the input pattern at the output layer from this
reduced code units. The feature set (output of central hidden layer) extracted
from this network is fed to Forgy's algorithm, which classify input data
patterns into distinguishable classes. In the implementation of Forgy's
algorithm, initial seed points are selected in such a way that they are distant
enough to be perfectly grouped into different categories. Thus a new method of
unsupervised learning is formulated and demonstrated in this paper. This method
gave impressive results when applied to classification of different image
patterns.
