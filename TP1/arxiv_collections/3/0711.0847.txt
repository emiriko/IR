In inhomogeneous environments, the correct expression of the diffusive flux
is often not given by the Fick's law $\Gamma = - D \nabla n $. The most general
hydrodynamic equation modelling diffusion is indeed the Fokker-Planck Equation
(FPE). The microscopic dynamics of each specific system may affect the form of
the FPE, either establishing connections between the diffusion and the
convection term, as well as providing supplementary terms. In particular, the
Fick's form for the Diffusion Equation may arise only in consequence of a
specific kind of microscopic dynamics. It is also shown how, in the presence of
sharp inhomogeneities, even the hydrodynamic FPE limit may becomes inaccurate
and mask some features of the true solution, as computed from the Master
Equation.
