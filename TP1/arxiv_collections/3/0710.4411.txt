Cluster radioactivity is described as a very mass asymmetric fission process.
The reflection symmetry breaking octupole moment has been used in a mean field
HFB theory as leading coordinate instead of the quadrupole moment usually used
in standard fission calculations. The procedure has been applied to the study
of the ``very mass asymmetric fission barrier'' of several even-even Thorium
isotopes. The masses of the emitted clusters as well as the corresponding
half-lives have been evaluated on those cases where experimental data exist.
