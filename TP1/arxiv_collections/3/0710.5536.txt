We discuss methods for the calculation of disconnected diagrams and their
application to various form factors of the nucleon. In particular, we present
preliminary results for the strange contribution to the scalar and axial form
factors, calculated with N_f=2 dynamical flavors of Wilson fermions on an
anisotropic lattice.
