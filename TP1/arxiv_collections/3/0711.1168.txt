We study the impurity states in bilayer graphene in the unitary limit using
Green's function method. Unlike in single layer graphene, the presence of
impurities at two non-equivalent sites in bilayer graphene produce different
impurity states which is understood as the change in the band structure due to
interlayer hopping of electrons. The impurity states can also be tuned by
changing the band structure of bilayer grahene through external electric field
bias.
