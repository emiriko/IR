We associate to every algebraic number field a hyperbolic surface lamination
and an external fundamental group: the latter a generalization of the
fundamental germ that necessarily contains external (not first order definable)
elements. The external fundamental group of the rationals is a split extension
of the absolute Galois group, that conjecturally contains a subgroup whose
abelianization is isomorphic to the idele class group.
