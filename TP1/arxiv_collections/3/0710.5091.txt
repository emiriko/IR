The hyperfine interaction of an electron with nuclei in the annealed
self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots is theoretically analyzed. For this
purpose, the annealing process, and energy structure of the quantum dots are
numerically modeled. The modeling is verified by comparison of the calculated
optical transitions and of the experimental data on photoluminescence for set
of the annealed quantum dots. The localization volume of the electron in the
ground state and the partial contributions of In, Ga, and As nuclei to the
hyperfine interaction are calculated as functions of the annealing temperature.
It is established that the contribution of indium nuclei into the hyperfine
interaction becomes predominant up to high annealing temperatures (T = 980 C)
when the In content in the quantum dots does not exceed 25%. Effect of the
nuclear spin fluctuations on the electron spin polarization is numerically
modeled. Effective field of the fluctuations is found to be in good agreement
with experimental data available.
