We study unparticle effects on particle and antiparticle osillations in
meson-antimeson, and muonium-antimuonium systems. Unlike usual tree level
contributions to meson oscillations from heavy particle exchange with small
$\Gamma_{12}$, the unparticle may have sizeable contributions to both $M_{12}$
and $\Gamma_{12}$ due to fractional dimension $d_\U$ of the unparticle. We find
that very stringent constraints on the unparticle and particle interactions can
be obtained. If unparticle effect dominates the contributions (which may happen
in $D^0-\bar D^0$ mixing) to meson mixing parameters $x$ and $y$, we find that
$x/y =\cot(\pi d_\U)$. Interesting constraints on unparticle and particle
interactions can also be obtained using muonion and antimuonion oscillation
data. We also comment on unparticle effects on CP violation in meson
oscillations.
