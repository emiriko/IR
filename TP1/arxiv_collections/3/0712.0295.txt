In this paper, the concepts and the direct theorems of stability in the sense
of Liapunov, within the framework of Birkhoffian dynamical systems on
manifolds, are considered. The Liapunov-type functions are constructed for
linear and nonlinear LC and RLC electrical networks, to prove stability under
certain conditions.
