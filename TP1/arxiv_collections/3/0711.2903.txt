In spite of the enormous success of the Standard Model (SM), we have strong
reasons to expect the presence of new physics beyond the SM at higher energies.
The idea of the Grand Unification of all the known interactions in nature is
perhaps the main reason behind these expectations. Low-energy Supersymmetry is
closely linked with grand unification as a solution of the hierarchy problem
associated with the ratio M_GUT / M_Z. In these lectures we will provide a
general overview of Grand Unification and Supersymmetry with special emphasis
on their phenomenological consequences at low energies. We will analyse the
flavour and CP problems of Supersymmetry and try to identify in these
associated low-energy observables possible indications of the existence of a
Grand Unified theory at high energies.
