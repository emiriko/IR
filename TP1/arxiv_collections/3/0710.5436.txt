In this Letter, the dynamic phase transitions of the time-dependent
Ginzburg-Landau equations are analyzed using a newly developed dynamic
transition theory and a new classification scheme of dynamics phase
transitions. First, we demonstrate that there are two type of dynamic
transitions, jump and continuous, dictated by the sign of a nondimensional
parameter R. This parameter is computable, and depends on the material
property, the applied field, and the geometry of domain that the sample
occupies. Second, using the parameter R, precise analytical formulas for
critical domain size, and for critical magnetic fields are derived.
