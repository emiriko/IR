We review recent studies of light scalar meson properties by means of
unitarization techniques, obtained from dispersion theory, and applied to the
Chiral Perturbation Theory expansion. In particular, light scalars do not
follow the N_c dependence of $\bar q q$ states although a subdominant
quark-antiquark component may be observed to arise for the f_0(600) around 1
GeV, where another quark-antiquark multiplet is believed to exist. Finally, we
present our preliminary results on the quark mass dependence of the f_0(600)
and rho(770) resonances.
