A conjecture formulated by Henri Poincare in 1912 suggests that Max Planck's
elementary quantum of action constitutes an authentic "atom of motion". When
the conjecture is implemented, the resulting entity, the xon, becomes "the
string string theorists forgot to notice". If a string exists in Nature, then
string theoretical research should be pursued.
