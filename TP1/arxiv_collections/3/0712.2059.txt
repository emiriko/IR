We consider a superconducting persistent-current qubit consisting of a
three-junction superconducting loop in an applied magnetic field. We show that
by choosing the field, Josephson couplings, and offset charges suitably, we can
perfectly suppress the tunneling between two oppositely directed states of
circulating current, leading to a vanishing of the splitting between the two
qubit states. The suppression arises for interference between tunneling along
different paths, and is analogous to that predicted previously for magnetic
particles with half-integer spin.
