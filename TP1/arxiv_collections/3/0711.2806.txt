We discuss the applicability, within the Random Matrix Theory, of
perturbative treatment of symmetry breaking to the experimental data on the
flip symmetry breaking in quartz crystal. We found that the values of the
parameter that measures this breaking are different for the spacing
distribution as compared to those for the spectral rigidity. We consider both
twofold and threefold symmetries. The latter was found to account better for
the spectral rigidity than the former. Both cases, however, underestimate the
experimental spectral rigidity at large L. This discrepancy can be resolved if
an appropriate number of eigenfrequecies is considered to be missing in the
sample. Our findings are relevant to isospin violation study in nuclei.
