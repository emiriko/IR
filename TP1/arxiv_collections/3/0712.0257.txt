The observation of three events for the decay $\Sigma^+ \to p \mu^+ \mu^-$
with a dimuon invariant mass of $214.3\pm0.5$MeV by the HyperCP collaboration
imply that a new particle X may be needed to explain the observed dimuon
invariant mass distribution. We show that there are regions in the SUSY-FCNC
parameter space where the $A^0_1$ in the NMSSM can be used to explain the
HyperCP events without contradicting all the existing constraints from the
measurements of the kaon decays, and the constraints from the $K^0-\bar{K}^0$
mixing are automatically satisfied once the constraints from kaon decays are
satisfied.
