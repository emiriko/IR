This paper presents a powerfull method to integrate general monomials on the
classical groups with respect to their invariant (Haar) measure. The method has
first been applied to the orthogonal group in [J. Math. Phys. 43, 3342 (2002)],
and is here used to obtain similar integration formulas for the unitary and the
unitary symplectic group. The integration formulas turn out to be of similar
form. They are all recursive, where the recursion parameter is the number of
column (row) vectors from which the elements in the monomial are taken. This is
an important difference to other integration methods. The integration formulas
are easily implemented in a computer algebra environment, which allows to
obtain analytical expressions very efficiently. Those expressions contain the
matrix dimension as a free parameter.
