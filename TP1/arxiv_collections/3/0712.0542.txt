We solve the Killing-Yano equation on manifolds with a $G$-structure for
$G=SO(n), U(n), SU(n), Sp(n)\cdot Sp(1), Sp(n), G_2$ and $Spin(7)$. Solutions
include nearly-K\"ahler, weak holonomy $G_2$, balanced SU(n) and holonomy $G$
manifolds. As an application, we find that particle probes on $AdS_4\times X$
compactifications of type IIA and 11-dimensional supergravity admit a ${\cal
W}$-type of symmetry generated by the fundamental forms. We also explore the
${\cal W}$-symmetries of string and particle actions in heterotic and common
sector supersymmetric backgrounds. In the heterotic case, the generators of the
${\cal W}$-symmetries completely characterize the solutions of the gravitino
Killing spinor equation, and the structure constants of the ${\cal W}$-symmetry
algebra depend on the solution of the dilatino Killing spinor equation.
