We present experiments in which the interaction of a single gold nanoparticle
with glass substrates or with another gold particle can be tuned by in-situ
control of their separations using scanning probe technology. We record the
plasmon resonances of the coupled systems as a function of the polarization of
the incident field and the particle position. The distinct spectral changes of
the scattered light from the particle pair are in good agreement with the
outcome of finite difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations. We believe our
experimental technique holds promise for the investigation of the van der
Waals-Casimir type interactions between nanoscopic neutral bodies.
