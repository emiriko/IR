We present our experience of designing a single-chip controller for advanced
digital still camera from specification all the way to mass production. The
process involves collaboration with camera system designer, IP vendors, EDA
vendors, silicon wafer foundry, package and testing houses, and camera maker.
We also co-work with academic research groups to develop a JPEG codec IP and
memory BIST and SOC testing methodology. In this presentation, we cover the
problems encountered, our solutions, and lessons learned.
