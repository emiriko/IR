Excitons bound to flourine atoms in ZnSe have the potential for several
quantum optical applications. Examples include optically accessible quantum
memories for quantum information processing and lasing without inversion. These
applications require the bound-exciton transitions to be coupled to cavities
with high cooperativity factors, which results in the experimental observation
of low-threshold lasing. We report such lasing from fluorine-doped ZnSe quantum
wells in 3 and 6 micron microdisk cavities. Photoluminescence and selective
photoluminescence spectroscopy confirm that the lasing is due to bound-exciton
transitions.
