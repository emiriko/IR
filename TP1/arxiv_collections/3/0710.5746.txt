We provide a snapshot of Dyson-Schwinger equation applications to the theory
and phenomenology of hadrons. Exact results for pseudoscalar mesons are
highlighted, with details relating to the U_A(1) problem. Calculated masses of
the lightest J=0,1 states are discussed. We recapitulate upon studies of
nucleon properties and give a perspective on the contribution of quark orbital
angular momentum to the spin of a nucleon at rest.
