Considering analyticity, unitarity and an influence of coupled channels,
experimental data on the isovector P-wave of pion-pion scattering was analyzed
to study rho-like mesons below 1900 MeV. The analysis indicates evidently that
in the energy range 1200--1800 MeV, there are three rho-like mesons: rho(1250),
rho(1450) and rho(1600), unlike the PDG tables. The obtained P-wave pion-pion
scattering length (a_1^1=33.9+- 2.02 [10^{-3}m_{pi^+}^{-3}]) most matches to
the one calculated in the local Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model.
