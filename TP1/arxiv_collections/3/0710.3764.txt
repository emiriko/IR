This paper presents the design of a novel distributed algorithm d-IRA for the
reachability analysis of linear hybrid automata. Recent work on iterative
relaxation abstraction (IRA) is leveraged to distribute the computational
problem among multiple computational nodes in a non-redundant manner by
performing careful infeasibility analysis of linear programs corresponding to
spurious counterexamples. The d-IRA algorithm is resistant to failure of
multiple computational nodes. The experimental results provide promising
evidence for the possible successful application of this technique.
