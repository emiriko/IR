The dynamics of quantum systems can be approximated by the time propagation
of Gaussian wave packets. Applying a time dependent variational principle, the
time evolution of the parameters of the coupled Gaussian wave packets can be
calculated from a set of ordinary differential equations. Unfortunately, the
set of equations is ill-behaved in most practical applications, depending on
the number of propagated Gaussian wave packets, and methods for regularization
are needed. We present a general method for regularization based on applying
adequate nonholonomic inequality constraints to the evolution of the
parameters, keeping the equations of motion well-behaved. The power of the
method is demonstrated for a non-integrable system with two degrees of freedom.
