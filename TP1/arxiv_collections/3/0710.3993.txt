We present a measurement of the ratio R =
\Gamma(\keg;\Estar>30\mev,\qstar>20^\circ)$/$\Gamma(\kegf)$ and a first
measurement of the direct emission contribution in KL semileptonic decays. The
measurement is done at the DAFNE phi-factory selecting phi->KL KS decays with
the KLOE detector. We use 328 pb^{-1}$ of data corresponding to about 3.5
million Ke3(g) events and about 9000 radiative events. Our result is R=(924 +/-
23(stat) +/-16(syst)10^{-5} for the branching ratio and X=-2.3 +/- 1.3(stat)
+/- 1.4(syst) for the parameter describing direct emission.
