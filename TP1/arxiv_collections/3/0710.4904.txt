Photoionization dynamics of the RNA base Uracil is studied in the framework
of Density Functional Theory (DFT). The photoionization calculations take
advantage of a newly developed parallel version of a multicentric approach to
the calculation of the electronic continuum spectrum which uses a set of
B-spline radial basis functions and a Kohn-Sham density functional hamiltonian.
Both valence and core ionizations are considered. Scattering resonances in
selected single-particle ionization channels are classified by the symmetry of
the resonant state and the peak energy position in the photoelectron kinetic
energy scale; the present results highlight once more the site specificity of
core ionization processes. We further suggest that the resonant structures
previously characterized in low-energy electron collision experiments are
partly shifted below threshold by the photoionization processes. A critical
evaluation of the theoretical results providing a guide for future experimental
work on similar biosystems.
