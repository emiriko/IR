We discuss the phenomenology of strange-quark dynamics in the nucleon, based
on experimental and theoretical results for electroweak form factors and for
parton densities. In particular, we construct a model for the generalized
parton distribution that relates the asymmetry s(x)-sbar(x) between the
longitudinal momentum distributions of strange quarks and antiquarks with the
form factor F1^s(t), which describes the distribution of strangeness in
transverse position space.
