In the contemporary Cosmology, dark energy is modeled as a perfect fluid,
having a very simple equation of state: pressure is proportional to dark energy
density. As an alternative, I propose a more complex equation of state, with
pressure being function of three variables: dark energy density, matter density
and the size of the Universe. One consequence of the new equation is that, in
the late-time Universe, cosmological scale factor is linear function of time;
while the standard cosmology predicts an exponential function.The new equation
of state allows attributing a temperature to the physical vacuum, a temperature
proportional to the acceleration of the expansion of the Universe. The vacuum
temperature decreases with the expansion of the Universe, approaching (but
never reaching) the absolute zero.
