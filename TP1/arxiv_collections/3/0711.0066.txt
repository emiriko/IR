Photon correlations in the emission of a resonantly driven quantum dot are
investigated, accounting for the influence of the solid-state phonon
environment. An analytical expression is derived for the second-order
fluorescence intensity correlation function, from which regimes of correlated
and uncorrelated photon emission are predicted as the driving field is varied.
Experiments to investigate this effect would provide valuable insight into
quantum dot carrier-phonon dynamics and are feasible with current technology.
