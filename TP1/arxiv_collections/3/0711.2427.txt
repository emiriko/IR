We provide a comprehensive overview of the current theoretical understanding
of the dynamic structure factor of stiff polymers in semidilute solution based
on the wormlike chain (WLC) model. We extend previous work by computing exact
numerical coefficients and an expression for the dynamic mean square
displacement (MSD) of a free polymer and compare various common approximations
for the hydrodynamic interactions, which need to be treated accurately if one
wants to extract quantitative estimates for model parameters from experimental
data. A recent controversy about the initial slope of the dynamic structure
factor is thereby resolved. To account for the interactions of the polymer with
a surrounding (sticky) polymer solution, we analyze an extension of the WLC
model, the glassy wormlike chain (GWLC), which predicts near power-law and
logarithmic long-time tails in the dynamic structure factor.
