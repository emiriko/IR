The v = 1 -> 0 radiative lifetime of NH (X triplet-Sigma-, v=1,N=0) is
determined to be tau_rad,exp. = 37.0 +/- 0.5 stat +2.0 / -0.8 sys miliseconds,
corresponding to a transition dipole moment of |mu_10| = 0.0540 + 0.0009 /
-0.0018 Debye. To achieve the long observation times necessary for direct
time-domain measurement, vibrationally excited NH (X triplet-Sigma-, v=1,N=0)
radicals are magnetically trapped using helium buffer-gas loading. Simultaneous
trapping and lifetime measurement of both the NH(v=1, N=0) and NH(v=0,N=0)
populations allows for accurate extraction of tau_rad,exp. Background helium
atoms are present during our measurement of tau_rad,exp., and the rate constant
for helium atom induced collisional quenching of NH(v=1,N=0) was determined to
be k_q < 3.9 * 10^-15 cm^3/s. This bound on k_q yields the quoted systematic
uncertainty on tau_rad,exp. Using an ab initio dipole moment function and an
RKR potential, we also determine a theoretical value of 36.99 ms for this
lifetime, in agreement with our experimental value. Our results provide an
independent determination of tau_rad,10, test molecular theory, and furthermore
demonstrate the efficacy of buffer-gas loading and trapping in determining
metastable radiative and collisional lifetimes.
