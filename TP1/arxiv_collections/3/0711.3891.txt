We discuss a left-right symmetric model with two Higgs bi-doublet and
spontaneous P and CP violation. The flavor changing neutral currents is
suppressed by assuming approximate global U(1) family symmetry. We calculate
the constraints from neural K meson mass difference \Delta m_K and demonstrate
that a right-handed gauge boson W_2 contribution in box-diagrams with mass
around 600 GeV is allowed due to a negative interference with a light charged
Higgs boson around 150 \sim 300 GeV. The W_2 contribution to \epsilon_K is
suppressed from appropriate choice of additional CP phases appearing in the
right-handed Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa(CKM) matrix. The model is found fully
consistent with B^0 mass difference and the mixing-induced CP asymmetry
measurements.
