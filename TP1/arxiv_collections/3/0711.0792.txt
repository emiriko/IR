Supposing only Lorentz and the gauge invariances of the Lagrangian, we derive
energy and angular distributions for $\tau^\pm \to \mu^\pm \mu^\pm \mu^\mp$
lepton flavor violating decay process. Using these results, we discuss methods
to determine the parameters associated with the lepton flavor violating
interactions.
