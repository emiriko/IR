We present a theory of threads, interleaving of threads, and interaction
between threads and services with features of molecular dynamics, a model of
computation that bears on computations in which dynamic data structures are
involved. Threads can interact with services of which the states consist of
structured data objects and computations take place by means of actions which
may change the structure of the data objects. The features introduced include
restriction of the scope of names used in threads to refer to data objects.
Because that feature makes it troublesome to provide a model based on
structural operational semantics and bisimulation, we construct a projective
limit model for the theory.
