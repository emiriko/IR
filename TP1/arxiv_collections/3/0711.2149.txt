We discuss realization, properties and performance of the adaptive finite
element approach to the design of nano-photonic components. Central issues are
the construction of vectorial finite elements and the embedding of bounded
components into the unbounded and possibly heterogeneous exterior. We apply the
finite element method to the optimization of the design of a hollow core
photonic crystal fiber. Thereby we look at the convergence of the method and
discuss automatic and adaptive grid refinement and the performance of higher
order elements.
