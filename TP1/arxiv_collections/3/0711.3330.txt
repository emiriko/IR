Reduced-Order Modelling of the Bending of an Array of An array of
micromirrors for beam steering optical switching has been designed in a thick
polysilicon technology. A novel semi-analytical method to calculate the static
characteristics of the micromirrors by taking into account the flexural
deformation of the structure is presented. The results are compared with 3D
coupled-field FEM simulation.
