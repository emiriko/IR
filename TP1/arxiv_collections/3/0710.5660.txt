In this talk, we present a procedure to systematically generate a large
number of valid mass matrix textures from very generic assumptions. Compared to
plain anarchy arguments, we postulate some structure for the theory, such as a
possible connection between quarks and leptons, and a mechanism to generate
flavor structure. We illustrate how this parameter space can be used to test
the exclusion power of future experiments, and we point out that one can
systematically generate embeddings in Z_N product flavor symmetry groups.
