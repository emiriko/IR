We consider models of maximal flavor violation (MxFV), in which a new scalar
mediates large q_3 <-> q_1 or q_3 <-> q_2 flavor changing transitions (q_i is
an i'th generation quark), while q_3 <-> q_3 transitions are suppressed, e.g.,
\xi_{31}, \xi_{13} ~ V_{tb} and \xi_{33} ~ V_{td}, where \xi_{ij} are the new
scalar couplings to quarks and V is the CKM matrix. We show that, contrary to
the conventional viewpoint, such models are not ruled out by the existing low
energy data on K^0, B^0 and D^0 oscillations and rare K and B-decays. We also
show that these models of MxFV can have surprising new signatures at the LHC
and the Tevatron.
