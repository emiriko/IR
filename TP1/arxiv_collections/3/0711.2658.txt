Several finite dimensional quasi-probability representations of quantum
states have been proposed to study various problems in quantum information
theory and quantum foundations. These representations are often defined only on
restricted dimensions and their physical significance in contexts such as
drawing quantum-classical comparisons is limited by the non-uniqueness of the
particular representation. Here we show how the mathematical theory of frames
provides a unified formalism which accommodates all known quasi-probability
representations of finite dimensional quantum systems. Moreover, we show that
any quasi-probability representation satisfying two reasonable properties is
equivalent to a frame representation and then prove that any such
representation of quantum mechanics must exhibit either negativity or a
deformed probability calculus.
