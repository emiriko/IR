We present a geometric argument determining the kinematic (phase-space)
factor contributing to the relative rate at which degrees of freedom of one
chirality come to dominate over degrees of freedom of opposite chirality, in
models with parity violation. We rely on the measure concentration of a subset
of a Euclidean cube which is controlled by an isoperimetric inequality. We
provide an interpretation of this result in terms of ideas of Statistical
Mechanics.
