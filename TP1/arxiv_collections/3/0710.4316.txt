We argue that the hypothesis of the gravitational repulsion between matter
and antimatter can be tested at the Ice Cube, a neutrino telescope, recently
constructed at the South Pole. If there is such a gravitational repulsion, the
gravitational field, deep inside the horizon of a black hole, might create
neutrino-antineutrino pairs from the quantum vacuum. While neutrinos must stay
confined inside the horizon, the antineutrinos should be violently ejected.
Hence, a black hole (made from matter) should behave as a point-like source of
antineutrinos. Our simplified calculations suggest, that the antineutrinos
emitted by supermassive black holes in the centre of the Milky Way and
Andromeda Galaxy, could be detected by the new generation of neutrino
telescopes.
