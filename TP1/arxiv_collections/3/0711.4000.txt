The analytic solution to the dynamics of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model
was developed in the nineties. It involves directly measurable out of
equilibrium quantities, and thus addresses the questions relevant to an
experimental system. We here review the out of equilibrium relaxation of this
model and how it compares to experimental measurements.
