We compute the relevant parameters of the combined Higgs and \phi scalar
effective potential in the Littlest Higgs (LH) model. These parameters are
obtained as the sum of two kind of contributions. The first one is the one-loop
radiative corrections coming from fermions and gauge bosons. The second one is
obtained at the tree level from the higher order effective operators needed for
the ultraviolet completion of the model. Finally we analyze the restrictions
that the requirement of reproducing the standard electroweak symmetry breaking
of the SM set on the LH model parameters.
