The derivation of electromagnetic gyrofluid equations is made systematic by
using the Hermite polynomial form of the underlying delta-f gyrokinetic
distribution function. The gyrokinetic free-energy functional is explicitly
used to set up the model. The gyrofluid free energy follows directly. The
interaction term in the gyrokinetic Lagrangian is used to obtain the gyrofluid
counterpart, from which the polarisation equation follows. One closure rule is
decided for taking moments over the kinetic gyroaveraging operator. These steps
fix the rest of the derivation of the conservative part of the gyrofluid
equations. Dissipation is then added in a form to obtain positive definite
dissipation and to obtain the collisional fluid equations in their appropriate
limit. Existing results are recovered, with the addition of a completely
consistent model for finite gyroradius effects in the nonlinearities
responsible for magnetic reconnection.
