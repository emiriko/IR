In a recent paper [Physica E 39 (2007) 214, arXiv:0708.1842v1] Crisan, Grosu
and Tifrea revisited the problem of the conductance through a double quantum
dot molecule connected to electrodes in a T-shape configuration. The authors
obtained an expression for the conductance that disagrees with previous results
in the literature. We point out an error in their derivation of the conductance
formula and show that it gives unphysical results even for non-interacting
quantum dots.
