We experimentally demonstrate that the origin of multiply reversed rectified
vortex motion in an asymmetric pinning landscape is a consequence not only of
the vortex-vortex interactions but also essentially depends on the ratio
between the characteristic interaction distance and the period of the
asymmetric pinning potential. Our system consists of an Al film deposited on
top of a square array of size-graded magnetic dots with a constant lattice
period a=2\mu m. Four samples with different periods of the size gradient d
were investigated. For large d the dc voltage Vdc recorded under a sinusoidal
ac excitation indicates that the average vortex drift is from bigger to smaller
dots for all explored positive fields. As d is reduced a series of sign
reversals in the dc response are observed as a function of field. We show that
the number of sign reversals increases as d decreases. These findings are in
agreement with recent computer simulations and illustrate the relevance of the
different characteristic lengths for the vortex rectification effects.
