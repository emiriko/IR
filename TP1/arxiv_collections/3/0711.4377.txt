The dynamics of excited phonon spectra of the Exe Jahn-Teller (hereafter, JT)
model mapped onto the generalized Calogero-Moser (gCM) gas of pseudoparticles
implies a complex interplay between nonlinearity and fluctuations of
quasiparticle trajectories. A broad crossover appears in a pseudotime
(interaction strength) between the initial oscillator region and the nonlinear
region of the kink-train lattice as a superlattice of the kink-antikink gCM
trajectories. The local nonlinear fluctuations, nuclei (droplets) of the
growing kink phase arise at the crossover, forming a new intermediate droplet
"glassy" phase as a precursor of the kink phase. The "glassy" phase is related
to a broad maximum in the entropy of the probability distributions of
pseudoparticle accelerations, or level curvatures. The kink-train lattice phase
with multiple kink-antikink collisions is stabilised by long-range correlations
when approaching a semiclassical limit. A series of bifurcations of
nearest-level spacings were recognised as signatures of pre-chaotic behaviour
at the quantum level in the kink phase. Statistical characteristics can be seen
to confirm the coexistence within all of the spectra of both regularity and
chaoticity to a varying extent (nonuniversality). Regions are observed within
which one of the phases is dominant.
