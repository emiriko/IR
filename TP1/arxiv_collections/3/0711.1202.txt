Reflectance, transmittance and absorbance of a symmetric light pulse, the
carrying frequency of which is close to the frequency of interband transitions
in a quantum well, are calculated. Energy levels of the quantum well are
assumed discrete, and two closely located excited levels are taken into
account. The theory is applicable for the quantum wells of arbitrary widths
when the size quantization is preserved. A distinction of refraction indices of
barriers and quantum well is taken into account. In such a case, some
additional reflection from the quantum well borders appears which changes
essentially a shape of the reflected pulse in comparison to homogeneous medium.
The reflection from the borders disappears at some definite ratios of the
carrying frequency of the stimulating pulse and quantum well width.
