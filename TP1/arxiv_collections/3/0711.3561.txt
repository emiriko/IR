Charge Coupled Devices (CCDs) have been successfully used in several high
energy physics experiments over the past two decades. Their high spatial
resolution and thin sensitive layers make them an excellent tool for studying
short-lived particles. The Linear Collider Flavour Identification (LCFI)
collaboration is developing Column-Parallel CCDs (CPCCDs) for the vertex
detector of the International Linear Collider (ILC). The CPCCDs can be read out
many times faster than standard CCDs, significantly increasing their operating
speed. The results of detailed simulations of the charge transfer inefficiency
(CTI) of a prototype CPCCD are reported and studies of the influence of gate
voltage on the CTI described. The effects of bulk radiation damage on the CTI
of a CPCCD are studied by simulating the effects of two electron trap levels,
0.17 and 0.44 eV, at different concentrations and operating temperatures. The
dependence of the CTI on different occupancy levels (percentage of hit pixels)
and readout frequencies is also studied. The optimal operating temperature for
the CPCCD, where the effects of the charge trapping are at a minimum, is found
to be about 230 K for the range of readout speeds proposed for the ILC. The
results of the full simulation have been compared with a simple analytic model.
