We derive area limit laws for the various symmetry classes of staircase
polygons on the square lattice, in a uniform ensemble where, for fixed
perimeter, each polygon occurs with the same probability. This complements a
previous study by Leroux and Rassart, where explicit expressions for the area
and perimeter generating functions of these classes have been derived.
