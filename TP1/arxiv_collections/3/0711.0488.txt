We identify possible dark matter candidates within the class of strongly
interacting models where electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by a light
composite Higgs boson. In these models, the Higgs boson emerges as a
Holographic pseudo-goldstone boson, while dark matter can be identified as a
fermionic composite state X^0, which is made stable through a conserved
(``dark'') quantum number. An effective lagrangian description of both the
Higgs and dark matter is proposed, that includes higher-dimensional operators
suppressed by an scale \Lambda_i. These operators will induce deviations from
the standard Higgs properties that could be meassured at future colliders
(LHC,ILC), and thus provide information on the dark matter scale. The dark
matter X^0, is expected to have a mass of order O(TeV), which is in agreement
with the values extracted from the cosmological bounds and the experimental
searches for dark matter.
