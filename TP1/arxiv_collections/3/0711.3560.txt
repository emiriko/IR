We present single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements on multiferroic
LuFe2O4 showing phase transitions at 240 and 175 K. Magnetic reflections are
observed below each transition indicating that the magnetic interactions in
LuFe2O4 are 3-dimensional (3D) in character. The magnetic structure is refined
as a ferrimagnetic spin configuration below the 240 K transition. While 3D
magnetic correlations persists below 175 K, a significant broadening of the
magnetic peaks is observed along with the build up of a diffuse component to
the magnetic scattering.
