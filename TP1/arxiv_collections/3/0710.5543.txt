In a recent paper we constructed an integrable generalization of the Toda law
on the square lattice. In this paper we construct other examples of integrable
dynamics of Toda-type on the square lattice, as well as on the triangular
lattice, as nonlinear symmetries of the discrete Laplace equations on the
square and triangular lattices. We also construct the $\tau$ - function
formulations and the Darboux-B\"acklund transformations of these novel
dynamics.
