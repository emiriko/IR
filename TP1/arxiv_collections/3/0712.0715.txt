We analyse an iterated version of Nielsen and Ninomiya (N&N)'s proposed card
game experiment to search for a specific type of backward causation on the
running of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. We distinguish "endogenous"
and "exogenous" potential causes of failure of LHC and we discover a curious
"cross-talk" between their respective probabilities and occurrence timescales
when N&N-style backward causation is in effect. Finally, we note a kind of
"statistical cosmic censorship" preventing the influence from the future from
showing up in a statistical analysis of the iterated runs.
