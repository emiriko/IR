This is an exciting time for folks who are looking at neutrino cross
sections, and the especially important quasielastic interaction. We are able to
inspect several recent results from K2K and MiniBooNE and are looking forward
to a couple more high statistics measurements of neutrino and anti-neutrino
interactions. There is additional interest because of the need for this cross
section information for current and upcoming neutrino oscillation experiments.
This paper is a brief review of our current understanding and some puzzles when
we compare the recent results with past measurements. I articulate some of the
short term challenges facing experimentalists, neutrino event generators, and
theoretical work on the quasielastic interaction.
