The domain of numerical simulation is a place where the parallelization of
numerical code is common. The definition of a numerical context means the
configuration of resources such as memory, processor load and communication
graph, with an evolving feature: the resources availability. A feature is often
missing: the adaptability. It is not predictable and the adaptable aspect is
essential. Without calling into question these implementations of these codes,
we create an adaptive use of these implementations. Because the execution has
to be driven by the availability of main resources, the components of a numeric
computation have to react when their context changes. This paper offers a new
architecture, a mobile computing architecture, based on mobile agents and
JavaSpace. At the end of this paper, we apply our architecture to several case
studies and obtain our first results.
