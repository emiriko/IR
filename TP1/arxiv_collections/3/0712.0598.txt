We present new results of the search for WH to lepton neutrino b b production
in ppbar collisions at a center of mass energy of sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV, based on a
dataset with integrated luminosity of 0.44 fb-1. We combine these new results
with previously published searches by the D0 collaboration, for WH and ZH
production analyzed in the MET b b final state, for ZH (to l+l- b b)
production, for WH (to WWW) production, and for H (to WW) direct production. No
signal-like excess is observed either in the WH analysis or in the combination
of all D0 Higgs boson analyses. We set 95% C.L. (expected) upper limits on to
1.9 (3.3) pb for Higgs boson masses between 105 and 145 GeV, to be compared to
the theoretical prediction of 0.13 pb for a standard model (SM) Higgs boson
with mass m_H=115 GeV. After combination with the other D0 Higgs boson
searches, we obtain for m_H=115 GeV an observed (expected) limit 8.5 (12.1)
times higher than the SM predicted Higgs boson production cross section. For
m_H=160 GeV, the corresponding observed (expected) ratio is 10.2 (9.0).
