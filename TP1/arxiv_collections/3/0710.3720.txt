We present a physical setup with which it is possible to produce arbitrary
symmetric long-lived multiqubit entangled states in the internal ground levels
of photon emitters, including the paradigmatic GHZ and W states. In the case of
three emitters, where each tripartite entangled state belongs to one of two
well-defined entanglement classes, we prove a one-to-one correspondence between
well-defined sets of experimental parameters, i.e., locally tunable polarizer
orientations, and multiqubit entanglement classes inside the symmetric
subspace.
