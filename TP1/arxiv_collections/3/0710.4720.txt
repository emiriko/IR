Nanometer circuits are becoming increasingly susceptible to soft-errors due
to alpha-particle and atmospheric neutron strikes as device scaling reduces
node capacitances and supply/threshold voltage scaling reduces noise margins.
It is becoming crucial to add soft-error tolerance estimation and optimization
to the design flow to handle the increasing susceptibility. The first part of
this paper presents a tool for accurate soft-error tolerance analysis of
nanometer circuits (ASERTA) that can be used to estimate the soft-error
tolerance of nanometer circuits consisting of millions of gates. The tolerance
estimates generated by the tool match SPICE generated estimates closely while
taking orders of magnitude less computation time. The second part of the paper
presents a tool for soft-error tolerance optimization of nanometer circuits
(SERTOPT) using the tolerance estimates generated by ASERTA. The tool finds
optimal sizes, channel lengths, supply voltages and threshold voltages to be
assigned to gates in a combinational circuit such that the soft-error tolerance
is increased while meeting the timing constraint. Experiments on ISCAS'85
benchmark circuits showed that soft-error rate of the optimized circuit
decreased by as much as 47% with marginal increase in circuit delay.
