We investigate bosonic atoms or molecules interacting via dipolar
interactions in a planar array of one-dimensional tubes. We consider the
situation in which the dipoles are oriented perpendicular to the tubes by an
external field. We find various quantum phases reaching from a `sliding
Luttinger liquid' phase in which the tubes remain Luttinger liquids to a
two-dimensional charge density wave ordered phase. Two different kinds of
charge density wave order occur: a stripe phase in which the bosons in
different tubes are aligned and a checkerboard phase. We further point out how
to distinguish the occurring phases experimentally.
