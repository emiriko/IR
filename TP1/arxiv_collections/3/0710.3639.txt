One-loop radiative corrections to the leptonic tensor in high energy
bremsstrahlung on heavy nuclei are calculated. Virtual and real photon
radiation is taken into account. Double bremsstrahlung is simulated by means of
Monte Carlo. Numerical results are presented for the case of muon
bremsstrahlung in conditions of the COMPASS experiment at CERN.
