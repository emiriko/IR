Using the Covariant Spectator Theory (CST), we have found One-Boson-Exchange
(OBE) potentials that fit the 2006 world np data below 350 MeV with a
\chi^2/N_data very close to 1, for a total of 3788 data. Our potentials have
significantly fewer adjustable parameters than previous high-precision
potentials, and they also reproduce the experimental triton binding energy
without introducing additional irreducible three-nucleon forces.
