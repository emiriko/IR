Her Majestys Revenue & Customs (HMRC) was born out of the need to create a UK
tax authority by merging both the Inland Revenue and HM Customs & Excise into
one department. HMRC encounters spreadsheets in tax-payers systems on a very
regular basis as well as being a heavy user of spreadsheets internally. The
approach to spreadsheet risk assessment and spreadsheet audit is by the use of
trained computer auditors and data handlers. This, by definition, limits the
use of our specialist spreadsheet audit tool to such trained staff. In order to
tackle the growing use of spreadsheets, a new way of approaching the problem
has been piloted. The aim is to issue all staff who come across spreadsheets
with a simple to use analysis and risk assessment tool, based on the
departmental software SpACE (Spreadsheet Audit & Compliance Examination).
