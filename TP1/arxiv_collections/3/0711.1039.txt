The dynamics of a binary mixture of large and small discs are studied at
temperatures approaching the glass transition using an analysis based on the
topology of the Voronoi polygon surrounding each atom. At higher temperatures
we find that dynamics is dominated by fluid-like motion that involves particles
entering and exiting the nearest-neighbour shells of nearby particles. As the
temperature is lowered, the rate of topological moves decreases and motion
becomes localised to regions of mixed pentagons and heptagons. In addition we
find that in the low temperature state particles may translate significant
distances without undergoing changes in their nearest neig hbour shell. These
results have implications for dynamical heterogeneities in glass forming
liquids.
