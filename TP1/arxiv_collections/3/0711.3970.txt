We consider Gribov's equation for inverse quark Green function with and
without pion correction. With polar parametrization of inverse quark Green
function, we relate the dynamical mass function without pion correction,
$M_{0}(q^2)$ and with pion correction, $M(q^2)$ at low momentum. A graph is
plotted for $M(q^2)$ and $M_{0}(q^2)$ with q for low momentum. It is found that
at low momenta pion corrections are small.
