Indirect information about the possible scale of supersymmetry (SUSY)
breaking can be obtained from the comparison of precisely measured observables
(and also of exclusion limits) with accurate theory predictions incorporating
SUSY loop corrections. Recent results are reviewed obtained from a combined
analysis of the most sensitive electroweak precision observables (EWPO), M_W,
sin^2_theta^eff, Gamma_Z, (g-2)_\mu and M_h, and B-physics observables (BPO),
BR(b -> s \gamma), BR(B_s -> \mu^+\mu^-), BR(B_u -> \tau \nu_\tau) and \Delta
M_{B_s}. Assuming that the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) provides the
cold dark matter density preferred by WMAP and other cosmological data, \chi^2
fits are performed to the parameters of the constrained minimal supersymmetric
extension of the Standard Model (CMSSM), in which the SUSY-breaking parameters
are universal at the GUT scale, and the non-universal Higgs model (NUHM), in
which this constraint is relaxed for the soft SUSY-breaking contributions to
the Higgs masses. Within the CMSSM indirect bounds on the mass of the lightest
CP-even Higgs boson are derived.
