We investigate the physics of coherent polaritons in a double-well
configuration under a resonant pumping. For a continuous wave pump, bistability
and self-pulsing regimes are identified as a function of the pump energy and
intensity. The response to an additional probe pulse is characterized in the
different cases and related to the Bogoliubov modes around the stationary
state. Under a pulsed pump, a crossover from Josephson-like oscillations to
self-trapping is predicted for increasing pump intensity. The accurateness of
the effective two-mode model is assessed by comparing its predictions to a full
solution of the non-equilibrium Gross-Pitaevskii equation.
