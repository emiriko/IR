In this paper we show that in the noncommutative chiral gauge theories the
4-fermion vertices are finite. The $4\psi$-vertices appear in linear order in
quantization of the $\theta$-expanded noncommutative gauge theories; in all
previously considered models, based on Dirac fermions, the $4\psi$-vertices
were divergent and nonrenormalizable.
