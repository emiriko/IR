The pion mass difference generates a pronounced cusp in K --> 3 pi decays,
the strength of which is related to the pi pi S-wave scattering lengths. We
apply an effective field theory framework developed earlier to evaluate the
amplitudes for K_L --> 3 pi decays in a systematic manner, where the strictures
imposed by analyticity and unitarity are respected automatically. The
amplitudes for the decay eta --> 3 pi are also given.
