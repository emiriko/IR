Let $f$ be a germ of holomorphic diffeomorphism of $\C^n$ fixing the origin
$O$, with $df_O$ diagonalizable. We prove that, under certain arithmetic
conditions on the eigenvalues of $df_O$ and some restrictions on the
resonances, $f$ is locally holomorphically linearizable if and only if there
exists a particular $f$-invariant complex manifold. Most of the classical
linearization results can be obtained as corollaries of our result.
