The high accuracy envisaged for future measurements of W-boson production at
hadron colliders has to be matched by precise theoretical predictions. We study
the impact of electroweak radiative corrections on W-boson production cross
sections and differential distributions at the Tevatron and at the LHC. In
particular, we include photon-induced processes, which contribute at O(alpha),
and leading radiative corrections beyond O(alpha) in the high-energy Sudakov
regime and from multi-photon final-state radiation. We furthermore present the
calculation of the complete supersymmetric next-to-leading-order electroweak
and QCD corrections to W-boson hadroproduction within the MSSM. The
supersymmetric corrections turn out to be negligible in the vicinity of the W
resonance in general, reaching the percent level only at high lepton transverse
momentum and for specific choices of the supersymmetric parameters.
