The `Wave Geometry' equation of the pre-WWII Hiroshima program is also the
key equation of the current `fake supergravity' program. I review the status of
(fake) supersymmetric domain walls and (fake) pseudo-supersymmetric
cosmologies. An extension of the domain-wall/cosmology correspondence to a
triple correspondence with instantons shows that `pseudo-supersymmetry' has
another interpretation as Euclidean supersymmetry.
