We give a brief review of recent developments in non-supersymmetric models
for electroweak symmetry breaking, including little Higgs, composite Higgs and
Higgsless theories. The new ideas such as extra dimensions, AdS/CFT
correspondence, dimension-deconstruction, and collective symmetry breaking
provide us new tools to construct new models. They also allow some old ideas to
be revived and implemented in these new models.
