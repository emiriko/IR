One of the challenges in functional brain imaging is integration of
complementary imaging modalities, such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). MEG, which uses highly sensitive
superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) to directly measure
magnetic fields of neuronal currents, cannot be combined with conventional
high-field MRI in a single instrument. Indirect matching of MEG and MRI data
leads to significant co-registration errors. A recently proposed imaging method
- SQUID-based microtesla MRI - can be naturally combined with MEG in the same
system to directly provide structural maps for MEG-localized sources. It
enables easy and accurate integration of MEG and MRI/fMRI, because microtesla
MR images can be precisely matched to structural images provided by high-field
MRI and other techniques. Here we report the first images of the human brain by
microtesla MRI, together with auditory MEG (functional) data, recorded using
the same seven-channel SQUID system during the same imaging session. The images
were acquired at 46 microtesla measurement field with pre-polarization at 30
mT. We also estimated transverse relaxation times for different tissues at
microtesla fields. Our results demonstrate feasibility and potential of human
brain imaging by microtesla MRI. They also show that two new types of imaging
equipment - low-cost systems for anatomical MRI of the human brain at
microtesla fields, and more advanced instruments for combined functional (MEG)
and structural (microtesla MRI) brain imaging - are practical.
