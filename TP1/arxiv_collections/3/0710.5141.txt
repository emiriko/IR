We present a search for neutral supersymmetric Higgs bosons decaying to
tau+tau- pairs produced in ppbar collisions at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV. The data have
been collected with the CDF II and D0 detectors at the Tevatron collider at
Fermilab (1 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity per experiment). No significant
excess above the standard model backgrounds is observed. We set exclusion
limits on the Higgs production cross-section times the branching fraction of
its decay to tau+tau- pairs for Higgs masses in the range from 90 to 250
GeV/c^2. We also set exclusion limits on MSSM parameters m_A and tan_beta in
several benchmark scenarios.
