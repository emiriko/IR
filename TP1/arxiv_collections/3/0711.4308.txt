We present a non-perturbative expression for the scattering matrix of $N$
particles interacting inside a quantum dot. Characterizing the dot by its
resonances, we find a compact form for the scattering matrix in a real-time
representation. We study the transmission probabilities and interaction-induced
orbital entanglement of two electrons incident on the dot in a spin-singlet
state.
