We consider the electonic transport in a mesoscopic metallic spin glasses. We
show that the distribution of overlaps between spin configurations can be
inferred from the reduction of the conductance fluctuations by the magnetic
impurities. Using this property, we propose new experimental protocols to probe
spin glasses directly through their overlaps.
