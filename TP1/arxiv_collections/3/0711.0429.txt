The D'Angelo finite type is shown to be equivalent to the Kohn finite ideal
type on smooth, pseudoconvex domains in complex n space. This is known as the
Kohn Conjecture. The argument uses Catlin's notion of a boundary system as well
as methods from subanalytic and semialgebraic geometry. When a subset of the
boundary contains only two level sets of the Catlin multitype, a lower bound
for the subelliptic gain in the \bar\partial-Neumann problem is obtained in
terms of the D'Angelo type, the dimension of the ambient space, and the level
of forms.
