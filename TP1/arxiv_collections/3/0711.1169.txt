We study the combined effect of delayed Raman response and bit pattern
randomness on pulse propagation in massive multichannel optical fiber
communication systems. The propagation is described by a perturbed stochastic
nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, which takes into account changes in pulse
amplitude and frequency as well as emission of continuous radiation. We perform
extensive numerical simulations with the model, and analyze the dynamics of the
frequency moments, the bit-error-rate, and the mutual distribution of amplitude
and position. The results of our numerical simulations are in good agreement
with theoretical predictions based on the adiabatic perturbation approach.
