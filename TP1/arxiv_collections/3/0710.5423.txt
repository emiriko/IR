Human language and its governing rules present a number of analogies with the
organization and structure of communication and information management in
living organisms. This chapter will provide a short general introduction about
grammar, as well as a brief explanation on how linguistic approaches
effectively contaminate scientific practice, and, finally, how they can also
provide systems biology with further tools and paradigms to analyse emergent
behaviours and interactions among the components of a biological system.
