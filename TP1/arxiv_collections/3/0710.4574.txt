The Dirac spin liquid was proposed to be the ground state of the spin-1/2
Kagome antiferromagnets. In a magnetic field $B$, we show that the state with
Fermi pocket is unstable to the Landau level (LL) state. The LL state breaks
the spin rotation around the axis of the magnetic field. We find that the LL
state has an in-plane 120$^{\circ}$ $q=0$ magnetization $M$ which scales with
the external field $M\sim B^{\alpha}$, where $\alpha$ is an intrinsic
calculable universal number of the Dirac spin liquid. We discuss the related
experimental implications which can be used to detect the possible Dirac spin
liquid phase in Herbertsmithite ZnCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$.
