In light of the five-year data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe
(WMAP), we discuss models of inflation based on the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone
potential predicted in five-dimensional gauge theories for different
backgrounds: flat Minkowski, anti-de Sitter, and dilatonic spacetime. In this
framework, the inflaton potential is naturally flat due to shift symmetries and
the mass scales associated with it are related to 5D geometrical quantities.
