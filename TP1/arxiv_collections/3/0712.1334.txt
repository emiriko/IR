We investigate the dynamical gauge-Higgs unification in the Randall-Sundrum
(RS) space-time. We study the dynamical gauge-Higgs unification in the SU(2)
gauge theory with a bulk fermion in the RS space-time. We evaluate the
contribution from fermion loop to the one-loop effective potential with respect
to the Wilson-line phase, and study the dynamical gauge symmetry breaking. We
also apply this mechanism of the gauge symmetry breaking to the electroweak
gauge-Higgs unification in the RS space-time. Especially we numerically studied
a SU(3)_w gauge model as a toy model of electroweak gauge-Higgs unification in
the RS space-time. We introduce an adjoint fermion into the model to break the
gauge symmetry and to obtain the U(1)_em electromagnetic symmetry. We found
that in this model the ratio of Z-boson mass to W-boson varies with respect to
the Wilson-line phase even at the tree level. We also propose a dynamical
mechanism of tuning the ratio m_Z/m_W to the experimental value
91.2GeV/80.4GeV=1.13 by introducing bulk scalars or bulk fermions with twisted
boundary conditions. In these models the Higgs can vary in mass between zero
and 290GeV.
