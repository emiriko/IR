Using thin scintillating fibers with Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) readout a
mo dular high-resolution charged-particle tracking detector has been designed.
The fiber modules consist of 2 x 5 layers of 128 round multiclad scintillating
fiber s of 0.250mm diameter. The fibers are read out by four SiPM arrays (8mm x
1mm) e ach on either end of the module.
