Electromagnetic waves propagate with the speed of light. The reason is that
electrostatic fields as well as magnetic fields propagate with this speed. Both
types of objects, waves as well as static fields contain and transport energy.
Consequently it is possible to calculate how much energy and how much energy
density a source of a field emits into the space - and the calculation shows
that this energy is not zero, for elementary particles as well as for
macroscopic spheres. The calculation is presented in this article.
  This leads to a principle problem not being answered up to now: From where
does the static charge obtain the energy, which it emits permantently? But the
paradox has a second aspect: If we follow the trace of a specified element of
volume containing an electric field on its way through the space, we will
notice that its contents of field energy decreases during time. But where does
this effluent energy go?
