We present a universal Holevo-like upper bound on the locally accessible
information for arbitrary multipartite ensembles. This bound allows us to
analyze the indistinguishability of a set of orthogonal states under LOCC. We
also derive the upper bound for the capacity of distributed dense coding with
multipartite senders and multipartite receivers.
