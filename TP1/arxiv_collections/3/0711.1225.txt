In this comment we show that the transition to collective motion in
Vicsek-like systems with angular noise remain discontinuous for large velocity
values. Thus, the networks studied by Aldana {\et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf
98}, 095702 (2007)] at best constitute a singular, large velocity limit of
these systems.
