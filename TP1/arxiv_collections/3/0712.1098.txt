Basic concepts of quantum theory of information, principles of quantum
calculations and the possibility of creation on this basis unique on
calculation power and functioning principle device, named quantum computer, are
briefly reviewed. The main blocks of quantum logic, schemes of implementation
of quantum calculations, as well as some known today effective quantum
algorithms, called to realize advantages of quantum calculations upon
classical, are concerned. Among them special place is taken by Shor's algorithm
of number factorization, Grover's algorithm of unsorted database search and,
finally, the most promising in application methods of quantum phenomena
simulation, particularly quantum chaos. The most perspective methods of
experimental realization of quantum computer, namely nuclear-magnetic resonance
and trapped ions realizations, are discussed. Phenomena of decoherence, its
influence on quantum computer stability and methods of quantum error correction
are described.
