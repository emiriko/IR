We study the ILC phenomenology of (1,0) Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes along two
universal extra dimensions compactified on the chiral square. We compute
production cross sections of various (1,0) particles at the ILC with sqrt(s)=1
TeV, focusing on decays of KK-leptons and the KK partner of hypercharge gauge
boson down to the "spinless photon", which is the lightest KK particle. We
contrast this model to one universal extra dimension with KK-photon (spin-1)
and supersymmetry with neutralino (spin-1/2) or gravitino (spin-3/2) dark
matter. We also investigate the discovery potential for (1,1) KK bosons as
s-channel resonances.
