It is generally admitted in thermodynamics that, for a given change in
volume, the work done by a system is greater in conditions of reversibility
than in conditions of irreversibility. If the basic conventions of physics are
strictly respected, it seems that this proposition needs to be reversed. Beyond
this formal aspect, the discussion consolidates the idea that thermodynamics
and relativity are closely connected.
