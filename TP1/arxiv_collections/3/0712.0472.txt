We investigated the nanosecond-scale time decay of the blue-green light
emitted by nominally pure SrTiO$_3$ following the absorption of an intense
picosecond laser pulse generating a high density of electron-hole pairs. Two
independent components are identified in the fluorescence signal that show a
different dynamics with varying excitation intensity, and which can be
respectively modeled as a bimolecular and unimolecolar process. An
interpretation of the observed recombination kinetics in terms of interacting
electron and hole polarons is proposed.
