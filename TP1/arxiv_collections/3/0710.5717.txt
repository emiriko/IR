We study neutron matter at and near the unitary limit using a low-momentum
ring diagram approach. By slightly tuning the meson-exchange CD-Bonn potential,
neutron-neutron potentials with various $^1S_0$ scattering lengths such as
$a_s=-12070fm$ and $+21fm$ are constructed. Such potentials are renormalized
with rigorous procedures to give the corresponding $a_s$-equivalent
low-momentum potentials $V_{low-k}$, with which the low-momentum
particle-particle hole-hole ring diagrams are summed up to all orders, giving
the ground state energy $E_0$ of neutron matter for various scattering lengths.
At the limit of $a_s\to \pm \infty$, our calculated ratio of $E_0$ to that of
the non-interacting case is found remarkably close to a constant of 0.44 over a
wide range of Fermi-momenta. This result reveals an universality that is well
consistent with the recent experimental and Monte-Carlo computational study on
low-density cold Fermi gas at the unitary limit. The overall behavior of this
ratio obtained with various scattering lengths is presented and discussed.
Ring-diagram results obtained with $V_{low-k}$ and those with $G$-matrix
interactions are compared.
