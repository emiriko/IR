We present a calculation of the renormalization coefficients of the quark
bilinear operators and the K-Kbar mixing parameter B_K. The coefficients
relating the bare lattice operators to those in the RI/MOM scheme are computed
non-perturbatively and then matched perturbatively to the MSbar scheme. The
coefficients are calculated on the RBC/UKQCD 2+1 flavor dynamical lattice
configurations. Specifically we use a 16^3 x 32 lattice volume, the Iwasaki
gauge action at beta=2.13 and domain wall fermions with L_s=16.
