The muon-catalyzed-fusion processes in D$_2$ gas for various temperatures and
densities have been studied by means of Monte Carlo simulations. In particular,
the role of the resonant and nonresonant $dd\mu$ formation and differences
between the neutron time spectra from the ortho-D$_2$ and para-D$_2$ targets at
low temperatures have been investigated.
