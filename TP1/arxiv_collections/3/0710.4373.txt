Strangeness production is calculated in a pQCD-based model (including nuclear
effects) in the high transverse momentum sector, where pQCD is expected to work
well. We investigate pion, kaon, proton and lambda production in pp and
heavy-ion collisions. Parton energy loss in AA collisions is taken into
account. We compare strange-to-non-strange meson and baryon ratios to data at
RHIC, and make predictions for the LHC. We find that these ratios significantly
deviate from unity not only at RHIC but also at the LHC, indicating the special
role of strangeness at both energies.
