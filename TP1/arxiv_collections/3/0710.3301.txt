In this Letter we present a quantum deletion algorithm that deletes a marked
state from an unsorted database of $N$ items with only a single query. This
algorithm achieves exponential speedup compared with classical algorithm where
O(N) number of query is required. General property of this deleting algorithm
is also studied.
