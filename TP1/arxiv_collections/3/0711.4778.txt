Recent studies based on unitary chiral perturbation theory (U$\chi$PT) found
that the low-lying axial vector mesons can be dynamically generated due to the
interaction of the pseudoscalar octet of the pion and the vector nonet of the
rho. In particular, two poles in the second Riemann sheet have been associated
to the nominal $K_1(1270)$ resonance. In this talk, we present a recent
analysis of the WA3 data on $K^-p\to K^-\pi^+\pi^- p$ at 63 GeV using the
U$\chi$PT amplitudes, and show that it is in favor of the existence of two
$K_1(1270)$'s [Phys. Rev. D 75, 014017 (2007)].
