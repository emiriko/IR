The diamond and completely bounded norms for linear maps play an increasingly
important role in quantum information science, providing fundamental stabilized
distance measures for differences of quantum operations. Based on the theory of
completely bounded maps, we formulate an algorithm to compute the norm of an
arbitrary linear map. We present an implementation of the algorithm via Maple,
discuss its efficiency, and consider the case of differences of unitary maps.
