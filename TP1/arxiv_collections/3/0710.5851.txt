We have demonstrated efficient intersubband electroabsorption in
InGaAs/InAlGaAs/InAlAs step quantum wells grown by metal-organic vapor phase
epitaxy (MOVPE). An absorption modulation of 6 dB at $\lambda=6.0 \mu$m due to
Stark shift of the IS absorption was achieved at a low voltage swing of $\pm
0.5$ V in a multipass waveguide structure. Based on the experimental results it
is estimated that an electroabsorption modulator with a low peak-to-peak
voltage of $V_{pp}=0.9$ V can yield a modulation speed of $f_{3dB} \approx 120$
GHz with the present material by using a strongly confining surface plasmon
waveguide of 30 $\mu$m length.
