There is an important connection between the low energy theorems of QCD and
the energy dependence of the Delta resonance in pi-N scattering, as well as the
closely related gamma^{*} N -> pi N reaction. The resonance shape is due not
only to the strong pi-N interaction in the p wave but the small interaction in
the s wave; the latter is due to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in QCD
(i.e. the Nambu-Goldstone nature of the pion). A brief overview of experimental
tests of chiral perturbation theory and chiral based models is presented
