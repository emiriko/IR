Evolution of gluon distribution function from
Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equation in
next-to-leading order (NLO) at low-x is presented assuming the Regge behaviour
of quarks and gluons at this limit. We compare our results of gluon
distribution function with MRST2004, GRV98LO and GRV98NLO parameterizations and
show the compatibility of Regge behaviour of quark and gluon distribution
functions with perturbative quantum chromodynamics (PQCD) at low-x.
