Several recent studies have been devoted to investigating the limitations
that ordinary quantum mechanics and/or quantum gravity might impose on the
measurability of space-time observables. These analyses are often confined to
the simplified context of two-dimensional flat space-time and rely on a simple
procedure for the measurement of space-like distances based on the exchange of
light signals. We present a generalization of this measurement procedure
applicable to all three types of space-time intervals between two events in
space-times of any number of dimensions. We also present some preliminary
observations on an alternative measurement procedure that can be applied taking
into account the gravitational field of the measuring apparatus, and briefly
discuss quantum limitations of measurability in this context.
