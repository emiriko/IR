I review recent progresses in heavy quarks physics on the lattice. I focus on
decay constants and form factors relevant for the extraction of CKM matrix
elements from experimental data. B-\bar{B} mixing is also discussed. In the
last part of the paper I describe phenomenological applications of Heavy Quark
Effective Theory (HQET) on the lattice, presenting in some detail the recent
non-perturbative determination of the b-quark mass including O(1/m_b)
corrections.
