We report on an analytical study of the statistics of conductance, $g$, and
shot-noise power, $p$, for a chaotic cavity with arbitrary numbers $N_{1,2}$ of
channels in two leads and symmetry parameter $\beta = 1,2,4$. With the theory
of Selberg's integral the first four cumulants of $g$ and first two cumulants
of $p$ are calculated explicitly. We give analytical expressions for the
conductance and shot-noise distributions and determine their exact asymptotics
near the edges up to linear order in distances from the edges. For $0<g<1$ a
power law for the conductance distribution is exact. All results are also
consistent with numerical simulations.
