In this paper we study the tangent spaces of the smooth nested Hilbert scheme
$ Hil{n,n-1}$ of points in the plane, and give a general formula for computing
the Euler characteristic of a $\TT^2$-equivariant locally free sheaf on
$\Hil{n,n-1}$. Applying our result to a particular sheaf, we conjecture that
the result is a polynomial in the variables $q$ and $t$ with non-negative
integer coefficients . We call this conjecturally positive polynomial as
\textsl{the nested $q,t$-Cat alan series}, for it has many conjectural
properties similar to that of the $q,t $-Catalan series.
