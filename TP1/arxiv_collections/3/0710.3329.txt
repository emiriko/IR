Manin, Feynman, and Deutsch have viewed quantum computing as a kind of
universal physical simulation procedure. Much of the writing about quantum
logic circuits and quantum Turing machines has shown how these machines can
simulate an arbitrary unitary transformation on a finite number of qubits. The
problem of universality has been addressed most famously in a paper by Deutsch,
and later by Bernstein and Vazirani as well as Kitaev and Solovay. The quantum
logic circuit model, developed by Feynman and Deutsch, has been more prominent
in the research literature than Deutsch's quantum Turing machines. Quantum
Turing machines form a class closely related to deterministic and probabilistic
Turing machines and one might hope to find a universal machine in this class. A
universal machine is the basis of a notion of programmability. The extent to
which universality has in fact been established by the pioneers in the field is
examined and this key notion in theoretical computer science is scrutinised in
quantum computing by distinguishing various connotations and concomitant
results and problems.
