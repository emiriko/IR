The critical temperature of an underdoped cuprate superconductor is limited
by its phase stiffness $\rho$. In this Letter we argue that the dependence of
$\rho$ on doping $x$ should be understood as a consequence of deleterious
competition with antiferromagnetism at large electron densities, rather than as
evidence for pairing of holes in the $x =0$ Mott insulator state. Our proposal
is based on the observation that the correlation energy of a d-wave
superconductor increases in magnitude at finite pairing wavevector when
antiferromagnetic fluctuations are strong.
