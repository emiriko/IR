We study the energetics of vortices and vortex lattices produced by rotation
in the cyclic phase of F=2 spinor Bose condensates. In addition to the familiar
triangular lattice predicted by Tkachenko for $^4$He, many more complex
lattices appear in this system as a result of the spin degree of freedom. In
particular, we predict a magnetic-field-driven transition from a triangular
lattice to a honeycomb lattice. Other transitions and lattice geometries are
driven at constant field by changes in the temperature-dependent ratio of
charge and spin stiffnesses, including a transition through an aperiodic vortex
structure.
