We investigated the orbital magnetic moment of electron in the hydrogen atom
in deformed space with minimal length. It turned out that corrections to the
magnetic moment caused by deformation depend on one parameter in the presence
of two-parametric deformation. It is interesting to note that the correction to
orbital magnetic moment is similar to the correction that follows from
relativistic theory but it has an opposite sign. Using the upper bound for
minimal length obtained in previous papers we estimated the upper bound for
relative correction to orbital magnetic moment and obtained the value $\sim
10^{-12}$. This is four power less than the relative error for most recent
experimental values of Bohr magneton.
