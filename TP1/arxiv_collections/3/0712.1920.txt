In this article mixed CuInP$_2$(S$_x$Se$_{1-x}$)$_6$ crystals were
investigated by broadband dielectric spectroscopy (20 Hz - 3 GHz). From these
results the complete phase diagram has been obtained. In the middle part of the
phase diagram the dipolar glass phase has been observed. The phase diagram of
investigated crystals is strongly asymmetric - the decreasing of ferroelectric
phase transition temperatures in CuInP$_2$(S$_x$Se$_{1-x}$)$_6$ is much more
flat with small admixture of sulphur then with small admixture of selenium. In
boundary region between ferroelectric order and dipolar glass disorder with
small amount of sulphur at low temperatures the nonergodic relaxor phase
appears. The phase diagram was discussed in terms of random bonds and random
fields.
