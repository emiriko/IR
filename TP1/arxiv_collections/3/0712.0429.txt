The strong interactions of the negative-parity heavy mesons with $\rho$ meson
may be described consistently in the context of an effective lagrangian, which
is invariant under isospin SU(2) transformation. Four coupling constants
$g_{HH\rho}$, $f_{H^*H\rho}$, $g_{H^*H^*\rho}$ and $f_{H^*H^*\rho}$ enter the
effective lagrangian, where $H$ $(H^*)$ denotes a pseudoscalar bottom or charm
meson (the corresponding vector meson). Using QCD light cone sum rule (LCSR)
method and, as inputs, the hadronic parameters updated recently, we give an
estimate of $g_{H^*H^*\rho}$ and $f_{H^*H^*\rho}$, about which little was known
before, and present an improved result for $g_{HH\rho}$ and $f_{H^*H\rho}$.
Also, we examine the heavy quark asymptotic behavior of these nonperturbative
quantities and assess the two low energy parameters $\beta$ and $\lambda$ of
the corresponding effective chiral lagrangian.
