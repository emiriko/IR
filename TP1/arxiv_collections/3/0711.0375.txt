We study the formation of vortices in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) that
has been prepared by allowing isolated and independent condensed fragments to
merge together. We focus on the experimental setup of Scherer {\it et al.}
[Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 98}, 110402 (2007)], where three BECs are created in a
magnetic trap that is segmented into three regions by a repulsive optical
potential; the BECs merge together as the optical potential is removed. First,
we study the two-dimensional case, in particular we examine the effects of the
relative phases of the different fragments and the removal rate of the optical
potential on the vortex formation. We find that many vortices are created by
instant removal of the optical potential regardless of relative phases, and
that fewer vortices are created if the intensity of the optical potential is
gradually ramped down and the condensed fragments gradually merge. In all
cases, self-annihilation of vortices of opposite charge is observed. We also
find that for sufficiently long barrier ramp times, the initial relative phases
between the fragments leave a clear imprint on the resulting topological
configuration. Finally, we study the three-dimensional system and the formation
of vortex lines and vortex rings due to the merger of the BEC fragments; our
results illustrate how the relevant vorticity is manifested for appropriate
phase differences, as well as how it may be masked by the planar projections
observed experimentally.
