Highly excited nuclear matter created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion
collisions possibly reaches the phase of quark deconfinement. It quickly cools
down and hadronises. We explain that the process of hadronisation may likely be
connected with disintegration into fragments. Observable signals of such a
scenario are proposed.
