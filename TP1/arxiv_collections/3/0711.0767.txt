A family of unusually stable boron cages was identified and examined using
first-principles local density functional method. The structure of the
fullerenes is similar to that of the B12 icosahedron and consists of six
crossing double-rings. The energetically most stable fullerene is made up of
180 boron atoms. A connection between the fullerene family and its precursors,
boron sheets, is made. We show that the most stable boron sheets are not
necessarily precursors of very stable boron cages. Our finding is a step
forward in the understanding of the structure of the recently produced boron
nanotubes.
