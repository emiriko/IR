This article is aimed at improving the description of lepton-nucleus
interactions in the sub-GeV energy range. Approximate spectral functions for
oxygen, calcium, and argon are constructed and used to obtain the electron
cross sections in a given scattering angle. Comparison with a sample of
available experimental data shows satisfactory agreement. Discrepancy between
the presented model and the systematic computations available for oxygen [O.
Benhar et al., Phys. Rev. D 72, 053005 (2005)] is also found to be very small.
Analysis of appropriate kinematical regions leads to the conclusion that the
obtained argon spectral function should describe well neutrino scattering in
the 800-MeV energy region. Several approximations used in the model are
critically reviewed. All the details needed to implement the presented approach
in Monte Carlo simulations are given.
