We use a multiscale procedure to derive a simple continuum model of
multiwalled carbon nanotubes that takes into account both strong covalent bonds
within graphene layers and weak bonds between atoms in different layers. The
model predicts polygonization of crossections of large multiwalled nanotubes as
a consequence of their curvature-induced turbostratic structure.
