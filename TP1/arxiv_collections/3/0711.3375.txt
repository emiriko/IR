We introduce a controlled form of recursion in XQuery, inflationary fixed
points, familiar in the context of relational databases. This imposes
restrictions on the expressible types of recursion, but we show that
inflationary fixed points nevertheless are sufficiently versatile to capture a
wide range of interesting use cases, including the semantics of Regular XPath
and its core transitive closure construct.
  While the optimization of general user-defined recursive functions in XQuery
appears elusive, we will describe how inflationary fixed points can be
efficiently evaluated, provided that the recursive XQuery expressions exhibit a
distributivity property. We show how distributivity can be assessed both,
syntactically and algebraically, and provide experimental evidence that XQuery
processors can substantially benefit during inflationary fixed point
evaluation.
