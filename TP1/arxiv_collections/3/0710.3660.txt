The electric quadrupole moment for the $5d^{2}D_{3/2}$ state of
$\mathrm{^{171}Yb^{+}}$, has been calculated using the relativistic
coupled-cluster method. Earlier a similar calculation was performed for the 4d
$^2D_{5/2}$ state of $\mathrm{^{88}Sr^{+}}$ which is the most accurate
determination to date {[}PRL, \textbf{96}, 193001 (2006)]. The present
calculation of the electric quadrupole moment of $\mathrm{^{171}Yb^{+}}$
yielded a value $2.157 ea_{0}^{2}$ where the experimental value is
$2.08(11)ea_{0}^{2}$; $a_{0}$ is the Bohr radius and $e$ the elementary charge.
We discuss in this paper our results in detail for $^{171}{\rm Yb}^{+}$ and
highlight the dominant correlation effects present. We have presented the
effect of inner core excitations and their contribution to the electric
quadrupole moment, which is a property sensitive to regions away from the
nucleus.
