The conclusions of the Physics Working Group of the international scoping
study of a future Neutrino Factory and super-beam facility (the ISS) are
presented. The ISS was carried by the international community between NuFact05,
(the 7th International Workshop on Neutrino Factories and Superbeams,
Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati, Rome, June 21-26, 2005) and NuFact06 (Ivine,
California, 24{30 August 2006). The physics case for an extensive experimental
programme to understand the properties of the neutrino is presented and the
role of high-precision measurements of neutrino oscillations within this
programme is discussed in detail. The performance of second generation
super-beam experiments, beta-beam facilities, and the Neutrino Factory are
evaluated and a quantitative comparison of the discovery potential of the three
classes of facility is presented. High-precision studies of the properties of
the muon are complementary to the study of neutrino oscillations. The Neutrino
Factory has the potential to provide extremely intense muon beams and the
physics potential of such beams is discussed in the final section of the
report.
