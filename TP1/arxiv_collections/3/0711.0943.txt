We study a class of quantum measurement models. A microscopic object is
entangled with a macroscopic pointer such that each eigenvalue of the measured
object observable is tied up with a specific pointer deflection. Different
pointer positions mutually decohere under the influence of a bath.
Object-pointer entanglement and decoherence of distinct pointer readouts
proceed simultaneously. Mixtures of macroscopically distinct object-pointer
states may then arise without intervening macroscopic superpositions.
Initially, object and apparatus are statistically independent while the latter
has pointer and bath correlated according to a metastable local thermal
equilibrium. We obtain explicit results for the object-pointer dynamics with
temporal coherence decay in general neither exponential nor Gaussian. The
decoherence time does not depend on details of the pointer-bath coupling if it
is smaller than the bath correlation time, whereas in the opposite Markov
regime the decay depends strongly on whether that coupling is Ohmic or
super-Ohmic.
