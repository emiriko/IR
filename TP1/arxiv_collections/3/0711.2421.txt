Recently Baumann et al. [arXiv:0709.3228v1] studied the phase-ordering
kinetics of the two-dimensional Ising model with uniform spatially quenched
disorder by Monte-Carlo simulations. They found that the two-time response and
correlation functions are in agreement with the predictions of local scale
invariance generalised to z!=2. The present paper shows why this is not true
and suggests an alternative approach which leads to a much better agreement
with the numerical results.
