The aim of this paper is to propose an approach based on the concept of
annotation for supporting design communication. In this paper, we describe a
co-operative design case study where we analyse some annotation practices,
mainly focused on design minutes recorded during project reviews. We point out
specific requirements concerning annotation needs. Based on these requirements,
we propose an annotation model, inspired from the Speech Act Theory (SAT) to
support communication in a 3D digital environment. We define two types of
annotations in the engineering design context, locutionary and illocutionary
annotations. The annotations we describe in this paper are materialised by a
set of digital artefacts, which have a semantic dimension allowing
express/record elements of technical justifications, traces of contradictory
debates, etc. In this paper, we first clarify the semantic annotation concept,
and we define general properties of annotations in the engineering design
context, and the role of annotations in different design project situations.
After the description of the case study, where we observe and analyse
annotations usage during the design reviews and minute making, the last section
is dedicated to present our approach. We then describe the SAT concept, and
define the concept of annotation acts. We conclude with a description of basic
annotation functionalities that are actually implemented in a software, based
on our approach.
