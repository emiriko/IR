The phase diagram of the classical \jj model on the \kag lattice is
investigated using extensive \mc simulations. In a realistic range of
parameters, this model has a low-temperature chiral-ordered phase without
long-range spin order. We show that the critical transition marking the
destruction of chiral order is preempted by the first order proliferation of
\Zdeux point defects. The core energy of these vortices appears to vanish when
approaching the T=0 phase boundary, where both \Zdeux defects and gapless
magnons contribute to disordering the system at very low temperature. This
situation might be typical of a large class of frustrated magnets. Possible
relevance for real materials is also discussed.
