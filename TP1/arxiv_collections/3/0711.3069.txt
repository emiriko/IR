Inclusive beauty quark production in photon-photon collisions at CERN LEP2 is
considered in the framework of the kt-factorization approach. Both direct and
resolved photon contributions are taken into account. The unintegrated gluon
distributions in a photon are either obtained from the full CCFM evolution
equation or from the Kimber-Martin-Ryskin prescription. The predicted beauty
cross section reasonably agrees with the recent experimental data taken by the
ALEPH collaboration. We argue that theoretical and experimental studies of the
azimuthal correlations in heavy quark production at high energies can serve as
a crucial probe of the unintegrated gluon densities.
