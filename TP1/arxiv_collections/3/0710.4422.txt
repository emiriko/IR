We present our updated results of the nucleon-nucleon potential in quenched
lattice QCD simulations with the plaquette gauge action and the Wilson quark
action on the 32^4(\simeq (4.4 fm)^4) lattice. From the equal-time
Bethe-Salpeter (BS) wave function, the NN potential is constructed through the
Schroedinger-type equation. Resulting NN potential has all the qualitative
features which phenomenological potentials commonly have: the repulsive core at
short distance and the attractive well at medium and long distances. In the L
\to \infty limit, our NN potential is guaranteed to reproduce the scattering
length obtained from the Luescher's formula. The quark mass dependence of the
NN potential is studied with m_{pi} \sim 380, 529, 731 MeV. The results suggest
that both the repulsive core at short distance and the attractive well at
medium distance are enhanced in the light quark mass region.
