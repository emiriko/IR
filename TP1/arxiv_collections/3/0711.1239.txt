CKM-unitarity, direct and indirect CP-violation and the \Delta I=1/2 rule in
full lattice QCD are the focus of this talk. To this end I will discuss and
compare recent lattice results for leptonic, semi-leptonic and non-leptonic
decays of the kaon and neutral kaon mixing and I will motivate current best
estimates f_K/f_\pi=1.198(10), f_+^{K\pi}(0)=0.964(5) and \hat{B}_K=0.720(39).
Moreover new theoretical advances that will improve the quality of these
computations in the future will be discussed.
