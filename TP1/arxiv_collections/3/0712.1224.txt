Anonymization is the process of removing or hiding sensitive information in
logs. Anonymization allows organizations to share network logs while not
exposing sensitive information. However, there is an inherent trade off between
the amount of information revealed in the log and the usefulness of the log to
the client (the utility of a log). There are many anonymization techniques, and
there are many ways to anonymize a particular log (that is, which fields to
anonymize and how). Different anonymization policies will result in logs with
varying levels of utility for analysis. In this paper we explore the effect of
different anonymization policies on logs. We provide an empirical analysis of
the effect of varying anonymization policies by looking at the number of alerts
generated by an Intrusion Detection System. This is the first work to
thoroughly evaluate the effect of single field anonymization policies on a data
set. Our main contributions are to determine a set of fields that have a large
impact on the utility of a log.
