The compounds, PrCo9Si4 and NdCo9Si4, have been recently reported to exhibit
first-order ferromagnetic transitions near 24 K. We have subjected this
compound for further characterization by magnetization, heat-capacity and
electrical resistivity measurements at low temperatures in the presence of
magnetic fields, particularly to probe magnetocaloric effect and
magnetoresistance. The compounds are found to exhibit rather modest
magnetocaloric effect at low temperatures peaking at Curie temperature,
tracking the behavior of magnetoresistance. The magnetic transition does not
appear to be first order in its character.
