A diluted FCC magnet with modified long-range RKKY interaction and arbitrary
Ising spin S is considered within two-sublattice model. In the molecular field
approximation the Gibbs free-energy is derived, from which all magnetic
thermodynamic properties can be self-consistently obtained. In particular, the
phase diagrams are studied for different magnetic ion and free-charge
concentration, the atomic short-range-order (Warren-Cowley) parameter being
taken into account.
