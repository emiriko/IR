Applicability of classical Lifshitz-Slyozov theory of Ostwald ripening is
analyzed and found limited by relatively large cluster sizes due to
restrictions imposed by theoretical assumptions. An assumption about the steady
state ripening regime poses an upper limit, while another, implicit assumption
of continuous description poses a cluster size-dependent lower limit on the
supersaturation level. These two limits mismatch for the clusters under certain
size in the nanometer scale making the theory inapplicable. We present a more
generic, molecular theory of Ostwald ripening, which reproduces classical
Lifshitz-Slyozov and Wagner theories in appropriate extreme cases. This theory
has a wider applicability than classical theories, especially at lower
supersaturation levels, and is more suitable for nanoscale systems.
