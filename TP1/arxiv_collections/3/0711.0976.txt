We propose the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) and superfluidity of
quasi-two-dimensional (2D) spatially indirect magnetobiexcitons in a slab of
superlattice with alternating electron and hole layers consisting from the
semiconducting quantum wells (QWs) and graphene superlattice in high magnetic
field. The two different Hamiltonians of a dilute gas of magnetoexcitons with a
dipole-dipole repulsion in superlattices consisting of both QWs and graphene
layers in the limit of high magnetic field have been reduced to one effective
Hamiltonian a dilute gas of two-dimensional excitons without magnetic field.
Moreover, for $N$ excitons we have reduced the problem of $2N\times 2$
dimensional space onto the problem of $N\times 2$ dimensional space by
integrating over the coordinates of the relative motion of an electron (e) and
a hole (h). The instability of the ground state of the system of interacting
two-dimensional indirect magnetoexcitons in a slab of superlattice with
alternating electron and hole layers in high magnetic field is established. The
stable system of indirect quasi-two-dimensional magnetobiexcitons, consisting
of pair of indirect excitons with opposite dipole moments is considered. The
density of superfluid component $n_{s}(T)$ and the temperature of the
Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition to the superfluid state in the system of
two-dimensional indirect magnetobiexcitons, interacting as electrical
quadrupoles, are obtained for both QW and graphene realizations.
