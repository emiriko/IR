Rotating charged Gauss-Bonnet black hole solutions in higher dimensional ($d
>4$), asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime are obtained in the small angular
momentum limit. The angular momentum, magnetic dipole moment, and the
gyromagnetic ratio of the black holes are calculated and it turns out that the
Gauss-Bonnet term does not affect to the gyromagnetic ratio.
