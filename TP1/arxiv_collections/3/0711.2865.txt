We obtain an analytical lower bound of entanglement quantified by concurrence
for arbitrary bipartite quantum states. It is shown that our bound is tight for
some mixed states and is complementary to the previous known lower bounds. On
the other hand, it is known that the entanglement monogamy inequality proposed
by Coffman, Kundu, and Wootters is in general not true for higher dimensional
quantum states. Inducing from the new lower bound of concurrence, we find a
proper form of entanglement monogamy inequality for arbitrary quantum states.
