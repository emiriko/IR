We report on a search for compositeness in ee+gamma events and a search for
gauge-mediated supersymmetry in gamma+gamma+met events. We also report on two
signature-based searches for anomalous production of gamma + gamma + X (where
X=e, mu, gamma, met) and gamma + lepton + X. The analyses are based on 0.9--1.2
fb-1 of data from p-pbar collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV collected with the CDF
and D0 detectors at the Fermilab Tevatron. No significant excess of data over
the predicted background has been observed.
