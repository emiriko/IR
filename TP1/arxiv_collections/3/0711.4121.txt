We propose an improved method of the equation of motion approach to study the
Kondo problem in spin-dependent non-equilibrium conditions. We find that the
previously introduced additional renormalization for non-equilibrium Kondo
effects is not required when we use a proper decoupling scheme. Our improved
formulation is then applied to address the spin-split Kondo peaks when a spin
current injects into a Kondo system.
