We consider a 3-brane embedded in a warped 5-dimensional background with a
dilaton and a Kalb-Ramond 2-form. We show that it is possible to find static
solutions of the form of charged dS/AdS-like black hole with horizon which
could have a negative mass parameter. The motion of the 3-brane in this bulk
generates an effective 4-dimensional bouncing cosmology induced by the negative
dark radiation term. This model avoids the instability that arises for bouncing
brane in a Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m-AdS bulk.
