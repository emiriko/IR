Recent developments in phenomenological analysis of the CLAS data on 2$\pi$
electroproduction are presented. The contributions from isobar channels and
$P_{11}(1440)$, $D_{13}(1520)$ electrocouplings at $Q^{2}$ from 0.25 to 0.6
GeV$^2$ were determined from the analysis of comprehensive data on differential
and fully integrated 2$\pi$ cross sections. Experiment Numbers: E94-005 Group:
