We study the superstring theory with an Abelian worldsheet gauge field. The
components of the gauge field appear as a space and a time coordinates. We call
them as "fictitious coordinates". The worldsheet supersymmetry and the
Poincar\'e symmetry of this model will be analyzed. The $T$-duality and
quantization of the two fictitious coordinates also will be obtained.
