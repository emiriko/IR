We report observations of stable bound pairs in very dilute deionized aqueous
suspensions of highly charged polystyrene colloidal particles, with monovalent
counterions, using a confocal laser scanning microscope. Through an analysis of
several thousands of time series of confocal images recorded deep inside the
bulk suspension, we find that the measured pair-potential, U(r) has a
long-range attractive component with well depths larger than the thermal
energy. These observations provide a direct and unequivocal evidence for the
existence of long-range attraction in U(r) of like-charged colloidal particles.
