In order to better understand the transition from quantum to classical
behavior in spin system, electron magnetic resonance (EMR) is studied in
suspensions of superparamagnetic magnetite nanoparticles with an average
diameter of ~ 9 nm and analyzed in comparison with the results obtained in the
maghemite particles of smaller size (~ 5 nm). It is shown that both types of
particles demonstrate common EMR behavior, including special features such as
the temperature-dependent narrow spectral component and multiple-quantum
transitions. These features are common for small quantum systems and not
expected in classical case. The relative intensity of these signals rapidly
decreases with cooling or increase of particle size, marking gradual transition
to the classical FMR behavior.
