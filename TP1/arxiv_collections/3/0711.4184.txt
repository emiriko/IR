We discuss the relation between the superradiance phenomenon and the
instability of rotating black holes in higher dimensions. In particular, we
point out that the superradiant instability of a massless scalar field around a
simply rotating Kerr-adS black hole implies the gravitational instability of
that black hole for tensor-type perturbations.
