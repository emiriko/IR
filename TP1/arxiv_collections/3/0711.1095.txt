We consider transient one-dimensional random walks in random environment with
zero asymptotic speed. An aging phenomenon involving the generalized Arcsine
law is proved using the localization of the walk at the foot of "valleys" of
height $\log t$. In the quenched setting, we also sharply estimate the
distribution of the walk at time $t$.
