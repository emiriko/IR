We propose a robust spectral beam combining scheme using wavelength dependent
polarisation rotators and polarization beam combiners. We successfully
demonstrated the concept for two Yb-doped fiber lasers at 1064nm and 1092nm up
to a total input power of 90W. The results reveal a very good combining
efficiency and the potential for scaling to high power operations in this
method of beam combining.
