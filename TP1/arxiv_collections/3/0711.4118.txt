We present a simple derivation of the entanglement entropy for a region made
up of a union of disjoint intervals in 1+1 dimensional quantum field theories
using holographic techniques. This generalizes the results for 1+1 dimensional
conformal field theories derived previously by exploiting the uniformization
map. We further comment on the generalization of our result to higher
dimensional field theories.
