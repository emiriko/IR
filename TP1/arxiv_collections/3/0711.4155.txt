In this article I deal with the notion of observation in the most fundamental
sense and its representation by means of formal languages serving as
expressional tools of formal-axiomatical theories. In doing so, I have taken
this notion in two diverse contexts. In the first as an epistemic notion that
refers to its interpretation in a formal mathematical environment and then to
its interpretation in a quantum mechanical environment. The second context in
which I tried to approach the notion of observation is that of a
phenomenological constitution basically as it is described in E. Husserl's
original works. Assuming that in phenomenological constitution mathematical
objects are special cases of perceptual objects including consequently objects
of a quantum mechanical measurement, the question is to inquire on the limits
of their description in the language of a formal-axiomatical theory. On one
hand, I derive an irreducibility on the level of observables as indecomposable
atoms without any further syntactical content in formal representation and on
the other a transcendence of a continuous substratum self-constituted as a kind
of impredicative synthetic unity on which to define an observational frame and
generate a predicative universe of discourse.
