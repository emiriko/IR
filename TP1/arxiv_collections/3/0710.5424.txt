The subject of heavy flavour decays as probes for physics beyond the TeV
scale is covered from the experimental perspective. Emphasis is placed on the
more traditional Beyond the Standard Model topics that have potential for
impact in the short term, with the physics explained. We do unabashedly promote
our own phemonenology work.
