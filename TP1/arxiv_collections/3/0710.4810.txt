Securing communication channels is especially needed in wireless
environments. But applying cipher mechanisms in software is limited by the
calculation and energy resources of the mobile devices. If hardware is applied
to realize cryptographic operations cost becomes an issue. In this paper we
describe an approach which tackles all these three points. We implemented a
hardware accelerator for polynomial multiplication in extended Galois fields
(GF) applying Karatsuba's method iteratively. With this approach the area
consumption is reduced to 2.1 mm^2 in comparison to. 6.2 mm^2 for the standard
application of Karatsuba's method i.e. for recursive application. Our approach
also reduces the energy consumption to 60 per cent of the original approach.
The price we have to pay for these achievement is the increased execution time.
In our implementation a polynomial multiplication takes 3 clock cycles whereas
the recurisve Karatsuba approach needs only one clock cycle. But considering
area, energy and calculation speed we are convinced that the benefits of our
approach outweigh its drawback.
