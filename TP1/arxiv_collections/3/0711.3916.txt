We show that the Bianchi I Einstein field equations in a perfect fluid scalar
field cosmology are equivalent to a linear Schrodinger equation. This is
achieved through a special case of the recent FLRW Schrodinger-type
formulation, and provides an alternate method of obtaining exact solutions of
the Bianchi I equations.
