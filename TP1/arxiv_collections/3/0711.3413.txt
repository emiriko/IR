We propose a fast and versatile algorithm to calculate local and transport
properties such as conductance, shot noise, local density of state or local
currents in mesoscopic quantum systems. Within the non equilibrium Green
function formalism, we generalize the recursive Green function technique to
tackle multiterminal devices with arbitrary geometries. We apply our method to
analyze two recent experiments: an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer in a
2D gas and a Hall bar made of graphene nanoribbons in quantum Hall regime. In
the latter case, we find that the Landau edge state pinned to the Dirac point
gets diluted upon increasing carrier density.
