First, we use the theory of characteristics of first order partial
differential equations to derive the guiding equation directly from the Quantum
Evolution Equation (QEE). After obtaining the general result, we apply it to a
set of evolution equations (Schroedinger, Pauli, Klein-Gordon, Dirac) to show
how the guiding equation is, actually, the characteristic velocity of the
corresponding matter field equations.
