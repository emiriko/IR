Experimental searches for modifications of vector mesons in the nuclear
medium are reviewed. Data on $\rho,\omega$ and $\Phi$ mesons are presented. The
results have been obtained in elementary reactions with proton and photon beams
as well as in heavy-ion collisions. Compared to the free particle properties,
the $\omega$ and $\Phi$ meson are found to drop in mass at normal nuclear
matter density by 9-14% and 3.5% whereas their widths are reported to increase
by factors of about 16 and 3.6, respectively. For the $\rho$ meson, conflicting
results on in-medium mass shifts and broadening have been published. The
experimental data are compared to recent model calculations.
