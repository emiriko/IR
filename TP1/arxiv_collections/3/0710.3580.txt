The availability of computational modeling tools for subatomic physics (Form,
FeynArts, FormCalc, and FeynCalc) has made it possible to perform sophisticated
calculations in perturbative quantum field theory. We have adapted these
packages in order to apply them to the effective chiral field theory of
hadronic interactions. A detailed description of this Computational Hadronic
Model is presented here, along with sample calculations.
