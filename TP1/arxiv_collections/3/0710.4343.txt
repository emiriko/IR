In this paper we discuss a general algebraic approach to treating static
equations of matrix models with a mass-like term. In this approach the
equations of motions are considered as consequence of parafermi-like trilinear
commutation relations. In this context we consider several solutions, including
construction of noncommutative spheres. The equivalence of fuzzy spheres and
parafermions is underlined.
