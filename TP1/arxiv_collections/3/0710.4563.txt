We present the highlights of the current identified strange particles
DeltaPhi and DeltaEta correlations analyses, including system-size and
trigger-pT of the jet and ridge, jet, ridge and away-side meson/baryon ratios,
and the current state of the multi-strange baryon analysis. We see clear
azimuthal peaks of comparable strength for all strange baryons and K0-short
mesons. We see no observable species dependence on the same-side jet or ridge
yields as a function of pT. However, while the away side and the ridge have
Lambda to K0-short ratio similar to that of the bulk, the jet-only ratio is
similar to that in $p+p$. The implications of these findings on current
in-medium jet theoretical explanations are discussed.
