The influences of an impurity on the spin and the charge transport of
one-dimensional antisymmetric spin filter are investigated using bosonization
and Keldysh formulation and the results are highlighted against those of
spinful Luttinger liquids. Due to the dependence of the electron spin
orientation on wave number the spin transport is not affected by the impurity,
while the charge transport is essentially identical with that of spinless
one-dimensional Luttinger liquid.
