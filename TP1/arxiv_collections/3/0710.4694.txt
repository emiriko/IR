We propose an approach to optimally synthesize quantum circuits from
non-permutative quantum gates such as Controlled-Square-Root-of-Not (i.e.
Controlled-V). Our approach reduces the synthesis problem to multiple-valued
optimization and uses group theory. We devise a novel technique that transforms
the quantum logic synthesis problem from a multi-valued constrained
optimization problem to a group permutation problem. The transformation enables
us to utilize group theory to exploit the properties of the synthesis problem.
Assuming a cost of one for each two-qubit gate, we found all reversible
circuits with quantum costs of 4, 5, 6, etc, and give another algorithm to
realize these reversible circuits with quantum gates.
