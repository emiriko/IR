This paper presents a new approach for code similarity on High Level
programs. Our technique is based on Fast Dynamic Time Warping, that builds a
warp path or points relation with local restrictions. The source code is
represented into Time Series using the operators inside programming languages
that makes possible the comparison. This makes possible subsequence detection
that represent similar code instructions. In contrast with other code
similarity algorithms, we do not make features extraction. The experiments show
that two source codes are similar when their respective Time Series are
similar.
