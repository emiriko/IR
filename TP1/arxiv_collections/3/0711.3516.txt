We investigate the effect of unparticles in the pure $ b \to d $ penguin
processes $ B^0 \to K^0 \bar K^0$ and $B^{+,0} \to \phi \pi^{+,0} $. Since
these processes receive dominant contributions due to the {\it top} quark in
the loop, direct and mixing-induced CP asymmetry parameters in these processes
are expected to be vanishingly small in the standard model. We find that due to
the unparticle effect sizable nonzero CP violation could be possible in these
channels.
