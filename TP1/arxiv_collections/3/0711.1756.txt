We study numerically the effects of static imperfections and residual
couplings between qubits for the quantum phase estimation algorithm with two
qubits. We show that the success probability of the algorithm is affected
significantly more by static imperfections than by random noise errors in
quantum gates. An improvement of the algorithm accuracy can be reached by
application of the Pauli-random-error-correction method (PAREC).
