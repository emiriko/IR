We have experimentally investigated the density of states (DOS) in Nb/Ni
(S/F) bilayers as a function of Ni thickness, $d_F$. Our thinnest samples show
the usual DOS peak at $\pm\Delta_0$, whereas intermediate-thickness samples
have an anomalous ``double-peak'' structure. For thicker samples ($d_F \geq
3.5$ nm), we see an ``inverted'' DOS which has previously only been reported in
superconductor/weak-ferromagnet structures. We analyze the data using the
self-consistent non-linear Usadel equation and find that we are able to
quantitatively fit the features at $\pm\Delta_0$ if we include a large amount
of spin-orbit scattering in the model. Interestingly, we are unable to
reproduce the sub-gap structure through the addition of any parameter(s).
Therefore, the observed anomalous sub-gap structure represents new physics
beyond that contained in the present Usadel theory.
