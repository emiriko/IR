We propose a novel scheme to generate polarization entanglement from
spatially-correlated photon pairs. We experimentally realized a scheme by means
of a spatial correlation effect in a spontaneous parametric down-conversion and
a modified Michelson interferometer. The scheme we propose in this paper can be
interpreted as a conversion process from spatial correlation to polarization
entanglement.
