We propose a manifestly U-duality invariant modular form for the D^6 R^4
interaction in the effective action of type IIB string theory compactified on
T^2. It receives perturbative contributions upto genus three, as well as
non-perturbative contributions from D-instantons and (p,q) string instantons
wrapping T^2. Our construction is based on constraints coming from string
perturbation theory, U-duality, the decompactification limit to ten dimensions,
and the equality of the perturbative part of the amplitude in type IIA and type
IIB string theories. Using duality, parts of the perturbative amplitude are
also shown to match exactly the results obtained from eleven dimensional
supergravity compactified on T^3 at one loop. We also obtain parts of the genus
one and genus k amplitudes for the D^{2k} R^4 interaction for arbitrary k > 3.
We enhance a part of this amplitude to a U-duality invariant modular form.
