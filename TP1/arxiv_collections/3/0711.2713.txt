We report results of a search for CPT and Lorentz violation in B0-B0bar
oscillations using inclusive dilepton events from 232 million Y(4S) --> BBbar
decays recorded by the BABAR detector at the PEP-II B Factory at SLAC. We find
2.8sigma significance, compatible with no signal, for variations in the complex
CPT violation parameter z at the Earth's sidereal frequency and extract values
for the quantities \Delta(a_\mu) in the general Lorentz-violating
standard-model extension. The spectral powers for variations in z over the
frequency range 0.26/year to 2.1/day are also compatible with no signal.
