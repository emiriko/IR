In Phys. Rev. A 62, 062314 (2000), D\"{u}r, Vidal and Cirac indicated that
there are infinitely many SLOCC classes for four qubits. Verstraete, Dehaene,
and Verschelde in Phys. Rev. A 65, 052112 (2002) proposed nine families of
states corresponding to nine different ways of entangling four qubits. In Phys.
Rev. A 75, 022318 (2007), Lamata et al. reported that there are eight true
SLOCC entanglement classes of four qubits up to permutations of the qubits. In
this paper, we investigate SLOCC classification of the nine families proposed
by Verstraete, Dehaene and Verschelde, and distinguish 49 true SLOCC
entanglement classes from them.
