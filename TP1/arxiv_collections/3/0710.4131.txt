Excited state soliton stars are studied numerically for the first time. The
stability of spherically symmetric S-branch excited state oscillatons under
radial perturbations is investigated using a 1D code. We find that these stars
are inherently unstable either migrating to the ground state or collapsing to
black holes. Higher excited state configurations are observed to cascade
through intermediate excited states during their migration to the ground state.
This is similar to excited state boson stars. Ground state oscillatons are then
studied in full 3D numerical relativity. Finding the appropriate gauge
condition for the dynamic oscillatons is much more challenging than in the case
of boson stars. Different slicing conditions are explored, and a customized
gauge condition that approximates polar slicing in spherical symmetry is
implemented. Comparisons with 1D results and convergence tests are performed.
The behavior of these stars under small axisymmetric perturbations is studied
and gravitational waveforms are extracted. We find that the gravitational waves
damp out on a short timescale, enabling us to obtain the complete waveform.
This work is a starting point for the evolution of real scalar field systems
with arbitrary symmetries.
