We consider supersymmetric model with right-handed (s)neutrinos where the
neutrino masses are purely Dirac-type. We discuss cosmology based on such a
scenario, paying particular attention to the case that the gravitino is the
lightest superparticles (LSP) while the right-handed sneutrino is the next-LSP.
It will be shown that the cosmological constraints on the gravitino-LSP
scenario (in particular, those from the big-bang nucleosynthesis) are
drastically relaxed in such a case. We will also consider the implication of
such scenario to the structure formation.
