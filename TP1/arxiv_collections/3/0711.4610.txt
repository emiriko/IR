We obtain the exact renormalization map and plots of Lee-Yang and Fisher
zeros distributions for Potts models on a number of hierarchical lattices: the
diamond hierarchical lattice, a lattice we call spider web, the Sierpinski
gasket and cylinders. Such models are only examples among the ones we can study
in the general framework of hierarchical lattices, developed in a previous
paper.
