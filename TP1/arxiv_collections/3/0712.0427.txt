Why are "analogue spacetimes'' interesting? For the purposes of this workshop
the answer is simple: Analogue spacetimes provide one with physically
well-defined and physically well-understood concrete models of many of the
phenomena that seem to be part of the yet incomplete theory of "quantum
gravity'', or more accessibly, "quantum gravity phenomenology''. Indeed
"analogue spacetimes'' provide one with concrete models of "emergence''
(whereby the effective low-energy theory can be radically different from the
high-energy microphysics). They also provide many concrete and controlled
models of "Lorentz symmetry breaking'', and extensions of the usual notions of
pseudo-Riemannian geometry such as "rainbow spacetimes'', and pseudo-Finsler
geometries, and more. I will provide an overview of the key items of "unusual
physics'' that arise in analogue spacetimes, and argue that they provide us
with hints of what we should be looking for in any putative theory of "quantum
gravity''. For example: The dispersion relations that naturally arise in the
known emergent/analogue spacetimes typically violate analogue Lorentz
invariance at high energy, but do not do so in completely arbitrary manner.
This suggests that a search for arbitrary violations of Lorentz invariance is
possibly overkill: There are a number of natural and physically well-motivated
restrictions one can put on emergent/ analogue dispersion relations,
considerably reducing the plausible parameter space.
