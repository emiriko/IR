We consider a defect in a strongly correlated host metal and discuss, within
a slave boson mean field formalism for the $t-t'-J$ model, the formation of an
induced paramagnetic moment which is extended over nearby sites. We study in
particular an impurity in a metallic band, suitable for modelling the optimally
doped cuprates, in a regime where the impurity moment is paramagnetic. The form
of the local susceptibility as a function of temperature and doping is found to
agree well with recent NMR experiments, without including screening processes
leading to the Kondo effect.
