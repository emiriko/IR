Non-perturbative renormalisation of a general class of scalar field theories
is performed at the Hartree level truncation of the 2PI effective action in the
broken symmetry regime. Renormalised equations are explicitly constructed for
the one- and two-point functions. The non-perturbative counterterms are deduced
from the conditions for the cancellation of the overall and the subdivergences
in the complete Hartree-Dyson-Schwinger equations, with a transparent method.
The procedure proposed in the present paper is shown to be equivalent to the
iterative renormalisation method of Blaizot et al., Nucl. Phys. A736 (2004)
