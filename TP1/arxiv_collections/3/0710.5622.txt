Rydberg atoms provide a wide range of possibilities to tailor interactions in
a quantum gas. Here we report on Rydberg excitation of Bose-Einstein condensed
87Rb atoms. The Rydberg fraction was investigated for various excitation times
and temperatures above and below the condensation temperature. The excitation
is locally blocked by the van der Waals interaction between Rydberg atoms to a
density-dependent limit. Therefore the abrupt change of the thermal atomic
density distribution to the characteristic bimodal distribution upon
condensation could be observed in the Rydberg fraction. The observed features
are reproduced by a simulation based on local collective Rydberg excitations.
