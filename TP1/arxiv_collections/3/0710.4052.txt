We experimentally demonstrate Cs2 Feshbach molecules well above the
dissociation threshold, which are stable against spontaneous decay on the
timescale of one second. An optically trapped sample of ultracold dimers is
prepared in an l-wave state and magnetically tuned into a region with negative
binding energy. The metastable character of these molecules arises from the
large centrifugal barrier in combination with negligible coupling to states
with low rotational angular momentum. A sharp onset of dissociation with
increasing magnetic field is mediated by a crossing with a g-wave dimer state
and facilitates dissociation on demand with a well defined energy.
