We study analytical properties of the hard exclusive process amplitudes. We
found that QCD factorization for deeply virtual Compton scattering and hard
exclusive vector meson production results in the subtracted dispersion relation
with the subtraction constant determined by the Polyakov-Weiss $D$-term.
