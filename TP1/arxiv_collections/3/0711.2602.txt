Non-radiative optical energy transfer from a GaAs quantum well to a thin
overlayer of an infrared organic semiconductor dye is unambiguously
demonstrated. The dynamics of exciton transfer are studied in the time-domain
using pump-probe spectroscopy at the donor site and fluorescence spectroscopy
at the acceptor site. The effect is observed as simultaneous increase of the
population decay rate at the donor and of the rise time of optical emission at
the acceptor sites. The hybrid configuration under investigation provides an
alternative non-radiative, non-contact pumping route to electrical carrier
injection that overcomes the losses imposed by the associated low carrier
mobility of organic emitters.
