The Friedberg-Lee model is studied at finite temperature and density. By
using the finite temperature field theory, the effective potential of the
Friedberg-Lee model and the bag constant $B(T)$ and $B(T,\mu)$ have been
calculated at different temperatures and densities. It is shown that there is a
critical temperature $T_{C}\simeq 106.6 \mathrm{MeV}$ when $\mu=0 \mathrm{MeV}$
and a critical chemical potential $\mu \simeq 223.1 \mathrm{MeV}$ for fixing
the temperature at $T=50 \mathrm{MeV}$. We also calculate the soliton solutions
of the Friedberg-Lee model at finite temperature and density. It turns out that
when $T\leq T_{C}$ (or $\mu \leq \mu_C$), there is a bag constant $B(T)$ (or
$B(T,\mu)$) and the soliton solutions are stable. However, when $T>T_{C}$ (or
$\mu>\mu_C$) the bag constant $B(T)=0 \mathrm{MeV}$ (or $B(T,\mu)=0
\mathrm{MeV}$) and there is no soliton solution anymore, therefore, the
confinement of quarks disappears quickly.
