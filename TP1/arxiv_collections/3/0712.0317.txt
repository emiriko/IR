Azimuthal angle two particle correlations have been shown to be a powerful
probe for extracting novel features of jet induced correlations produced in
Au+Au collisions at RHIC. At intermediate $p_T$, 2-5GeV/c, the jets have been
shown to be significantly modified in both their particle composition and their
angular distribution compared to p+p collisions. Two-particle angular
correlations with identified particles provide sensitive probes of both the
interactions between hard scattered partons and the medium. The systematics of
these correlations are essential to understanding the physics of intermediate
$p_T$ in heavy ion collisions.
