The internal s-electron polarization in the ground state of a
Friedel-Anderson and a Kondo impurity is calculated. The Wilson basis with
exponentially fine energies close to the Fermi level is used and expressed in
terms of free electron waves with linear energy-momentum dispersion. It is
found that in the singlet state the magnetic moment of the d-electron is
screened by an s-electron cloud. The linear extension of the cloud is inversely
proportional to the Kondo energy. When the singlet state is destroyed the
polarization cloud is absent.
