We show that the relativistic hydrogen atom possesses an SO(4) symmetry by
introducing a kind of pseudo-spin vector operator. The same SO(4) symmetry is
still preserved in the relativistic quantum system in presence of an U(1)
monopolar vector potential as well as a nonabelian vector potential. Lamb shift
and SO(4) symmetry breaking are also discussed.
