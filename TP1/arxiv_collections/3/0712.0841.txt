We present a numerical simulation of the double slit interference experiment
realized by F. Shimizu, K. Shimizu and H. Takuma with ultracold atoms. We show
how the Feynman path integral method enables the calculation of the
time-dependent wave function. Because the evolution of the probability density
of the wave packet just after it exits the slits raises the issue of the
interpreting the wave/particle dualism, we also simulate trajectories in the de
Broglie-Bohm interpretation.
