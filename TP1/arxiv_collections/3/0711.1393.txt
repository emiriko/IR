Two next-generation high-energy experiments, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
and the $e^+e^-$ International Linear Collider (ILC), are highly expected to
unravel the new structure of matter and forces from the electroweak scale to
the TeV scale. In this talk we give a compelling but rather descriptive review
of the complementary role of LHC and ILC in drawing a comprehensive and high
precision picture of the mechanism breaking the electroweak symmetries and
generating mass, the unification of forces and the structure of spacetime.
Supersymmetry is exploited in this description as a prototype scenario of the
physics beyond the Standard Model.
