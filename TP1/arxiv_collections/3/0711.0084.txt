We present a variational method to calculate the exchange interactions among
donor clusters in a semiconductor. Such clusters are candidates for a so-called
control-qubit architecture for quantum information, where the effective
exchange coupling between two atoms is controlled by the electronic state of a
third. We use a combination of the effective-mass approximation and the quantum
defect method; our variational ansatz is particularly suited to cases where an
excited state of one of the donors (control) is partially delocalised over
several different centres, forming an analogue of an extended molecular
orbital. Our method allows calculations of the "on/off" ratios of exchange
interactions in such cases. We compare exchange interactions when the control
is in the "on" and "off" states, and find that both the magnitude and sign of
the exchange interactions may be changed. To rationalize the sign-change, we
carry out a simple Green's function perturbation-theory calculation. This
simple model qualitatively explains the sign change and illustrates its origins
both in ring-exchange processes and in the delocalization of the control
electron. We also compute probability distributions for the coupling strengths
over the ensemble of clusters, and show that excitation of the control causes
narrowing of the distributions along with shifts to larger magnitudes and from
anti-ferromagnetic to ferromagnetic coupling.
