Reduction in power consumption has become a major criterion of design in
modern ICs. One such scheme to reduce power consumption by an IC is the use of
multiple power supplies for critical and non-critical paths. To maintain the
impedance of a power distribution system below a specified level, multiple
decoupling capacitors are placed at different levels of power grid hierarchy.
This paper describes about three-voltage supply power distribution systems. The
noise at one power supply can propagate to the other power supply, causing
power and signal integrity problems in the overall system. Effects such as
anti-resonance and remedies for these effects are studied. Impedance of the
three-voltage supply power distribution system is calculated in terms of
RLC-model of decoupling capacitors. Further the obtained impedance depends on
the frequency; hence brief frequency analysis of impedance is done.
