The spontaneous breaking of of translational invariance in non-commutative
self-interacting scalar field theory in two dimensions is investigated by
effective action techniques. The analysis confirms the existence of the stripe
phase, already observed in lattice simulations, due to the non-local nature of
the non-commutative dynamics.
