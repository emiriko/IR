We review recent results in heavy quark hadron spectroscopy at the Tevatron.
With increasing data samples the Tevatron experiments start to uncover
information on the b-hadrons. Most important are the first observations of the
narrow Bs** as well as Sigma_b, Sigma_b* and Xi_b- baryons. In addition we
present updated results on the narrow B** and Bc mesons.
