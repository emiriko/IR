Strange particle production is an important experimental observable that
allows the study of the strongly interacting matter created in relativistic
heavy-ion collisions. The STAR experiment at RHIC has a unique capability of
measuring identified strange particles over a wide range of acceptance
providing a rich set of data to perform a systematic study. In addition to the
data from Au+Au collisions, strange particles from p+p and d+Au collisions are
also available for comparison and normalization. A new set of data from Cu+Cu
reactions at 62 GeV and 200 GeV provides the chance to compare the system size
dependence observed in Au+Au collisions with this smaller system size. In
addition to the comparison of the yields, a statistical thermal model was used
to extract freeze-out characteristics for the different system sizes and
collision energies.
