Hypothesis Testing Minority Game (HMG) is a variant of the standard Minority
Game (MG) that models the inertial behavior of agents in the market. In the
earlier study of our group, we find that agents cooperate better in HMG than in
the standard MG when strategies are picked from the full strategy space. Here
we continue to study the behavior of HMG when strategies are chosen from the
maximal reduced strategy space. Surprisingly, we find that, unlike the standard
MG, the level of cooperation in HMG depends strongly on the strategy space
used. In addition, a novel intermittency dynamics is also observed in the
minority choice time series in a certain parameter range in which the orderly
phases are characterized by a variety of periodic dynamics. Remarkably, all
these findings can be explained by the crowd-anticrowd theory.
