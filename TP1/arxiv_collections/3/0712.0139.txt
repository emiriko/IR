We propose a new ternary infinite (even full-infinite) square-free sequence.
The sequence is defined both by an iterative method and by a direct definition.
Both definitions are analogous to those of the Thue-Morse sequence. The direct
definition is given by a deterministic finite automaton with output. In short,
the sequence is automatic.
