We discuss the experimental results on the behavior of the average
multiplicities and angular distributions of slow particles emitted in
hadron-nuclear and nuclear-nuclear interactions at relativistic energies as a
function of the centrality of collisions. It is observed that by increasing the
mass of the projectiles the angular distributions of slow particles change and
the structure which was demonstrated in the case of pi-mesons, protons and
light nuclear projectiles, almost disappears. During the interaction of the
heavier projectile with nuclear target, the number of secondary interactions as
well as number of nucleon-nucleon elastic scattering and re-scattering events
increases. We suggest to restore this information using the heavy ion
generators taking into account the multiplicity distributions. Because our
investigations show that the formation of the percolation cluster sufficiently
influences the behaviour of the average multiplicity of the slow particles
emitted in these interactions.
