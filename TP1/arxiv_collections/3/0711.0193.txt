The entropy in the interior of the Universe has many contributions including
well understood ones from radiation and relic neutrinos. The gravitational
entropy is larger and more subtle. One contribution which provides our lower
bound is from supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. The
remainder is harder to pin down. We suggest an upper bound which is many orders
of magnitude below the holographic bound yet above that of the supermassive
black holes. We propose that gravitational entropy in dark matter halos is the
largest contributor to the present entropy of the universe.
