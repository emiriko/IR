The Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber (GRW) theory is a physical theory that, when
combined with a suitable ontology, provides an explanation of quantum
mechanics. The so-called collapse of the wave function is problematic in
conventional quantum theory but not in the GRW theory, in which it is governed
by a stochastic law. A possible ontology is the flash ontology, according to
which matter consists of random points in space-time, called flashes. The joint
distribution of these points, a point process in space-time, is the topic of
this work. The mathematical results concern mainly the existence and uniqueness
of this distribution for several variants of the theory. Particular attention
is paid to the relativistic version of the GRW theory that I developed in 2004.
