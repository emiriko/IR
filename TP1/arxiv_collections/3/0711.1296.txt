We present a microscopic Hamiltonian framework to develop Maxwell demon like
engine. Our model consists of a equilibrium thermal bath and a non-equilibrium
bath; latter generated by driving with an external stationary, Gaussian noise.
The engine we develop, can be considered as a device to extract work by
modifying internal fluctuations. Our theoretical analysis focusses on finding
the essential ingredients necessary for generating fluctuation induced
transport under non-equilibrium condition. An important outcome of our model is
that the net motion occurs when the non-linear bath is modulated by the
external noise, creating the non-zero effective temperature even when the
temperature of both the baths are same.
