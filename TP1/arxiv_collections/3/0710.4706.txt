This paper presents an infrastructure to test the functionality of the
specific architectures output by a high-level compiler targeting dynamically
reconfigurable hardware. It results in a suitable scheme to verify the
architectures generated by the compiler, each time new optimization techniques
are included or changes in the compiler are performed. We believe this kind of
infrastructure is important to verify, by functional simulation, further
research techniques, as far as compilation to Field-Programmable Gate Array
(FPGA) platforms is concerned.
