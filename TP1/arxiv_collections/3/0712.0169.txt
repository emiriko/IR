We consider contact line deposition and pattern formation of a pinned
evaporating thin drop. We identify and focus on the transport dynamics
truncated by the maximal concentration, proposed by Dupont, as the single
deposition mechanism. The truncated process, formalized as "pipe models",
admits a characteristic moving shock front solution that has a robust
functional form and depends only on local conditions. By applying the models,
we solve the deposition process and describe the deposit density profile in
different asymptotic regimes. In particular, near the contact line the density
profile follows a scaling law that is proportional to the square root of the
concentration ratio, and the maximal deposit density/thickness occurs at about
2/3 of the total drying time for uniform evaporation and 1/2 for
diffusion-controlled evaporation. Away from the contact line, we for the first
time identify the power-law decay of the deposit profile with respect to the
radial distance. In comparison, our work is consistent with and extends
previous results. We also predict features of the depinning process and
multiple-ring patterns within Dupont model, and our predictions are consistent
with empirical evidence.
