I impose previously neglected symmetry conditions in Leggett's non-local
hidden variable theory that are required by the conditions in a recent
experimental test of this theory. These conditions lead to an inequality for
the polarization correlation function that has a maximal violation from the
quantum predictions that is 2.5 times larger than reported in this article.
Furthermore, when these symmetry conditions are applicable, Leggett's non-local
theory also cannot model the observed quantum correlations in previous
experiments.
