We examine the proposal for constructing the effective action of a
D-brane-anti-D-brane system from the non-abelian extension of tachyon DBI
action. We consider two prescriptions for the trace in the non-abelian tachyon
DBI action. The usual trace and the symmetric trace prescription. The former
gives an action for the D\bar{D} system which reduces to the action proposed by
A.Sen for coincident branes. The latter gives a different action which is
consistent with the S-matrix element calculations.
