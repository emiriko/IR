We demonstrate interesting and previously unforeseen properties of a pair of
gap solitons in a resonant photonic crystal which are predicted and explained
in a physically transparent form using both analytical and numerical methods.
The most important result is the fact that an oscillating gap soliton created
by the presence of a localized population inversion inside the crystal can be
manipulated by means of a proper choice of bit rate, phase and amplitude
modulation. Developing this idea, we are able to obtain qualitatively different
regimes of a resonant photonic crystal operation. In particular, a noteworthy
observation is that both the delay time and amplitude difference must exceed a
certain level to ensure effective control over the soliton dynamics.
