The pair contact process with diffusion (PCPD) is studied with a standard
Monte Carlo approach and with simulations at fixed densities. A standard
analysis of the simulation results, based on the particle densities or on the
pair densities, yields inconsistent estimates for the critical exponents.
However, if a well-chosen linear combination of the particle and pair densities
is used, leading corrections can be suppressed, and consistent estimates for
the independent critical exponents delta=0.16(2), beta=0.28(2) and z=1.58 are
obtained. Since these estimates are also consistent with their values in
directed percolation (DP), we conclude that PCPD falls in the same universality
class as DP.
