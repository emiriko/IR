We experimentally study equilibration across the sample edge at high
fractional filling factors 4/3, 5/3 under experimental conditions, which allow
us to obtain high imbalance conditions. We find a lack of the full
equilibration across the edge even in the flat-band situation, where no
potential barrier survives at the sample edge. We interpret this result as the
manifestation of complicated edge excitation structure at high fractional
filling factors 4/3, 5/3. Also, a mobility gap in the $\nu_c=1$ incompressible
strip is determined in normal and tilted magnetic fields.
