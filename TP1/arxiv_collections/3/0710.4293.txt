We investigate the Yukawa sector for up-like quarks in the Lee's version of
the Littlest Higgs model. We derive general quark mass and mixing formulae and
study leading order contributions due to non-zero light quark masses. Relying
on the unitarity of the generalized quark mixing matrix we obtain corrections
to the CKM matrix elements. In this model FCNCs appear at the tree level and
using leading order contributions we obtain the FCNC couplings for the up-like
quark transitions. In light of recent experimental results on the D0 - D0bar
transition we make predictions for xD as well as the D to mu+ mu- decay rate.
Finally, we discuss probabilities for the t to c (u) Z transitions relevant for
the LHC studies.
