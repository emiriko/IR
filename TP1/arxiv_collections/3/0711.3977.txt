The main assumptions the Copenhagen quantum mechanics has been based on will
be summarized and the known (not yet decided) contradiction between Einstein
and Bohr will be newly analyzed. The given assumptions have been represented
basically by time-dependent Schroedinger equation, to which some further
assumptions have been added. Some critical comments have been raised against
the given mathematical model structure by Pauli (1933) and by Susskind and
Glogover (1964). They may be removed if only the Schroedinger equation is
conserved and the additional assumptions are abandoned, as shown recently. It
seems to be in contradiction to the numerous declarations that the Copenhagen
model has been approved by experimental results.
  However, in the most of these experiments only the agreement with the mere
Schroedinger equation has been tested. All mentioned assumptions have been
tested practically only in the EPR experiment (measurement of coincidence light
transmission through two polarizers) proposed originally by Einstein (1935).
Also these experimental results have been interpreted as supporting the
Copenhagen alternative, which has not been, however, true. In fact the
microscopic world may be described correspondingly only with the help of the
hidden-variable theory that is represented by the Schroedinger equation without
mentioned additional assumptions, which has the consequence that the earlier
interpretation gap between microscopic and macroscopic worlds has been removed.
The only difference concerns the existence of discrete states. The
possibilities of the human reason of getting to know the nature will be also
shortly discussed in the beginning of this contribution.
