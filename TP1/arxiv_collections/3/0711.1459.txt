We expound in detail the physics reach of an experimental set-up in which the
proposed large magnetized iron detector at the India-based Neutrino Observatory
(INO) would serve as the far detector for a so-called beta-beam. If this pure
$\nue$ and/or $\anue$ beam is shot from some source location like CERN such
that the source-detector distance $L \simeq 7500$ km, the impact of the CP
phase $\delta_{CP}$ on the oscillation probability and associated parameter
correlation and degeneracies are almost negligible. This ``magical'' beta-beam
experiment would have unprecedented sensitivity to the neutrino mass hierarchy
and $\theta_{13}$, two of the missing ingredients needed for our understanding
of the neutrino sector. With Lorentz boost $\gamma=650$ and irrespective of the
true value of $\delta_{CP}$, the neutrino mass hierarchy could be determined at
$3\sigma$ C.L. if $\sin^22\theta_{13}{\rm {(true)}} > 5.6 \times 10^{-4}$ and
we can expect an unambiguous signal for $\theta_{13}$ at $3\sigma$ C.L. if
$\sin^22\theta_{13}{\rm {(true)}} > 5.1 \times 10^{-4}$ independent of the true
neutrino mass hierarchy.
