We update constraints from B physics observables on the parameters of the
MSSM and the NMSSM, combining them with LEP constraints. Presently available SM
and Susy radiative corrections are included in the calculations, which will be
made public in the form of a Fortran code. Results for the tan(beta) and
M_{H^+} dependence of b -> s gamma are presented, as well as constraints on the
NMSSM specific case of a light CP odd Higgs scalar. We find that the latter are
essentially due to B_s -> mu^+ mu^-, but they do not exclude this possibility.
