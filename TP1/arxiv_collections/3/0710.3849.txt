We use the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) to study the
electrical discharge current fluctuations in plasma and show that it has
multifractal properties and behaves as a weak anti-correlated process.
Comparison of the MF-DFA results for the original series with those for the
shuffled and surrogate series shows that correlation of the fluctuations is
responsible for multifractal nature of the electrical discharge current.
