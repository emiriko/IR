We conjecture that criterion for perfect quantum teleportation is that the
Groverian entanglement of the entanglement resource is $1/\sqrt{2}$. In order
to examine the validity of our conjecture we analyze the quantum teleportation
and superdense coding with $|\Phi> = (1/\sqrt{2}) (|00q_1> + |11q_2>)$, where
$|q_1>$ and $|q_2>$ are arbitrary normalized single qubit states. It is shown
explicitly that $|\Phi>$ allows perfect two-party quantum teleportation and
superdense coding scenario. Next we compute the Groverian measures for
$|\psi>=\sqrt{1/2 - b^2}|100>+b |010>+a|001> +\sqrt{1/2-a^2}|111>$ and
$|\tilde{\psi}>=a|000>+b|010>+\sqrt{1/2 - (a^2+b^2)}|100> + (1/\sqrt{2})
|111>$, which also allow the perfect quantum teleportation. It is shown that
both states have $1/\sqrt{2}$ Groverian entanglement measure, which strongly
supports that our conjecture is valid.
