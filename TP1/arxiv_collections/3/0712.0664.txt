We present that there should exist a light strange-scalar meson kappa', in
addition to the kappa(800), which has a mass around 1.1-1.2 GeV, a rather
narrow width, and couples strongly to kappa(800)sigma(600) (Kpipipi) but weakly
to Kpi, based upon the U~(12)-classification scheme of hadrons and BES II data
on J/psi -> barK*(892)0K+pi- decay.
