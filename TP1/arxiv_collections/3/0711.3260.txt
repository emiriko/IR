In this paper we discuss a new type of 4-dimensional representation of the
braid group. The matrices of braid operations are constructed by q-deformation
of Hamiltonians. One is the Dirac Hamiltonian for free electron with mass m,
the other, which we find, is related to the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian for
quasiparticles in $^3$He-B with the same free energy and mass being m/2. In the
process, we choose the free q-deformation parameter as a special value in order
to be consistent with the anyon description for fractional quantum Hall effect
with $\nu = 1/2$.
