The growth by condensation of small water droplets in a three-dimensional
homogeneous isotropic turbulent flow is considered. Within a simple model of
advection and condensation, the dynamics and growth of millions of droplets are
integrated. A droplet-size spectra broadening is obtained and it is shown to
increase with the Reynolds number of turbulence, by means of two series of
direct numerical simulations at increasing resolution. This is a key point
towards a proper evaluation of the effects of turbulence for condensation in
warm clouds, where the Reynolds numbers typically achieve huge values. The
obtained droplet-size spectra broadening as a function of the Reynolds number
is shown to be consistent with dimensional arguments. A generalization of this
expectation to Reynolds numbers not accessible by DNS is proposed, yielding
upper and lower bounds to the actual size-spectra broadening. A further DNS
matching the large scales of the system suggests consistency of the picture
drawn, while additional effort is needed to evaluate the impact of this effect
for condensation in more realistic cloud conditions.
