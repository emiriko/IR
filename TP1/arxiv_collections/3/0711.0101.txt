Heavy neutron-rich nuclei close to N=126 were produced by fragmentation of a
1 A GeV 208Pb beam at the FRS at GSI. The beta-decay half-lives of 8 nuclides
have been determined. The comparison of the data with model calculations
including an approach based on the self-consistent ground-state description and
continuum QRPA considering the Gamow-Teller and first-forbidden decays provide
a first indication on the importance of first-forbidden transitions around
A=195. The measured data indicate that the matter flow in the r-process to
heavier fissioning nuclei is faster than previously expected.
