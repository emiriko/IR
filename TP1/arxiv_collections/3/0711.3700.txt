The simple model of a low Reynolds number swimmer made from three spheres
that are connected by two arms is considered in its general form and analyzed.
The swimming velocity, force--velocity response, power consumption, and
efficiency of the swimmer are calculated both for general deformations and also
for specific model prescriptions. The role of noise and coherence in the stroke
cycle is also discussed.
