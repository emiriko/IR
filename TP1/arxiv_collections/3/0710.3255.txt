We consider the constraint of $B_s-\bar{B}_s$ mass difference, $\Delta m_s$,
on an MSSM scenario with large flavor mixing. Even with this constraint, we
show that a large deviation from the SM in CP asymmetries of $B_s \to KK$
decays is still possible, making this channel promising in search for
supersymmetry.
