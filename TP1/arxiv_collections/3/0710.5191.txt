We propose a simple explanation for the increase of approximately
  3 MeV/c^2 in the mass value of the X(3872) obtained from
  D^{*0} {D^0}bar decay relative to that obtained from decay to J/psi pi+ pi-.
  If the total width of the X(3872) is 2-3 MeV, the peak position in the
  D^{*0} {D^0}bar invariant mass distribution is sensitive to the final state
orbital angular momentum because of the proximity of the X(3872) to D^{*0}
{D^0}bar threshold. We show that for total width 3 MeV and one unit of orbital
angular momentum, a mass shift ~3 MeV/c^2 is obtained; experimental mass
resolution should slightly increase this value. A consequence is that
spin-parity 2^- is favored for the X(3872).
