We present a quantum secure direct communication(QSDC) scheme as an extension
for a proposed supervised secure entanglement sharing protocol. Starting with a
quick review on the supervised entanglement sharing protocol -- the "Wuhan"
protocol [Y. Li and Y. Liu, arXiv:0709.1449v2], we primarily focus on its
further extend using for a QSDC task, in which the communication attendant
Alice encodes the secret message directly onto a sequence of 2-level particles
which then can be faithfully teleported to Bob using the shared maximal
entanglement states obtained by the previous "Wuhan" protocol. We also evaluate
the security of the QSDC scheme, where an individual self-attack performed by
Alice and Bob -- the out of control attack(OCA) is introduced and the
robustness of our scheme on the OCA is documented.
