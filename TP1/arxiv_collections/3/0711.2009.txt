For a doped antiferromagnet with short-range spin stripe correlations and
long-range charge stripe order we find that the manifestation of charge order
changes abruptly as a function of momentum along the Fermi surface. The
disorder averaged local density of states is almost perfectly homogeneous when
integrated only over states which contribute to the ``nodal'' spectral weight
whereas it displays long range charge stripe order when integrated only over
states which contribute to the ``antinodal'' spectral weight. An effectively
two dimensional nodal liquid can thus coexist with static charge stripes
provided there is no static spin order. We also study commensurate spin and
charge stripe ordered systems where the Fermi surface consists of a nodal hole
pocket and an open ``stripe band'' section. Due to the stripe order the
relation between hole density and size of a pocket will be reduced compared to
a paramagnet by a factor of two for even charge period and four for odd charge
period and we find an estimated upper limit on the area fraction of a hole
pocket of 1.6% for charge period four and 4% for charge period five. We also
discuss why electron pockets are not expected for a stripe ordered system and
show that the open Fermi surface section may be electron like with a negative
Hall coefficient.
