We comment on a recent paper by L. Baum and P. H. Frampton [Phys. Rev. Lett.
98, 071301 (2007)] where it was argued that the entropy problem can be resolved
in a peculiar cyclic universe model through a deflation mechanism (i.e., the
universe is fragmented into many disconnected causal patches at the
turnaround). We point out that in this cyclic model the Hubble length will
become infinity at the turnaround, thus the deflation scenario is not valid.
