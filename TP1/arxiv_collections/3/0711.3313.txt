This paper presents a micro electrostatic vibration-toelectricity energy
converter. For the 3.3 V supply voltage and 1cm2 chip area constraints, optimal
design parameters were found from theoretical calculation and Simulink
simulation. In the current design, the output power is 200 $\mu$W/cm2 for the
optimal load of 8 M\Omega. The device was fabricated in a silicon-on-insulator
(SOI) wafer. Mechanical and electrical measurements were conducted. Residual
particles caused shortage of the variable capacitor and the output power could
not be measured. Device design and fabrication processes are being refined.
