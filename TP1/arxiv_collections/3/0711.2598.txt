We present an apparatus for the study of an ultracold gaseous atomic mixture
of 133Cs and 87Rb. The mixture is prepared using a double magneto-optical trap
(MOT) system in which a two-species pyramid MOT acts as a source of cold atoms
for a `science' MOT. Measurements of the interspecies trap loss rate
coefficients beta_RbCs and beta_CsRb in the science MOT are reported. After the
initial MOT phase, atoms in the mixture are optically pumped into the
magnetically trappable |F=3,m_F=-3> and |F=1,m_F=-1> states of Cs and Rb
(respectively) and loaded into an Ioffe-Pritchard magnetic trap. We demonstrate
a novel technique for limiting the interspecies loss rate in the science MOT by
spatially separating the two trapped atom clouds, which greatly enhances the
number of atoms which can be loaded into the magnetic trap.
