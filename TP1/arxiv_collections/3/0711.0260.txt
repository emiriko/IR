A shape phase transition is demonstrated to occur in 190W by applying the
Projected Shell Model, which goes beyond the usual mean-field approximation.
Rotation alignment of neutrons in the high-j, i_{13/2} orbital drives the yrast
sequence of the system, changing suddenly from prolate to oblate shape at
angular momentum 10$\hbar$. We propose observables to test the picture.
