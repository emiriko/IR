Phase correlations, density fluctuations and three-body loss rates are
relevant for many experiments in quasi one-dimensional geometries. Extended
mean-field theory is used to evaluate correlation functions up to third order
for a quasi one-dimensional trapped Bose gas at zero and finite temperature. At
zero temperature and in the homogeneous limit, we also study the transition
from the weakly correlated Gross-Pitaevskii regime to the strongly correlated
Tonks-Girardeau regime analytically. We compare our results with the exact
Lieb-Liniger solution for the homogeneous case and find good agreement up to
the cross-over regime.
