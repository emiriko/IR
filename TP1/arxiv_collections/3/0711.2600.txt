Relic abundance of dark matter is investigated in the framework of universal
extra dimension models with right-handed neutrinos. These models are free from
the serious Kaluza-Klein (KK) graviton problem that the original universal
extra dimension model possesses. The first KK particle of the right-handed
neutrino is a candidate for dark matter in this framework. When ordinary
neutrino masses are large enough such as the degenerate mass spectrum case, the
dark matter relic abundance can change significantly. The scale of the extra
dimension consistent with cosmological observations can be 500 GeV in the
minimal setup of universal extra dimension models with right-handed neutrinos.
