There has been much recent research into polarizing an antiproton beam,
instigated by the recent proposal from the PAX (Polarized Antiproton
eXperiment) project at GSI Darmstadt. It plans to polarize an antiproton beam
by repeated interaction with a polarized internal target in a storage ring. The
method of polarization buildup by spin filtering requires many of the beam
particles to remain within the ring after scattering off the polarized internal
target via electromagnetic and hadronic interactions. Sets of differential
equations which describe the buildup of polarization by spin filtering in many
different scenarios have recently been presented and solved. In this paper we
add to this literature by investigating a scenario where unpolarized particles
are input into the beam at a linearly increasing rate, i.e. the input rate is
ramped up.
