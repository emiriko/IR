We investigate the dynamics of DNA translocation through a nanopore using 2D
Langevin dynamics simulations, focusing on the dependence of the translocation
dynamics on the details of DNA sequences. The DNA molecules studied in this
work are built from two types of bases $A$ and $C$, which has been shown
previously to have different interactions with the pore. We study DNA with
repeating blocks $A_nC_n$ for various values of $n$, and find that the
translocation time depends strongly on the {\em block length} $2n$ as well as
on the {\em orientation} of which base entering the pore first. Thus, we
demonstrate that the measurement of translocation dynamics of DNA through
nanopore can yield detailed information about its structure. We have also found
that the periodicity of the block sequences are contained in the periodicity of
the residence time of the individual nucleotides inside the pore.
