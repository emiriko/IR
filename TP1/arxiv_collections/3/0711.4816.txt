We have performed four-probe electrical transport measurements on solitary
highly crystalline wires of semimetallic bismuth with aspect ratios up to 60 at
room and at cryogenic temperatures. By proper choice of the substrate material
and the film deposition parameters, lithographic wires with lateral dimensions
of down to one single grain, $\sim 250$ nm, were fabricated. The electrical
resistance of each wire was measured against its thickness through successive
reactive ion etching of the self-same wire. Quantum size effects revealed
themselves as regular oscillations in the electrical resistance. Some evidence
for the semimetal-to-semiconductor phase transition has been detected. The
measured data are discussed within the framework of the existing theoretical
models.
