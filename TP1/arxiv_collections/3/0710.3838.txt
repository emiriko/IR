Using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy we have
studied the momentum and photon energy dependence of the anomalous high-energy
dispersion, termed "waterfalls", between the Fermi level and 1 eV binding
energy in several high-Tc superconductors. We observe strong changes of the
dispersion between different Brillouin zones and a strong dependence on the
photon energy around 75 eV, which we associate with the resonant photoemission
at the Cu 3p3d_{x^2-y^2} edge. We conclude that the high-energy "waterfall"
dispersion results from a strong suppression of the photoemission intensity at
the center of the Brillouin zone due to matrix element effects and is,
therefore, not an intrinsic feature of the spectral function. This indicates
that the new high energy scale in the electronic structure of cuprates derived
from the "waterfall"-like dispersion may be incorrect.
