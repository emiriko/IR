We study rubber sliding friction on hard lubricated surfaces. We show that
even if the hard surface appears smooth to the naked eye, it may exhibit short
wavelength roughness, which may give the dominant contribution to rubber
friction. That is, the observed sliding friction is mainly due to the
viscoelastic deformations of the rubber by the substrate surface asperities.
The presented results are of great importance for rubber sealing and other
rubber applications involving (apparently) smooth surfaces.
