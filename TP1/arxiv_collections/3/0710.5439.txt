Nonequilibrium steady states in an open system connecting two reservoirs of
platelike colloidal particles are investigated by means of a recently proposed
phenomenological dynamic density functional theory [M. Bier and R. van Roij,
Phys. Rev. E 76, 021405 (2007)]. The platelike colloidal particles are
approximated within the Zwanzig model of restricted orientations, which
exhibits an isotropic-nematic bulk phase transition. Inhomogeneities of the
local chemical potential generate a diffusion current which relaxes to a
nonvanishing value if the two reservoirs coupled to the system sustain
different chemical potentials. The relaxation process of initial states towards
the steady state turns out to comprise two regimes: a smoothening of initial
steplike structures followed by an ultimate relaxation of the slowest diffusive
mode. The position of a nonequilibrium interface and the particle current of
steady states depend nontrivially on the structure of the reservoirs due to the
coupling between translational and orientational degrees of freedom of the
fluid.
