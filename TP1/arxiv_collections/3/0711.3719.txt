It is shown that the families of generalized matrix ensembles recently
considered which give rise to an orthogonal invariant stable L\'{e}vy ensemble
can be generated by the simple procedure of dividing Gaussian matrices by a
random variable. The nonergodicity of this kind of disordered ensembles is
investigated. It is shown that the same procedure applied to random graphs
gives rise to a family that interpolates between the Erd\"{o}s-Renyi and the
scale free models.
