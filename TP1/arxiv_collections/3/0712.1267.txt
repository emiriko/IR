The neutrino spin flip radiative conversion processes nu_L -> nu_R + gamma^*
and nu_L + gamma^* -> nu_R in medium are considered. It is shown in part that
an analysis of the so-called spin light of neutrino without a complete taking
account of both the neutrino and the photon dispersion in medium is physically
inconsistent.
