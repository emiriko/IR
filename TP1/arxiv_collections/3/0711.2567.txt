Definitions of fractional derivatives as fractional powers of derivative
operators are suggested. The Taylor series and Fourier series are used to
define fractional power of self-adjoint derivative operator. The Fourier
integrals and Weyl quantization procedure are applied to derive the definition
of fractional derivative operator. Fractional generalization of concept of
stability is considered.
