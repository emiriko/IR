I describe an approach to similarity motivated by Bayesian methods. This
yields a similarity function that is learnable using a standard Bayesian
methods. The relationship of the approach to variable kernel and variable
metric methods is discussed. The approach is related to variable kernel
Experimental results on character recognition and 3D object recognition are
presented..
