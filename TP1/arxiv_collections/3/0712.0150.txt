We solve the one dimensional Feshbach-Villars equation for spin-1/2 particle
subjected to a scalar smooth potential. The eight component wave function is
given in terms of the hypergeometric functions and via a limiting procedure,
the wave functions of the step potential are deduced. These wave functions are
used to test the validity of the boundary conditions deduced from the
Feshbach-Villars transformation. The creation of pairs is predicted from the
boundary condition of the charge density.
