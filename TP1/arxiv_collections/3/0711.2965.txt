In this paper we establish a notion of deformation quantization of a
surjective submersion which is specialized further to the case of a principal
fibre bundle: the functions on the total space are deformed into a right module
for the star product algebra of the functions on the base manifold. In case of
a principal fibre bundle we require in addition invariance under the principal
action. We prove existence and uniqueness of such deformations. The commutant
within all differential operators on the total space is computed and gives a
deformation of the algebra of vertical differential operators. Applications to
noncommutative gauge field theories and phase space reduction of star products
are discussed.
