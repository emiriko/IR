Monte Carlo (MC) Simulations, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and
Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectroscopy were used to study the melting
behavior of single lipid components in two-component membranes of
1,2-Dimyristoyl-D54-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphocholine (DMPC-d54) and
1,2-Distearoyl-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphocholine (DSPC). Microscopic information on
the temperature dependent melting of the single lipid species could be
investigated using FTIR. The microscopic behavior measured could be well
described by the results from the MC simulations. These simulations also
allowed to calculate heat capacity profiles as determined with DSC. These ones
provide macroscopic information about melting enthalpies and entropy changes
which are not accessible with FTIR. Therefore, the MC simulations allowed us to
link the two different experimental approaches of FTIR and DSC.
