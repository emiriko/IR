We study the Casimir energy of a spherical shell of radius $a$ in
$\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime for a complex field with an asymmetric ordering
and obtain the energy up to $O(1/\kappa^2)$. We show that the vacuum breaks
particle and anti-particle symmetry if one requires the spectra to be
consistent with the blackbody radiation at the commutative limit.
