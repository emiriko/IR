After a short introduction to the SUSY flavour problem, we focus the
attention on the MSSM with MFV and large $\tan\beta$. The theoretical
motivations and the general features of this scenario are briefly reviewed. The
possible signatures in low-energy flavour-violating observables are discussed,
with particular attention to the role played by $\BR(P\to\ell\nu)$,
$\BR(B_{s,d}\to \ell^+\ell^-)$ and $\BR(\mu\to e \gamma)$
