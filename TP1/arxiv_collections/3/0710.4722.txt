This paper suggests a practical "hybrid" synthesis methodology which
integrates designer-derived analytical models for system-level description with
simulation-based models at the circuit level. We show how to optimize
stage-resolution to minimize the power in a pipelined ADC. Exploration (via
detailed synthesis) of several ADC configurations is used to show that a
4-3-2... resolution distribution uses the least power for a 13-bit 40 MSPS
converter in a 0.25 $\mu$m CMOS process.
