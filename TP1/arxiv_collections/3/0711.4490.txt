We report a computer-simulation study of the equilibrium phase diagram of a
three-dimensional system of particles with a repulsive step potential. Using
free-energy calculations, we have determined the equilibrium phase diagram of
this system. At low temperatures, we observe a number of distinct crystal
phases. However, under certain conditions the system undergoes a glass
transition in a regime where the liquid appears thermodynamically stable. We
argue that the appearance of this amorphous low-temperature phase can be
understood by viewing this one-component system as a pseudo-binary mixture.
