A Langmuir monolayer trough that is equipped for simultaneous microrheology
and standard rheology measurements has been constructed. The central elements
are the trough itself with a full range of optical tools accessing the
air-water interface from below the trough and a portable knife-edge torsion
pendulum that can access the interface from above. The ability to
simultaneously measure the mechanical response of Langmuir monolayers on very
different lengths scales is an important step in for our understanding of the
mechanical response of such systems.
