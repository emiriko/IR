We report measurements of the frequency-dependent shear moduli of aging
colloidal systems that evolve from a purely low-viscosity liquid to a
predominantly elastic glass or gel. Using microrheology, we measure the local
complex shear modulus $G^{*}(\omega)$ over a very wide range of frequencies (1
Hz- 100 kHz). The combined use of one- and two-particle microrheology allows us
to differentiate between colloidal glasses and gels - the glass is homogenous,
whereas the colloidal gel shows a considerable degree of heterogeneity on
length scales larger than 0.5 micrometer. Despite this characteristic
difference, both systems exhibit similar rheological behavior which evolve in
time with aging, showing a crossover from a single power-law frequency
dependence of the viscoelastic modulus to a sum of two power laws. The
crossover occurs at a time $t_{0}$, which defines a mechanical transition
point. We found that the data acquired during the aging of different samples
can be collapsed onto a single master curve by scaling the aging time with
$t_{0}$. This raises questions about the prior interpretation of two power laws
in terms of a superposition of an elastic network embedded in a viscoelastic
background.
