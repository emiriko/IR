This paper presents a new research study on the platform fabrication of
fluorescence bio-detection chip with an optical fiber transmission. Anisotropic
wet etching on (100) silicon wafers to fabrication V-groove for optical fiber
alignment and micro-mirror were included. Combing with anodic bonding technique
to adhere glass, silicon structure and optical fiber for a fluorescence
excitation platform was completed. In this study, the etching solution 40% KOH
was used to study the parameters effect. The results show that working
temperature is the main parameter to significantly effect the etch rate. The
anisotropic etching resulted 54.7 degrees reflective mirrors and its
reflectivity for optical beam were also examined. The surface roughness of the
micro-mirror is Ra 4.1 nm measured using AFM, it provides excellent optical
reflection. The incident light and beam profiles were also examined for further
study. This study can show this micro-platform adaptable for fluorescence
bio-detection.
