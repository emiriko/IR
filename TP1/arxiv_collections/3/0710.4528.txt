We consider the impact of Catalyzed Big Bang Nucleosynthesis on theories with
a gravitino LSP and a charged slepton NLSP. In models where the gravitino to
gaugino mass ratio is bounded from below, such as gaugino-mediated SUSY
breaking, we derive a lower bound on the gaugino mass parameter m_1/2. As a
concrete example, we determine the parameter space of gaugino mediation that is
compatible with all cosmological constraints.
