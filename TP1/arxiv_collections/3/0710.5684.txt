Generalization of the Rouse model without any use of the postulates
concerning the Gaussian distribution of the vector connecting the ends of
segments is advanced. In the initial (in general, nonlinear) Langevin
equations, self-averaging over continuous fragments of a macromolecule
naturally defines a linear term for the tagged chain, and this term differs
from the entropy term of the classical Rouse model only by the numerical
coefficient. According to the inertia-free approximation, the initial decay
rates of correlation functions for the normal modes are described by the Rouse
model independently of the character of fluctuations of the vector connecting
the ends of the Kuhn segment. This statement is valid for any moment if the
initial Langevin equations are treated in terms of the approximation of dynamic
self-consistency. Simulation of the Fraenkel chains by the method of Brownian
dynamics shows that decay of autocorrelation functions of shortwave normal
modes is fairly described by the linearized equations for a given model of a
chain and that the Rouse equation can be used for the longwave modes. The
results of this study make it possible to explain a marked difference between
the lengths of the Kuhn and Rouse segments that is estimated from static and
dynamic experiments.
