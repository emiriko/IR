An axisymmetric static solution of a nonlinear electrodynamics is considered
as a massive charged particle with spin and magnetic moment. A linearization of
the nonlinear electrodynamics around the static solution is investigated. The
appropriate problem for linear waves around the static solution is considered.
This wave part of the particle solution is considered to provide the
appropriate wave properties for the particle. It has been found that the right
(experimentally proved) formula for frequency of this wave appears
theoretically for the static solution with ring singularity.
