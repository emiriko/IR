We review previous work of Alain Connes, and its extension by the author, on
some conformal invariants obtained from the noncommutative residue on even
dimensional compact manifolds without boundary. Inspired by recent work of Yong
Wang, we also address possible generalizations of these conformal invariants to
the setting of compact manifolds with boundary.
