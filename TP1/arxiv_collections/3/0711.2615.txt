We present a method for measuring the distance among records based on the
correlations of data stored in the corresponding database entries. The original
method (F. Bagnoli, A. Berrones and F. Franci. Physica A 332 (2004) 509-518)
was formulated in the context of opinion formation. The opinions expressed over
a set of topic originate a ``knowledge network'' among individuals, where two
individuals are nearer the more similar their expressed opinions are. Assuming
that individuals' opinions are stored in a database, the authors show that it
is possible to anticipate an opinion using the correlations in the database.
This corresponds to approximating the overlap between the tastes of two
individuals with the correlations of their expressed opinions.
  In this paper we extend this model to nonlinear matching functions, inspired
by biological problems such as microarray (probe-sample pairing). We
investigate numerically the error between the correlation and the overlap
matrix for eight sequences of reference with random probes. Results show that
this method is particularly robust for detecting similarities in the presence
of translocations.
