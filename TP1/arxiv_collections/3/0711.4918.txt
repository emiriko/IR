The energetics of the stochastic process has shown the balance of energy on
the mesoscopic level. The heat and the energy defined there are, however,
generally different from their macroscopic counterpart. We show that this
discrepancy can be removed by adding to these quantities the reversible heat
associated with the mesoscopic free energy.
