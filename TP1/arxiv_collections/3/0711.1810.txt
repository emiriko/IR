We present phase coherence time measurements in quasi-one-dimensional Ag
wires implanted with Ag$^{+}$ ions with an energy of $100 keV$. The
measurements have been carried out in the temperature range from $100 mK$ up to
$10 K$; this has to be compared with the Kondo temperature of iron in silver,
i.e. $T_{K}^{Ag/Fe} \approx 4 K$, used in recent experiments on dephasing in
Kondo systems\cite{mallet_prl_06,birge_prl_06}. We show that the phase
coherence time is not affected by the implantation procedure, clearly proving
that ion implantation process by itself \emph{does not lead to any extra
dephasing} at low temperature.
