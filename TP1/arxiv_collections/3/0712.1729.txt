The dynamical symmetry breaking in a quasi-(1+1)-dimensional relativistic
model is investigated. The motions of particles in intrachain are described as
a relativistic electron-hole gas, while the interchain hopping term is
introduced as a 0th-component of vector in (1+1)-dimensions, a kind of chemical
potential of the system. The gauge symmetry of the model is chosen as U(1)
suitable for a possible situation of a real substance in condensed matter
physics. We consider the BCS-type contact interactions for the s-wave
fermion-pair condensates, while employ the nonlocal interactions of the
generalized BCS framework to generate the $p$-, $d$- and $f$-wave condensations
in the system. Especially we examine the dynamical generation of a Dirac mass
term and superconductivity in the model. The phenomenon is interpreted as
metal-insulator/metal-superconductor phase transitions.
