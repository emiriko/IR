This paper addresses delay test for SOC devices with high frequency clock
domains. A logic design for on-chip high-speed clock generation, implemented to
avoid expensive test equipment, is described in detail. Techniques for on-chip
clock generation, meant to reduce test vector count and to increase test
quality, are discussed. ATPG results for the proposed techniques are given.
