This paper gives an overview of the potential to discover a Standard Model
Higgs Boson in the inclusive search channels at the ATLAS and CMS experiments
at the LHC. The most important decay modes, $H \to \gamma \gamma$, $H \to WW
\to ll\nu\nu$ and $H \to ZZ \to 4l$ are described and a summary of recently
published analyses using realistic detector simulations is presented.
