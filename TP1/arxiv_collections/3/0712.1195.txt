We outline the basic properties of a pertubative QCD factorization formalism
that maintains exact over-all kinematics in both the initial and final states.
Such a treatment requires the use of non-perturbative factors that depend on
all components of parton four-momentum. These objects are referred to as parton
correlation functions. We describe the complications faced in defining parton
correlation functions and discuss recent progress. Emphasis is placed on the
need for precise operator definitions in a complete derivation of
factorization.
