In the present article a family of quantum anharmonic oscillators is studied
using Hermite's function basis (Fock's basis) in the Hilbert space. The
numerical investigation of the eigenenergies of that family is presented. The
statistical properties of the calculated eigenvalues are compared with the
theoretical predictions derived from the Random Matrix Theory. Conclusions are
inferred.
