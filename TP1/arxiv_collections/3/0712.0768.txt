The strange quark mass is determined from a new QCD Finite Energy Sum Rule
(FESR) optimized to reduce considerably the systematic uncertainties arising
from the hadronic resonance sector. As a result, the main uncertainty in this
determination is due to the value of $\Lambda_{QCD}$. The correlator of
axial-vector divergences is used in perturbative QCD to five-loop order,
including quark and gluon condensate contributions, in the framework of both
Fixed Order (FOPT), and Contour Improved Perturbation Theory (CIPT). The latter
exhibits very good convergence, leading to a remarkably stable result in the
very wide range $s_0 = 1.0 - 4.0 {GeV}^2$, where $s_0$ is the radius of the
integration contour in the complex energy (squared) plane. The value of the
strange quark mass in this framework at a scale of 2 GeV is $m_s(2 {GeV}) = 95
\pm 5 (111 \pm 6) {MeV}$ for $\Lambda_{QCD} = 420
  (330) {MeV}$, respectively.
