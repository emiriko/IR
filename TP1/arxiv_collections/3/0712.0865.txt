With the eigenfunctional theory, we study a general interacting electron
system, and give a rigorous expression of its ground state energy which is
composed of two parts, one part is contributed by the non-interacting
electrons, and another one is represented by the correlation functions that are
controlled by the electron correlation. Moreover, according to the rigorous
expression of the ground state energy, an effective method beyond the local
density approximation of the density functional theory is proposed.
