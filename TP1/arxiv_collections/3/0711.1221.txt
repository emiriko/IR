In a quantum gravity theory the entropy of entanglement $S$ between the
fundamental degrees of freedom spatially divided by a surface is discussed. The
classical gravity is considered as an emergent phenomenon and arguments are
presented that: 1) $S$ is a macroscopical quantity which can be determined
without knowing a real microscopical content of the fundamental theory; 2) $S$
is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula in terms of the area of a
co-dimension 2 hypesurface $\cal B$; 3) in static space-times $\cal B$ can be
defined as a minimal hypersurface of a least volume separating the system in a
constant time slice. It is shown that properties of $S$ are in agreement with
basic properties of the von Neumann entropy. Explicit variational formulae for
$S$ in different physical examples are considered.
