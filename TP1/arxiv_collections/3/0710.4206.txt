The COMPTEL instrument performed the first mapping of the 1.809 MeV photons
in the Galaxy, triggering considerable interest in determing the sources of
interstellar 26Al. The predicted 26Al is too low compared to the observation,
for a better understanding more accurate rates for the 25Mg(p; gamma)26Al
reaction are required. The 25Mg(p;gamma)26Al reaction has been investigated at
the resonances at Er= 745; 418; 374; 304 keV at Ruhr-Universitat-Bochum using a
Tandem accelerator and a 4piNaI detector. In addition the resonance at Er = 189
keV has been measured deep underground laboratory at Laboratori Nazionali del
Gran Sasso, exploiting the strong suppression of cosmic background. This low
resonance has been studied with the 400 kV LUNA accelerator and a HPGe
detector. The preliminary results of the resonance strengths will be reported.
