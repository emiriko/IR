The Double Chooz reactor neutrino experiment will be the next detector to
search for a non vanishing theta13 mixing angle with unprecedented sensitivity,
which might open the way to unveiling CP violation in the leptonic sector. The
measurement of this angle will be based in a precise comparison of the
antineutrino spectrum at two identical detectors located at different distances
from the Chooz nuclear reactor cores in France. Double Chooz is particularly
attractive because of its capability to measure sin2(2theta13) to 3 sigmas if
sin2(2theta13) > 0.05 or to exclude sin2(2theta13) down to 0.03 at 90% C.L. for
Dm2 = 2.5 x 10-3 eV2 in three years of data taking with both detectors. The
construction of the far detector starts in 2008 and the first neutrino results
are expected in 2009. The current status of the experiment, its physics
potential and design and expected performance of the detector are reviewed.
