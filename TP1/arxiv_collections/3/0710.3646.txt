We here present the complete analysis of experiments on driven Brownian
motion and electric noise in a $RC$ circuit, showing that thermodynamic entropy
production can be related to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry in the
statistical description of these nonequilibrium systems. The symmetry breaking
can be expressed in terms of dynamical entropies per unit time, one for the
forward process and the other for the time-reversed process. These entropies
per unit time characterize dynamical randomness, i.e., temporal disorder, in
time series of the nonequilibrium fluctuations. Their difference gives the
well-known thermodynamic entropy production, which thus finds its origin in the
time asymmetry of dynamical randomness, alias temporal disorder, in systems
driven out of equilibrium.
