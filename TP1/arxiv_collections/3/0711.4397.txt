Data from the L3, Tasso, Opal and Delphi collaborations are analyzed in terms
of a statistical model of high energy collisions. The model contains a power
law critical exponent tau and Levy index alpha. These data are used to study
values of tau and alpha. The very high multiplicity events in L3, Opal and
Delphi are consistent with a model based on a Feynman-Wilson gas which has a
tail exponent tau=3/2 and alpha=1/2.
