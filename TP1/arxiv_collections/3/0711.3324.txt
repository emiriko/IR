In this paper the feasibility study of an IR sensor card is presented. The
methodology and the results of a quasi real-time thermal characterization tool
and method for the temperature mapping of circuits and boards based on sensing
the infrared radiation is introduced. With the proposed method the IR
radiation-distribution of boards from the close proximity of the sensor card is
monitored in quasi real-time. The proposed method is enabling in situ IR
measurement among operating cards of a system e.g. in a rack.
