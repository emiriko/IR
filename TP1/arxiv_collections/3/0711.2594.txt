Two families of solutions of a generalized non-Abelian Toda lattice are
considered. These solutions are expressed in terms of quasideterminants,
constructed by means of Darboux and binary Darboux transformations. As an
example of the application of these solutions, we consider the 2-periodic
reduction to a matrix sine-Gordon equation. In particular, we investigate the
interaction properties of polarized kink solutions.
