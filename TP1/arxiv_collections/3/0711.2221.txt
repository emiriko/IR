High critical current-density (10 to 420 kA/cm^2)
superconductor-insulator-superconductor tunnel junctions with aluminium nitride
barriers have been realized using a remote nitrogen plasma from an inductively
coupled plasma source operated in a pressure range of 10^{-3} to 10^{-1} mbar.
We find a much better reproducibility and control compared to previous work.
  From the current-voltage characteristics and cross-sectional TEM images it is
inferred that, compared to the commonly used AlO_x barriers, the
poly-crystalline AlN barriers are much more uniform in transmissivity, leading
to a better quality at high critical current-densities.
