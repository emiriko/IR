The equation of state and bulk and shear viscosities are shown to be able to
affect the transverse dynamics of a central heavy ion collision. The net
entropy, along with the femtoscopic radii are shown to be affected at the
10-20% level by both shear and bulk viscosity. The degree to which these
effects help build a tsunami-like pulse is also discussed.
