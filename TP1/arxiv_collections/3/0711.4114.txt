"God does not play dice. He flips coins instead." And though for some reason
He has denied us quantum bit commitment. And though for some reason he has even
denied us strong coin flipping. He has, in His infinite mercy, granted us
quantum weak coin flipping so that we too may flip coins.
  Instructions for the flipping of coins are contained herein. But be warned!
Only those who have mastered Kitaev's formalism relating coin flipping and
operator monotone functions may succeed. For those foolhardy enough to even
try, a complete tutorial is included.
