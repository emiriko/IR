We investigate the properties of isospin-symmetric nuclear matter and neutron
stars in a chiral model approach adopting the SU(2) parity doublet formulation.
This ansatz explicitly incorporates chiral symmetry restoration with the limit
of degenerate masses of the nucleons and their parity partners. Instead of
searching for an optimized parameter set we explore the general parameter
dependence of nuclear matter and star properties in the model. We are able to
get a good description of ground state nuclear matter as well as large values
of mass for neutron stars in agreement with observation.
