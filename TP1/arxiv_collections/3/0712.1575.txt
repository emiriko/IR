The traditional description of black holes in terms of event horizons is
inadequate for many physical applications, especially when studying black holes
in non-stationary spacetimes. In these cases, it is often more useful to use
the quasi-local notions of trapped and marginally trapped surfaces, which lead
naturally to the framework of trapping, isolated, and dynamical horizons. This
framework allows us to analyze diverse facets of black holes in a unified
manner and to significantly generalize several results in black hole physics.
It also leads to a number of applications in mathematical general relativity,
numerical relativity, astrophysics, and quantum gravity. In this review, I will
discuss the basic ideas and recent developments in this framework, and
summarize some of its applications with an emphasis on numerical relativity.
