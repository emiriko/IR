We propose and discuss the phenomenology of a Topcolor-assisted Technicolor
(TC2) model with a flavor-universal hypercharge sector. After discussing the
symmetry breaking pattern and low-energy effective Lagrangian, we examine
various experimental and theoretical constraints, finding that precision
electroweak measurements yield the strongest bounds on the model. We perform a
combined fit to all available $Z$-pole and LEP2 data and find that the goodness
of fit for hypercharge-universal topcolor is comparable to that of the Standard
Model. In contrast, TC2 models with a flavor non-universal hypercharge sectors
are markedly disfavored by the data.
