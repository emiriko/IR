This is a review of progress in hadron structure physics from lattice QCD.
Recent results on the structure of the nucleon and the pion in terms of
(transition) form factors, moments of distribution amplitudes and (generalized)
parton distribution functions are presented. These observables allow us to
investigate a number of fundamental physics questions related to e.g. the
distribution of charge and momentum in hadrons, the spin structure of the
nucleon and the pion, and correlations between spin, orbital angular momentum
and coordinate degrees of freedom. Chiral extrapolations of selected lattice
results are presented and compared to results from experiment and
phenomenology. We conclude that lattice simulations already today strongly
contribute to our understanding of the structure of hadrons.
