We study the possibility for a global unitary applied on an arbitrary number
of qubits to be decomposed in a sequential unitary procedure, where an
ancillary system is allowed to interact only once with each qubit. We prove
that sequential unitary decompositions are in general impossible for genuine
entangling operations, even with an infinite-dimensional ancilla, being the
controlled-NOT gate a paradigmatic example. Nevertheless, we find particular
nontrivial operations in quantum information that can be performed in a
sequential unitary manner, as is the case of quantum error correction and
quantum cloning.
