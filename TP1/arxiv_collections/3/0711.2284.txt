The numerical simulation of the 3D incompressible Euler equation is analyzed
with respect to different integration methods. The numerical schemes we
considered include spectral methods with different strategies for dealiasing
and two variants of finite difference methods. Based on this comparison, a
Kida-Pelz like initial condition is integrated using adaptive mesh refinement
and estimates on the necessary numerical resolution are given. This estimate is
based on analyzing the scaling behavior similar to the procedure in critical
phenomena and present simulations are put into perspective.
