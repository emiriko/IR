We studied the quantum dynamics of ferromagnetic domain walls (topological
kink-type solitons) in one dimensional ferromagnetic spin chains. We show that
the tunneling probability does not depend on the number of spins in a domain
wall; thus, this probability can be large even for a domain wall containing a
large number of spins. We also predict that there is a strong interplay between
the tunneling of a wall from one lattice site to another (tunneling of the kink
coordinate) and the tunneling of the kink topological charge (so-called
chirality). Both of these elementary processes are suppressed for kinks in
one-dimensional ferromagnets with half-integer spin. The dispersion law (i.e.,
the domain wall energy versus momentum) is essentially different for chains
with either integer or half-integer spins. The predicted quantum effects could
be observed for mesoscopic magnetic structures, e.g., chains of magnetic
clusters, large-spin molecules, or nanosize magnetic dots.
