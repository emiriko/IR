As microfluidics-based biochips become more complex, manufacturing yield will
have significant influence on production volume and product cost. We propose an
interstitial redundancy approach to enhance the yield of biochips that are
based on droplet-based microfluidics. In this design method, spare cells are
placed in the interstitial sites within the microfluidic array, and they
replace neighboring faulty cells via local reconfiguration. The proposed design
method is evaluated using a set of concurrent real-life bioassays.
