Some features of the Pioneer anomaly are discussed in context of author's
explanation of this effect as a deceleration of the probes in the graviton
background. It is noted that if the model is true then the best parameter of
the anomalous acceleration should be not the distance to the Sun but a cosine
of the angle between a velocity of the probe and its radius-vector.
