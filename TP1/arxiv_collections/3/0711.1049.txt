Some theories of new physics accounting for neutrino masses can give rise to
a low-energy non-unitary leptonic mixing matrix. It is shown that the
CP-asymmetries in the $\nu_\mu\to \nu_\tau$ channel are an excellent probe of
such new physics. In adition, we clarify the relationship betweeen our
framework and the so called "non-standard neutrino interactions" scenarios: the
sensitivities explored here apply as well to such constructions, except for
extremely fine-tuned cancellations.
