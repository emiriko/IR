Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) of ~ 1-10 solar-mass compact objects
into ~ million solar-mass massive black holes can serve as excellent probes of
strong-field general relativity. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA)
is expected to detect gravitational wave signals from apprxomiately one hundred
EMRIs per year, but the data analysis of EMRI signals poses a unique set of
challenges due to their long duration and the extensive parameter space of
possible signals. One possible approach is to carry out a search for EMRI
tracks in the time-frequency domain. We have applied a time-frequency search to
the data from the Mock LISA Data Challenge (MLDC) with promising results. Our
analysis used the Hierarchical Algorithm for Clusters and Ridges to identify
tracks in the time-frequency spectrogram corresponding to EMRI sources. We then
estimated the EMRI source parameters from these tracks. In these proceedings,
we discuss the results of this analysis of the MLDC round 1.3 data.
