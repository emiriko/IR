In this paper we present the package S@M (Spinors@Mathematica) which
implements the spinor-helicity formalism in Mathematica. The package allows the
use of complex-spinor algebra along with the multi-purpose features of
Mathematica. The package defines the spinor objects with their basic properties
along with functions to manipulate them. It also offers the possibility of
evaluating the spinorial objects numerically at every computational step. The
package is therefore well suited to be used in the context of on-shell
technology, in particular for the evaluation of scattering amplitudes at tree-
and loop-level.
