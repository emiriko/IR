The Isospin Quantum Molecular Dynamics model is used to compare spectra and
elliptic flow of kaons produced at subthreshold energies with data taken at the
SIS accelerator at GSI. We find that temperatures of the spectra are dominated
by the rescattering of the kaons. The study of elliptic flow observables
indicates the influence of rescattering as well as of the optical potential of
the kaons with increasing dominance of the optical potential at lower incident
energies.
