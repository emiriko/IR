An inclusion of temperature and chemical potential dependent surface tension
into the gas of quark-gluon bags model resolves a long standing problem of a
unified description of the first and second order phase transition with the
cross-over. The suggested model has an exact analytical solution and allows one
to rigorously study the vicinity of the critical endpoint of the deconfinement
phase transition. It is found that at the curve of a zero surface tension
coefficient there must exist the surface induced phase tranition of the 2-nd or
higher order. The present model predicts that the critical endpoint (CEP) of
quantum chromodynamics is the tricritical endpoint.
