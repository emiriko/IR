Classification of states of quantum channels of information transfer is built
on the basis of unreducible representations of qubit state space group of
symmetry and properties of density matrix spectrum. It is shown that pure
disentangled states form two-dimensional surface, and the reason of state
disentanglement is in degeneration of non-zero density matrix eigenvalues
