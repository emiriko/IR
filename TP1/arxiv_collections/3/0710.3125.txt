We calculate the zenith-angle dependence of conventional and prompt
high-energy muon fluxes at India-Based Neutrino Observatory (INO) depth. This
study demonstrates a possibility to discriminate models of the charm
hadroproduction including the low-x QCD behaviour of hadronic cross-sections
relevant at very high energies.
