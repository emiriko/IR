Transport in electronic devices based on high-Tc superconductors depends
critically on the charge redistribution at interfaces, since the band structure
is modified on a local scale. Using the density functional theory approach for
relaxed YBa2Cu3O7-metal contacts, the charge transfer into the superconductor
has been studied in Appl. Phys. Lett. 90, 192502 (2007). In the present paper
we discuss the systematics inherent in the local electronic structure of the
near-contact YBa2Cu3O7 sites, in particular the dependence on the contact
geometry.
