Three integrable models - the deformed Heisenberg, Landau - Lifschits and
Ishimori magnets are written in terms of the stereographic projection. The
Hamiltonians of these models are obtained and certain questions related to the
existence of exact solutions are studied. In particular, the stability of
solitions is studied for the Heisenberg marnet, simplest stationary solutions
are obtained for the Landau - Lifschits magnet, and Hamiltonians and
topological charges are calculated for several known solutions of the Ishimori
model
