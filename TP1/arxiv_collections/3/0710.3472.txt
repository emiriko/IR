We study a dephasing channel with memory, modelled by a multimode environment
of oscillators. Focusing on the case of two channel uses, we show that memory
effects can enhance the amount of coherent quantum information transmitted down
the channel. We also show the Kraus representation for two channel uses.
Finally, we propose a coding-decoding scheme that takes advantage of memory to
improve the fidelity of transmission.
