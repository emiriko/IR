We demonstrate the existence of ferromagnetism in the Periodic Anderson Model
(PAM) at conduction-band filling near a quarter. We show that this
ferromagnetism is not supported by Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)
interactions but is instead driven by the precursors of charge density wave
(CDW) formation in the conduction electron band. To study the effect of spatial
correlations, we compare Dynamical Mean field Approximation (DMFA) and
Dynamical Cluster Approximation (DCA) results. We find that both RKKY and CDW
driven ferromagnetism persist as short-range correlations are incorporated into
the theory. Both DMFA and DCA show the precursors of CDW formation through the
strong enhancement of the d-electron CDW susceptibility as the temperature
decreases, up to the ferromagnetic transition temperature. In addition, the DCA
captures the signal of a band gap opening due to Peierls instability.
