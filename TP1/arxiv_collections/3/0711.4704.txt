We report Monte Carlo simulations of the self-assembly of supramolecular
polymers based on a model of patchy particles. We find a first-order phase
transition, characterized by hysteresis and nucleation, toward a solid bundle
of polymers, of length much greater than the average gas phase length. We argue
that the bundling transition is the supramolecular equivalent of the
sublimation transition, that results from a weak chain-chain interaction. We
provide a qualitative equation of state that gives physical insight beyond the
specific values of the parameters used in our simulations.
