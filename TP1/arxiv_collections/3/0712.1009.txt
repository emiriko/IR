We demonstrate for the first time that when a methanethiol adsorbed on the
regular Cu(111) surface, the dissociative structure is thermodynamically more
stable than the intact one. The computational results show that at low
temperature the methanethiol adsorbate prefers the atop site of the regular
Cu(111) surface. As the temperature is increased, the S-H bond is broken and
the methylthiolate favors the hollow sites. On the defected Cu(111) surface,
the dissociative configuration is still thermodynamically more stable than the
nondissociative one. The calculation indicates that the hydrogen initially
attached to the sulfur would like to form a bond with the copper surface rather
than desorb from it. Even though both copper and gold are the noble metal, the
stability of the methanethiol adsorption on the Cu(111) substrate is almost the
reverse of that on the Au(111).
