We present a criteria for necessary conditions for instanton formation of an
energy packet from a prior to our present universe, using the
Reissnor-Nordstrom metric which is congruent with Crowell's pseudo time
evolution version of Wheeler De Witt equation. This is based upon Wesson's
(1999) treatment of instanton formation in five dimensional cosmologies.
Criteria for break up of this instanton is proposed due to a causal barrier
derived from first principles From the Friedmann equation for scale factor
evolution, with a discussion of how this can be linked to Seth Lloyd's
treatment of computational bits of 'information' in different periods of
inflationary cosmology
