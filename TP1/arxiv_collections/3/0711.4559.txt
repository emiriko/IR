The full theoretical analysis of the kinetics of multicomponent nucleation is
presented. The relief of the free energy with surface excesses was analyzed,
the valleys and ridges were described, their mutual interaction was studied.
The new possibility to change the valley of nucleation is shown. The
possibility to have one common valley instead of several neighbor ones which
leads to the radical change in the height of the effective activation barrier
and to the new value for the nucleation rate.
