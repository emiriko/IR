The capacity-achieving input covariance matrices for coherent block-fading
correlated MIMO Rician channels are determined. In this case, no closed-form
expressions for the eigenvectors of the optimum input covariance matrix are
available. An approximation of the average mutual information is evaluated in
this paper in the asymptotic regime where the number of transmit and receive
antennas converge to $+\infty$. New results related to the accuracy of the
corresponding large system approximation are provided. An attractive
optimization algorithm of this approximation is proposed and we establish that
it yields an effective way to compute the capacity achieving covariance matrix
for the average mutual information. Finally, numerical simulation results show
that, even for a moderate number of transmit and receive antennas, the new
approach provides the same results as direct maximization approaches of the
average mutual information, while being much more computationally attractive.
