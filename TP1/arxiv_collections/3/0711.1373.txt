Let $F_n(x)$ be the partition polynomial $\sum_{k=1}^n p_k(n) x^k$ where
$p_k(n)$ is the number of partitions of $n$ with $k$ parts. We emphasize the
computational experiments using degrees up to $70,000$ to discover the
asymptotics of these polynomials. Surprisingly, the asymptotics of $F_n(x)$
have two scales of orders $n$ and $\sqrt{n}$ and in three different regimes
inside the unit disk. Consequently, the zeros converge to network of curves
inside the unit disk given in terms of the dilogarithm.
