We calculate the O($\eps$)--term of the two--loop massive operator matrix
elements for twist 2--operators, which contribute to the heavy flavour Wilson
coefficients in unpolarized deep--inelastic scattering in the asymptotic limit
$Q^2 \gg m^2.$ Our calculation was performed in Mellin space using
Mellin--Barnes integrals and generalized hypergeometric functions. The
O($\eps$)--term contributes in the renormalization at 3--loop order.
