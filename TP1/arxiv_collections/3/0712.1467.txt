We report experimental results on heterodyne holographic microscopy of
subwavelength-sized gold particles. The apparatus uses continuous green laser
illumination of the metal beads in a total internal reflection configuration
for dark-field operation. Detection of the scattered light at the illumination
wavelength on a charge-coupled device array detector enables 3D localization of
brownian particles in water
