The quantum space-time and the phase space with fuzzy structure is
investigated as the possible quantization formalism. In this theory the state
of nonrelativistic particle corresponds to the element of fuzzy ordered set
(Foset) - fuzzy point. Due to Foset partial (weak) ordering, particle's space
coordinate x acquires principal uncertainty dx. It's shown that Shroedinger
formalism of Quantum Mechanics can be completely derived from consideration of
particle evolution in fuzzy phase space with minimal number of axioms.
