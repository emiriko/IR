A shape evolution of 162,164Yb in yrast states is traced using the
self-consistent Skyrme Hartree-Fock calculations. We found that nonaxial
octupole deformations (in particular, Y_{31} term) become favorable at large
rotational frequencies (> 0.4 MeV) in 162Yb, while in 164Yb a nonaxial
quadrupole shape is dominant at fast rotation. The cranked Nilsson model and
random phase approximation are used to understand the dynamics of octupole
correlations in both nuclei. We demonstrate that the disappearance of one of
the octupole vibrational modes in the rotating frame gives rise to the nonaxial
octupole deformations in 162Yb, while the octupole modes are nonzero in 164Yb.
