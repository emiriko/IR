EPR transient nutation spectroscopy is used to measure the effective field
(Rabi frequency) for multiphoton transitions in a two-level spin system
bichromatically driven by a transverse microwave (MW) field and a longitudinal
radio-frequency (RF) field. The behavior of the effective field amplitude is
examined in the case of a relatively strong MW field, when the derivation of
the effective Hamiltonian cannot be reduced to first-order perturbation theory
in w_{1} / w_{rf} (w_{1} is the microwave Rabi frequency, w_{rf} is the RF
frequency). Experimental results are consistently interpreted by taking into
account the contributions of second and third order in w_{1} / w_{rf} evaluated
by Krylov-Bogolyubov-Mitropolsky averaging. In the case of inhomogeneously
broadened EPR line, the third-order correction modifies the nutation frequency,
while the second-order correction gives rise to a change in the nutation
amplitude due to a Bloch-Siegert shift.
