The Kirillov--Schilling--Shimozono (KSS) bijection appearing in theory of the
Fermionic formula gives an one to one correspondence between the set of
elements of tensor products of the Kirillov--Reshetikhin crystals (called
paths) and the set of rigged configurations. It is a generalization of
Kerov--Kirillov--Reshetikhin bijection and plays inverse scattering formalism
for the box-ball systems. In this paper, we give an algebraic reformulation of
the KSS map from the paths to rigged configurations, using the combinatorial R
and energy functions of crystals. It gives a characterization of the KSS
bijection as an intrinsic property of tensor products of crystals.
