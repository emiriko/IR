The problem of scalar mesons still remains a challenging puzzle, for which we
do not even know which are the right pieces to set up. The proliferation of
resonances (some of them are very broad and appear on top of hadronic
thresholds) and of coupled channels that interact strongly among each other
makes the study of this sector a hard task. Our objective is the study of the
strongly interacting mesons in coupled channels with quantum numbers J^{PC} =
0^{++} and I=0 and I=1/2, up to a center of mass energy sqrt{s} < 2 GeV. Our
framework is based on Unitary Chiral Perturbation Theory. We include for I=0
the channels: \pi\pi, K\bar{K}, \eta\eta, \sigma\sigma, \eta\eta', \rho\rho,
\omega\omega, \eta'\eta', \omega\phi, \phi\phi, K^\ast \bar{K}^\ast,
a_1(1260)\pi and \pi^{\star}(1300)\pi. In addition, and in order to constrain
our fits, we also study the I=1/2, 3/2 channels given by K\pi, K\eta and
K\eta'. We finally present the resonant content of our fits with the $\sigma$,
$f_0(980)$, $f_0(1310)$, $f_(1500)$, $f_0(1710)$ and $f_0(1790)$.
