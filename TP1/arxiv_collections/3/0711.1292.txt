Microscopic dynamics of the oblate-prolate shape coexistence/mixing phenomena
in 68Se and 72Kr are studied by means of the adiabatic self-consistent
collective coordinate (ASCC) method in conjunction with the
pairing-plus-quadrupole (P+Q) Hamiltonian including the quadrupole pairing
interaction. Quantum collective Hamiltonian is constructed, and excitation
spectra, spectroscopic quadrupole moments and quadrupole transition properties
are evaluated. The effect of the time-odd pair field on the collective mass
(inertia function) of the large-amplitude vibration and the rotational moments
of inertia about three principal axes is evaluated. Basic properties of the
shape coexistence/mixing are well reproduced. The calculation indicates that
the oblate-prolate shape mixing decreases as the angular momentum increases.
