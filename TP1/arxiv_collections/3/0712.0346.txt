Via a multidimensional complementarity relation we derive a novel operational
entanglement measure for any discrete quantum system, i.e. for any
multidimensional and multipartite system. This new measure admits a separation
into different classes of entanglement obtained by using a flip operator
2,3,...,n times, defining a m-flip concurrence. For mixed states bounds on this
m-flip concurrence can be obtained. Moreover, the information content of a n
partite multidimensional system admits an intuitive interpretation. Explicitly,
the three qubits system is analyzed and the physical difference in entanglement
of the W-state, the GHZ state or the bi-separable state is revealed.
