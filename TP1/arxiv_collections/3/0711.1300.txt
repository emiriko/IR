The model of the Universe in this paper uses equations of the unperturbed
Keplerian motion. They have been updated, complementied and generalized when
the solution of these equations is the characteristic function of a random
value from the theory of probabilities. Argument of the differential equation
in this case is any more time, an interval of time between sections of a random
stationary prosess. In this paper this time interval is referred to as flexible
(elastic) time due to its many non-trivial properties. It is proved flexible
time does not depend on the space which makes invalid the four dimensional
space-time concept. The Universe becomes stationary and Eucledian. It is
proved: 1. the advavce of Mercury's perihelion versus the predictions in
accordance with the universal gravity law results inequality of the
coefficients in the correlation equations of Keplerian moution along axes x, y
and z; 2. the velocity of propagation of harmonic oscillation in the Uneverse
is not constant; 3. long-range interaction, i.e. instantaneous communication
between any two points of space in tne Universe is possible; 4. the Universe is
a closed-loop informatiom-energy system which revives the nature and acts as a
barrier to the second law of thermodynamics where stars are treated as machines
which accumulate energy by moving. Physics in the Universe is conceptually
different from that of the Earth and, respectively, needs methods of
investigation different from the ones which are used today. Numerous
astronomical supervision and the researches lead by known astrophysicist
N.A.Kozyrev personally or under his management confirm adequacy of the model in
the present paper.
