The main physics programme of the International Linear Collider (ILC)
requires a measurement of the beam energy at the interaction point with an
accuracy of $10^{-4}$ or better. To achieve this goal a magnetic spectrometer
using high resolution beam position monitors (BPMs) has been proposed. This
paper reports on the cavity BPM system that was deployed to test this proposal.
We demonstrate sub-micron resolution and micron level stability over 20 hours
for a $1\m$ long BPM triplet. We find micron-level stability over 1 hour for 3
BPM stations distributed over a $30\m$ long baseline. The understanding of the
behaviour and response of the BPMs gained from this work has allowed full
spectrometer tests to be carried out.
