Under broad conditions, evolutions due to two different Hamiltonians are
shown to lead at some moment to orthogonal states. For two spin-1/2 systems
subject to precession by different magnetic fields the achievement of
orthogonalization is demonstrated for every scenario but a special one. This
discrimination between evolutions is experimentally much simpler than
procedures proposed earlier based on either sequential or parallel application
of the unknown unitaries. A lower bound for the orthogonalization time is
proposed in terms of the properties of the two Hamiltonians.
