The original Randall-Sundrum (RS) model with a warped extra dimension along
with extensions provides the possibility for a simultaneous solution to
Planck-weak hierarchy problem as well as the flavor puzzle in the Standard
Model (SM). The most distinctive feature of this scenario is the existence of
Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons whose masses and couplings to the SM fields are set
by the TeV scale. In some realistic versions of this framework, the largest
coupling of the gravitons to the observed particles is to the top quark and
unphysical Higgses ($W^{\pm}_L$ and $Z_L$) with the KK graviton (G) masses
predicted to be $\gsim$ 4 TeV. We extend earlier works on the KK graviton
decays to the $t\bar{t}$ final state and to the ``gold-plated'' $Z_L Z_L$ modes
(with each Z decaying to $e^+ e^-$ or to $\mu^+ \mu^-$) by studying the
resonant production of the gravitons and their subsequent decay to $W_L W_L$
pair. We find that with 300 $fb^{-1}$ integrated luminosity of data the
semileptonic $G \to W (\to l \nu_l) W(\to 2 jets)$ mode offers a good
opportunity to search for the RS KK graviton mode with mass lighter than $\sim$
3-3.5 TeV at the CERN LHC. Efficient WW mass reconstruction in the semileptonic
mode combined with an analysis of dilepton mass distribution in the purely
leptonic channel, $pp \to W (\to l \nu_l) W(\to l^\prime \nu_{l^\prime})$ may
help to observe KK $Z^\prime$ and KK graviton separately. Suitably defined
average energy of the charged lepton in the semileptonic mode may be used to
distinguish decays from longitudinal versus transverse W-bosons.
