Screening of topological charges (singularities) is discussed for paraxial
optical fields with short and with long range correlations. For short range
screening the charge variance in a circular region with radius $R$ grows
linearly with $R$, instead of with $R^{2}$ as expected in the absence of
screening; for long range screening it grows faster than $R$: for a field whose
autocorrelation function is the zero order Bessel function J_{0}, the charge
variance grows as R ln R$. A J_{0} correlation function is not attainable in
practice, but we show how to generate an optical field whose correlation
function closely approximates this form. The charge variance can be measured by
counting positive and negative singularities inside the region A, or more
easily by counting signed zero crossings on the perimeter of A. \For the first
method the charge variance is calculated by integration over the charge
correlation function C(r), for the second by integration over the zero crossing
correlation function Gamma(r). Using the explicit forms of C(r) and of Gamma(r)
we show that both methods of calculation yield the same result. We show that
for short range screening the zero crossings can be counted along a straight
line whose length equals P, but that for long range screening this
simplification no longer holds. We also show that for realizable optical
fields, for sufficiently small R, the charge variance goes as R^2, whereas for
sufficiently large R, it grows as R. These universal laws are applicable to
both short and pseudo-long range correlation functions.
