We have performed chain-growth simulations of minimalistic hybrid lattice
models for polymers interacting with interfaces of attractive solid substrates
in order to gain insights into the conformational transitions of the polymers
in the adsorption process. Primarily focusing on the dependence of the
conformational behavior on temperature and solubility we obtained pseudophase
diagrams with a detailed structure of conformational subphases. In the study of
hydrophobic-polar peptides in the vicinity of different types of substrates, we
found a noticeable substrate specificity of the assembly of hydrophobic domains
in the conformations dominating the adsorption subphases.
