We introduce a technique for testing the semiclassical limit of a quantum
gravity vertex amplitude. The technique is based on the propagation of a
semiclassical wave packet. We apply this technique to the newly introduced
"flipped" vertex in loop quantum gravity, in order to test the intertwiner
dependence of the vertex. Under some drastic simplifications, we find very
preliminary, but surprisingly good numerical evidence for the correct classical
limit.
