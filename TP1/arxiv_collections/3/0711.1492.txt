We report the first calculation of persistent current in two coupled rings
which form a character ``8'' genus g=2 structure. We obtain an exact solution
for the persistent current and investigated the exact solution numerically. For
two large coupled rings with equal fluxes, we find that the persistent current
in the two coupled rings is equal to that in a single ring. For opposite fluxes
the energy has a chaotic structure. For both cases the periodicity is $h/e$.
This results are obtained within an extension of Dirac's second class method to
fermionic constraints. This theory can be tested in the ballistic regime.
