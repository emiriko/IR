We proposed in a previous paper [Opt. Commun. 228, 33 (2003)] a modified
radiative transfer equation to describe radiative transfer in a medium with a
spatially varying refractive index. The present paper is devoted to the
demonstration that this equation perfectly works in the non-absorbing /
non-scattering limit, what was contested by L. Mart\'i-L\'opez and coworkers
[Opt. Commun. 266, 44 (2006)]. The assertion that this equation would imply a
zero divergence of the rays is also commented.
