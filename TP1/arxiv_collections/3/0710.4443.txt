It is argued that the quantum gravity attractions dynamically generate tiny
degenerate Majorana masses for the neutrinos. The unequal masses of the charged
leptons then induce a computable neutrino mass matrix with splittings and
mixings through the electroweak interactions. In this way the Standard Model
including quantum gravity can accommodate and predict the neutrino masses and
mixings. Some consequences are pointed out.
