We describe measurements of the parity-violating (P-odd) triton emission
asymmetry coefficient in the 6Li(n,alfa)3H reaction with polarised cold
neutrons. Experiments were carried out at the Petersburg Nuclear Physics
Institute (Gatchina, Russia) and at the Institut Laue-Langevin (Grenoble,
France). We employed an ionisation chamber in a configuration allowing us to
suppress the left-right asymmetry well below 10^(-8). A test for a false
asymmetry due to eventual target impurities ("zero test") resulted in the value
(0.0+-0.5)x10^(-8). As final result we obtained P-odd effect
(-8.6+-2.0)x10^(-8).
