We report the fabrication of triangular lattices of parallel gold and silver
nanowires of high optical quality, with diameters down to 500 nm and
length-to-diameter ratios as high as 100,000. The nanowires are supported by a
silica glass matrix and are disposed around a central solid glass core, i.e., a
missing nanowire. These cm-long structures make it possible to trap light
within an array of nanowires and characterize the plasmon resonances that form
at specific optical frequencies. Such nanowire arrays have many potential
applications, e.g., to imaging on the sub-wavelength scale.
