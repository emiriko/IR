We evidence the importance of electron charging under nonequilibrium
conditions for carbon-nanotube-based molecular bridges, using a self-consistent
Green's function method with an extended Huckel Hamiltonian and a
three-dimensional Poisson solver. Our analysis demonstrates that such feature
is highly dependent on the chirality of the carbon nanotube as well as on the
type of the contact metal, conditioning in a nongeneralized way the system's
conduction mechanism. Based on its impact on transport, we argue that
self-consistency is essential for the current-voltage calculations of
semiconducting nanotubes, whereas less significant in the case of metallic
ones.
