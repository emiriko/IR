Neither Dark Matter nor scalar particles in the Higgs sector are ruled out at
energies accessible to bottom and charm factories. In Dark Matter searches, the
error on the mass of Dark Matter is $\sim 4$ GeV in the best LHC studies. For
light Dark Matter this could represent a 100% (or more) error. In Higgs
searches, the presence of a light singlet Higgs can make the LHC Higgs search
difficult, if not impossible. If Dark Matter or a Higgs scalar is light, it
will {\it require} a low-energy machine to precisely determine the couplings.
We review the models, modes of discovery and rate expectations for these new
particle searches at bottom and charm factories. We also discuss the options
for new runs at bottom and charm factories relevant for these searches.
