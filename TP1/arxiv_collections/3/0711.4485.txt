In this note we present a new self-contained approach to the class field
theory of arithmetic schemes in the sense of Wiesend. Along the way we prove
new results on space filling curves on arithmetic schemes and on the class
field theory of local rings. We show how one can deduce the more classical
version of higher global class field theory due to Kato and Saito from
Wiesend's version. One of our new results says that the connected component of
the identity element in Wiesend's class group is divisible if some obstruction
is absent.
