Critical points that can be suppressed to zero temperature are interesting
because quantum fluctuations have been shown to dramatically alter electron gas
properties. Here, the metal formed by Co doping the paramagnetic insulator
FeS$_2$, Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$S$_2$, is demonstrated to order ferromagnetically at
$x>x_c=0.01\pm0.005$ where we observe unusual transport, magnetic, and
thermodynamic properties. We show that this magnetic semiconductor undergoes a
percolative magnetic transition with distinct similarities to the Griffiths
phase, including singular behavior at $x_c$ and zero temperature.
