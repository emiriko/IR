In this work, we report the first lattice calculation of hyperon axial
couplings, using the 2+1-flavor MILC configurations and domain-wall fermion
valence quarks. Both the $\Sigma$ and $\Xi$ axial couplings are computed for
the first time in lattice QCD. In particular we find that $g_{\Sigma\Sigma} =
0.450(21)_{\rm stat}(27)_{\rm syst}$ and $g_{\Xi\Xi} = -0.277(15)_{\rm
stat}(19)_{\rm syst}$.
