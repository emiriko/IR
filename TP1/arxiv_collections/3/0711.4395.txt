We investigate for quantum dynamics in phase-space regions containing
``shearless tori''. We show that the properties of these peculiar classical
phase-space structures -- important to the dynamics of tokamaks -- may be
exploited for quantum information applications. In particular we show that
shearless tori permit the non-dispersive transmission of localized wavepackets.
The quantum many-body Hamiltonian of a Heisenberg ferromagnetic spin chain,
subjected to an oscillating magnetic field, can be reduced to a classical
one-body ``image'' dynamical system which is the well-studied Harper map. The
Harper map belongs to a class of Hamiltonian systems (non-twist maps) which
contain shearless tori. We show that a variant with sinusoidal time driving
``driven Harper model'' produces shearless tori which are especially suitable
for quantum state transfer. The behavior of the concurrence is investigated as
an example.
