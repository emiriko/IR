We show theoretically how constant-energy maps of the angle-resolved
photoemission intensity can be used to test wave function symmetry in graphene.
For monolayer graphene, we demonstrate that the observed anisotropy of ARPES
spectra is a manifestation of what has been recently branded as electronic
chirality. For bilayer graphene, we show that the anisotropy of the
constant-energy maps may be used to extract information about the magnitude and
sign of interlayer coupling parameters and about symmetry breaking inflicted on
a bilayer by the underlying substrate.
