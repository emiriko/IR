We investigate the QCD Dirac operator with gauge configurations given by a
liquid of instantons in the region of temperatures about the chiral phase
transition. Both the quenched and unquenched cases are examined in detail. We
present evidence of a localization transition in the low lying modes of the
  Dirac operator around the same temperature as the chiral phase transition.
Thus both level statistics and eigenvectors of the QCD Dirac operator at the
chiral phase transition have similar properties than those of a disordered
conductor at the metal-insulator transition. This strongly suggests the
phenomenon of Anderson localization (localization by destructive quantum
interference) is the leading physical mechanism in the restoration of the
chiral symmetry. Finally we argue that our findings are not in principle
restricted to the ILM approximation and may also be found in lattice
simulations.
