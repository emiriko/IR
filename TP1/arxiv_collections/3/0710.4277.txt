The Point Contact Andreev Reflection (PCAR) technique has already been used
to measure the spin polarization of some of the dilute magnetic semiconductors,
such as narrow-band (In,Mn)Sb, as well as wider gap (Ga,Mn)As. While in
(In,Mn)Sb conventional Andreev reflection has been demonstrated, in (Ga,Mn)As
quasiparticle density of states (DOS) broadening has been observed, possibly
due to inelastic scattering effects. Here, we investigate the spin
polarization, magnetic, and transport properties of epitaxially grown (Ga,Mn)Sb
films with the Curie temperature of ~ 10K. The spin polarization of 57+/-5% was
measured. Spectrum broadening in (Ga,Mn)Sb has also been observed.
