We find a new family of AdS_4 vacua in IIA string theory. The internal space
is topologically either the complex projective space CP^3 or the "flag
manifold" SU(3)/(U(1)xU(1)), but the metric is in general neither Einstein nor
Kaehler. All known moduli are stabilized by fluxes, without using quantum
effects or orientifold planes. The analysis is completely ten--dimensional and
does not rely on assumptions about Kaluza--Klein reduction.
