Some astronomy projects require a blind search through a vast number of
hypotheses to detect objects of interest. The number of hypotheses to test can
be in the billions. A naive blind search over every single hypothesis would be
far too costly computationally. We propose a hierarchical scheme for blind
search, using various "resolution" levels. At lower resolution levels,
"regions" of interest in the search space are singled out with a low
computational cost. These regions are refined at intermediate resolution levels
and only the most promising candidates are finally tested at the original fine
resolution. The optimal search strategy is found by dynamic programming. We
demonstrate the procedure for pulsar search from satellite gamma-ray
observations and show that the power of the naive blind search can almost be
matched with the hierarchical scheme while reducing the computational burden by
more than three orders of magnitude.
