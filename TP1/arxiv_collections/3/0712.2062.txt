We present a comprehensive study of Vicsek-style self-propelled particle
models in two and three space dimensions. The onset of collective motion in
such stochastic models with only local alignment interactions is studied in
detail and shown to be discontinuous (first-order like). The properties of the
ordered, collectively moving phase are investigated. In a large domain of
parameter space including the transition region, well-defined high-density and
high-order propagating solitary structures are shown to dominate the dynamics.
Far enough from the transition region, on the other hand, these objects are not
present. A statistically-homogeneous ordered phase is then observed, which is
characterized by anomalously-strong density fluctuations, superdiffusion, and
strong intermittency.
