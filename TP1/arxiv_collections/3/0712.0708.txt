The purpose of this paper is to explain how the identities of various
fundamental lemmas fall within the scope of the transfer principle, a general
result that allows to transfer theorems about identities of p-adic integrals
from one collection of fields to others. In particular, once the fundamental
lemma has been established for one collection of fields (for example, fields of
positive characteristic), it is also valid for others (fields of characteristic
zero).
