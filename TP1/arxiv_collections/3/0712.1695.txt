An arithmetically simple method has been developed for the evaluation of
Biot--Savart integrals on tetrahedralized distributions of vorticity. In place
of the usual approach of analytical formulae for the velocity induced by a
linear distribution of vorticity on a tetrahedron, the integration is performed
using Gaussian quadrature and a ray tracing technique from computer graphics.
This eliminates completely the need for the evaluation of square roots,
logarithms and arc tangents, and almost completely eliminates the requirement
for trigonometric functions, with no operation more costly than a division
required during the main calculation loop. An assessment of the algorithm's
performance is presented, demonstrating its accuracy, second order convergence
and near-linear speedup on parallel systems.
