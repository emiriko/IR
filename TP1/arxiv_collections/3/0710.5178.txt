For a general mechanical system, it is shown that each solution of the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation defines an N=2 pseudo-supersymmetric extension of the
system, such that the usual relation of the momenta to Hamilton's principal
function is the `BPS' condition for preservation of 1/2 pseudo-supersymmetry.
The examples of the relativistic and non-relativistic particle, in a general
potential, are worked through in detail, and used to discuss the relation to
cosmology and to supersymmetric quantum mechanics.
