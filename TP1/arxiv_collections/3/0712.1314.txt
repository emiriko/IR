A frozen spin polarized deuteron target cooled by the 3He/4He dilution
refrigerator is described. Fully deuterated 1,2-propanediol was used as a
target material. Deuteron vector polarization about 40% was obtained for the
target in the shape of a cylinder of 2 cm diameter and 6 cm length. The target
is intended for a study of 3N interactions at the polarized neutron beam
generated by the Van de Graaff accelerator at the Charles University in Prague.
