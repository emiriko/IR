International standards for lexicon formats are in preparation. To a certain
extent, the proposed formats converge with prior results of standardization
projects. However, their adequacy for (i) lexicon management and (ii)
lexicon-driven applications have been little debated in the past, nor are they
as a part of the present standardization effort. We examine these issues. IGM
has developed XML formats compatible with the emerging international standards,
and we report experimental results on large-coverage lexica.
