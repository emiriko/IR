We review some aspects of D-instantons in intersecting D-brane models. In
particular, we present applications of the recently proposed instanton calculus
to computations of charged matter superpotential couplings and corrections to
the gauge kinetic function in the low energy effective action of type IIA
orientifolds. As an interesting byway, we also discuss how one-loop corrections
to the gauge kinetic function can be deduced from gauge threshold corrections
in the type IIA setting.
