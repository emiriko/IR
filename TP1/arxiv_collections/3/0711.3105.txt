We theoretically study the optical properties of a gas of ultracold,
coherently dressed three-level atoms in a Mott insulator phase of an optical
lattice. The vacuum state, the band dispersion and the absorption spectrum of
the polariton field can be controlled in real time by varying the amplitude and
the frequency of the dressing beam. In the weak dressing regime, the system
shows unique ultra-slow light propagation properties without absorption. In the
presence of a fast time modulation of the dressing amplitude, we predict a
significant emission of photon pairs by parametric amplification of the
polaritonic zero-point fluctuations. Quantitative considerations on the
experimental observability of such a dynamical Casimir effect are presented for
the most promising atomic species and level schemes.
