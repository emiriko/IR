We have investigated the influence of impurities on the possible supersolid
transition by systematically enriching isotopically-pure 4He (< 1 ppb of 3He)
with 3He. The onset of nonclassical rotational inertia is broadened and shifts
monotonically to higher temperature with increasing 3He concentration,
suggesting that the phenomenon is correlated to the condensation of 3He atoms
onto the dislocation network in solid 4He.
