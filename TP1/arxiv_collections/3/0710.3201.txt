For laboratory kinetic energies between 50 and 200 MeV, we focus on
generating an energy-dependent Lorentz covariant parameterization of the
on-shell nucleon-nucleon (NN) scattering amplitudes in terms of a number of
Yukawa-type meson exchanges in first-order Born approximation. This
parameterization provides a good description of NN scattering observables in
the energy range of interest, and can also be extrapolated to energies between
40 and 300 MeV.
