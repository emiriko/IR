Algorithmic progress in recent years made it possible to simulate QCD with
Nf=2 flavours of O(a)-improved Wilson fermions at very light quark masses. We
present the current results for baryon spectrum states, the nucleon axial
coupling and the lowest moment of unpolarised nucleon structure functions.
Special emphasis is given to a comparison of our calculations with results from
chiral effective theories.
