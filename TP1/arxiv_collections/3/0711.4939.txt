We studied the response of a ferromagnet-insulator-normal metal tunnel
structure under an external oscillating radio frequency (R.F.) magnetic field.
The D. C. voltage across the junction is calculated and is found not to
decrease despite the high resistance of the junction; instead, it is of the
order of $\mu V$ to $100\mu V$, much larger than the experimentally observed
value (100 nano-V) in the "strong coupled" ohmic ferromagnet-normal metal
bilayers. This is consistent with recent experimental results in tunnel
structures, where the voltage is larger than $\mu V$s. The damping and loss of
an external RF field in this structure is calculated.
