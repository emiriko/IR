From a reflection measurement in a rectangular microwave billiard with
randomly distributed scatterers the scattering and the ordinary fidelity was
studied. The position of one of the scatterers is the perturbation parameter.
Such perturbations can be considered as {\em local} since wave functions are
influenced only locally, in contrast to, e. g., the situation where the
fidelity decay is caused by the shift of one billiard wall. Using the
random-plane-wave conjecture, an analytic expression for the fidelity decay due
to the shift of one scatterer has been obtained, yielding an algebraic $1/t$
decay for long times. A perfect agreement between experiment and theory has
been found, including a predicted scaling behavior concerning the dependence of
the fidelity decay on the shift distance. The only free parameter has been
determined independently from the variance of the level velocities.
