We generalize to stochastic dynamics the exact expression for average
dissipation along an arbitrary non-equilibrium process, given in Phys. Rev.
Lett. 98, 080602 (2007). We then derive lower bounds by various coarse-graining
procedures and illustrate how, when and where the information on the
dissipation is captured in models of over- and underdamped Brownian particles.
