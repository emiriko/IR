We consider an effective field theory for the nonleptonic decay in which a
heavy quark decays into a pair of a heavy quark and antiquark having a small
relative velocity and one relativistic (massless) quark. This effective theory
is a combination of HQET, SCET, and a covariant modification of NRQCD. In the
leading logarithm approximation the effective theory decay amplitude factorizes
into the product of matrix elements of heavy-to-heavy and heavy-to-light
currents. We discuss a possibility of factorization beyond the leading
logarithm approximation and find it doubtful. The Wilson coefficients of the
effective theory electro-weak (EWET) Lagrangian in the next-to-the leading
logarithm approximation are calculated at the matching scale of the decay. The
differential decay rate for the inclusive decay B -> J/\psi+h in the effective
theory framework is evaluated.
