Micro-Raman spectroscopy has been used to study lattice dynamics associated
with the ferroelectric domains of a BiFeO$_3$ single crystal at low
temperature. The phonon assignment shows a large frequency splitting between
the transverse and longitudinal components of the A$_1$ phonon mode related to
the Bi-O bonds in contrast with thin films where the splitting is negligible.
Applying an external electric field induces frequency shifts of the low energy
modes related to the Bi-O bonds. These softenings are due to a tensile stress
via the piezoelectric effect. We give estimates of the phonon deformation
potentials.
