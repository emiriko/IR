Urban segregation of different communities, like blacks and whites in the
USA, has been simulated by Ising-like models since Schelling 1971. This
research was accompanied by a scientific segregation, with sociologists and
physicists ignoring each other until 2000. We review recent progress and also
present some new two-temperature multi-cultural simulations.
