Microwave irradiation causes voltage fluctuations in solid state nanodevices.
Such an effect is relevant in atomic electronics and nanostructures for quantum
information processing, where charge or spin states are controlled by microwave
fields and electrically detected. Here the variation of the characteristic
times of the multiphonon capture and emission of a single electron by an
interface defect in submicron MOSFETs is calculated and measured as a function
of the microwave power, whose frequency of the voltage modulation is assumed to
be large if compared to the inverse of the characteristic times. The variation
of the characteristic times under microwave irradiation is quantitatively
predicted from the microwave frequency dependent stationary current generated
by the voltage fluctuations itself. The expected values agree with the
experimental measurements. The coupling between the microwave field and either
one or two terminals of the device is discussed. Some consequences on nanoscale
device technology are drawn.
