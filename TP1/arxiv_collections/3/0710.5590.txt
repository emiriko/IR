Within particle physics itself, Gauguin's questions may be interpreted as: P1
- What is the status of the Standard Model? P2 - What physics may lie beyond
the Standard Model? P3 - What is the `Theory of Everything'? Gauguin's
questions may also asked within a cosmological context: C1 - What were the
early stages of the Big Bang? C2 - What is the material content of the Universe
today? C3 - What is the future of the Universe? In this talk I preview many of
the topics to be discussed in the plenary sessions of this conference,
highlighting how they bear on these fundamental questions.
