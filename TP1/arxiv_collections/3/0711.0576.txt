We study the approach in which independent variables describing gravity are
functions of the space-time embedding into a flat space of higher dimension. We
formulate a canonical formalism for such a theory in a form, which requires
imposing additional constraints, which are a part of Einstein's equations. As a
result, we obtain a theory with an eight-parameter gauge symmetry. This theory
becomes equivalent to Einstein's general relativity either after partial gauge
fixing or after rewriting the metric in the form that is invariant under the
additional gauge transformations. We write the action for such a theory.
