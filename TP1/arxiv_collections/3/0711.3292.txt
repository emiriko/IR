This paper reports on our research in developing a micro power generation
system based on gas turbine engine and piezoelectric converter. The micro gas
turbine engine consists of a micro combustor, a turbine and a centrifugal
compressor. Comprehensive simulation has been implemented to optimal the
component design. We have successfully demonstrated a silicon-based micro
combustor, which consists of seven layers of silicon structures. A
hairpin-shaped design is applied to the fuel/air recirculation channel. The
micro combustor can sustain a stable combustion with an exit temperature as
high as 1600 K. We have also successfully developed a micro turbine device,
which is equipped with enhanced micro air-bearings and driven by compressed
air. A rotation speed of 15,000 rpm has been demonstrated during lab test. In
this paper, we will introduce our research results major in the development of
micro combustor and micro turbine test device.
