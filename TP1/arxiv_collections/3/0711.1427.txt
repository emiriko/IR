We present results of finite temperature QCD from N_f=2 flavors of
non-perturbatively improved Wilson fermions on lattices with N_t=8, 10 and 12.
The transition temperature T_c is determined for the first time at lattice
spacings as low as a = 0.08 fm, albeit at pion masses 1.3 < r_0 m_\pi. We
furthermore compute the screening masses in various color channels at T>T_c.
