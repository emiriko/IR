Using a phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory for the magnetic conical
cycloid state of a multiferroic, which has been recently reported in the cubic
spinel CoCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$, we discuss its low-energy fluctuation spectrum. We
identify the Goldstone modes of the conical cycloidal order, and deduce their
dispersion relations whose signature anisotropy in momentum space reflects the
symmetries broken by the ordered state. We discuss the soft polarization
fluctuations, the `electromagnons', associated with these magnetic modes and
make several experimental predictions which can be tested in neutron scattering
and optical experiments.
