The thermal resistance between a nanostructure and a half-body is calculated
in the framework of particle-phonons physics. The current models approximate
the nanostructure as a thermal bath. We prove that the multireflections of heat
carriers in the nanostructure significantly increase resistance in
contradiction with former predictions. This increase depends on the shape of
the nanostructure and the heat carriers mean free path only. We provide a
general and simple expression for the contact resistance and examine the
specific cases of nanowires and nanoparticles.
