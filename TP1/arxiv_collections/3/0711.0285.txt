This paper concerns relational first principles from which the Dirac
procedure exhaustively picks out the geometrodynamics corresponding to general
relativity as one of a handful of consistent theories. This was accompanied by
a number of results and conjectures about matter theories and general features
of physics -- such as gauge theory, the universal light cone principle of
special relativity and the equivalence principle -- being likewise picked out.
I have previously shown that many of these matter results and conjectures are
contingent on further unrelational simplicity assumptions. In this paper, I
point out 1) that the exhaustive procedure in these cases with matter fields is
slower than it was previously held to be. 2) While the example of equivalence
principle violating matter theory that I previously showed how to accommodate
on relational premises has a number of pathological features, in this paper I
point out that there is another closely related equivalence principle violating
theory that also follows from those premises and is less pathological. This
example being known as an `Einstein--aether theory', it also serves for 3)
illustrating limitations on the conjectured emergence of the universal light
cone special relativity principle.
