This paper serves as a report on the large amount of analysis done in
conjunction with the polarized proton program at RHIC. This comprises elastic
scattering data of protons on protons in colliding beam or fixed target mode
and proton beams on carbon targets. In addition to providing a model for the
energy dependence of the analyzing power of elastic scattering needed for
proton polarimetry, it also provides some significant information about the
spin dependence of dominant Regge poles. Most notably, the data indicates that
the Pomeron has a significant spin-flip coupling. This allows the exploration
of the double spin flip asymmetry A_{NN} for which some data over a wide energy
range is now available, along with a concrete realization of a proposed Odderon
search.
