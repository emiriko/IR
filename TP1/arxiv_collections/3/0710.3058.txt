In this paper we investigate the nature and structure of the relation between
imposed classifications and real clustering in a particular case of a
scale-free network given by the on-line encyclopedia Wikipedia. We find a
statistical similarity in the distributions of community sizes both by using
the top-down approach of the categories division present in the archive and in
the bottom-up procedure of community detection given by an algorithm based on
the spectral properties of the graph. Regardless the statistically similar
behaviour the two methods provide a rather different division of the articles,
thereby signaling that the nature and presence of power laws is a general
feature for these systems and cannot be used as a benchmark to evaluate the
suitability of a clustering method.
