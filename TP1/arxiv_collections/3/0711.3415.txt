Magnetic impurities play an important role in many spintronics-related
materials. Motivated by this fact, we study the anomalous Hall effect in the
presence of magnetic impurities, focusing on two-dimensional electron systems
with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. We find a highly nonlinear dependence on the
impurity polarization, including possible sign changes. At small impurity
magnetizations, this is a consequence of the remarkable result that the linear
term is independent of the spin-orbit coupling strength. Near saturation of the
impurity spins, the anomalous Hall conductivity can be resonantly enhanced, due
to interference between potential and magnetic scattering.
