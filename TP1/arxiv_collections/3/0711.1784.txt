We study the mean field approximation of a recent model of cascades on
networks relevant to the investigation of systemic risk control in financial
networks. In the model, the hypothesis of a trend reinforcement in the
stochastic process describing the fragility of the nodes, induces a trade-off
in the systemic risk with respect to the density of the network. Increasing the
average link density, the network is first less exposed to systemic risk, while
above an intermediate value the systemic risk increases. This result offers a
simple explanation for the emergence of instabilities in financial systems that
get increasingly interwoven. In this paper, we study the dynamics of the
probability density function of the average fragility. This converges to a
unique stable distribution which can be computed numerically and can be used to
estimate the systemic risk as a function of the parameters of the model.
