Using recent results in the field of quantum chaos we derive explicit
expressions for the time scale of decoherence induced by the system-environment
entanglement. For a generic system-environment interaction and for a generic
quantum chaotic system as environment, conditions are derived for energy
eigenstates to be preferred states in the weak coupling regime. A simple model
is introduced to numerically confirm our predictions. The results presented
here may also help understanding the dynamics of quantum entanglement
generation in chaotic quantum systems.
