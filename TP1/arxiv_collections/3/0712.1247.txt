Measurements of the temperature of Mo shocked to ~60 GPa and then released to
~28 GPa were previously attempted using high explosive driven flyer plates and
pyrometry. Analysis of the radiance traces at different wavelengths indicates
that the temporal evolution of the radiance can be explained by a contribution
from the LiF window to the measured thermal radiation. Fitting the radiance
traces with a simple model, supported by continuum dynamics studies which were
able to relate structures in the radiance history to hydrodynamic events in the
experiment, the contribution of the window was obtained and hence the
temperature of the Mo sample. The shock-and release temperature obtained in the
Mo was 762+/-40K which is consistent with calculations taking the contribution
of plastic work to the heating into account. The radiance obtained for the LiF
window shows a non thermal distribution which can be described by a bulk
temperature of 624+/-112K and hot spots (less than 0.5% in total volume) within
the window at a temperature of about 2000K.
