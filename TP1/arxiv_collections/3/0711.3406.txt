We present a concise review of the physics of ultra-cold dipolar gases, based
mainly on the theoretical developments in our own group. First, we discuss
shortly weakly interacting ultra-cold trapped dipolar gases. Dipolar
Bose-Einstein condensates exhibit non-standard instabilities and the physics of
both Bose and Fermi dipolar gases depends on the trap geometry. We focus then
the second part of the paper on strongly correlated dipolar gases and discuss
ultra-cold dipolar gases in optical lattices. Such gases exhibit a spectacular
richness of quantum phases and metastable states, which may perhaps be used as
quantum memories. We comment shortly on the possibility of superchemistry
aiming at the creation of dipolar heteronuclear molecules in lattices. Finally,
we turn to ultra-cold dipolar gases in artificial magnetic fields, and consider
rotating dipolar gases, that provide in our opinion the best option towards the
realization of the fractional quantum Hall effect and quantum Wigner crystals.
