This document describes our current effort to gridify Jade, a java-based
environment for the autonomic management of clustered J2EE application servers,
developed in the INRIA SARDES research team. Towards this objective, we use the
java ProActive grid technology. We first present some of the challenges to turn
such an autonomic management system initially dedicated to distributed
applications running on clusters of machines, into one that can provide
self-management capabilities to large-scale systems, i.e. deployed on grid
infrastructures. This leads us to a brief state of the art on grid monitoring
systems. Then, we recall the architecture of Jade, and consequently propose to
reorganize it in a potentially more scalable way. Practical experiments pertain
to the use of the grid deployment feature offered by ProActive to easily
conduct the deployment of the Jade system or its revised version on any sort of
grid.
