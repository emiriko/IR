In the chiral limit of QCD, the pion decay constant F can be extracted from
lattice gauge theory by means of a coupling to isospin chemical potential. Here
we compute the leading correction due to finite volume in the epsilon-expansion
of chiral perturbation theory. A comparison is made to recent Monte Carlo data.
