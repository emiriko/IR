We consider gauge theories in a String Field Theory-inspired formalism. The
constructed algebraic operations lead in particular to homotopy algebras of the
related BV theories. We discuss invariant description of the gauge fixing
procedure and special algebraic features of gauge theories coupled to matter
fields.
