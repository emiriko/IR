We used a continuously rotating torsion balance instrument to measure the
acceleration difference of beryllium and titanium test bodies towards sources
at a variety of distances. Our result Delta a=(0.6+/-3.1)x10^-15 m/s^2 improves
limits on equivalence-principle violations with ranges from 1 m to infinity by
an order of magnitude. The Eoetvoes parameter is eta=(0.3+/-1.8)x10^-13. By
analyzing our data for accelerations towards the center of the Milky Way we
find equal attractions of Be and Ti towards galactic dark matter, yielding
eta=(-4 +/- 7)x10^-5. Space-fixed differential accelerations in any direction
are limited to less than 8.8x10^-15 m/s^2 with 95% confidence.
