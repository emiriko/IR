The ATLAS experiment sensitivity to top quark Flavour Changing Neutral
Current (FCNC) decays was studied at LHC using ttbar events. While one of the
top quarks is expected to follow the dominant Standard Model decay t->bW, the
other decays through a FCNC channel, i.e. t-> Z u(c), t-> gamma u(c) or t-> g
u(c). Different types of analyses, applied to each FCNC decay mode, were
compared. The FCNC branching ratio sensitivity (assuming a 5sigma signal
significance) and 95% confidence level limits on the branching ratios (in the
hypothesis of signal absence) were obtained.
