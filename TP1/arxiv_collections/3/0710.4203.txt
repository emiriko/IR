We measure relative abundances of $K_{S}^{0}$, $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$
in near-side and away-side cones correlated with triggered high-$p_{T}$
particles in $^{197}$Au + $^{197}$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV.
The centrality dependence of identified particles in the triggered particle
cones is also presented. Particle yields and ratios are extracted on the
near-side and away-side of the trigger particle. The associate-particle ratios
are studied as a function of the angle relative to the trigger particle azimuth
$\Delta\phi$. Such studies should help elucidate the origin of the
modifications in the jet like correlations observed in Au+Au collisions
relative to p+p collisions. And these studies also will help understand the
variation of local parton densities at the away side. We discuss how these
measurements might be related to several scenarios for interactions of fast
partons with the medium created in Au+Au collision.
