We explore the quasistationary regime of the Hamiltonian Mean Field Model
(HMF) showing that at least three different classes of events exist, with a
different diffusive behavior and with a relative frequency which depends on the
size of the system. Along the same line of a recent work \cite{epl}, these
results indicate that one must be very careful in exchanging time averages with
ensemble averages during the non-ergodic metastable regime and at the same time
they emphasize the role of finite size effects in the evaluation of the
diffusive properties of the system.
