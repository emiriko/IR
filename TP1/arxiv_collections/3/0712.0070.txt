We show that the phenomenology of isospin effects on heavy ion reactions at
intermediate energies (few AGeV range) is extremely rich and can allow a
``direct'' study of the covariant structure of the isovector interaction in a
high density hadron medium. We work within a relativistic transport frame,
beyond a cascade picture, consistently derived from effective Lagrangians,
where isospin effects are accounted for in the mean field and collision terms.
We show that rather sensitive observables are provided by the pion/kaon
production (\pi^-/\pi^+, K^0/K^+ yields). Relevant non-equilibrium effects are
stressed. The possibility of the transition to a mixed hadron-quark phase, at
high baryon and isospin density, is finally suggested. Some signatures could
come from an expected ``neutron trapping'' effect.
