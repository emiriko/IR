Present paper is a review of results, obtained in the framework of
semiclassical approach in nanophysics. Semiclassical description, based on
Electrostatics and Thomas-Fermi model was applied to calculate dimensions of
the electronic shell of a fullerene molecule and a carbon nanotube. This
simplified approach yields surprisingly accurate results in some cases.
Semiclassical approach provides rather good description of the dimensions of
the electronic shell of a fullerene molecule. Two types of dipole oscillations
in a fullerene molecule were considered and their frequencies were calculated.
Similar calculations were performed for a carbon nanotube also. These results
look rather reasonable. Three types of dipole oscillations in carbon nanotube
were considered and their frequencies were calculated. Frequencies of the
longitudinal collective oscillations of delocalized electrons in carbon peapod
were calculated as well. Metallic cluster was modeled as a spherical ball. It
was shown that metallic cluster is stable; its bulk modulus and the frequency
of the dipole oscillation of the electronic shell relative to the ions were
calculated.
