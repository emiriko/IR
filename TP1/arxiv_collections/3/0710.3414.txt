$K \to \pi$ and $K \to 0$ weak matrix elements of $\Delta S = 1$ operators
have been measured in 2+1 flavor domain wall fermion (DWF) QCD on (3 fm)$^3$
lattices with $a^{-1} = 1.73(3)$ GeV. As is well known, using these matrix
elements and chiral perturbation theory allows a determination of the $K \to
\pi \pi$ matrix elements that enter in the quantitative value for the $\Delta I
= 1/2$ rule and $\epsilon^\prime/\epsilon$. Two light dynamical sea quark
masses have been used, along with six valence quark masses, with the lightest
valence quark mass $\approx 1/10$ the physical strange quark mass. We report
our results for lattice matrix elements in the $SU(3)_L \times SU(3)_R$ (27,1),
(8,1), and (8,8) representations, paying particular attention to the
statistical errors achieved after measurements on 75 configurations. We also
report on our calculation of the non-perturbative renormalization coefficients
for these $\Delta S=1$ weak operators, using the Rome-Southampton method.
