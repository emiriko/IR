Impurity effects on the stability of a ferromagnetic metallic state in a
bicritical-state manganite, (La0.7Pr0.3)0.65Ca0.35MnO3, on the verge of
metal-insulator transition have been investigated by substituting a variety of
transition-metal atoms for Mn ones. Among them, Fe doping exhibits the
exceptional ability to dramatically decrease the ferromagnetic transition
temperature. Systematic studies on the magnetotransport properties and x-ray
diffraction for the Fe-doped crystals have revealed that charge-orbital
ordering evolves down to low temperatures, which strongly suppresses the
ferromagnetic metallic state. The observed glassy magnetic and transport
properties as well as diffuse phase transition can be attributed to the
phase-separated state where short-range charge-orbital-ordered clusters are
embedded in the ferromagnetic metallic matrix. Such a behavior in the Fe-doped
manganites form a marked contrast to the Cr-doping effects on
charge-orbital-ordered manganites known as impurity-induced collapse of
charge-orbital ordering.
