Two-body scattering is studied by solving the Lippmann-Schwinger equation in
momentum space without angular-momentum decomposition for a local spin
dependent short range interaction plus Coulomb. The screening and
renormalization approach is employed to treat the Coulomb interaction.
Benchmark calculations are performed by comparing our procedure with
partial-wave calculations in configuration space for p-10Be, p-16O and 12C-10Be
elastic scattering, using a simple optical potential model.
