I put metastable supersymmetry breaking in a cosmological context. I argue
that under reasonable assumptions, the cooling down early Universe favors
metastable SUSY-breaking vacua over the stable supersymmetric vacua. To
illustrate the general argument, I analyze the early-Universe history of the
Intriligator-Seiberg-Shih model.
