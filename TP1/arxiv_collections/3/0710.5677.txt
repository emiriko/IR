A constituent quark model is developed for the reaction, allowing us to
investigate all available data for differential cross sections as well as
single polarization asymmetries (beam and target) by including {\it all} of the
PDG, one to four star, nucleon resonances ($S_{11}$, $P_{11}$, $P_{13}$,
$D_{13}$, $D_{15}$, $F_{15}$, $F_{17}$, $G_{17}$, $G_{19}$, $H_{19}$,
$I_{1,11}$, and $K_{1,13}$). Issues related to the missing resonances are also
briefly discussed by examining possible contributions from several new
resonances ($S_{11}$, $P_{11}$, $P_{13}$, $D_{13}$, $ D_{15}$, and $H_{1,11}$).
