The power grid defines one of the most important technological networks of
our times and sustains our complex society. It has evolved for more than a
century into an extremely huge and seemingly robust and well understood system.
But it becomes extremely fragile as well, when unexpected, usually minimal,
failures turn into unknown dynamical behaviours leading, for example, to sudden
and massive blackouts. Here we explore the fragility of the European power grid
under the effect of selective node removal. A mean field analysis of fragility
against attacks is presented together with the observed patterns. Deviations
from the theoretical conditions for network percolation (and fragmentation)
under attacks are analysed and correlated with non topological reliability
measures.
