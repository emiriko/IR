Recently there have been some controversies about the criterion of the
adiabatic approximation. It is shown that an approximate diagonalization of the
effective Hamiltonian in the second quantized formulation gives rise to a
reliable and unambiguous criterion of the adiabatic approximation. This is
illustrated for the model of Marzlin and Sanders and a model related to the
geometric phase which can be exactly diagonalized in the present sense.
