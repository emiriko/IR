Diamond nanocrystals containing highly photoluminescent color centers are
attractive non-classical and near-field light sources. For near-field
applications the size of the nanocrystal is crucial since it defines the
optical resolution. NV (Nitrogen-Vacancy) color centers are efficiently created
by proton irradiation and annealing of a nanodiamond powder. Using near-field
microscopy and photon statistics measurements, we show that nanodiamond with
size down to 25 nm can hold a single NV color center with bright and stable
photoluminescence.
