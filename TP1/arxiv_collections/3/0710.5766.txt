We performed inelastic neutron experiments on underdoped
La_2-xSr_xCuO_4(x=0.10, T_c=28.6K) using a time-of-flight neutron scattering
technique. Four incommensurate peaks on the two-dimensional reciprocal plane
disperse inwards toward an antiferromagnetic zone center as the energy
increases. These peaks merge into a single peak at an energy E_cross around
w=40+-3meV. Beyond E_cross, the peak starts to broaden and ``hourglass-like''
excitations are observed. The E_cross in the underdoped sample is smaller than
that reported for the optimally doped La_1.84Sr_0.16CuO_4. The reduction of the
E_cross is explained by the doping-independent slope of the downward dispersion
below the E_cross combined with the smaller incommensurability in the
underdoped sample. In the energy spectrum of chi"(w), we observed a similar
"peak-dip-hump" structure in the energy region of 10~45meV to that reported for
the optimally doped sample. We discuss the relation between the
hourglass-shaped dispersion and the peak-dip-hump energy spectrum.
