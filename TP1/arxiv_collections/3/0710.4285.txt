Voiced sounds involve self-sustained vocal folds oscillations due to the
interaction between the airflow and the vocal folds. Common vocal folds
pathologies like polyps and anatomical asymmetry degrade the mechanical vocal
fold properties and consequently disturb the normal oscillation pattern
resulting in an abnormal sound production. Treatment of voice abnormalities
would benefit from an improved understanding between the pathology and the
resulting oscillation pattern which motivates physical vocal folds modelling.
The current study applies a theoretical vocal folds model to vocal folds
pathologies. The theoretical vocal folds model is validated using an
experimental set-up simulating the human phonatory apparatus. It consists in a
pressure reservoir, a self-oscillating latex replica of the vocal folds and an
acoustical resonator. The effects of pathologies are simulated by modifying the
replica's geometry, elasticity, and homogeneity under controlled experimental
conditions. In general, we observed a close match between measurements and
theoretical predictions, which is all the more surprising considering the
crudeness of the theoretical model
