We review recent progress in the determination of the subsaturation density
behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy from heavy-ion collisions as well as
the theoretical progress in probing the high density behavior of the symmetry
energy in heavy-ion reactions induced by high energy radioactive beams. We
further discuss the implications of these results for the nuclear effective
interactions and the neutron skin thickness of heavy nuclei.
