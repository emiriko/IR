A spherically symmetric charged ideal fluid solution of Einstein field
equation is given in the presence of the cosmological constant and two well
known example of this type of solution is presented. If the matter is confined
in a region, the exterior spacetime is considered as RN-de Sitter
(Reissner-Nordstrom de Sitter) and to complete solution matching conditions are
examined. We show that the function which is related to the dynamics of the
system will determine the fate of the system: expansion, contraction or
bouncing situations may occur for different configurations. The initial
conditions of the matter determine the final form of the system and therefore
the nature of the singularities in the presence of the electric charge and the
cosmological constant is examined to reveal their effects on the singularity
formation during collapse.
