In this work we simulate a viscous hydrodynamical model of non-central Au-Au
collisions in 2+1 dimensions, assuming longitudinal boost invariance. The model
fluid equations were proposed by \"{O}ttinger and Grmela \cite{OG}. Freezeout
is signaled when the viscous corrections become large relative to the ideal
terms. Then viscous corrections to the transverse momentum and differential
elliptic flow spectra are calculated. When viscous corrections to the thermal
distribution function are not included, the effects of viscosity on elliptic
flow are modest. However, when these corrections are included, the elliptic
flow is strongly modified at large $p_T$. We also investigate the stability of
the viscous results by comparing the non-ideal components of the stress tensor
($\pi^{ij}$) and their influence on the $v_2$ spectrum to the expectation of
the Navier-Stokes equations ($\pi^{ij} = -\eta \llangle \partial_i u_j
\rrangle$). We argue that when the stress tensor deviates from the
Navier-Stokes form the dissipative corrections to spectra are too large for a
hydrodynamic description to be reliable. For typical RHIC initial conditions
this happens for $\eta/s \gsim 0.3$.
