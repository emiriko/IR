We show that the leading coefficient of the Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomial
$P_{x,w}(q)$ known as $\mu(x,w)$ is always either 0 or 1 when $w$ is a Deodhar
element of a finite Weyl group. The Deodhar elements have previously been
characterized using pattern avoidance by Billey--Warrington (2001) and
Billey--Jones (2007). In type $A$, these elements are precisely the 321-hexagon
avoiding permutations. Using Deodhar's (1990) algorithm, we provide some
combinatorial criteria to determine when $\mu(x,w) = 1$ for such permutations
$w$.
