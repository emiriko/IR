Using cold bosonic atoms with two (hyperfine) ground states, we introduce a
spin-boson mixture which allows to implement the quantum Ising model in a
tunable dissipative environment. The first specie lies in a deep optical
lattice with tightly confining wells and forms a spin array; spin-up/down
corresponds to occupation by one/no atom at each site. The second specie forms
a superfluid reservoir. Different species are coupled coherently via laser
transitions and collisions. Whereas the laser coupling mimics a transverse
field for the spins, the coupling to the reservoir sound modes induces a
ferromagnetic (Ising) coupling as well as dissipation. This gives rise to an
order-disorder quantum phase transition where the effect of dissipation can be
studied in a controllable manner.
