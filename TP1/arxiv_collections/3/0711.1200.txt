In this paper, we complete the classification of the {\bf Z}-graded modules
of the intermediate series over the $q$-analog Virasoro-like algebra $L$. We
first construct four classes of irreducible {\bf Z}-graded $L$-modules of the
intermediate series. Then we prove that any {\bf Z}-graded $L$-modules of the
intermediate series must be the direct sum of some trivial $L$-modules or one
of the modules constructed by us.
