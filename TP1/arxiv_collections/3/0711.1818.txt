The Hartree-Fock exchange operator is an integral operator arising in the
Hartree-Fock method and replaced by a multiplicative operator (a local
potential) in Kohn-Sham density functional theory. This article presents a
detailed analysis of the mathematical properties of various local
approximations to the nonlocal Hartree-Fock exchange operator, including the
Slater potential, the optimized effective potential (OEP), the
Krieger-Li-Iafrate (KLI) and common energy-denominator approximations (CEDA) to
the OEP, and the effective local potential (ELP). In particular, we show that
the Slater, KLI, CEDA potentials and the ELP can all be defined as solutions to
certain variational problems. We also provide a rigorous derivation of the
integral OEP equation and establish the existence of a solution to a system of
coupled nonlinear partial differential equations defining the Slater
approximation to the Hartree-Fock equations.
