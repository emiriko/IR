This paper considers a developing theory on the effects of inevitable process
variations during the fabrication of MEMS and other microsystems. The effects
on the performance and design yield of the microsystems devices are analyzed
and presented. A novel methodology in the design cycle of MEMS and other
microsystems is briefly introduced. This paper describes the initial steps of
this methodology that is aimed at counteracting the parametric variations in
the product cycle of microsystems. It is based on a concept of worst-case
analysis that has proven successful in the parent IC technology. Issues ranging
from the level of abstraction of the microsystem models to the availability of
such models are addressed
