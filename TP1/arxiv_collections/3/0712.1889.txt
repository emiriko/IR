By using 2-photon 4-qubit cluster states we demonstrate deterministic one-way
quantum computation in single qubit rotation algorithm. In this operation
feed-forward measurements are automatically implemented by properly choosing
the measurement basis of the qubits, while Pauli error corrections are realized
by using two fast driven Pockels cells. We realized also a C-NOT gate for
equatorial qubits and a C-Phase gate for a generic target qubit. Our results
demonstrate that 2-photon cluster states can be used for rapid and efficient
deterministic one-way quantum computing.
