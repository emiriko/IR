The general analysis of the rare Bc->D^*_s l^+ l^- decay is presented by
using the most general, model independent effective Hamiltonian. The
dependencies of the branching ratios, longitudinal, normal and transversal
polarization asymmetries for l^- and the combined asymmetries for l^- and l^+
on the new Wilson coefficients are investigated. Our analysis shows that the
lepton polarization asymmetries are very sensitive to the scalar and tensor
type interactions, which will be very useful in looking for new physics beyond
the standard model.
