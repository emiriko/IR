Exact solutions of the Dirac--Pauli equation for massive neutrino with
anomalous magnetic moment interacting with dense matter and strong
electromagnetic field are found. The complete system of neutrino wavefunctions,
which show spin rotation properties are obtained and their possible
applications are discussed.
