We consider diffusively coupled map lattices with $P$ neighbors (where $P$ is
arbitrary) and study the stability of synchronized state. We show that there
exists a critical lattice size beyond which the synchronized state is unstable.
This generalizes earlier results for nearest neighbor coupling. We confirm the
analytical results by performing numerical simulations on coupled map lattices
with logistic map at each node. The above analysis is also extended to
2-dimensional $P$-neighbor diffusively coupled map lattices.
