We calculate light-cone distribution amplitudes for non-relativistic bound
states, including radiative corrections from relativistic gluon exchange to
first order in the strong coupling constant. Our results apply to hard
exclusive reactions with non-relativistic bound states in the QCD factorization
approach like, for instance, [B_c -> eta_c l nu] or [e+ e- -> J/psi eta_c].
They also serve as a toy model for light-cone distribution amplitudes of light
mesons or heavy B and D mesons.
