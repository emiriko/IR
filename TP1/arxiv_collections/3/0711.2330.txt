In general, when a black hole evaporates, there arises a net energy flow from
black hole into its outside environment due to Hawking radiation and energy
accretion onto black hole. The existence of energy flow means that the
thermodynamic state of the whole system, which consists of a black hole and its
environment, is in a nonequilibrium state. To know the detail of evaporation
process, the nonequilibrium effects of energy flow should be taken into
account. The nonequilibrium nature of black hole evaporation is a challenging
topic including issues of not only black hole physics but also nonequilibrium
physics. Using the nonequilibrium thermodynamics which has been formulated
recently, this report shows: (1) the self-gravitational effect of black hole
which appears as its negative heat capacity guarantees the validity of
generalized 2nd law without entropy production inside the outside environment,
(2) the nonequilibrium effect of energy flow tends to shorten the evaporation
time (life time) of black hole, and consequently specific nonequilibrium
phenomena are suggested. Finally a future direction of this study is commented.
