We have studied temperature dependences of electron transport in graphene and
its bilayer and found extremely low electron-phonon scattering rates that set
the fundamental limit on possible charge carrier mobilities at room
temperature. Our measurements have shown that mobilities significantly higher
than 200,000 cm2/Vs are achievable, if extrinsic disorder is eliminated. A
sharp (threshold-like) increase in resistivity observed above approximately
200K is unexpected but can qualitatively be understood within a model of a
rippled graphene sheet in which scattering occurs on intra-ripple flexural
phonons.
