The physical meaning of bare and dressed scattering matrix singularities has
been investigated. Special attention has been attributed to the role of well
known invariance of scattering matrix with respect to the field transformation
of the effective Lagrangian. Examples of evaluating bare and dressed quantities
in various models are given.
