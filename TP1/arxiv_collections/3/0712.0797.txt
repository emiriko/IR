I will discuss a new method for calculating transport quantities, such as the
charged particle stopping power, in a weakly to moderately coupled plasma. This
method, called dimensional continuation, lies within the framework of
convergent kinetic equations, and it is powerful enough to allow for systematic
perturbative expansions in the plasma coupling constant. In particular, it
provides an exact evaluation of the stopping power to leading and
next-to-leading order in the plasma coupling, with the systematic error being
of cubic order. Consequently, the calculation is near-exact for a weakly
coupled plasma, and quite accurate for a moderately coupled plasma. The leading
order term in this expansion has been known since the classic work of Spitzer.
In contrast, the next-to-leading order term has been calculated only recently
by Brown, Preston, and Singleton (BPS), using the aforementioned method, to
account for all short- and long-distance physics accurate to second order in
the plasma coupling, including an exact treatment of the quantum-to-classical
scattering transition. Preliminary numerical studies suggest that the BPS
stopping power increases the ignition threshold, thereby having potential
adverse implications for upcoming high energy density facilities. Since the key
ideas behind the BPS calculation are possibly unfamiliar to plasma physicists,
and the implications might be important, I will use this opportunity to explain
the method in a pedagogical fashion.
