Resonant X-ray scattering (RXS) is a spectroscopy where both the power of
site selective diffraction and the power of local absorption spectroscopy
regarding atomic species are combined. By virtue of the dependence on the core
level state energy and the three dimensional electronic structure of the
intermediate state, this technique is specially suited to study charge, orbital
or spin orderings and associated crystal distortions. In the case of charge
ordering, we exploit the fact that atoms with closely related site symmetries
but with small charge differences exhibit resonances at slightly different
energies. The sensitivity of this effect allows for quantitative estimations of
the charge disproportion. Opposite to fluorescence or absorption measurements,
the power of diffraction relies on the capability of detecting differences that
are smaller than the inverse lifetime of the core hole level. To account for
the uncertainty of the crystallographic structure and the fact that the charge
ordering must be disentangled from the associated atomic displacements, a
complete methodology is proposed and applied to the low temperature phase of
magnetite. Relative sensitivity on spin, toroidal and orbital ordering is also
shown and compared in different transition metal oxide compounds, like V2O3 and
GaFeO3.
