Comparing the respective structures of the correlators defining generalized
and transverse momentum dependent parton distributions, one finds possible
relations between these two objects. Although it looks like the relations found
do not hold in general, we show that they can be established at least in simple
spectator model calculations. In addition, we discuss these relations in the
context of generalized transverse momentum dependent parton distributions.
