It is a common belief that in any environment where life is possible, life
will be generated. Here it is suggested that the cause for a spontaneous
generation of complex systems is probability driven processes. Based on
equilibrium thermodynamics, it is argued that in low occupation number
statistical systems, the second law of thermodynamics yields an increase of
thermal entropy and a canonic energy distribution. However, in high occupation
number statistical systems, the same law for the same reasons yields an
increase of information and a Benford's law/power-law energy distribution. It
is therefore, plausible, that eventually the heat death is not necessarily the
end of the universe.
