We report on the electric field control of magnetic phase transition
temperatures in multiferroic Ni3V2O8 thin films. Using magnetization
measurements, we find that the phase transition temperature to the canted
antiferromagnetic state is suppressed by 0.2 K in an electric field of 30 MV/m,
as compared to the unbiased sample. Dielectric measurements show that the
transition temperature into the magnetic state associated with ferroelectric
order increases by 0.2 K when the sample is biased at 25 MV/m. This electric
field control of the magnetic transitions can be qualitatively understood using
a mean field model incorporating a tri-linear coupling between the magnetic
order parameters and spontaneous polarization.
