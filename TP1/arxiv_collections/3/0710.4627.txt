Dynamic equations for quantum fields far from equilibrium are derived by use
of functional renormalisation group techniques. The obtained equations are
non-perturbative and lead substantially beyond mean-field and quantum Boltzmann
type approximations. The approach is based on a regularised version of the
generating functional for correlation functions where times greater than a
chosen cutoff time are suppressed. As a central result, a time evolution
equation for the non-equilibrium effective action is derived, and the
time-evolution of the Green functions is computed within a vertex expansion. It
is shown that this agrees with the dynamics derived from the 1/N-expansion of
the two-particle irreducible effective action.
