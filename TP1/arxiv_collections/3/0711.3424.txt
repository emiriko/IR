We present a study of the trilinear gauge interactions in extensions of the
Standard Model (SM) with several anomalous extra U(1)'s, identified in various
constructions, from special vacua of string theory to large extra dimensions.
In these models an axion and generalized Chern-Simons interactions for
anomalies cancelation are present. We derive generalized Ward identities for
these vertices and discuss their structure in the Stuckelberg and
Higgs-Stuckelberg phases. We give their explicit expressions in all the
relevant cases, which can be used for phenomenological studies of these models
at the LHC.
