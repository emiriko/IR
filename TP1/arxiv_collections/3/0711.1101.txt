The magnetic configurations of bi-phase micro- and nanotubes consisting of a
ferromagnetic internal tube, an intermediate non-magnetic spacer, and an
external magnetic shell are investigated as a function of their geometry. Based
on a continuum approach we obtained analytical expressions for the energy which
lead us to obtain phase diagrams giving the relative stability of
characteristic internal magnetic configurations of the bi-phase tubes.
