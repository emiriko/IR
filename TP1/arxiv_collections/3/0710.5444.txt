We study radiation-matter interaction in a system of ultracold atoms trapped
in an optical lattice in a Mott insulator phase. We develop a fully general
quantum model, and we perform calculations for a one-dimensional geometry at
normal incidence. Both two- and three-level $\Lambda$ atomic configurations are
studied. The polariton dispersion and the reflectivity spectra are
characterized in the different regimes, for both semi-infinite and finite-size
geometries. We apply this model to propose a photon energy lifter experiment: a
device which is able to shift the carrier frequency of a slowly travelling
wavepacket without affecting the pulse shape nor its coherence.
