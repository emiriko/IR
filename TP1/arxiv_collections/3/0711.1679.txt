Measurements of production of the neutral and charged strange hadrons in ep
collisions with the ZEUS detector are presented. The data on differential cross
sections, baryon-to-meson ratios, baryon-antibaryon asymmetry and Bose-Einstein
correlations in deep inelastic scattering and photoproduction are summarized.
