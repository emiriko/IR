We present a quantitative study of most prominent incompressible quantum Hall
states in the partially filled first excited Landau level (LL1) which have been
recently studied experimentally by Choi et al. The pseudopotential describing
the electron - electron interaction in LL1 is harmonic at short range. It
produces a series of incompressible states which is different from its LL0
counterpart. The numerical data indicate that the most prominent states
$\nu={5/2}$, 7/3, and 8/3 are not produced by Laughlin correlated electrons,
but result from a tendency of electrons to form pairs or larger clusters which
eventually become Laughlin correlated. States with smaller gaps at filling
factors 14/5, 16/7, 11/5, 19/7 are Laughlin correlated electron or hole states
and fit Jain's sequence of filled $\rm{CF}^4$ levels.
