A unitarized nonrelativistic meson model which is successful for the
description of the heavy and light vector and pseudoscalar mesons yields, in
its extension to the scalar mesons but for the same model parameters, a
complete nonet below 1 GeV. In the unitarization scheme, real and virtual
meson-meson decay channels are coupled to the quark-antiquark confinement
channels. The flavor-dependent harmonic-oscillator confining potential itself
has bound states epsilon(1.3 GeV), S(1.5 GeV), delta(1.3 GeV), kappa(1.4 GeV),
similar to the results of other bound-state qqbar models. However, the full
coupled-channel equations show poles at epsilon(0.5 GeV), S(0.99 GeV),
delta(0.97 GeV), kappa(0.73 GeV). Not only can these pole positions be
calculated in our model, but also cross sections and phase shifts in the
meson-scattering channels, which are in reasonable agreement with the available
data for pion-pion, eta-pion and Kaon-pion in S-wave scattering.
