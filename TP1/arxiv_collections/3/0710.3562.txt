We study the threshold production of two pions induced by neutrinos in
nucleon targets. The contribution of nucleon, pion and contact terms are
calculated using a chiral Lagrangian. The contribution of the Roper resonance,
neglected in earlier studies, has also been taken into account. The numerical
results for the cross sections are presented and compared with the available
experimental data. It has been found that in the two pion channels with
$\pi^+\pi^-$ and $\pi^0\pi^0$ in the final state, the contribution of the
$N^*(1440)$ is quite important and could be used to determine the $N^*(1440)$
electroweak transition form factors if experimental data with better statistics
become available in the future.
