We report on tensor reduction of five point integrals needed for the
evaluation of loop-by-loop corrections to Bhabha scattering. As an example we
demonstrate the calculation of the rank two tensor integral with cancellation
of the spurious Gram determinant in the denominator. The reduction scheme is
worked out for arbitrary five point processes.
