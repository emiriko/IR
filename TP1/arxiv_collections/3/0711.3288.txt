This paper deals with a single-crystal-silicon (SCS) MEMS resonator with
improved temperature stability. While simulations have shown that the
temperature coefficient of resonant frequency can be down to 1 ppm/degrees C,
preliminary measurements on non-optimised structures gave evidence of a
temperature coefficient of 29 ppm/degrees C. Design, optimisation, experimental
results with post process simulation and prospective work are presented.
