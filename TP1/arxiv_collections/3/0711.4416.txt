We discuss the possibility that spacetime geometry may be an emergent
phenomenon. This idea has been motivated by the Analogue Gravity programme.
These are systems where the kinematics of small perturbations are dominated by
an effective gravitational field. In these models there is no obvious
connection between the "gravitational" field tensor and the Einstein equations,
as the emergent spacetime geometry arises as a consequence of linearising
around some classical field. After a brief introduction on this topic, we
present our recent contributions to the field.
