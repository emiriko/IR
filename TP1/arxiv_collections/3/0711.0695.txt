Combined analyses at the Large Hadron Collider and at the International
Linear Collider are important to unravel a difficult region of supersymmetry
that is characterized by scalar SUSY particles with masses around 2 TeV.
Precision measurements of masses, cross sections and forward-backward
asymmetries allow to determine the fundamental supersymmetric parameters even
if only a small part of the spectrum is accessible. Mass constraints for the
heavy particles can be derived.
