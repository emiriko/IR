Fractals are measurable metric sets with non-integer Hausdorff dimensions. If
electric and magnetic fields are defined on fractal and do not exist outside of
fractal in Euclidean space, then we can use the fractional generalization of
the integral Maxwell equations. The fractional integrals are considered as
approximations of integrals on fractals. We prove that fractal can be described
as a specific medium.
