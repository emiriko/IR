Data on temperature-dependent, anisotropic thermal expansion in pure and
doped RAgSb2 (R = Y, Sm, La) single crystals are presented. Using the Ehrenfest
relation and heat capacity measurements, uniaxial pressure derivatives for long
range magnetic ordering and charge density wave transition temperatures are
evaluated and compared with the results of the direct measurements under
hydrostatic pressure. In-plane and c-axis pressure have opposite effect on the
phase transitions in these materials, with in-plane effects being significantly
weaker. Quantum oscillations in magnetostriction were observed for the three
pure compounds, with the possible detection of new frequencies in SmAgSb2 and
LaAgSb2. The uniaxial (along the c-axis) pressure derivatives of the dominant
extreme orbits (beta) were evaluated for YAgSb2 and LaAgSb2.
