The dynamics of a one-dimensional, highly discrete, linear array of
alternating $0-$ and $\pi-$ Josephson junctions is studied numerically, under
constant bias current at zero magnetic field. The calculated current - voltage
characteristics exhibit half-integer and integer zero-field-like steps for even
and odd total number of junctions, respectively. Inspection of the
instantaneous phases reveals that, in the former case, single $\pi-$kink
excitations (discrete semi-fluxons) are supported, whose propagation in the
array gives rise to the $1/2-$step, while in the latter case, a pair of
$\pi-$kink -- $\pi-$antikink appears, whose propagation gives rise to the
$1-$step. When additional $2\pi-$kinks are inserted in the array, they are
subjected to fractionalization, transforming themselves into two closely spaced
$\pi-$kinks. As they propagate in the array along with the single $\pi-$kink or
the $\pi-$kink - $\pi-$antikink pair, they give rise to higher half-integer or
integer zero-field-like steps, respectively.
