Semiconductor microcavities offer a unique system to investigate the physics
of weakly interacting bosons. Their elementary excitations, polaritons--a
mixture of excitons and photons--behave, in the low density limit, as bosons
that can undergo a phase transition to a regime characterised by long range
coherence. Condensates of polaritons have been advocated as candidates for
superfluidity; and the formation of vortices as well as elementary excitations
with a linear dispersion are actively sought after. In this work, we have
created and set in motion a macroscopically degenerate state of polaritons and
let it collide with a variety of defects present in the sample. Our experiments
show striking manifestations of a coherent light-matter packet that displays
features of a superfluid, although one of a highly unusual character as it
involves an out-of-equilibrium dissipative system where it travels at
ultra-fast velocity of the order of 1% the speed of light. Our main results are
the observation of i) a linear polariton dispersion accompanied with
diffusion-less motion, ii) flow without resistance when crossing an obstacle,
iii) suppression of Rayleigh scattering and iv) splitting into two fluids when
the size of the obstacle is comparable with the size of the wavepacket. This
work opens the way to the investigation of new phenomenology of
out-of-equilibrium condensates.
