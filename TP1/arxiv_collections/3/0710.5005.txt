The general principles of Bayesian data analysis imply that models for survey
responses should be constructed conditional on all variables that affect the
probability of inclusion and nonresponse, which are also the variables used in
survey weighting and clustering. However, such models can quickly become very
complicated, with potentially thousands of poststratification cells. It is then
a challenge to develop general families of multilevel probability models that
yield reasonable Bayesian inferences. We discuss in the context of several
ongoing public health and social surveys. This work is currently open-ended,
and we conclude with thoughts on how research could proceed to solve these
problems.
