Inertial energy scavengers are self-contained devices which generate power
from ambient motion, by electrically damping the internal motion of a suspended
proof mass. There are significant challenges in converting the power generated
from such devices to useable form, particularly in micro-engineered variants.
This paper presents approaches to this power conversion requirement, with
emphasis on the cases of electromagnetic and electrostatic transduction.
