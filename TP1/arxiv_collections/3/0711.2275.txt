A brief discussion of the recent interest in light scalar mesons motivates
the study of a generalized linear sigma model. In an SU(3) flavor invariant
version of the model there is a prediction that the the lighter scalars have
sizeable "four quark" content. It is further predicted that one of the singlet
scalars should be exceptionally light. Due to the presence of scalar mesons,
the model gives "controlled" corrections to the current algebra formula for
threshold pion pion scattering. These corections act in the direction to
improve agreement with current experiments.
