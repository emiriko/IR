The fractal distribution of charged particles is considered. An example of
this distribution is the charged particles that are distributed over fractal.
The fractional integrals are used to describe fractal distribution. These
integrals are considered as approximations of integrals on fractals. Typical
turbulent media could be of a fractal structure and the corresponding equations
should be changed to include the fractal features of the media. The
magnetohydrodynamics equations for fractal media are derived from the
fractional generalization of integral Maxwell equations and integral
hydrodynamics (balance) equations. Possible equilibrium states for these
equations are considered.
