The phase variation with angle of hadronic amplitudes is studied with a view
to understanding the underlying physical quantities which control it and how
well it can be determined in free space. We find that unitarity forces a
moderately accurate determination of the phase in standard amplitude analyses
but that the nucleon-nucleon analyses done to date do not give the phase
variation needed to achieve a good representation of the data in multiple
scattering calculations. Models are examined which suggest its behavior near
forward angles is related to the radii of the real and absorptive parts of the
interaction. The dependence of this phase on model parameters is such that if
these radii are modified in the nuclear medium (in combination with the change
due to the shift in energy of the effective amplitude in the medium) then the
larger magnitudes of the phase needed to fit the data might be attainable, but
only for negative values of the phase variation parameter.
