We study the role of viscosity in the early stages of relativistic heavy ion
collisions. We investigate the role of viscosity on the chemical equilibration
of a parton gas. In the presence of viscosity the lifetime of the system is
increased. The temperature as well as the parton fugacities evolve more slowly
compared to the ideal fluid dynamics.
