The domain morphology of weakly disordered ferromagnets, quenched from the
high-temperature phase to the low-temperature phase, is studied using numerical
simulations. We find that the geometrical properties of the coarsening domain
structure, e.g., the distributions of hull enclosed areas and domain perimeter
lengths, are described by a scaling phenomenology in which the growing domain
scale R(t) is the only relevant parameter. Furthermore, the scaling functions
have forms identical to those of the corresponding pure system, extending the
'super-universality' property previously noted for the pair correlation
function.
