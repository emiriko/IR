Interval exchange maps are related to geodesic flows on translation surfaces;
they correspond to the first return maps of the vertical flow on a transverse
segment. The Rauzy-Veech induction on the space of interval exchange maps
provides a powerful tool to analyze the Teichmueller geodesic flow on the
moduli space of Abelian differentials. Several major results have been proved
using this renormalization.
  Danthony and Nogueira introduced in 1988 a natural generalization of interval
exchange transformations, namely the linear involutions. These maps are related
to general measured foliations on surfaces (orientable or not). In this paper
we are interested by such maps related to geodesic flow on (orientable) flat
surfaces with Z/2Z linear holonomy. We relate geometry and dynamics of such
maps to the combinatorics of generalized permutations. We study an analogue of
the Rauzy-Veech induction and give an efficient combinatorial characterization
of its attractors. We establish a natural bijection between the extended Rauzy
classes of generalized permutations and connected components of the strata of
meromorphic quadratic differentials with at most simple poles, which allows, in
particular, to classify the connected components of all exceptional strata.
