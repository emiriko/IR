We propose a scheme for calculation of linear optical response of
current-carrying molecular junctions for the case when electronic tunneling
through the junction is much faster than characteristic time of external laser
field. We discuss relationships between nonequilibrium Green function (NEGF)
and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) approaches, and derive
expressions for optical response and linear polarizability within NEGF-TDDFT
scheme. Corresponding results for isolated molecule, derived within TDDFT
approach previously, are reproduced when coupling to contacts is neglected.
