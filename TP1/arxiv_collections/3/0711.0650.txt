In this paper we study the role of surface plasmon modes in the Casimir
effect. First we write the Casimir energy as a sum over the modes of a real
cavity. We may identify two sorts of modes, two evanescent surface plasmon
modes and propagative modes. As one of the surface plasmon modes becomes
propagative for some choice of parameters we adopt an adiabatic mode definition
where we follow this mode into the propagative sector and count it together
with the surface plasmon contribution, calling this contribution "plasmonic".
The remaining modes are propagative cavity modes, which we call "photonic". The
Casimir energy contains two main contributions, one coming from the plasmonic,
the other from the photonic modes. Surprisingly we find that the plasmonic
contribution to the Casimir energy becomes repulsive for intermediate and large
mirror separations. Alternatively, we discuss the common surface plasmon
defintion, which includes only evanescent waves, where this effect is not
found. We show that, in contrast to an intuitive expectation, for both
definitions the Casimir energy is the sum of two very large contributions which
nearly cancel each other. The contribution of surface plasmons to the Casimir
energy plays a fundamental role not only at short but also at large distances.
