Based on Shoenberg assumption of magnetic flux density dependence of
diamagnetic moments which accounts for an instability of strongly correlated
electron gas at the conditions of dHvA effect and diamagnetic phase transition
(DPT) to non-uniform phase, we investigate the morphology of the Condon domains
(CD) in plate-like sample theoretically. At one period of dHvA oscillations the
intrinsic structure of inhomogeneous diamagnetic phase (IDP) is governed by the
first order phase transitions between different non-uniform phases similar to
the high-anisotropy magnetic systems of spin origin, and strongly affected by
temperature, magnetic field and impurity of the sample due to the electron
correlations. The phase diagrams of evolution of IDP with temperature and
small-scale magnetic field in every period of dHvA oscillations are calculated.
