Dynamical Symmetry breaking and meson masses are studied in the
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model at finite temperature and chemical potential
using the dimensional regularization. Since the model is not renormalizable in
four space-time dimensions, physical results and parameters depend on the
regularization method. Following the imaginary time formalism, we introduce the
temperature, $T$ and the chemical potential, $\mu$. The parameters in the model
are fixed by calculating the pion mass and decay constant in the dimensional
regularization at $T=\mu=0$.
