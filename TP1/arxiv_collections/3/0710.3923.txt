Fundamental particles, regarded as the constituents of quarks and leptons,
are described classicaly in the framework of the Weyl-Dirac version of Wesson's
Induced Matter Theory. There are neutral particles and particles having charge
Q=+/-(1/3e). The particles appear on the 4D brane, our universe, and are filled
with a substance induced by the 5D bulk. This substace is taken to have mass
density, charge density, pressure and is characterized by the prematter eq. of
state P+\rho=0. The interior is separated from the surrounding vacuum by a
boundary surface where the 4D metric tensor satisfies an a'la Schwarzschild
condition. Outside of the boundary holds the Schwarzschild, or the
Reissner-Nordstroem Metric, while the particles are characterized by mass,
radius, charge.
