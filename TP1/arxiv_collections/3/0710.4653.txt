Power dissipation during test is a major challenge in testing integrated
circuits. Dynamic power has been the dominant part of power dissipation in CMOS
circuits, however, in future technologies the static portion of power
dissipation will outreach the dynamic portion. This paper proposes an efficient
technique to reduce both dynamic and static power dissipation in scan
structures. Scan cell outputs which are not on the critical path(s) are
multiplexed to fixed values during scan mode. These constant values and primary
inputs are selected such that the transitions occurred on non-multiplexed scan
cells are suppressed and the leakage current during scan mode is decreased. A
method for finding these vectors is also proposed. Effectiveness of this
technique is proved by experiments performed on ISCAS89 benchmark circuits.
