Theory of electronic transport through a triangular triple quantum dot
subject to a perpendicular magnetic field is developed using a tight binding
model. We show that magnetic field allows to engineer degeneracies in the
triple quantum dot energy spectrum. The degeneracies lead to zero electronic
transmission and sharp dips in the current whenever a pair of degenerate states
lies between the chemical potential of the two leads. These dips can occur with
a periodicity of one flux quantum if only two levels contribute to the current
or with half flux quantum if the three levels of the triple dot contribute. The
effect of strong bias voltage and different lead-to-dot connections on
Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in the conductance is also discussed.
