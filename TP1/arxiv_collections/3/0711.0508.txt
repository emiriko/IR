Lattice chiral fermions are synonymous to the Ginsparg-Wilson relation.
Indeed, this relation is satisfied by the overlap, domain wall and perfect
action fermion kernel.
  In a recent work we have shown that it is possible to take a direct RG
approach for fermions in the presence of gauge fields. This is due to an
algebraically implicit blocking technique which yields a Schur-complementary
coarse Dirac operator. Using a Schur complement approximation which is stable
and regular, the scheme can be iterated to the fixed point.
  In this talk, we elaborate more on the direct RG approach and show how to get
highly improved chiral fermions on the coarse lattice with the gauge fields
remaining on the fine lattice. We give numerical examples in the case of
lattice QCD using QCDLAB {\tt http://phys.fshn.edu.al/qcdlab.html}
