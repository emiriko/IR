The onset of small-scale fluctuations around a steady convection pattern in a
rotating baroclinic annulus filled with air is investigated using Direct
Numerical Simulation. In previous laboratory experiments of baroclinic waves,
such fluctuations have been associated with a flow regime termed Structural
Vacillation which is regarded as the first step in the transition to
fully-developed geostrophic turbulence.
