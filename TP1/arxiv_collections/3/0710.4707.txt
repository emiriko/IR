In this paper, we present a methodology for customized communication
architecture synthesis that matches the communication requirements of the
target application. This is an important problem, particularly for
network-based implementations of complex applications. Our approach is based on
using frequently encountered generic communication primitives as an alphabet
capable of characterizing any given communication pattern. The proposed
algorithm searches through the entire design space for a solution that
minimizes the system total energy consumption, while satisfying the other
design constraints. Compared to the standard mesh architecture, the customized
architecture generated by the newly proposed approach shows about 36%
throughput increase and 51% reduction in the energy required to encrypt 128
bits of data with a standard encryption algorithm.
