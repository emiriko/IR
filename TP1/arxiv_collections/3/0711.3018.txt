We argue that, within a broad class of extensions of the Standard Model,
there is a tight corellation between the dynamics of the electroweak phase
transition and the cubic self-coupling of the Higgs boson: Models which exhibit
a strong first-order EWPT predict a large deviation of the Higgs self-coupling
from the Standard Model prediction, as long as no accidental cancellations
occur. Order-one deviations are typical. This shift would be observable at the
Large Hadron Collider if the proposed luminosity or energy upgrades are
realized, as well as at a future electron-positron collider such as the
proposed International Linear Collider. These measurements would provide a
laboratory test of the dynamics of the electroweak phase transition.
