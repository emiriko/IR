Recent results on QCD thermodynamics are presented. The nature of the T>0
transition is determined, which turns out to be an analytic cross-over. The
absolute scale for this transition is calculated. The temperature dependent
static potential is given. The results were obtained by using a Symanzik
improved gauge and stout-link improved fermionic action. In order to approach
the continuum limit four different sets of lattice spacings were used with
temporal extensions N_t=4, 6, 8 and 10 (they correspond to lattice spacings a
\sim 0.3, 0.2, 0.15 and 0.12 fm). A new technique is presented, which --in
contrast to earlier methods-- enables one to determine the equation of state at
very large temperatures.
