We provide an analysis of the parameter space of several supersymmetry
breaking scenarios such as the minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) model and the non
universal Higgs mass (NUHM) framework, as well as the Anomaly Mediated
Supersymmetry Breaking (AMSB) and the Gauge Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking
(GMSB) models, in the light of a novel observable in b -> s gamma transitions,
i.e. the isospin symmetry breaking in the exclusive B -> K* gamma decays. We
find that in many cases, this observable provides severe restrictions on the
allowed parameter space regions for the mentioned models. Moreover, we provide
a few examples of investigations of the physical masses of supersymmetric
particles and search for the excluded values. The constraints from the
branching ratio associated to b -> s gamma are also presented here for all the
examined parameter space regions. A comparison with B_s -> mu+ mu- branching
ratio has also been performed.
