We review recent results on global attractors of U(1)-invariant dispersive
Hamiltonian systems. We study several models based on the Klein-Gordon equation
and sketch the proof that in these models, under certain generic assumptions,
the weak global attractor is represented by the set of all solitary waves. In
general, the attractors may also contain multifrequency solitary waves; we give
examples of systems which contain such solutions.
