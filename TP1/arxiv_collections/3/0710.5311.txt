We discuss the scenario where the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric
particle and the long-lived next-to-lightest sparticle (NSP) is the neutralino
or the stau, the charged partner of the tau lepton. In this case staus form
bound states with several nuclei, affecting the cosmological abundances of Li6
and Li7 by enhancing nuclear rates that would otherwise be strongly suppressed.
We consider the effects of these enhanced rates on the final abundances
produced in Big-Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), including injections of both
electromagnetic and hadronic energy during and after BBN. We show that if the
stau lifetime is longer than 10^3-10^4 s, the abundances of Li6 and Li7 are far
in excess of those allowed by observations. For shorter lifetimes of order 1000
s, it appears that stau bound state effect could reduce the Li7 abundance from
standard BBN values while at the same time enhancing the Li6 abundance,
creating a region where both lithium abundances match their plateau values.
