We discuss quantum non-locality and contextuality using the notion of
transition sets. This approach provides a way to obtain a direct logical
contradiction with locality/non-contextuality in the EPRB gedanken experiment
as well as a clear graphical illustration of what violations of Bell
inequalities quantify. In particular, we show graphically how these violations
are related to measures of non-local transition sets. We also introduce a new
form of contextuality, {\em measurement ordering contextuality}, i.e. there
exists commuting operators $\hat{\mathcal{A}}$ and $\hat{\mathcal{B}}$ such
that the outcome for $\hat{\mathcal{A}}$ depends on whether we measured
$\hat{\mathcal{B}}$ before or after $\hat{\mathcal{A}}$. It is shown (excluding
retro-causal and/or conspiratorial theories) that any hidden variable theory
capable of reproducing the quantum statistics has to have this property. This
generalizes yet another feature of the hidden variable theory of deBroglie and
Bohm.
