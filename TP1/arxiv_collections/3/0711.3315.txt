In this paper, CFD approach is used to simulate the thermal behavior in a
sensitive high-Q gyroscope. The electromagnetically driving wires, in which AC
current flows, are treated as Joule heat sources in the model. We found that
the differences of temperature, pressure and velocity along the driving
direction and transversely across the proof masses increased as the gap height
between the proof mass and top glass became smaller. Local pressure gradient is
expected to possibly enhance the impact of any imperfect led by MEMS processes
or designs on the offset of our tuning fork type gyroscope, which has been
experimentally verified. A device with 200um gap gives a two-third offset down
compared with that of its counterpart with 50um gap.
