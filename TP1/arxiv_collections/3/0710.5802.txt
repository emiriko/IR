We study leptogenesis in supersymmetric SO(10) models with a left-right
symmetric seesaw mechanism, including flavour effects and the contribution of
the next-to-lightest right-handed neutrino. Assuming M_D = M_u and hierarchical
light neutrino masses, we find that successful leptogenesis is possible for 4
out of the 8 right-handed neutrino mass spectra that are compatible with the
observed neutrino data. An accurate description of charged fermion masses
appears to be an important ingredient in the analysis.
