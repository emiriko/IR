The relativistic Faddeev equation for three-nucleon scattering is formulated
in momentum space and directly solved in terms of momentum vectors without
employing a partial wave decomposition. Relativistic invariance is achieved by
constructing a dynamical unitary representation of the Poincar\'e group on the
three-nucleon Hilbert space. The exclusive breakup reaction at 508 MeV is
calculated based on a Malfliet-Tjon type of two-body interaction and the cross
sections are compared to measured cross sections at this energy. We find that
the magnitude of the relativistic effects can be quite large and depends on the
configurations considered. In spite of the simple nature of the model
interaction, the experimental cross sections are in surprisingly good agreement
with the predictions of the relativistic calculations. We also find that
although for specific configurations the multiple scattering series converges
rapidly, this is in general not the case.
