In a recent manuscript (arXiv:0710.4917v2), Jones-Smith et al. attempt to use
the well-established box-counting technique for fractal analysis to
"demonstrate conclusively that fractal criteria are not useful for
authentication". Here, in response to what we view to be an extremely
simplistic misrepresentation of our earlier work by Jones-Smith et al., we
reiterate our position regarding the potential of fractal analysis for artwork
authentication. We also point out some of the flaws in the analysis presented
in by Jones-Smith et al.
