We conjecture an integrability and linearizability test for dispersive
Z^2-lattice equations by using a discrete multiscale analysis. The lowest order
secularity conditions from the multiscale expansion give a partial differential
equation of the form of the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation. If the
starting lattice equation is integrable then the resulting NLS equation turns
out to be integrable, while if the starting equation is linearizable we get a
linear Schrodinger equation. On the other hand, if we start with a
non-integrable lattice equation we may obtain a non-integrable NLS equation.
This conjecture is confirmed by many examples.
