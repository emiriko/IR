We consider the possible effects of gravitational lensing by globular
clusters on gravitational waves from asymmetric neutron stars in our galaxy. In
the lensing of gravitational waves, the long wavelength, compared with the
usual case of optical lensing, can lead to the geometrical optics approximation
being invalid, in which case a wave optical solution is necessary. In general,
wave optical solutions can only be obtained numerically. We describe a
computational method that is particularly well suited to numerical wave optics.
This method enables us to compare the properties of several lens models for
globular clusters without ever calling upon the geometrical optics
approximation, though that approximation would sometimes have been valid.
Finally, we estimate the probability that lensing by a globular cluster will
significantly affect the detection, by ground-based laser interferometer
detectors such as LIGO, of gravitational waves from an asymmetric neutron star
in our galaxy, finding that the probability is insignificantly small.
