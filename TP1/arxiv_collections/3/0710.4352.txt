The act of measuring optical emissions from two remote qubits can entangle
them. By demanding that a photon from each qubit reaches the detectors, one can
ensure than no photon was lost. But the failure rate then rises quadratically
with loss probability. In [1] this resulted in 30 successes per billion
attempts. We describe a means to exploit the low grade entanglement heralded by
the detection of a lone photon: A subsequent perfect operation is quickly
achieved by consuming this noisy resource. We require only two qubits per node,
and can tolerate both path length variation and loss asymmetry. The impact of
photon loss upon the failure rate is then linear; realistic high-loss devices
can gain orders of magnitude in performance and thus support QIP.
