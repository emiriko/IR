We briefly report our calculation of the 2-loop coefficient of the coupling
constant renormalization function Z_g in lattice perturbation theory. The
quantity under study is defined through g_0 = Z_g g, where g_0 (g) is the bare
(renormalized) coupling constant. The 2-loop expression for Z_g can be directly
related to the 3-loop bare beta-function beta_L(g_0).
  Our calculation is performed using overlap fermions and Wilson gluons, and
the background field technique has been chosen for convenience. Our results
depend explicitly on the number of fermion flavors (N_f) and colors (N). Since
the dependence of Z_g on the overlap parameter rho cannot be extracted
analytically, we tabulate our results for different values of rho in the
allowed range (0<rho<2), focusing on values which are being used most
frequently in simulations. Plots of the 1- and 2-loop results for Z_g versus
rho exhibit a nontrivial dependence on the overlap parameter.
