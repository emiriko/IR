We present a method for optimizing quantum circuits architecture. The method
is based on the notion of "quantum comb", which describes a circuit board in
which one can insert variable subcircuits. The method allows one to efficiently
address novel kinds of quantum information processing tasks, such as
storing-retrieving, and cloning of channels.
