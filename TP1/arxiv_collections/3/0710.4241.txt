We propose new types of density dependent contact pairing interaction which
reproduce the pairing gaps in symmetric and neutron matter obtained by a
microscopic treatment based on the nucleon-nucleon interaction. These
interactions are able to simulate the pairing gaps of either the bare
interaction or the interaction screened by the medium polarization effects. It
is shown that the medium polarization effects cannot be cast into the density
power law function usually introduced together with the contact interaction and
require the introduction of another isoscalar term. The BCS-BEC crossover of
neutrons pairs in symmetric and symmetric nuclear matter is studied by using
these contact interactions. It is shown that the bare and screened pairing
interactions lead to different features of the BCS-BEC crossover in symmetric
nuclear matter. For the screened pairing interaction, a two-neutron BEC state
is formed in symmetric matter at $k_{Fn}\sim 0.2$ fm$^{-1}$ (neutron density
$\rho_n/\rho_0\sim 10^{-3}$). Contrary the bare interaction does not form the
BEC state at any neutron density.
