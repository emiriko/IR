In this paper we present our contribution in terms of synchronization
processor for a SoC design methodology based on the theory of the latency
insensitive systems (LIS) of Carloni et al. Our contribution consists in IP
encapsulation into a new wrapper model which speed and area are optimized and
synthetizability guarantied. The main benefit of our approach is to preserve
the local IP performances when encapsulating them and reduce SoC silicon area.
