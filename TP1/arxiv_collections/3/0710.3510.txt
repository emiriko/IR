The quantum theory (QT) and new stochastic approaches have no deterministic
prediction for a single measurement or for a single time -series of events
observed for a trapped ion, electron or any other individual physical system.
The predictions of QT being of probabilistic character apply to the statistical
distribution of the results obtained in various experiments. The probability
distribution is not an attribute of a dice but it is a characteristic of a
whole random experiment : '' rolling a dice''. and statistical long range
correlations between two random variables X and Y are not a proof of any causal
relation between these variable. Moreover any probabilistic model used to
describe a random experiment is consistent only with a specific protocol
telling how the random experiment has to be performed.In this sense the quantum
theory is a statistical and contextual theory of phenomena. In this paper we
discuss these important topics in some detail. Besides we discuss in historical
perspective various prerequisites used in the proofs of Bell and CHSH
inequalities concluding that the violation of these inequalities in spin
polarization correlation experiments is neither a proof of the completeness of
QT nor of its nonlocality. The question whether QT is predictably complete is
still open and it should be answered by a careful and unconventional analysis
of the experimental data. It is sufficient to analyze more in detail the
existing experimental data by using various non-parametric purity tests and
other specific statistical tools invented to study the fine structure of the
time-series. The correct understanding of statistical and contextual character
of QT has far reaching consequences for the quantum information and quantum
computing.
