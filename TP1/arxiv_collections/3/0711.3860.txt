We exploit the Kallen-Lehman representation of the two-point Green function
to prove that the gluon propagator cannot go to zero in the infrared limit. We
are able to derive also the functional form of it. This means that current
results on the lattice can be used to derive the scalar glueball spectrum to be
compared both with experiments and different aimed lattice computations.
