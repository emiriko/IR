We consider a class of rotationally invariant unitary random matrix ensembles
where the eigenvalue density falls off as an inverse power law. Under a new
scaling appropriate for such power law densities (different from the scaling
required in Gaussian random matrix ensembles), we calculate exactly the
two-level kernel that determines all eigenvalue correlations. We show that such
ensembles belong to the class of critical ensembles.
