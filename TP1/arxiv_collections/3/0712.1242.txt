Momentum-transfer (q) dependent non-resonant inelastic x-ray scattering
measurements were made at the N4,5 edges for several rare earth compounds. With
increasing q, giant dipole resonances diminish, to be replaced by strong
multiplet lines at lower energy transfer. These multiplets result from two
different orders of multipole scattering and are distinct for systems with
simple 4f^0 and 4f^1 initial states. A many-body theoretical treatment of the
multiplets agrees well with the experimental data on ionic La and Ce phosphate
reference compounds. Comparing measurements on CeO2 and CeRh3 to the theory and
the phosphates indicates sensitivity to hybridization as observed by a
broadening of 4f^0-related multiplet features. We expect such strong, nondipole
features to be generic for NIXS from f-electron systems.
