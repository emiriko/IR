We study the M\"{o}ller and Bhabha scattering in the noncommutative extension
of the standard model(SM) using the Seiberg-Witten maps of this to first order
of the noncommutative parameter $\theta_{\mu \nu}$. We look at the angular
distribution $d\sigma/d\Omega$ to explore the noncommutativity of space-time at
around $\Lambda_{NC} \sim$ TeV and find that the distribution deviates
significantly from the one obtained from the commutative version of the
standard model.
