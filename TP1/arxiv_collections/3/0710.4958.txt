Folding and aggregation of proteins, the interaction between proteins and
membranes, as well as the adsorption of organic soft matter to inorganic solid
substrates belong to the most interesting challenges in understanding structure
and function of complex macromolecules. This is reasoned by the
interdisciplinary character of the associated questions ranging from the
molecular origin of the loss of biological functionality as, for example, in
Alzheimer's disease to the development of organic circuits for biosensory
applications. In this lecture, we focus on the analysis of mesoscopic models
for protein folding, aggregation, and hybrid systems of soft and solid
condensed matter. The simplicity of the coarse-grained models allows for a more
universal description of the notoriously difficult problem of protein folding.
In this approach, classifications of structure formation processes with respect
to the conformational pseudophases are possible. This is similar in aggregation
and adsorption processes, where the individual folding propensity is influenced
by external forces. The main problem in studies of conformational transitions
is that the sequences of amino acids proteins are built up of are necessarily
of finite length and, therefore, a thermodynamic limit does not exist. Thus,
structural transitions are not phase transitions in the strict thermodynamic
sense and the analysis of pseudouniversal aspects is intricate, as apparently
small-system effects accompany all conformational transitions and cannot be
neglected.
