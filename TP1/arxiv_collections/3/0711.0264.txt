Using Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) in a Cesium vapor, we
demonstrate experimentally that the quantum state of a light beam can be mapped
into the long lived Zeeman coherences of an atomic ground state. Two
non-commuting variables carried by light are simultaneously stored and
subsequentely read-out, with no noise added. We compare the case where a
tunable single sideband is stored independently of the other one to the case
where the two symmetrical sidebands are stored using the same EIT transparency
window.
