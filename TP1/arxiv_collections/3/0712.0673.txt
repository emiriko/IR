In their textbook, Suzuki and Varga [Y. Suzuki and K. Varga, {\em Stochastic
Variational Approach to Quantum-Mechanical Few-Body Problems} (Springer,
Berlin, 1998)] present the stochastic variational method with the correlated
Gaussian basis in a very exhaustive way. The matrix elements for central
potentials are put under a pleasant form but the elements for spin dependent
operators, when treated, are given as very cumbersome expressions. In this
paper, we find a lot of new formulae for those elements. Their expressions are
given in terms of the same geometrical functions that appear in the case of
central potentials. These functions get therefore a universal status; this
property is very useful for numerical applications.
