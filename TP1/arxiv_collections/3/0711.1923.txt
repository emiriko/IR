We present non-local dynamics of Bell states in separate cavities. It is
demonstrated that (i) the entanglement damping speed will saturate when the
cavity leakage rate $\gamma\geq 0.4$; (ii) the synchronism relationship between
the fidelity and the concurrence depends on the initial state; (iii) if the
initial state is $1/\sqrt{2}(|01>+|10>)$, the dynamics of entropy is opposite
to that of fidelity.
