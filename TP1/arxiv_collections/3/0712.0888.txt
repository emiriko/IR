We show that a number of problems of modern cosmology may be addressed and
solved in the framework of multidimensional gravity with high-order curvature
invariants, without invoking other fields. As applications of this approach, we
mention primordial inflation and particle production after it; description of
the modern accelerated stage of the Universe with stable compact extra
dimensions; construction of asymmetric thick brane-world models.
