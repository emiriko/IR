A "$\Lambda$ selection rule" for $N^*$ resonances in the presence of QCD
mixing effects is identified. Due to the QCD mixing, excitations of {\bf
20}-plets are possible in SU(6). We show that this selection rule is useful for
classifying PDG states at N=2, and for clarifying whether strongly correlated
diquarks survive for $L > 0$.
