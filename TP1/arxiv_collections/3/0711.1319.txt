We supplement the study of Galois theory for algebraic quantum groups started
in the paper 'Galois Theory for Multiplier Hopf Algebras with Integrals' by A.
Van Daele and Y.H. Zhang. We examine the structure of the Galois objects:
algebras equipped with a Galois coaction such that only the scalars are
coinvariants. We show how their structure is as rich as the one of the quantum
groups themselves: there are two distinguished weak K.M.S. functionals, related
by a modular element, and there is an analogue of the antipode squared. We also
show how to reflect the quantum group across the Galois object to obtain a
(possibly) new algebraic quantum group. We end by considering an example.
