We have used the analogy between gravitational systems and non-homogeneous
fluid flows to calculate the density-density correlation function of an atomic
Bose-Einstein condensate in the presence of an acoustic black hole. The
emission of correlated pairs of phonons by Hawking-like process results into a
peculiar long-range density correlation. Quantitative estimations of the effect
are provided for realistic experimental configurations.
