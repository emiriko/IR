Using the recursive Green's function method, we study the problem of electron
transport in a disordered single-layer graphene sheet. The conductivity is of
order $e^2/h$ and its dependence on the carrier density has a scaling form that
is controlled solely by the disorder strength and the ratio between the sample
size and the correlation length of the disorder potential. The shot noise Fano
factor is shown to have a narrow dip near the neutrality point for weak
disorder and to develop a nearly doping independent behavior at strong
disorder. Our results are in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with
experiments and provide a way for extracting microscopic information about the
magnitude of extrinsic disorder in graphene.
