Fix a number field k. We prove that k* - k*^2 is diophantine over k. This is
deduced from a theorem that for a nonconstant separable polynomial P(x) in
k[x], there are at most finitely many a in k* modulo squares such that there is
a Brauer-Manin obstruction to the Hasse principle for the conic bundle X given
by y^2 - az^2 = P(x).
