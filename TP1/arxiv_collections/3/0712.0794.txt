We report the realization of a new iterative Fourier-transform algorithm for
creating holograms that can diffract light into an arbitrary two-dimensional
intensity profile. We show that the predicted intensity distributions are
smooth with a fractional error from the target distribution at the percent
level. We demonstrate that this new algorithm outperforms the most frequently
used alternatives typically by one and two orders of magnitude in accuracy and
roughness, respectively. The techniques described in this paper outline a path
to creating arbitrary holographic atom traps in which the only remaining hurdle
is physical implementation.
