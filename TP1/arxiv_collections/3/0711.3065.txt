Recent theoretical developments in the studies of two-photon exchange effects
in elastic electron-proton scattering are reviewed. Two-photon exchange
mechanism is considered a likely source of discrepancy between polarized and
unpolarized experimental measurements of the proton electric form factor at
momentum transfers of several GeV$^2$. This mechanism predicts measurable
effects that are currently studied experimentally.
