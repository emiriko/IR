This talk gives a brief introduction to black hole horizons and their role in
black hole thermodynamics. In particular a distinction is made between
quasi-locally defined horizons and event horizons. Currently some new
techniques have led to interesting developments and the field seems to be
growing in two distinct directions. We will show how thermodynamics can equally
well be applied to locally defined horizons and discuss some recent results.
The emphasis is on giving simple intuitive pictures and mathematical details
are largely omitted.
