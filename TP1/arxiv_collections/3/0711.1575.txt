This remodeled form of Einstein's relativity theories retains and
incorporates only experimentally proven principles. It is based on a
generalized law for spinning and rotational motions, which is in fact the
conservation law of momentum vector direction, and can be successfully used for
the precision computation of planetary and lunar orbits. The most fundamental
principles of the remodeled relativity theory are the conservation laws of
energy and momentum. Based on experience of relativity experiments, we adopted
the principles that energy level is the underlying cause for relativistic
effects, and that mass is expressed by the relativistic energy equation from
Einstein. From space age ephemeris generation experience and following nature's
way to conserve energy and momentum, we found reason to replace the concept of
"relativity of all frames" with that of "nature's preferred frame", which
helped us to escape Einstein's dilemma till 1912, when he concluded that 'there
is no way of escape from the consequence of non-Euclidean geometry, if all
frames are permissible'. Einstein formulated gtr as a law for all frames, but
physicists and astronomers have continued to adopt one or other 'ad-hoc'
approach not in full conformity with the basic tenets of gtr/str. Based on
above principles, a comprehensive remodeling led to this theory that uses
Euclidean space to consistently and successfully simulate numerically the
results of all the "well-established" tests of gtr (as in our earlier papers),
and for the precise calculation of relativistic effects observed in case of the
GPS applications, and other tests of str. It combined the essential essence of
gtr/str, and the experience of relativity experiments, and has been shown to
avoid the inadequacies of the former.
