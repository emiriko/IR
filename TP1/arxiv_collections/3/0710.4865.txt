We study the static correlation functions of the Richardson pairing model
(also known as the reduced or discrete-state BCS model) in the canonical
ensemble. Making use of the Algebraic Bethe Ansatz formalism, we obtain exact
expressions which are easily evaluated numerically for any value of the pairing
strength up to large numbers of particles. We provide explicit results at
half-filling and extensively discuss their finite-size scaling behavior.
