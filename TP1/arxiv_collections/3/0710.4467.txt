Nuclear effects in the quasielastic and inelastic scattering of
neutrinos(antineutrinos) from nuclear targets have been studied. The
calculations are done in the local density approximation which take into
account the effect of nucleon motion as well as renormalisation of weak
transition strengths in the nuclear medium. The inelastic reaction leading to
production of pions is calculated in a $\Delta$ dominance model taking into
account the renormalization of $\Delta$ properties in the nuclear medium.
