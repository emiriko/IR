Scattering of 2 particles of spin 0 and 1/2 is evaluated based on a basis
constructed from the momentum and the helicity states (the momentum-helicity
basis). This shortly called three-dimensional (3D) technique is a good
alternative to the standard partial wave (PW) technique especially for higher
energies, where PW calculations may become not feasible. Taking as input a
simple spin-orbit potential model we calculate as an example the spin averaged
differential cross section and polarization.
