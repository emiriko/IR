A generalization of matrix product states (MPS) is introduced which is
suitable for describing interacting quantum systems in two and three
dimensions. These scale-renormalized matrix-product states (SR-MPS) are based
on a course-graining of the lattice in which the blocks at each level are
associated with matrix products that are further transformed (scale
renormalized) with other matrices before they are assembled to form blocks at
the next level. Using variational Monte Carlo simulations of the
two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model as a test, it is shown that the
SR-MPS converge much more rapidly with the matrix size than a standard MPS. It
is also shown that the use of lattice-symmetries speeds up the convergence very
significantly.
