We introduce and study the notion of plurisubharmonic functions in calibrated
geometry. These functions generalize the classical plurisubharmonic functions
from complex geometry and enjoy their important properties. Moreover, they
exist in abundance whereas the corresponding pluriharmonics are generally quite
scarce. A number of the results established in complex analysis via
plurisubharmonic functions are extended to calibrated manifolds. In particular,
the notion of pseudo-convexity for a calibrated manifold (X,\phi) is introduced
and studied. Analogues of totally real submanifolds are also introduced and
used to construct enormous families of strictly \phi-convex spaces with every
topological type allowed by Morse Theory. Specific calibrations are used as
examples throughout.
