AdS/QCD correspondence predicts the structure of quark-antiquark potential in
the static limit. We use this piece of information together with the Salpeter
equation (Schr\"odinger equation with relativistic kinematics) and a short
range hyperfine splitting potential to determine quark masses and the quark
potential parameters from the meson spectrum. The agreement between theory and
experimental data is satisfactory provided one considers only mesons comprising
at least one heavy quark. We use the same potential (in the one-gluon-exchange
approximation) and these data to estimate constituent diquark masses. Using
these results as an input we compute tetraquark masses using a
diquark-antidiquark model. The masses of the states X(3872) or Y(3940) are
predicted rather accurately. We also compute tetraquark masses with open charm
and strangeness. Our result is that tetraquark candidates such as D_s(2317),
D_s(2457) or X(2632) can hardly be interpreted as diquark-antidiquark states
within the present approach.
