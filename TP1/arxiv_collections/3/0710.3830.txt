In order to study the mechanism of the mass enhancement in heavy fermion
compounds in the presence of magnetic field, we study the periodic Anderson
model using the fluctuation exchange approximation. The resulting value of the
mass enhancement factor z^{-1} can become up to 10, which is significantly
larger than that in the single-band Hubbard model. We show that the difference
between the magnitude of the mass enhancement factor of up spin (minority spin)
electrons z^{-1}_up and that of down spin (majority spin) electrons z^{-1}_down
increases by the applied magnetic field B//z, which is consistent with de
Haas-van Alphen measurements for CeCoIn_5, CeRu_2Si_2 and CePd_2Si_2. We
predict that z^{-1}_up >z^{-1}_down in many Ce compounds, whereas z^{-1}_up <
z^{-1}_down in Yb compounds.
