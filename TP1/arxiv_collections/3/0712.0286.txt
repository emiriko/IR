We develop the Ginzburg - Landau theory of the upper critical field in the
basal plane of a tetragonal multiband metal in two-component superconducting
state. It is shown that typical for the two component superconducting state the
upper critical field basal plane anisotropy and the phase transition splitting
still exist in a multiband case. However, the value of anisotropy can be
effectively smaller than in the single band case. The results are discussed in
the application to the superconducting Sr2RuO4.
