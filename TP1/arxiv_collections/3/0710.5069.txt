The role of local fields in the optical response of silicon nanocrystals is
analyzed using a tight binding approach. Our calculations show that, at
variance with bulk silicon, local field effects dramatically modify the silicon
nanocrystal optical response. An explanation is given in terms of surface
electronic polarization and confirmed by the fair agreement between the tight
binding results and that of a classical dielectric model. From such a
comparison, it emerges that the classical model works not only for large but
also for very small nanocrystals. Moreover, the dependence on size of the
optical response is discussed, in particular treating the limit of large size
nanocrystals.
