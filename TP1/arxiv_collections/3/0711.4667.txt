We report on a new type of magnetic lens that focuses atomic clouds using a
static inhomogeneous magnetic field in combination with a radio-frequency
field. The experimental study is performed with a cloud of cold cesium atoms.
The rf field adiabatically deforms the magnetic potential of a coil and
therefore changes its focusing properties. The focal length can be tuned
precisely by changing the rf frequency value. Depending on the rf antenna
position relative to the DC magnetic profile, the focal length of the atomic
lens can be either decreased or increased by the rf field.
