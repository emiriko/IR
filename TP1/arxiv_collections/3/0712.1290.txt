We present a new method for extracting numerically exact imaginary-time Green
functions from standard Hirsch-Fye quantum Monte Carlo (HF-QMC) simulations
within dynamical mean-field theory. By analytic continuation, angular resolved
spectra are obtained without the discretization bias previously associated with
HF-QMC results. The method is shown to be accurate even at very low
temperatures (T=W/800 for bandwidth W) in the strongly correlated regime.
