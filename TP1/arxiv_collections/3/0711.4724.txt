Background : The carnivorous plants of the genus Nepenthes, widely
distributed in the Asian tropics, rely mostly on nutrients derived from
arthropods trapped in their pitcher-shaped leaves and digested by their
enzymatic fluid. The genus exhibits a great diversity of prey and pitcher forms
and its mechanism of trapping has long intrigued scientists. The slippery inner
surfaces of the pitchers, which can be waxy or highly wettable, have so far
been considered as the key trapping devices. However, the occurrence of species
lacking such epidermal specializations but still effective at trapping insects
suggests the possible implication of other mechanisms. Methodology/Principal
Findings : Using a combination of insect bioassays, high-speed video and
rheological measurements, we show that the digestive fluid of Nepenthes
rafflesiana is highly viscoelastic and that this physical property is crucial
for the retention of insects in its traps. Trapping efficiency is shown to
remain strong even when the fluid is highly diluted by water, as long as the
elastic relaxation time of the fluid is higher than the typical time scale of
insect movements. Conclusions/Significance : This finding challenges the common
classification of Nepenthes pitchers as simple passive traps and is of great
adaptive significance for these tropical plants, which are often submitted to
high rainfalls and variations in fluid concentration. The viscoelastic trap
constitutes a cryptic but potentially widespread adaptation of Nepenthes
species and could be a homologous trait shared through common ancestry with the
sundew (Drosera) flypaper plants. Such large production of a highly
viscoelastic biopolymer fluid in permanent pools is nevertheless unique in the
plant kingdom and suggests novel applications for pest control.
