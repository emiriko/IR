We justify the validity of the discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation for
the tight-binding approximation in the context of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation
with a periodic potential. Our construction of the periodic potential and the
associated Wannier functions is based on the previous work, while our analysis
involving energy estimates and Gronwall's inequality addresses time-dependent
localized solutions on large but finite time intervals.
