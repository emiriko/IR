We investigate a certain distributional extension of the group of spatial
diffeomorphisms in Loop Quantum Gravity. This extension, which is given by the
automorphisms Aut(P) of the path groupoid P, was proposed by Velhinho and is
inspired by category theory. This group is much larger than the group of
piecewise analytic diffeomorphisms. In particular, we will show that graphs
with the same combinatorics but different generalized knotting classes can be
mapped into each other. We describe the automorphism-invariant Hilbert space
and comment on how a combinatorial formulation of LQG might arise.
