Intrinsic localized modes (ILMs), also called discrete breathers, are
directly generated via modulational instability in an array of coupled
pendulums. These ILMs can be stabilized over a range of driver frequencies and
amplitudes. They are characterized by a pi-phase difference between their
center and wings. At higher driver frequencies, these ILMs are observed to
disintegrate via a pulsating instability, and the mechanism of this breather
instability is investigated.
