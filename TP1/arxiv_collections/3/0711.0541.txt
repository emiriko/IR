The Caspar-Klug classification of viruses whose protein shell, called viral
capsid, exhibits icosahedral symmetry, has recently been extended to
incorporate viruses whose capsid proteins are exclusively organised in
pentamers. The approach, named `Viral Tiling Theory', is inspired by the theory
of quasicrystals, where aperiodic Penrose tilings enjoy 5-fold and 10-fold
local symmetries. This paper analyzes the extent to which this classification
approach informs dynamical properties of the viral capsids, in particular the
pattern of Raman active modes of vibrations, which can be observed
experimentally.
