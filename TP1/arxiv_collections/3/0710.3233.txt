The studies of hyperon production performed at COSY-11 are summarized. The
results of the experiments in the reaction channels pp-->pK+Lambda,
pp-->pK+Sigma0, and pp-->nK+Sigma+ are shown. Excitation functions
fromthreshold up to about 90MeV excess energies have been evaluated with high
precision for the Lambda and Sigma0 production. The Lambdap and Sigma0p final
state interactions were extracted. The Sigma+ production was measured at 13 and
60 MeV excess energies.
