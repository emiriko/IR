This paper surveys the characteristics of multimedia systems. Multimedia
applications today are dominated by compression and decompression, but
multimedia devices must also implement many other functions such as security
and file management. We introduce some basic concepts of multimedia algorithms
and the larger set of functions that multimedia systems-on-chips must
implement.
