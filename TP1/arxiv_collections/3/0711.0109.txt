The simple genetic algorithm is proposed for the simulation of quantum many
body dynamics. It uses the selection of entangled quantum states and has the
inbuilt absolute decoherence that comes from the limitation of classical
memory. It utilizes the "pre-quantum field" in the form of interacting between
the different "quantum worlds". It is shown how this selection model can be
applied to the problem of molecular association in chemical reactions.
