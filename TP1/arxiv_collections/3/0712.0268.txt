Exact solutions of Schrodinger equation are obtained for the modified Kratzer
and the corrected Morse potentials with the position-dependent effective mass.
The bound state energy eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions are
calculated for any angular momentum for target potentials. Various forms of
point canonical transformations are applied. PACS numbers: 03.65.-w; 03.65.Ge;
