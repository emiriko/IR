This paper describes JANUS, a modular massively parallel and reconfigurable
FPGA-based computing system. Each JANUS module has a computational core and a
host. The computational core is a 4x4 array of FPGA-based processing elements
with nearest-neighbor data links. Processors are also directly connected to an
I/O node attached to the JANUS host, a conventional PC. JANUS is tailored for,
but not limited to, the requirements of a class of hard scientific applications
characterized by regular code structure, unconventional data manipulation
instructions and not too large data-base size. We discuss the architecture of
this configurable machine, and focus on its use on Monte Carlo simulations of
statistical mechanics. On this class of application JANUS achieves impressive
performances: in some cases one JANUS processing element outperfoms high-end
PCs by a factor ~ 1000. We also discuss the role of JANUS on other classes of
scientific applications.
