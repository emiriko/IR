The difference between Z(4430) as a $D^{*}D_1$ molecule and a tetraquark
state and how to distinguish between them are discussed. We construct an
effective Lagrangian with $D^{*}D_1$ contact interactions constrained by the
heavy quark symmetry and chiral symmetry to study Z(4430). We find that if
Z(4430) is a $D^{*}D_1$ molecule state, there should be a $B^{*}B_1$ bound
state as well, and it mass is about 11048.6 MeV.
