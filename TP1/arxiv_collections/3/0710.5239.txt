Generalisation of the quantum weakest precondition result of D'Hondt and
Panangaden is presented. In particular the most general notion of quantum
predicate as positive operator valued measure (POVM) is introduced. The
previously known quantum weakest precondition result has been extended to cover
the case of POVM playing the role of a quantum predicate. Additionally, our
result is valid in infinite dimension case and also holds for a quantum
programs defined as a positive but not necessary completely positive
transformations of a quantum states.
