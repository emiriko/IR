By means of an adapted mean-field expansion for large fillings $n\gg1$, we
study the evolution of quantum fluctuations in the time-dependent Bose-Hubbard
model, starting in the superfluid state and approaching the Mott phase by
decreasing the tunneling rate or increasing the interaction strength in time.
For experimentally relevant cases, we derive analytical results for the
temporal behavior of the number and phase fluctuations, respectively. This
allows us to calculate the growth of the quantum depletion and the decay of
off-diagonal long-range order. We estimate the conditions for the observability
of the time dependence in the correlation functions in the experimental setups
with external trapping present. Finally, we discuss the analogy to quantum
effects in the early universe during the inflationary epoch.
