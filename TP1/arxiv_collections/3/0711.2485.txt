We study 85Rb atomic vapor for electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)
and obtain sub-natural EIT spectra at optical power higher than saturation
intensity. It is shown that spectral width of transmission and intensity of EIT
signal increases with intensity of optical field, which is one of the desirable
features for slow light and quantum information processing. A details analysis
has been done on such an atomic system.
