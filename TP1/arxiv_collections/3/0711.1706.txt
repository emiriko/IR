Laser-based angle-resolved photoemission measurements with super-high
resolution have been carried out on an optimally-doped
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_8$ high temperature superconductor. New high energy
features at $\sim$115 meV and $\sim$150 meV, besides the prominent $\sim$70 meV
one, are found to develop in the nodal electron self-energy in the
superconducting state. These high energy features, which can not be attributed
to electron coupling with single phonon or magnetic resonance mode, point to
the existence of a new form of electron coupling in high temperature
superconductors.
