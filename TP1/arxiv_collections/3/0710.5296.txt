Non-Fermi liquid behavior of strongly correlated Fermi systems is derived
within the Landau approach. We attribute this behavior to a phase transition
associated with a rearrangement of the Landau state that leads to flattening of
a portion of the single-particle spectrum $\epsilon({\bf p})$ in the vicinity
of the Fermi surface. We demonstrate that the quasiparticle subsystem
responsible for the flat spectrum possesses the same thermodynamic properties
as a gas of localized spins. Theoretical results compare favorably with
available experimental data. While departing radically from prevalent views on
the origin of non-Fermi-liquid behavior, the theory advanced here is
nevertheless a conservative one of in continuing to operate within the general
framework of Landau theory.
