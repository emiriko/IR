In this paper, the quantum phase transition between superfluid state and
Mott-insulator state is studied based on an extended Bose-Hubbard model with
two- and three-body on-site interactions. By employing the mean-field
approximation we find the extension of the insulating 'lobes' and the existence
of a fixed point in three dimensional phase space. We investigate the link
between experimental parameters and theoretical variables. The possibility to
obverse our results through some experimental effects in optically trapped
Bose-Einstein Condensates(BEC) is also discussed.
