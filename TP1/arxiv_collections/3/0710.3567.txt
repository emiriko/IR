In a highly polarized liquid (laser-polarized 3He-4He mixtures in our
experiment), dipolar magnetic interactions within the liquid introduce a
significant nonlinear and nonlocal contribution to the Bloch equation that
leads to instabilities during NMR evolution. We have launched a study of these
instabilities using spin echo techniques. At high magnetizations, a simple 180
degree rf pulse fails to refocus magnetization, so we use a standard
solid-state NMR pulse sequence: the magic sandwich. We report an experimental
and numerical investigation of the effect of this sequence on unstable NMR
evolution. Using a series of repeated magic sandwich sequences, the transverse
magnetization lifetime can be increased by up to three orders of magnitude.
