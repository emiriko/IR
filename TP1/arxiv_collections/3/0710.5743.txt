When making the connection between the thermodynamics of irreversible
processes and the theory of stochastic processes through the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem, it is necessary to invoke a postulate of the
Einstein-Boltzmann type. For convective processes hydrodynamic fluctuations
must be included, the velocity is a dynamical variable and although the entropy
cannot depend directly on the velocity, $\delta^{2} S$ will depend on velocity
variations. Some authors do not include velocity variations in $\delta^{2} S$,
and so have to introduce a non-thermodynamic function which replaces the
entropy and does depend on the velocity. At first sight, it seems that the
introduction of such a function requires a generalisation of the
Einstein-Boltzmann relation to be invoked. We review the reason why it is not
necessary to introduce such a function, and therefore why there is no need to
generalise the Einstein-Boltzmann relation in this way. We then obtain the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem which shows some differences as compared with
the non-convective case. We also show that $\delta^{2} S$ is a Liapunov
function when it includes velocity fluctuations.
