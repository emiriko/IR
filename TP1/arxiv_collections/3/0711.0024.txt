A quantitative comparison between the finite temperature behaviour of the
staggered and Wilson fermion formulations are performed. The comparison is
based on a physical quantity that is expected to be quite sensitive to the
fermionic features of the action. For that purpose we use the height of the
peak for $d\chi_s/dT$, where $\chi_s$ is the quark number susceptibility.
