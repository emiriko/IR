Spin-torque driven ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) is used to study thin
Co/Ni synthetic layers with perpendicular anisotropy confined in spin-valve
based nanojunctions. Field swept ST-FMR measurements were conducted with a
magnetic field applied perpendicular to the layer surface. The resonance lines
were measured under low amplitude rf excitation, from 1 to 20 GHz. These
results are compared with those obtained using conventional rf field driven FMR
on extended films with the same Co/Ni layer structure. The layers confined in
spin valves have a lower resonance field, a narrower resonance linewidth and
approximately the same linewidth vs frequency slope, implying the same damping
parameter. The critical current for magnetic excitations is determined from
measurements of the resonance linewidth vs dc current and is in accord with the
one determined from I-V measurements.
