We investigate the behavior of the dc electronic current, Jdc, in an
interacting quantum dot driven by two ac local potentials oscillating with a
frequency, Omega0, and a phase-lag, phi. We provide analytical functions to
describe the fingerprints of the Coulomb interaction in an experimental Jdc vs
phi characteristic curve. We show that the Kondo resonance reduces at low
temperatures the frequency range for the linear behavior of Jdc in Omega0 to
take place and determines the evolution of the dc-current as the temperature
increases.
