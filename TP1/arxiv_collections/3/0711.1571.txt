We present the current status of experimental results and prospects for the
determination of CP and T violation in the charm sector. Such measurements have
acquired renewed interest in recent years in view of theoretical work, which
has highlighted the possibility to probe experimental signatures from New
Physics beyond the Standard Model, since the effect of CP violation due to
Standard Model processes is expected to be highly suppressed in D decays. The
current limits of experimental sensitivities for these studies are reaching the
interesting theoretical regimes. We include new measurements from the Belle,
BABAR, and CLEO-c collaborations.
