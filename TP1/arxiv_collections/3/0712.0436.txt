We study coherent electron dynamics in a biassed undriven ideal semiconductor
superlattice coupled to the continuum, near energy level anticrossings. In
particular, we examine the dependence of wavepacket dynamical characteristics
on electric field detuning, and investigate mixed regimes involving a
superposition of energy level anticrossings showing both Rabi oscillations and
resonant tunnelling. In earlier work [Phys. Rev. B 75 165421 (2007)], Rabi and
Zener resonances were shown to have a common origin, and a criteria for the
occurrence of either was proposed. The present results allow a better
understanding of the nature of an interminiband resonance, which can be useful
in the areas of microwave radiation generation and matter manipulation on the
particle level, as well as demonstrate an alternative approach to examining
electron level structure of a finite superlattice.
