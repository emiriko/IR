We investigate methods to estimate the parameters of the gravitational-wave
signal from a spinning neutron star using Fourier transformed segments of the
strain response from an interferometric detector. Estimating the parameters
from the power, we find generalizations of the PowerFlux method. Using
simulated elliptically polarized signals injected into Gaussian noise, we apply
the generalized methods to estimate the squared amplitudes of the plus and
cross polarizations (and, in the most general case, the polarization angle),
and test the relative detection efficiencies of the various methods.
