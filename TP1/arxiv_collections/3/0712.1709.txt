We consider a classical N. Steenrod's problem on realization of homology
classes by images of the fundamental classes of manifolds. It is well-known
that each integral homology class can be realized with some multiplicity as an
image of the fundamental class of a manifold. Our main result is an explicit
purely combinatorial construction that for a given integral cycle provides a
combinatorial manifold realizing a multiple of the homology class of this
cycle. The construction is based on a local procedure for resolving
singularities of a pseudo-manifold. We give an application of our result to the
problem of constructing a combinatorial manifold with the prescribed set of
links of vertices.
