The theory of Quantum Chromo Dynamics (QCD) reproduces the strong interaction
at distances much shorter than the size of the nucleon. At larger distance
scales, the generation of hadron masses and confinement cannot yet be derived
from first principles on basis of QCD. The ${\bar{\rm P}}$ANDA experiment at
FAIR will address the origin of these phenomena in controlled environments.
Beams of antiprotons together with a multi-purpose and compact detection system
will provide unique tools to perform studies of the strong interaction. This
will be achieved via precision spectroscopy of charmonium and open-charm
states, an extensive search for exotic objects such as glueballs and hybrids,
in-medium and hypernuclei spectroscopy, and more. An overview is given of the
physics program of the ${\bar{\rm P}}$ANDA collaboration.
