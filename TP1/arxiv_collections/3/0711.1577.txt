An unreported praseodymium substituted phase of the Bi-Ru-O system with
formula Bi2.67Pr0.33Ru3O11was prepared. Its crystal structure and magnetic
properties were investigated. Pr substituted occurs only on one of the two Bi
sites. The magnetism of the compound is essentially dominated by a Pr3+
contribution. A non linear variation of the reciprocal magnetic susceptibility
is observed that appears to account for crystal electric field interactions on
the Pr3+ ions.
