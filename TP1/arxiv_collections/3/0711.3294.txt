During recent years, microelectronics helped to develop complex and varied
technologies. It appears that many of these technologies can be applied
successfully to realize Seebeck micro generators: photolithography and
deposition methods allow to elaborate thin thermoelectric structures at the
micro-scale level. Our goal is to scavenge energy by developing a miniature
power source for operating electronic components. First Bi and Sb micro-devices
on silicon glass substrate have been manufactured with an area of 1cm2
including more than one hundred junctions. Each step of process fabrication has
been optimized: photolithography, deposition process, anneals conditions and
metallic connections. Different device structures have been realized with
different micro-line dimensions. Each devices performance will be reviewed and
discussed in function of their design structure.
