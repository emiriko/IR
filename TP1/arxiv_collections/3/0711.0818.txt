In this paper we study the lattice CP$^1$ model in (3+1) dimensions coupled
with a dynamical compact U(1) gauge field. This model is an effective field
theory of the $s={1 \over 2}$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin model in three
spatial dimensions. By means of Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate its
phase structure. There exist the Higgs, Coulomb and confinement phases, and the
parameter regions of these phases are clarified. We also measure magnetization
of O(3) spins, energy gap of spin excitations, and mass of gauge boson. Then we
discuss the relationship between these three phases and magnetic properties of
the high-$T_{\rm c}$ cuprates, in particular the possibility of
deconfined-spinon phase. Effect of dimer-like spin exchange coupling and
ring-exchange coupling is also studied.
