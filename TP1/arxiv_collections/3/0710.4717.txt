This paper presents the novel idea of multi-placement structures, for a fast
and optimized placement instantiation in analog circuit synthesis. These
structures need to be generated only once for a specific circuit topology. When
used in synthesis, these pre-generated structures instantiate various layout
floorplans for various sizes and parameters of a circuit. Unlike procedural
layout generators, they enable fast placement of circuits while keeping the
quality of the placements at a high level during a synthesis process. The fast
placement is a result of high speed instantiation resulting from the efficiency
of the multi-placement structure. The good quality of placements derive from
the extensive and intelligent search process that is used to build the
multi-placement structure. The target benchmarks of these structures are analog
circuits in the vicinity of 25 modules. An algorithm for the generation of such
multi-placement structures is presented. Experimental results show placement
execution times with an average of a few milliseconds making them usable during
layout-aware synthesis for optimized placements.
