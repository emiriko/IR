Non-linear techniques are used to optimize the harvested energy from
piezoelectric and electromagnetic generators. This paper introduces an
analytical study for the voltage amplification obtained from these techniques.
The analytical study is experimentally validated using a macro model of
piezoelectric generator. Moreover, the integration influences on these
techniques is studied. Through all the obtained results, a suitable structure
for autonomous microsystems is proposed.
