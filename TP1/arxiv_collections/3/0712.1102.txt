After reviewing the concept of vison excitations in Z_2 dimer liquids, we
study the liquid-crystal transition of the Quantum Dimer Model on the
triangular lattice by means of a semiclassical spin-wave approximation to the
dispersion of visons in the context of a "soft-dimer" version of the model.
This approach captures some important qualitative features of the transition:
continuous nature of the transition, linear dispersion at the critical point,
and \sqrt{12}x\sqrt{12} symmetry-breaking pattern. In a second part, we present
a variational calculation of the vison dispersion relation at the RK point
which reproduces the qualitative shape of the dispersion relation and the order
of magnitude of the gap. This approach provides a simple but reliable
approximation of the vison wave functions at the RK point.
