Color-octet scalars, if present at the TeV scale, will be produced in
abundance at the LHC. We discuss in some detail the phenomenology of scalars in
the (8,2)_{1/2} representation, recently identified by Manohar and Wise as an
addition to the standard-model Higgs sector consistent with the principle of
minimal flavor violation. Couplings of this multiplet to the Higgs lift the
mass degeneracy among its states, possibly allowing for two-body decays of a
heavier colored scalar to a lighter one and a gauge boson. We perform a
renormalization group analysis of these couplings and find that limits from
Tevatron searches leave little room for these decays. This fact, and the
assumption of minimal flavor violation, lead us to study the case where the
octets decay to the heaviest kinematically accessible fermion pairs. Focusing
on pair-production events leading to (t t-bar t t-bar), (b b-bar b b-bar), and
(b b-bar t t-bar) final states, we find that discovery at the LHC should be
possible up to masses exceeding 1 TeV.
