Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a functional imaging method that is
being developed for bedside use in critical care medicine. Aiming at improving
the chest anatomical resolution of EIT images we developed a fuzzy model based
on EIT high temporal resolution and the functional information contained in the
pulmonary perfusion and ventilation signals. EIT data from an experimental
animal model were collected during normal ventilation and apnea while an
injection of hypertonic saline was used as a reference . The fuzzy model was
elaborated in three parts: a modeling of the heart, a pulmonary map from
ventilation images and, a pulmonary map from perfusion images. Image
segmentation was performed using a threshold method and a ventilation/perfusion
map was generated. EIT images treated by the fuzzy model were compared with the
hypertonic saline injection method and CT-scan images, presenting good results
in both qualitative (the image obtained by the model was very similar to that
of the CT-scan) and quantitative (the ROC curve provided an area equal to 0.93)
point of view. Undoubtedly, these results represent an important step in the
EIT images area, since they open the possibility of developing EIT-based
bedside clinical methods, which are not available nowadays. These achievements
could serve as the base to develop EIT diagnosis system for some
life-threatening diseases commonly found in critical care medicine.
