From recent study of properties of the lowest spin-parity $1/2^-$ baryons,
$N^*(1535)$ and $\Delta^*(1620)$, new pictures for the internal structure of
the lowest $1/2^-$ baryon octet and decuplet are proposed. While the lowest
$1/2^-$ baryon octet may have large diquark-diquark-antiquark component, the
lowest $1/2^-$ baryon decuplet is proposed to have large vector-meson-baryon
components. Evidence for the "missing" members of the new pictures is pointed
out and suggestions are made for detecting these predicted states from
forthcoming experiments.
