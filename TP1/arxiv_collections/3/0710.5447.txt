GDP/capita correlations are investigated in various time windows (TW), for
the time interval 1990-2005. The target group of countries is the set of 25 EU
members, 15 till 2004 plus the 10 countries which joined EU later on. The
TW-means of the statistical correlation coefficients are taken as the weights
(links) of a fully connected network having the countries as nodes. Thereafter
we define and introduce the overlapping index of weighted network nodes. A
cluster structure of EU countries is derived from the statistically relevant
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix. This may be considered to
yield some information about the structure, stability and evolution of the EU
country clusters in a macroeconomic sense.
