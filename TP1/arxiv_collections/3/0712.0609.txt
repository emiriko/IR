Using lattice simulations, we study the extent of the conformal window for an
$\text{SU}(3)$ gauge theory with $N_f$ Dirac fermions in the fundamental
representation. We present evidence that the infrared behavior is conformal for
$12 \leq N_f \leq 16$, governed by an infrared fixed point, while confinement
and chiral symmetry breaking are present for $N_f \leq 8$.
