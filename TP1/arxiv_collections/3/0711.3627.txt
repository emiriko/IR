We present a theoretical study of the collective excitations of a trapped
imbalanced fermion gas at unitarity, when the system consists of a superfluid
core and a normal outer shell. We formulate the relevant boundary conditions
and treat the normal shell both hydrodynamically and collisionlessly. For an
isotropic trap, we calculate the mode frequencies as a function of trap
polarization. Out-of-phase modes with frequencies below the trapping frequency
are obtained for the case of a hydrodynamic normal shell. For the collisionless
case, we calculate the monopole mode frequencies, and find that all but the
lowest mode may be damped.
