In this article, I review the most recent results in radiative penguin decays
from the B factories Belle and Babar. Most notably, I will talk about the
recent new observations in the decays B -> (rho/omega) gamma, a new analysis
technique in b -> s gamma, and first measurements of radiative penguin decays
in the B_s meson system. Finally, I will summarize the current status and
future prospects of radiative penguin B physics at the B factories.
