We construct a new multi-component CKP hierarchy based on the eigenfunction
symmetry reduction. It contains two types of CKP equation with self-consistent
sources which Lax representations are presented. Also it admits reductions to
$k$-constrained CKP hierarchy and to a (1+1)-dimensional soliton hierarchy with
self-consistent source, which include two types of Kaup-Kuperschmidt equation
with self-consistent sources and of bi-directional Kaup-Kuperschmidt equation
with self-consistent sources.
