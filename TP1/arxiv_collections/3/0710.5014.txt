In this paper we prove a duality between $k$-noncrossing partitions over
$[n]=\{1,...,n\}$ and $k$-noncrossing braids over $[n-1]$. This duality is
derived directly via (generalized) vacillating tableaux which are in
correspondence to tangled-diagrams \cite{Reidys:07vac}. We give a combinatorial
interpretation of the bijection in terms of the contraction of arcs of
tangled-diagrams. Furthermore it induces by restriction a bijection between
$k$-noncrossing, 2-regular partitions over $[n]$ and $k$-noncrossing braids
without isolated points over $[n-1]$. Since braids without isolated points
correspond to enhanced partitions this allows, using the results of
\cite{MIRXIN}, to enumerate 2-regular, 3-noncrossing partitions.
