New nonlinear connection formulae of the q-orthogonal polynomials, such
continuous q-Laguerre, continuous big q-Hermite, q-Meixner-Pollaczek and
q-Gegenbauer polynomials, in terms of their respective classical analogues are
obtained using a special realization of the q-exponential function as infinite
multiplicative series of ordinary exponential function.
