We report on three new types of nanoelectromechanical systems based on carbon
nanotubes: an electromechanical nanothermometer, a nanorelay and a nanomotor.
The nanothermometer can be used for accurate temperature measurements in
spatially localized regions with dimensions of several hundred nanometers. The
nanorelay is a prototype of a memory cell, and the nanoactuator can be used for
transformation of the forward force into the relative rotation of the walls.
Relative motion of the walls in these nanosystems is defined by the shape of
the interwall interaction energy surface. Ab initio and semi-empirical
calculations have been used to estimate the operational characteristics and
dimensions of these nanosystems.
