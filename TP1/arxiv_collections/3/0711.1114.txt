Numerical simulations are performed for isolated cyclic chains with excluded
volume. Data are reported for the form factor, S(x), where x is the reduced
scattering variable, and also for averages and distributions of the distance
between intramolecular units. The averages of distances are compared with two
alternative expressions describing their dependence with the number of segments
separating the units. The distribution function results are compared with the
des Cloizeaux form. Finally the S(x) data are compared with theoretical
functions also derived from the des Cloizeaux expression for the distribution
function. Moreover, the low x and asymptotic expansions of these functions are
obtained. Based on these expansions, simple formulas are proposed to give a
good description of the simulation data in the whole range of values of x. A
comparison with similar results for linear chains is also included.
