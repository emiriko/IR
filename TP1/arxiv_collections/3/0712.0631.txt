We show that the Zagier-Eisenstein series shares its non-holomorphic part
with certain weak Maass forms whose holomorphic parts are generating functions
for overpartition rank differences. This has a number of consequences,
including exact formulas, asymptotics, and congruences for the rank differences
as well as $q$-series identities of the mock theta type.
