Based on Landau-Devonshire (LD) phenomenological theory, phase diagram of
epitaxial BST50/50 thin films on anisotropic in-plane strains is investigated.
Different from BaTiO3 thin films, the paraelectric phase appears under the
anisotropic misfit strains on BST50/50 thin films at the room temperature. The
pyroelectric property of the BST films is also calculated, we find that the
position of pyroelectric peak greatly depends on anisotropic misfit strains.
