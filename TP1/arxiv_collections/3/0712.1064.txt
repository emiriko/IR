We study decoherence effects in a dc SQUID phase qubit caused by an isolation
circuit with a resonant frequency. The coupling between the SQUID phase qubit
and its environment is modeled via the Caldeira-Leggett formulation of quantum
dissipation/coherence, where the spectral density of the environment is related
to the admittance of the isolation circuit. When the frequency of the qubit is
at least two times larger than the resonance frequency of the isolation
circuit, we find that the decoherence time of the qubit is two orders of
magnitude larger than the typical ohmic regime, where the frequency of the
qubit is much smaller than the resonance frequency of the isolation circuit.
Lastly, we show that when the qubit frequency is on resonance with the
isolation circuit, an oscillatory non-Markovian decay emerges, as the dc SQUID
phase qubit and its environment self-generate Rabi oscillations of
characteristic time scales shorter than the decoherence time.
