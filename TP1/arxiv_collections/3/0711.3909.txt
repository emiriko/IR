It seems that what has been said by now about market and competitiveness do
not fit perfectly with competences of getting the best of profit. Sometimes,
the classical methods of fundamentals of management do not apply to individual
companies that face irregular accommodation on the market. It is high time to
replace the perfect business with the right one. New approaches and models may
help in identifying new competition trends, changes for better application of
purposes and proposals.
