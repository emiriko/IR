The dual-kinetic-balance (DKB) finite basis set method for solving the Dirac
equation for hydrogen-like ions [V. M. Shabaev et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 93,
130405 (2004)] is extended to problems with a non-local spherically-symmetric
Dirac-Hartree-Fock potential. We implement the DKB method using B-spline basis
sets and compare its performance with the widely-employed approach of Notre
Dame (ND) group [W.R. Johnson and J. Sapirstein, Phys. Rev. Lett. 57, 1126
(1986)]. We compare the performance of the ND and DKB methods by computing
various properties of Cs atom: energies, hyperfine integrals, the
parity-non-conserving amplitude of the $6s_{1/2}-7s_{1/2}$ transition, and the
second-order many-body correction to the removal energy of the valence
electrons. We find that for a comparable size of the basis set the accuracy of
both methods is similar for matrix elements accumulated far from the nuclear
region. However, for atomic properties determined by small distances, the DKB
method outperforms the ND approach. In addition, we present a strategy for
optimizing the size of the basis sets by choosing progressively smaller number
of basis functions for increasingly higher partial waves. This strategy
exploits suppression of contributions of high partial waves to typical
many-body correlation corrections.
