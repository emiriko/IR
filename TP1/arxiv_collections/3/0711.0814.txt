The linearizability of differential equations was first considered by Lie for
scalar second order semi-linear ordinary differential equations. Since then
there has been considerable work done on the algebraic classification of
linearizable equations and even on systems of equations. However, little has
been done in the way of providing explicit criteria to determine their
linearizability. Using the connection between isometries and symmetries of the
system of geodesic equations criteria were established for second order
quadratically and cubically semi-linear equations and for systems of equations.
The connection was proved for maximally symmetric spaces and a conjecture was
put forward for other cases. Here the criteria are briefly reviewed and the
conjecture is proved.
