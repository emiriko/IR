A collective mechanism for current reversal in superconducting vortex
ratchets is proposed. The mechanism is based on a two-dimensional instability
of the ground state (T=0) of the system. We illustrate our results with
numerical simulations and experiments in Nb superconducting films fabricated on
top of Si substrates with artificially induced asymmetric pinning centers.
