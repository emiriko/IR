The decay \phi -> f_0(980) \gamma and process e^+e^- -> \phi f_0(980) are
considered within the local Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. In the amplitudes of
these processes contributions of s-quark and kaon loops are taken into account.
The kaon loop gives a dominant contribution. Our estimation for the decay width
of \phi -> f_0 \gamma is in satisfactory agreement with recent experimental
data. This allows us to make some predictions for cross sections of the process
e^+e^- -> \gamma^* -> \phi f_0 which can be tested in the C-\tau factory. The
total and differential cross sections of this process are calculated and
presented in the figures.
