Following the recent proposal of Alday and Maldacena to obtain the strong
coupling scattering amplitude in N=4 SYM via AdS/CFT, we point out that a
unique solution can be obtained by imposing all the Virasoro constraints. In
the case of four-gluon scattering, this solution is identical to the
Alday-Maldacena solution, which is in accordance with the ansatz of Bern, Dixon
and Smirnov. This also solves the moduli space problem of the four-point
solution in a recent paper of Mironov, Morozov and Tomaras.
