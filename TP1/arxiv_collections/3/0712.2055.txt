The explicit one-loop renormalizability of the gluon sector of QCD with
Lorentz violation is demonstrated. The result is consistent with multiplicative
renormalization as the required counter terms are consistent with a single
re-scaling of the Lorentz-violation parameters. In addition, the resulting beta
functions indicate that the CPT-even Lorentz-violating terms increase with
energy scale in opposition to the asymptotically free gauge coupling and
CPT-odd terms. The calculations are performed at lowest-order in the
Lorentz-violating terms as they are assumed small.
