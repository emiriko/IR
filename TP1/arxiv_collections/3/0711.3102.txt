We study the transient dynamics that arise during the formation of an atom
laser beam in a tight waveguide. During the time evolution the density profile
develops a series of wiggles which are related to the diffraction in time
phenomenon. The apodization of matter waves, which relies on the use of smooth
aperture functions, allows to suppress such oscillations in a time interval,
after which there is a revival of the diffraction in time. The revival time
scale is directly related to the inverse of the harmonic trap frequency for the
atom reservoir.
