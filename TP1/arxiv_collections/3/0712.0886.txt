A T6 orbifold compactification is discussed from the somewhat unconventional
perspective as the large radius limit of a Landau-Ginzburg model. The features
of the model are in principle familiar, but the way they enter here is
different from the way they enter when using more commonly used methods. It is
hoped that the point of view presented here can supplement the understanding of
the features used in string compactifications, notably in terms of naturalness
and completeness. More precisely, the analyzed T6 / Z_4 x Z_4 features two
different kinds of O-planes, branes in the bulk as well as fractional branes,
continuous and discrete Wilson lines as well as an orientifold action which can
act in different ways on the Wilson lines. The D-branes are desribed by matrix
factorizations. This work is also intended to be a showcase for the potentials
of matrix factorizations which are for the first time geared to their full
level of sophistication in this paper. Throughout the analyis everything is
mapped from the B-model side of the LG-model to the A side by mirror symmetry.
The work could be extended straightforwardly yet tediously to perform mirror
symmetry on a general intersecting brane configuration and to compute Yukawa
couplings. The analysis presented here can also be applied to non-toroidal
backgrounds with an intersecting brane configuration on it, so I hope that it
will be a helpful basis for later applications of mirror symmetry to models
exhibiting real world properties.
