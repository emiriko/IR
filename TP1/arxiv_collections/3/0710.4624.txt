Why can the world resist the law of entropy increase and produce
self-organizing structure? Does the entropy of an isolated system always only
increase and never decrease? Can be thermodymamic degradation and
self-organizing evolution united? How to unite? In this paper starting out from
nonequilibrium entropy evolution equation we proved that a new entropy decrease
could spontaneously emerge in nonequilibrium system with internal attractive
interaction. This new entropy decrease coexists with the traditional law of
entropy increase, both of them countervail each other, so that the total
entropy of isolated system can be able to decrease. It not only makes isolated
system but also helps open system to produce self-organizing structure. We
first derived a statistical formula for this new entropy decrease rate, and
compared it both in mathematical form and in microscopic physical foundation
with the statistical formula for the law of entropy increase which was derived
by us some years ago. Furthermore, we gave the formulas for the time rate of
change of total entropy in isolated system and open system. The former is equal
to the sum of the formula for the law of entropy increase and the formula for
the new entropy decrease rate, the latter is the algebraic sum of the formulas
for entropy increase, entropy decrease and entropy flow. All of them manifest
the unity of thermodynamic degradation and self-organizing evolution. As the
application of the new theoretical formulas, we discussed qualitatively the
emergency of inhomogeneous structure in two real isolated systems including
clarifying the inference about the heat death of the universe.
