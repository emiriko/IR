Emergent pattern formation in self-propelled particle (SPP) systems is
extensively studied because it addresses a range of swarming phenomena which
occur without leadership. Here we present a dynamic SPP model in which a
sensory blind zone is introduced into each particle's zone of interaction.
Using numerical simulations we discovered that the degradation of milling
patterns with increasing blind zone ranges undergoes two distinct transitions,
including a new, spatially nonhomogeneous transition that involves cessation of
particles' motion caused by broken symmetries in their interaction fields. Our
results also show the necessity of nearly complete panoramic sensory ability
for milling behavior to emerge in dynamic SPP models, suggesting a possible
relationship between collective behavior and sensory systems of biological
organisms.
