We show that, from a topological point of view, 2-tape B\"uchi automata have
the same accepting power than Turing machines equipped with a B\"uchi
acceptance condition. In particular, we show that for every non null recursive
ordinal alpha, there exist some Sigma^0_alpha-complete and some
Pi^0_alpha-complete infinitary rational relations accepted by 2-tape B\"uchi
automata. This very surprising result gives answers to questions of W. Thomas
