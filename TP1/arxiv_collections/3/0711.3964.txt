The paper introduces a novel iterative method that assigns a reputation to n
+ m items: n raters and m objects. Each rater evaluates a subset of objects
leading to a n x m rating matrix with a certain sparsity pattern. From this
rating matrix we give a nonlinear formula to define the reputation of raters
and objects. We also provide an iterative algorithm that superlinearly
converges to the unique vector of reputations and this for any rating matrix.
In contrast to classical outliers detection, no evaluation is discarded in this
method but each one is taken into account with different weights for the
reputation of the objects. The complexity of one iteration step is linear in
the number of evaluations, making our algorithm efficient for large data set.
Experiments show good robustness of the reputation of the objects against
cheaters and spammers and good detection properties of cheaters and spammers.
