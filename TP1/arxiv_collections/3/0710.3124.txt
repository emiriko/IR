We report new data for the topological susceptibility computed on 2+1 flavor
dynamical configurations with lattice spacing 0.06 fm, generated with the
asqtad action. The topological susceptibility is computed by HYP smearing and
compared with rooted staggered chiral perturbation theory as the pion mass goes
to zero. At 0.06 fm, the raw data is already quite close to the continuum
extrapolated values obtained from coarser lattices. These results provide a
further test of the asqtad action with rooted staggered flavors.
