It is shown that $2\beta_1(\G)\leq h(\G)$ for any countable group $\G$, where
$\beta_1(\G)$ is the first $\ell^2$-Betti number and $h(\G)$ the uniform
isoperimetric constant. In particular, a countable group with non-vanishing
first $\ell^2$-Betti number is uniformly non-amenable.
  We then define isoperimetric constants in the framework of measured
equivalence relations. For an ergodic measured equivalence relation $R$ of type
$\IIi$, the uniform isoperimetric constant $h(R)$ of $R$ is invariant under
orbit equivalence and satisfies $$ 2\beta_1(R)\leq 2C(R)-2\leq h(R), $$ where
$\beta_1(\R)$ is the first $\ell^2$-Betti number and $C(R)$ the cost of $R$ in
the sense of Levitt (in particular $h(R)$ is a non-trivial invariant). In
contrast with the group case, uniformly non-amenable measured equivalence
relations of type $\IIi$ always contain non-amenable subtreeings.
  An ergodic version $h_e(\G)$ of the uniform isoperimetric constant $h(\G)$ is
defined as the infimum over all essentially free ergodic and measure preserving
actions $\alpha$ of $\G$ of the uniform isoperimetric constant $h(\R_\alpha)$
of the equivalence relation $R_\alpha$ associated to $\alpha$. By establishing
a connection with the cost of measure-preserving equivalence relations, we
prove that $h_e(\G)=0$ for any lattice $\G$ in a semi-simple Lie group of real
rank at least 2 (while $h_e(\G)$ does not vanish in general).
