The design of reliable circuits has received a lot of attention in the past,
leading to the definition of several design techniques introducing fault
detection and fault tolerance properties in systems for critical
applications/environments. Such design methodologies tackled the problem at
different abstraction levels, from switch-level to logic, RT level, and more
recently to system level. Aim of this paper is to introduce a novel
system-level technique based on the redefinition of the operators functionality
in the system specification. This technique provides reliability properties to
the system data path, transparently with respect to the designer. Feasibility,
fault coverage, performance degradation and overheads are investigated on a FIR
circuit.
