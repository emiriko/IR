The one parameter scaling theory is a powerful tool to investigate Anderson
localization effects in disordered systems. In this paper we show this theory
can be adapted to the context of quantum chaos provided that the classical
phase space is homogeneous, not mixed. The localization problem in this case is
defined in momentum, not in real space. We then employ the one parameter
scaling theory to: a) propose a precise characterization of the type of
classical dynamics related to the Wigner-Dyson and Poisson statistics which
also predicts in what situations Anderson localization corrections invalidate
the relation between classical chaos and random matrix theory encoded in the
Bohigas-Schmit-Giannoni conjecture, b) to identify the universality class
associated with the metal-insulator transition in quantum chaos. In low
dimensions it is characterized by classical superdiffusion, in higher
dimensions it has in general a quantum origin as in the case of disordered
systems. We illustrate these two cases by studying 1$d$ kicked rotors with non
analytical potentials and a 3$d$ kicked rotor with a smooth potential.
