The proposal of this paper is to provide a simple angular random walk model
to build up polypeptide structures, which encompass properties of dihedral
angles of folded proteins. From this model, structures will be built with
lengths ranging from 125 up to 400 amino acids for the different fractions of
secondary structure motifs, which dihedral angles were randomly chosen
according to narrow Gaussian probability distributions. In order to measure the
fractal dimension of proteins three different cases were analyzed. The first
contained alpha-helix structures only, the second beta-strands structures and
the third a mix of alpha-helices and beta-sheets. The behavior of proteins with
alpha-helix motifs are more compacted than in other situations. The findings
herein indicate that this model describes some structural properties of a
protein and suggest that randomness is an essential ingredient but proteins are
driven by narrow angular Gaussian probability distributions and not by
random-walk processes.
