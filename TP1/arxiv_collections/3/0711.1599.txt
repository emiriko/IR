We report on a comprehensive study of the electronic and magnetic structure
of the striped nickelate La5/3Sr1/3NiO4. The investigation is carried out using
band structure calculations based on density functional theory. A magnetic
structure compatible with experiment is obtained from spin-polarized
calculations within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), whereas
inclusion of a local Coulomb interaction in the LDA+U framework results in a
different ground state. The influence of the various interaction parameters is
discussed in detail.
