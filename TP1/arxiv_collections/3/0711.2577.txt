The GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation and experimental characterization of the
Siemens E.Cam Dual Head gamma camera hosted in the Particular Hospital of
Algarve have been done. Imaging tests of thyroid and other phantoms have been
made "in situ" and compared with the results obtained with the Monte Carlo
simulation.
