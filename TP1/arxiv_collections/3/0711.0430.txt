The Ricci flow is a heat equation for metrics, which has recently been used
to study the topology of closed three manifolds. In this paper we apply Ricci
flow techniques to general relativity. We view a three dimensional
asymptotically flat Riemannian metric as a time symmetric initial data set for
Einstein's equations. We study the evolution of the area A and Hawking mass M
of a two dimensional closed surface under the Ricci flow. The physical
relevance of our study derives from the fact that, in general relativity the
area of apparent horizons is related to black hole entropy and the Hawking mass
of an asymptotic round 2-sphere is the ADM energy.We begin by considering the
special case of spherical symmetry to develop a physical feel for the geometric
quantities involved. We then consider a general asymptotically flat Riemannian
metric and derive an inequality which relates the evolution of the area of a
closed surface S to its Hawking mass. We suggest that there may be a maximum
principle which governs the long term existence of the asymptotically flat
Ricci flow.
