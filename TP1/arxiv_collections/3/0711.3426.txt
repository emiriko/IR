We have made pressure and NMR measurements during the evolution of phase
separation in solid helium isotopic mixtures. Our observations indicate clearly
all three stages of the homogeneous nucleation - growth process: 1) creation of
nucleation sites; 2) growth of the new-phase component at these nucleation
sites; and 3) coarsening: the dissolution of sub-critical droplets with the
consequent further late-stage growth of the super-critical droplets. The time
exponent for the coarsening, a = 1/3, is consistent with the conserved order
parameter Lifshitz-Slezov evaporation-condensation mechanism.
