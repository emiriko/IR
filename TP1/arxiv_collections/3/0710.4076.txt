We illustrate how elementary information-theoretic ideas may be employed to
provide proofs for well-known, nontrivial results in number theory.
Specifically, we give an elementary and fairly short proof of the following
asymptotic result: The sum of (log p)/p, taken over all primes p not exceeding
n, is asymptotic to log n as n tends to infinity. We also give finite-n bounds
refining the above limit. This result, originally proved by Chebyshev in 1852,
is closely related to the celebrated prime number theorem.
