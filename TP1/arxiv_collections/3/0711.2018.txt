In view of the recent results from the MiniBooNE experiment we revisit the
global neutrino oscillation fit to short-baseline neutrino data by adding one,
two or three sterile neutrinos with eV-scale masses to the three Standard Model
neutrinos. We find that four-neutrino oscillations of the (3+1) type, which
have been only marginally allowed before the recent MiniBooNE results, become
even more disfavored with the new data. In the framework of so-called (3+2)
five-neutrino mass schemes the MiniBooNE results can be nicely reconciled with
the LSND appearance evidence thanks to the possibility of CP violation
available in such oscillation schemes; however, the tension between appearance
and disappearance experiments represents a serious problem in (3+2) schemes, so
that these models are ultimately not viable. This tension remains also when a
third sterile neutrino is added, and we do not find a significant improvement
of the global fit in a (3+3) scheme.
