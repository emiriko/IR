Modern societies feature an increasing contact between cultures, yet we have
a poor understanding of what the outcomes might be. Here we consider a
mathematical model of contact between social groups, grounded in social
psychology and analyzed using tools from statistical physics. We use the model
to study how a culture might be affected by immigration. We find that in some
cases residents' culture is relatively unchanged, but in other cases residents
may adopt the opinions and beliefs of immigrants. The decisive factors are each
group's cultural legacy and its attitudes towards in- and out-groups. The model
can also predict how social policies may influence the outcome of culture
contact.
