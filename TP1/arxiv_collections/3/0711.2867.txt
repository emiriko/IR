We analyze linkage strategies for a set I of webpages for which the webmaster
wants to maximize the sum of Google's PageRank scores. The webmaster can only
choose the hyperlinks starting from the webpages of I and has no control on the
hyperlinks from other webpages. We provide an optimal linkage strategy under
some reasonable assumptions.
