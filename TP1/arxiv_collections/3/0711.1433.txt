We study the resonant electronic excitation dynamics for ultracold atoms
trapped in a deep optical lattice prepared in a Mott insulator state. Excitons
in these artificial crystals are similar to Frenkel excitons in Noble atom or
molecular crystals. They appear when the atomic excited state line width is
smaller than the exciton band width generated by dipole-dipole coupling. When
the atoms are placed within a cavity the electronic excitations and the
quantized cavity mode get coupled. In the collective strong coupling regime
excitations form two branches of cavity polaritons with Rabi splitting larger
than the atomic and the cavity line width. To demonstrate their properties we
calculate the transmission, reflection, and absorption spectra for an incident
weak probe field, which show resonances at the polariton frequencies.
