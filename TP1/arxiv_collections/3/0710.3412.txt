We report the latest result for the search for the standard model higgs
produced in association with a W and a Z boson at CDF. The results include
about 1 to 1.7 fb-1 of data collected by CDF in run II of the Tevatron. Novel
analysis techniques have been developed to enhance the sensitivity of these
searches.
