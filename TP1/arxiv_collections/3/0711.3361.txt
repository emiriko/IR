The decay of the standard model Higgs boson into a single photon and a vector
unparticle through a one-loop process is studied. For an intermediate mass
Higgs boson, this single photon plus unparticle mode can have a branching ratio
comparable with the two-photon discovery mode. The emitted photon has a
continuous energy spectrum encoding the nature of the recoil unparticle. It can
be measured in precision studies of the Higgs boson after its discovery.
