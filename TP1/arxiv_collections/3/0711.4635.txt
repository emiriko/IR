We study the ground state phases of Bose-Fermi mixtures in one-dimensional
optical lattices with quantum Monte Carlo simulations using the Canonical Worm
algorithm. Depending on the filling of bosons and fermions, and the on-site
intra- and inter-species interaction, different kinds of incompressible and
superfluid phases appear. On the compressible side, correlations between bosons
and fermions can lead to a distinctive behavior of the bosonic superfluid
density and the fermionic stiffness, as well as of the equal-time Green
functions, which allow one to identify regions where the two species exhibit
anticorrelated flow. We present here complete phase diagrams for these systems
at different fillings and as a function of the interaction parameters.
