Performing molecular dynamics simulations for all-atom models, we
characterize the conformational and structural relaxations of poly(ethylene
oxide) and poly(propylene oxide) melts. The temperature dependence of these
relaxation processes deviates from an Arrhenius law for both polymers. We
demonstrate that mode-coupling theory captures some aspects of the glassy
slowdown, but it does not enable a complete explanation of the dynamical
behavior. When the temperature is decreased, spatially heterogeneous and
cooperative translational dynamics are found to become more important for the
structural relaxation. Moreover, the transitions between the conformational
states cease to obey Poisson statistics. In particular, we show that, at
sufficiently low temperatures, correlated forward-backward motion is an
important aspect of the conformational relaxation, leading to strongly
nonexponential distributions for the waiting times of the dihedrals in the
various conformational states
