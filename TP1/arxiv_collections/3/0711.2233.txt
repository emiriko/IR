We calculate in chiral perturbation theory the parity-violating two-pion
exchange nucleon-nucleon potentials at leading one-loop order. At a distance of
$r= m_\pi^{-1} \simeq 1.4 $fm they amount to about $\pm 16%$ of the
parity-violating $1\pi$-exchange potential. We evaluate also the
parity-violating effects arising from $2\pi$-exchange with excitation of
virtual $\Delta(1232)$-isobars. These come out to be relatively small in
comparison to those from diagrams with only nucleon intermediate states. The
reason for this opposite behavior to the parity-conserving case is the blocking
of the dominant isoscalar central channel by CP-invariance. Furthermore, we
calculate the T-matrix related to the iteration of the parity-violating
$1\pi$-exchange with the parity-conserving one. The analytical results
presented in this work can be easily implemented into calculations of
parity-violating nuclear observables.
