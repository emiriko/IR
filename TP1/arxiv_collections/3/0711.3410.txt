A self-consistent coupled-channel approach is used to study the properties of
$D$ and $\bar D$ mesons in hot dense matter. The starting point is a broken
SU(4) s-wave Tomozawa-Weinberg $DN$ ($\bar DN$) interaction supplemented by an
attractive isoscalar-scalar term. The Pauli blocking effects, baryon mean-field
bindings, and $\pi$ and open-charm meson self-energies are incorporated in
dense matter at finite temperature. In the $DN$ sector, the dynamically
generated $\tilde\Lambda_c$ and $\tilde\Sigma_c$ resonances remain close to
their free space position while acquiring a remarkable width because of the
thermal smearing of Pauli blocking. Therefore, the $D$ meson spectral density
shows a single pronounced quasiparticle peak close to the free mass, that
broadens with increasing density, and a low energy tail associated to smeared
$\tilde\Lambda_c N^{-1}$, $\tilde\Sigma_c N^{-1}$ configurations. In the $\bar
DN$ case, the low-density approximation to the repulsive $\bar D$ self-energy
is found unreliable already at subsaturation densities. From this study we
speculate the possible existence of $D$-mesic nuclei. We also discuss the
consequences for $J/\Psi$ suppression at FAIR.
