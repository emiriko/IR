We discuss the relativistic transformation of the energy of a charged
spherical capacitor. The energy stored in the electromagnetic fields observed
by an uniformly moving frame is related to that of the rest frame by a factor
different from $\gamma $. Considering the energy and the stresses in the
capacitor shells we show that the total energy of the system satisfies the
expected relativistic transformation.
