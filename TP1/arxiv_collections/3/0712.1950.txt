The International Linear Collider (ILC) is a 200-500 GeV center-of-mass
high-luminosity linear electron-positron collider, based on 1.3 GHz
superconducting radio-frequency (SCRF) accelerating cavities. The ILC has a
total footprint of about 31 km and is designed for a peak luminosity of 2x10^34
cm^-2s^-1. This report is the Executive Summary (Volume I) of the four volume
Reference Design Report. It gives an overview of the physics at the ILC, the
accelerator design and value estimate, the detector concepts, and the next
steps towards project realization.
