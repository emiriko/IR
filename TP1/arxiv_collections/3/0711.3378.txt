We show that the efficiency of manipulating electron spin in semiconductor
quantum wells can be enhanced by tuning the strain strength. The effect
combining intrinsic and strain-induced spin splitting varies for different
systems, which provides an alternative route to understand the experimental
phenomena brought in by the strain. The types of spin splittings caused by
strain are suggested to be distinguished by the measurement of the
electron-dipole-spin-resonance intensity through changing the direction of the
$ac$ electric field in the $x$-$y$ plane of the quantum well and tuning the
strain strengths.
