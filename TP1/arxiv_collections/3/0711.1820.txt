The dual parametrization of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) is
considered in details. We discuss which part of information about hadron
structure encoded in GPDs [part of total GPD image] can be restored from the
known amplitude of a hard exclusive process. The physics content of this
partial image is analyzed.
