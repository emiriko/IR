Multivariance of geometry means that at the point $P_{0}$ there exist many
vectors $P_{0}P_{1}$, $\P_{0}P_{2}$,... which are equivalent (equal) to the
vector $\Q_{0}Q_{1}$ at the point $Q_{0}$, but they are not equivalent between
themselves. The discrimination capacity (zero-variance) of geometry appears,
when at the point $P_{0}$ there are no vectors, which are equivalent to the
vector $Q_{0}Q_{1}$ at the point $Q_{0}$. It is shown, that in some
multivariant space-time geometries some particles of small mass may be
discriminated (i.e. either they do not exist, or their evolution is
impossible). The possibility of some particle discrimination may appear to be
important for explanation of the discrete character of mass spectrum of
elementary particles.
