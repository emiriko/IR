We explore the impact of the short range interaction on the scattering of
ground state polar molecules, and study the transition from a weak to strong
dipolar scattering over an experimentally reasonable range of energies and
electric field values. In the strong dipolar limit, the scattering scales with
respect to a dimensionless quantity defined by mass, induced dipole moment, and
collision energy. The scaling has implications for all quantum mechanical
dipolar scattering, and therefore this universal dipolar scaling provides
estimates of scattering cross sections for any dipolar system.
