We theoretically study the possibility of reaching the antiferromagnetic
phase of the Hubbard model by starting from a normal gas of trapped fermionic
atoms and adiabatically ramping up an optical lattice. Requirements on the
initial temperature and the number of atoms are determined for a three
dimensional square lattice by evaluating the Neel state entropy, taking into
account fluctuations around the mean-field solution. We find that these
fluctuations place important limitations on adiabatically reaching the Neel
state.
