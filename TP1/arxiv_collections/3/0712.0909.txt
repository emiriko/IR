We summarize the objectives and results of the ``international scoping study
of a future neutrino factory and superbeam facility'' (ISS) physics working
group. Furthermore, we discuss how the ISS study should develop into a neutrino
factory design study (IDS-NF) from the point of view of physics and performance
evaluation.
