Strong spin-orbit interaction characteristic for p-type GaAs systems, makes
such systems promising for the realization of spintronic devices. Here we
report on transport measurements in nanostructures fabricated on p-type,
C-doped GaAs heterostructures by scanning probe oxidation lithography. We
observe conductance quantization in a quantum point contact, as well as
pronounced Coulomb resonances in two quantum dots with different geometries.
Charging energies for both dots, extracted from Coulomb diamond measurements
are in agreement with the lithographic dimensions of the dots. The absence of
excited states in Coulomb diamond measurements indicates that the dots are in
the multi-level transport regime.
