This paper compares the performances of a vibrationpowered electrical
generators using PZT piezoelectric ceramic associated to two different power
conditioning circuits. A new approach of the piezoelectric power conversion
based on a nonlinear voltage processing is presented and implemented with a
particular power conditioning circuit topology. Theoretical predictions and
experimental results show that the nonlinear processing technique may increase
the power harvested by a factor up to 4 compared to the Standard optimization
technique. Properties of this new technique are analyzed in particular in the
case of broadband, random vibrations, and compared to those of the Standard
interface.
