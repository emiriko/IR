The Hamiltonian constraint of the coupled Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs system
with a cosmological constant is shown to be a pure Poisson bracket of a
dimensionless functional on the phase space and the volume of the three-space.
One of its potential consequences, a restriction on the eigenstates of the
volume operator in a class of canonical quantum gravity theories, is also
pointed out.
