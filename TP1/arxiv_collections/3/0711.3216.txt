We consider quantum charge pumping of electrons across a superconducting
double barrier structure in the adiabatic limit. The superconducting barriers
are assumed to be reflection-less so that an incident electron on the barrier
can either tunnel through it or Andreev reflect from it. In this structure,
quantum charge pumping can be achieved (a) by modulating the amplitudes,
$\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$ of the two superconducting gaps or alternatively, (b)
by a periodic modulation of the order parameter phases, $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$
of the superconducting barriers. In the former case, we show that the
superconducting gap gives rise to a very sharp resonance in the transmission
resulting in quantization of pumped charge, when the pumping contour encloses
the resonance. On the other hand, we find that quantization is hard to achieve
in the latter case. We show that inclusion of weak electron-electron
interaction in the quantum wire leads to renormalisation group evolution of the
transmission amplitude towards the perfectly transmitting limit due to
proximity effects. Hence as we approach the zero temperature limit, we get
destruction of quantized pumped charge. This is in sharp contrast to the case
of charge pumping in a double barrier in a Luttinger liquid where quantized
charge pumping is actually achieved in the zero temperature limit. We also
propose an experimental set-up to study these effects.
