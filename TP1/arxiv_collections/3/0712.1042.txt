We show that finite angular momentum pairing chiral superconductors on the
triangular lattice have point zeroes in the complex gap function. A topological
quantum phase transition takes place through a nodal superconducting state at a
specific carrier density $x_c$ where the normal state Fermi surface crosses the
isolated zeros. For spin singlet pairing, we show that the second nearest
neighbor $d+id$-wave pairing can be the dominant pairing channel. The gapless
critical state at $x_c\simeq0.25$ has six Dirac points and is topologically
nontrivial with a $T^3$ spin relaxation rate below $T_c$. This picture provides
a possible explanation for the unconventional superconducting state of
Na$_x$CoO$_2\cdot y$H$_2$O. Analyzing a pairing model with strong correlation
using the Gutzwiller projection and symmetry arguments, we study these
topological phases and phase transitions as a function of Na doping.
