A detailed simple model is applied to study a high temperature hydrogen
plasma ball. It is assumed that the ions and delocalized electrons are
distributed randomly throughout the charged plasma ball (extra/missing charge
is assumed to be found in a thin layer on the surface of a ball). The energy of
the microscopic electrostatic field around the ions is taken into account and
calculated. It is shown in the framework of the model that charged hydrogen
plasma ball can be stable as a metastable state, when subjected to external
(atmospheric) pressure. Equilibrium radius of a ball, the barrier and the
enthalpy of the equilibrium ball are calculated. It looks like the charged
plasma ball in a metastable equilibrium should be used to conduct controllable
nuclear fusion. Changes in the electric charge can be used to control the
volume of a plasma ball.
