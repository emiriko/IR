We propose a resonant one-dimensional quasicrystal, namely, a multiple
quantum well (MQW) structure satisfying the Fibonacci-chain rule with the
golden ratio between the long and short inter-well distances. The resonant
Bragg condition is generalized from the periodic to Fibonacci MQWs. A
dispersion equation for exciton-polaritons is derived in the two-wave
approximation, the effective allowed and forbidden bands are found. The
reflection spectra from the proposed structures are calculated as a function of
the well number and detuning from the Bragg condition.
