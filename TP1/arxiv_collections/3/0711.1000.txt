Ca_1-xSr_xRuO_3, which is ferromagnetic for Sr concentration x > 0.3, has
been studied by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) in Ru 3p and O 1s
core-level x-ray absorption. XMCD signals appear at x ~ 0.3 and monotonically
increases with x in the ferromagnetic phase. While the monotonic increase of
the XMCD signals with x is of a typical Stoner-type, the absence of appreciable
change in the spectral line shapes of both the Ru 3p and O 1s XMCD spectra
indicate that the itinerant-electron ferromagnetism in Ca_1-xSr_xRuO_3 is
influenced by strong electron correlation.
