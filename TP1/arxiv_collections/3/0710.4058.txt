We discuss Israel layers collapsing inward from rest at infinity along
Schwarzschild-Lemaitre geodesics. The dynamics of the collapsing layer and its
equation of state are developed. There is a general equation of state which is
approximately polytropic in the limit of very low pressure. The equation of
state establishes a new limit on the stress-density ratio.
