Isotropic antiferromagnets shows a reach variety of magnetic solitons with
non-trivial static and dynamic properties. One-dimensional soliton elementary
excitations have a periodic dispersion law. For two-dimensional case, planar
antiferromagnetic vortices having non-singular macroscopic core with the
saturated magnetic moment are present. The dynamic properties of these planar
antiferromagnetic vortex are characterized by presence of a gyroforce
