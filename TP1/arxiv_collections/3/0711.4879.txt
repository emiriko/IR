We experimentally and theoretically investigate exciton-field coupling for
the surface plasmon polariton (SPP) in waveguide-confined (WC) anti-symmetric
modes of hexagonal plasmonic crystals in InP-TiO-Au-TiO-Si heterostructures.
The radiative decay time of the InP-based transverse magnetic (TM)-strained
multi-quantum well (MQW) coupled to the SPP modes is observed to be 2.9-3.7
times shorter than that of a bare MQW wafer. Theoretically we find that 80 % of
the enhanced PL is emitted into SPP modes, and 17 % of the enhanced
luminescence is redirected into WC-anti-symmetric modes. In addition to the
direct coupling of the excitons to the plasmonic modes, this demonstration is
also useful for the development of high-temperature SPP lasers, the development
of highly integrated photo-electrical devices, or miniaturized biosensors.
