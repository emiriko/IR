We investigate the $CR$ geometry of the orbits $M$ of a real form $G_0$ of a
complex simple group $G$ in a complex flag manifold $X=G/Q$. We are mainly
concerned with finite type, Levi non-degeneracy conditions, canonical
$G_0$-equivariant and Mostow fibrations, and topological properties of the
orbits.
