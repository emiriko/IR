We critically analyse and comment on the claims of M. R. Pennington and D. J.
Wilson [arxiv:0711.3521]. Although we generally agree with their obvious
algebra, it is clearly not applicable to our equations. Moreover, we argue that
the corresponding proposal is not useful for production-data analysis. The
advantages of our approach, which involves complex yet purely kinematical
coefficients, are summarised.
