Studying our semirelativistic potential model and the numerical results,
which succeeds in predicting and reproducing recently discovered higher
resonances of $D$, $D_s$, $B$, and $B_s$, we find a simple expression for the
mass gap between two spin multiplets of heavy-light mesons, $(0^-,1^-)$ and
$(0^+,1^+)$. The mass gap between chiral partners defined by $\Delta
M=M(0^+)-M(0^-)$ and/or $M(1^+)-M(1^-)$ is given by $\Delta
M=M(0^+)-M(0^-)=M(1^+)-M(1^-)\approx \Lambda_{\rm Q}-m_q$ in the limit of heavy
quark symmetry. We also study the case including $1/m_Q$ corrections.
