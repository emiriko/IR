We study the statefinder parameters in the Yang-Mills condensate dark energy
models, and find that the evolving trajectories of these models are different
from those of other dark energy models. We also define two eigenfunctions of
the Yang-Mills condensate dark energy models. The values of these
eigenfunctions are quite close to zero if the equation-of-state of the
Yang-Mills condensate is not far from -1, which can be used to simply
differentiate between the Yang-Mills condensate models and other dark energy
models.
