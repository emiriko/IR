We have built a new kind of manifolds which leads to an alternative new
geometrical space. The study of the nowhere differentiable functions via a
family of mean functions leads to a new characterization of this category of
functions. A fluctuant manifold has been built with an appearance of a new
structure on it at every scale, and we embedded into it an internal structure
to transform its fluctuant geometry to a new fixed geometry. This approach
leads us to what we call fractal manifold. The elements of this kind of
manifold appear locally as tiny double strings, with an appearance of new
structure at every step of approximation. We have obtained a variable
dimensional space which is locally neither a continuum nor a discrete, but a
mixture of both. Space acquires a variable geometry, it becomes explicitly
dependent on the approximation process, and the geometry on it assumed to be
characterized not only by curvature, but also by the appearance of new
structure at every step of approximation.
