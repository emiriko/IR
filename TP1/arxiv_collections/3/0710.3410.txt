Spherically symmetric entities filled with matter induced by the 5D Bulk may
be built in the empty 4D space-time. The substance of the entity, the latter
regarded as a fundamental particle, is characterized by the prematter equ. of
state P=-rho. the particle is coverede by a Schwarzschild-like envelope and
from the outside it is characterized by mass and radius. One regard these
entities as neutral fundamental particles being constituents of quarks and
leptons. The presented classical models are developed in the framwork of the
Weyl-Dirac version of Wesson's IMT.
