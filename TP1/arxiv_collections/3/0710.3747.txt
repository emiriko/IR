Efficient simulations of quantum evolutions of spin-1/2 systems are relevant
for ensemble quantum computation as well as in typical NMR experiments. We
propose an efficient method to calculate the dynamics of an observable provided
that the initial excitation is "local". It resorts a single entangled pure
initial state built as a superposition, with random phases, of the pure
elements that compose the mixture. This ensures self-averaging of any
observable, drastically reducing the calculation time. The procedure is tested
for two representative systems: a spin star (cluster with random long range
interactions) and a spin ladder.
