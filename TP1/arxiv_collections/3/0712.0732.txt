The hot and dense strongly interacting matter created in collisions of heavy
nuclei at RHIC energies is modeled with relativistic hydrodynamics, and the
spectra of real and virtual photons produced at mid-rapidity in these events
are calculated. Several different sources are considered, and their relative
importance is compared. Specifically, we include jet fragmentation, jet-plasma
interactions, the emission of radiation from the thermal medium and from
primordial hard collisions. Our calculations consistently take into account jet
energy loss, as evaluated in the AMY formalism. We obtain results for the
spectra, the nuclear modification factor (R_AA), and the azimuthal anisotropy
(v_2) that agree with the photon measurements performed by the PHENIX
collaboration at RHIC.
