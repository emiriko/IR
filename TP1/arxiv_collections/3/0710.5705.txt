$La_{0.7}Ca_{0.3}MnO_3$ samples were prepared in nano- and polycrystalline
forms by sol-gel and solid state reaction methods, respectively, and
structurally characterized by synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The magnetic
properties determined by ac susceptibility and dc magnetization measurements
are discussed. The magnetocaloric effect in this nanocrystalline manganite is
spread over a broader temperature interval than in the polycrystalline case.
The relative cooling power of the poly- and nanocrystalline manganites is used
to evaluate a possible application for magnetic cooling below room temperature.
