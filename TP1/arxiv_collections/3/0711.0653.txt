We study the effect of the rotation on a harmonically trapped Fermi gas at
zero temperature under the assumption that vortices are not formed. We show
that at unitarity the rotation produces a phase separation between a non
rotating superfluid (S) core and a rigidly rotating normal (N) gas. The
interface between the two phases is characterized by a density discontinuity
$n_{\rm N}/n_{\rm S}= 0.85$, independent of the angular velocity. The depletion
of the superfluid and the angular momentum of the rotating configuration are
calculated as a function of the angular velocity. The conditions of stability
are also discussed and the critical angular velocity for the onset of a
spontaneous quadrupole deformation of the interface is evaluated.
