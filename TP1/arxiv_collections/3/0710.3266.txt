The activated surface diffusion of interacting adsorbates is described in
terms of the so-called interacting single adsorbate approximation, which is
applied to the diffusion of Na atoms on Cu(001) for coverages up to 20% in
quasielastic He atom scattering experiments. This approximation essentially
consists of solving the standard Langevin equation with two noise sources and
frictions: a Gaussian white noise accounting for the friction with the
substrate, and a white shot noise characterized by a collisional friction
simulating the adsorbate-adsorbate collisions. The broadenings undergone by the
quasielastic peak are found to be in very good agreement with the experimental
data reported at two surface temperatures 200 and 300 K.
