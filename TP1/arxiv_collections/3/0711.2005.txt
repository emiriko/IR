Considering the large value of the top Yukawa coupling, we investigate the
leading one-loop Yukawa electroweak corrections that can be induced by the top
quark in a process such as Higgs production in association with a tagged bottom
anti-bottom pair at the LHC. At NLO these contributions are found to be small
at the LHC both for the total cross section and for the distributions. In the
limit of vanishing bottom Yukawa coupling where the LO contribution vanishes,
the process can still be induced at one-loop through the top quark transition.
Though this contribution which can be counted as part of the NNLO correction is
small for Higgs masses around 120GeV, it quickly picks up for higher Higgs
masses. This contribution represents the rescattering of the top quarks and
their decay into W's leading to Higgs production through WW fusion
