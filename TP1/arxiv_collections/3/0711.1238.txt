We analyse the lepton sector of the Left-Right Twin Higgs Model. This model
offers an alternative way to solve the "little hierarchy" problem of the
Standard Model. We show that one can achieve an effective see-saw to explain
the origin of neutrino masses and that this model can accommodate the observed
neutrino masses and mixings. We have also studied the lepton flavour violation
process l_1 -> l_2 \gamma and discussed how the experimental bound from these
branching ratios constrains the scale of symmetry breaking of this Twin Higgs
model.
