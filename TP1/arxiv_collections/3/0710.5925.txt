We present here some results supporting the nature of the $\Lambda(1405)$
resonance as dynamically generated from the meson baryon interaction in coupled
channels and resulting from the superposition of two close-by poles. We find
support for this picture in the $K^- p \to \pi^0 \pi^0 \Sigma^0 $ reaction,
which shows a different shape than the one obtained from the $\pi ^- p \to K^0
\pi \Sigma $ reaction. We also call the attention to the $K^- p \to \gamma \pi
\Sigma$ with $\pi \Sigma$ in the $\Lambda(1405)$ region, which shows a narrow
peak in the calculations around 1420 MeV. We also report on recent calculations
of the radiative decay of the two $\Lambda(1405)$ states and on reactions to
obtain information on these decay modes. Finally, we present results for the
$pp\to p K^+\Lambda(1405)$ reaction recently measured at ANKE/COSY and compare
them with theoretical results.
