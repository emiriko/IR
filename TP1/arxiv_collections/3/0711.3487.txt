The surface structural phases of Ca(2-x)Sr(x)RuO(4) are investigated using
quantitative Low Energy Electron Diffraction. The broken symmetry at the
surface enhances the structural instability against the RuO6 rotational
distortion while diminishing the instability against the RuO6 tilt distortion
occurring within the bulk crystal. As a result, suppressed structural and
electronic surface phase transition temperatures are observed, including the
appearance of an inherent Mott metal-to-insulator transition for x = 0.1 and
possible modifications of the surface quantum critical point near xc ~ 0.5.
