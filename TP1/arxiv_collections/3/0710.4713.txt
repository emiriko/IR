A new approach for enhancing the process-variation tolerance of digital
circuits is described. We extend recent advances in statistical timing analysis
into an optimization framework. Our objective is to reduce the performance
variance of a technology-mapped circuit where delays across elements are
represented by random variables which capture the manufacturing variations. We
introduce the notion of statistical critical paths, which account for both
means and variances of performance variation. An optimization engine is used to
size gates with a goal of reducing the timing variance along the statistical
critical paths. We apply a pair of nested statistical analysis methods
deploying a slower more accurate approach for tracking statistical critical
paths and a fast engine for evaluation of gate size assignments. We derive a
new approximation for the max operation on random variables which is deployed
for the faster inner engine. Circuit optimization is carried out using a
gain-based algorithm that terminates when constraints are satisfied or no
further improvements can be made. We show optimization results that demonstrate
an average of 72% reduction in performance variation at the expense of average
20% increase in design area.
