We develop a detailed microscopic theory describing dc Josephson effect and
Andreev bound states in superconducting junctions with a half-metal. In such
systems the supercurrent is caused by triplet pairing states emerging due to
spin-flip scattering at the interfaces between superconducting electrodes and
the half-metal. For sufficiently clean metals we provide a detailed
non-perturbative description of the Josephson current at arbitrary
transmissions and spin-flip scattering parameters for both interfaces. Our
analysis demonstrates that the behavior of both the Josephson current and
Andreev bound states crucially depends on the strength of spin-flip scattering
showing a rich variety of features which can be tested in future experiments.
