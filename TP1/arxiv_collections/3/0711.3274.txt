Over the last decade the successful design and fabrication of complex MEMS
(MicroElectroMechanical Systems), optical circuits and ASICs have been
demonstrated. Packaging and integration processes have lagged behind MEMS
research but are rapidly maturing. As packaging processes evolve, a new
challenge presents itself, microsystem product development. Product development
entails the maturation of the design and all the processes needed to
successfully produce a product. Elements such as tooling design, fixtures,
gages, testers, inspection, work instructions, process planning, etc., are
often overlooked as MEMS engineers concentrate on design, fabrication and
packaging processes. Thorough, up-front planning of product development efforts
is crucial to the success of any project.
