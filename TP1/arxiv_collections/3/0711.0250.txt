The far-zone flux of energy contains hereditary (tail) contributions that
depend on the entire past history of the source. Using the multipolar
post-Minkowskian wave generation formalism, we propose and implement a
semi-analytical method in the frequency domain to compute these contributions
from the inspiral phase of a binary system of compact objects moving in
quasi-elliptical orbits up to 3PN order. The method explicitly uses the
quasi-Keplerian representation of elliptical orbits at 1PN order and exploits
the doubly periodic nature of the motion to average the 3PN fluxes over the
binary's orbit. Together with the instantaneous (non-tail) contributions
evaluated in a companion paper, it provides crucial inputs for the construction
of ready-to-use templates for compact binaries moving on quasi-elliptic orbits,
an interesting class of sources for the ground based gravitational wave
detectors such as LIGO and Virgo as well as space based detectors like LISA.
