We define a notion of coupling time with ambiguities for interacting particle
systems, and show how this can be used to prove ergodicity and to bound the
convergence time to equilibrium and the decay of correlations at equilibrium. A
motivation is to provide simple conditions which ensure that perturbed particle
systems share some properties of the underlying unperturbed system. We apply
these results to context-dependent substitution models recently introduced by
molecular biologists as descriptions of DNA evolution processes. These models
take into account the influence of the neighboring bases on the substitution
probabilities at a site of the DNA sequence, as opposed to most usual
substitution models which assume that sites evolve independently of each other.
