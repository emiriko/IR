We have calculated the 1+ and 3+, T=0 states in 14N and 10B. In a
neutron-proton RPA model these two nuclei are described by the same set of
equations. We first show that a bare Minnesota interaction leads to too weak
binding in bothnuclei. Furthermore it does not produce a 3+ ground state in 10B
as it should. Including medium effects as an exchange of phonons between the
neutron-proton pair cures the desagreement in 14N but still gives a 1+ ground
state in 10B with the 3+ as an excited state. The same study with a Gogny
effective interaction reproduces nicely the properties of both nuclei: same
agreement in 14N as previously when medium effeccts were introduced but now the
3+ in 10B becomes the ground state. This success suggests that through its
density dependent term the Gogny interaction takes account of the presence of a
three-body force which, in a shell model calculation, has been shown to be
essential to give a 3+ ground state in 10B.
