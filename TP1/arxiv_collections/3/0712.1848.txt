We study a two-dimensional family of probability measures on infinite
Gelfand-Tsetlin schemes induced by a distinguished family of extreme characters
of the infinite-dimensional unitary group. These measures are unitary group
analogs of the well-known Plancherel measures for symmetric groups. We show
that any measure from our family defines a determinantal point process, and we
prove that in appropriate scaling limits, such processes converge to two
different extensions of the discrete sine process as well as to the extended
Airy and Pearcey processes.
