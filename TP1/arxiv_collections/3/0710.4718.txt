A technique for evaluating noise figure suitable for BIST implementation is
described. It is based on a low cost single-bit digitizer, which allows the
simultaneous evaluation of noise figure in several test points of the analog
circuit. The method is also able to benefit from SoC resources, like memory and
processing power. Theoretical background and experimental results are presented
in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.
