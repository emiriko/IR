We introduce a new formalism of differential operators for a general
associative algebra A. It replaces Grothendieck's notion of differential
operator on a commutative algebra in such a way that derivations of the
commutative algebra are replaced by DDer(A), the bimodule of double
derivations. Our differential operators act not on the algebra A itself but
rather on F(A), a certain `Fock space' associated to any noncommutative algebra
A in a functorial way. The corresponding algebra D(F(A)), of differential
operators, is filtered and gr D(F(A)), the associated graded algebra, is
commutative in some `twisted' sense. The resulting double Poisson structure on
gr D(F(A)) is closely related to the one introduced by Van den Bergh.
Specifically, we prove that gr D(F(A))=F(T_A(DDer(A)), provided A is smooth.
  It is crucial for our construction that the Fock space F(A) carries an
extra-structure of a wheelgebra, a new notion closely related to the notion of
a wheeled PROP. There are also notions of Lie wheelgebras, and so on. In that
language, D(F(A)) becomes the universal enveloping wheelgebra of a Lie
wheelgebroid of double derivations.
  In the second part of the paper we show, extending a classical construction
of Koszul to the noncommutative setting, that any Ricci-flat, torsion-free
bimodule connection on DDer(A) gives rise to a second order (wheeled)
differential operator, a noncommutative analogue of the BV-operator.
