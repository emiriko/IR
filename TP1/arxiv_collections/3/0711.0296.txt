We show in this paper by using the Wang-Landau flat-histogram Monte Carlo
method that the phase transition in the XY stacked triangular antiferromagnet
is clearly of first-order, confirming results from latest Monte Carlo
simulation and from a nonperturbative renormalization group, putting an end to
a long-standing controversial issue.
