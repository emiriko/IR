This article is a survey on the braid groups, the Artin groups, and the
Garside groups. It is a presentation, accessible to non-experts, of various
topological and algebraic aspects of these groups. It is also a report on three
points of the theory: the faithful linear representations, the cohomology, and
the geometrical representations.
