Let \theta be an involution of the semisimple Lie algebra g and g=k+p be the
associated Cartan decomposition. The nilpotent commuting variety of (g,\theta)
consists in pairs of nilpotent elements (x,y) of p such that [x,y]=0. It is
conjectured that this variety is equidimensional and that its irreducible
components are indexed by the orbits of p-distinguished elements. This
conjecture was established by A. Premet in the case (g \times g, \theta) where
\theta(x,y)=(y,x). In this work we prove the conjecture in a significant number
of other cases.
