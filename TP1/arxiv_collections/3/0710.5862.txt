It is introduced inertial anti-gravitational potential into the theory of
gravity to stop gravitational collapse at the nuclear density and thus prevent
singularities. It is considered effective gravity which includes Newtonian
potential and inertial anti-gravitational potential. It is investigated
footprints of the effective gravity in the solar system. The inertial
anti-gravitational potential of the sun allows to explain the anomalous
acceleration of Pioneer 10 and 11, the anomalous increase in the lunar
semi-major axis, the residuals of the seasonal variation of the proper angular
velocity of the earth, the anomalous increase of the Astronomical Unit, the
anomalous shift of the perihelion of mercury.
