I present measurements of the W boson charge asymmetry and the W boson width
G_W using 350 pb-1 of CDF Run II data. The charge asymmetry is the first direct
measurement, which uses a new technique to reconstruct the W rapidity by
constraining its mass; the result will further constrain Parton Distribution
Functions in future fits. The width measurement relies on a fit to the W
transverse mass distribution. We measure G_W = 2032 +/- 71 MeV which is in good
agreement with the Standard Model prediction.
