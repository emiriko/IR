Facilitated or kinetically constrained spin models (KCSM) are a class of
interacting particle systems reversible w.r.t. to a simple product measure.
Each dynamical variable (spin) is re-sampled from its equilibrium distribution
only if the surrounding configuration fulfills a simple local constraint which
\emph{does not involve} the chosen variable itself. Such simple models are
quite popular in the glass community since they display some of the peculiar
features of glassy dynamics, in particular they can undergo a dynamical arrest
reminiscent of the liquid/glass transitiom. Due to the fact that the jumps
rates of the Markov process can be zero, the whole analysis of the long time
behavior becomes quite delicate and, until recently, KCSM have escaped a
rigorous analysis with the notable exception of the East model. In these notes
we will mainly review several recent mathematical results which, besides being
applicable to a wide class of KCSM, have contributed to settle some debated
questions arising in numerical simulations made by physicists. We will also
provide some interesting new extensions. In particular we will show how to deal
with interacting models reversible w.r.t. to a high temperature Gibbs measure
and we will provide a detailed analysis of the so called one spin facilitated
model on a general connected graph.
