In part 1 of this series compact integral representations had been obtained
for the one-loop photon-graviton amplitude involving a charged spin 0 or spin
1/2 particle in the loop and an arbitrary constant electromagnetic field. In
this sequel, we study the structure and magnitude of the various polarization
components of this amplitude on-shell. Explicit expressions are obtained for a
number of limiting cases.
