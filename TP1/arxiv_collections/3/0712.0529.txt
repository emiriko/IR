We review our recent study of the role played by the chiral interactions
induced by instantons, in the lowest-lying sector of the light hadron spectrum.
We discuss how the ordering of the lowest meson and baryon excitations is
explained by the structure of the instanton-induced quark-quark and gluon-gluon
interaction. We focus on the pion, nucleon, vector- and axial-vector mesons,
and on the scalar glueball. We find that all these hadrons are bound in this
model and have realistic masses.
