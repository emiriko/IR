By making use of the concept of natural time, a simple model is proposed
which exhibits the $1/f^a$ behavior with $a$ close to unity. The properties of
the model are compared to those of the Seismic Electric Signals (SES)
activities that have been found to obey the ubiquitous $1/f^a$ behavior with $a
\approx 1$. This comparison, which is made by using the most recent SES data,
reveals certain similarities, but the following important difference is found:
The model suggests that the entropy $S_-$ under time reversal becomes larger
compared to the entropy $S$ in forward time, thus disagreeing with the
experimental SES results which show that $S$ may be either smaller or larger
than $S_-$. This might be due to the fact that SES activities exhibit {\em
critical} dynamics, while the model cannot capture all the characteristics of
such dynamics.
