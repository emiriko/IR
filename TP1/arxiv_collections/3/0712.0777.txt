The angular distribution in photon-jet production in p \bar{p} -> \gamma jet
X is studied within a generalized factorization scheme taking into account the
transverse momentum of the partons in the initial hadrons. Within this scheme
an anomalously large cos(2\phi) asymmetry observed in the Drell-Yan process
could be attributed to the T-odd, spin and transverse momentum dependent parton
distribution function h_1^{\perp q}(x, p_{\perp}^2). This same function is
expected to produce a cos(2\phi) asymmetry in the photon-jet production cross
section. We give the expression for this particular azimuthal asymmetry, which
is estimated to be smaller than the Drell-Yan asymmetry but still of
considerable size for Tevatron kinematics. This offers a new possibility to
study T-odd effects at the Tevatron.
