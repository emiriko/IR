We present two generic classes of supersymmetric solutions of N=2, d=4
supergravity coupled to non-Abelian vector supermultiplets with a gauge group
that includes an SU(2) factor. The first class consists of embeddings of the 't
Hooft-Polyakov monopole and in the examples considered it has a fully regular,
asymptotically flat space-time metric without event horizons. The other class
of solutions consists of regular non-Abelian extreme black holes. There is a
covariant attractor at the horizon of these non-Abelian black holes.
