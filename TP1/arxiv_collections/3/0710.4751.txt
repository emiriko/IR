Safety-critical embedded systems having to meet real-time constraints are
expected to be highly predictable in order to guarantee at design time that
certain timing deadlines will always be met. This requirement usually prevents
designers from utilizing caches due to their highly dynamic, thus hardly
predictable behavior. The integration of scratchpad memories represents an
alternative approach which allows the system to benefit from a performance gain
comparable to that of caches while at the same time maintaining predictability.
In this work, we compare the impact of scratchpad memories and caches on worst
case execution time (WCET) analysis results. We show that caches, despite
requiring complex techniques, can have a negative impact on the predicted WCET,
while the estimated WCET for scratchpad memories scales with the achieved
Performance gain at no extra analysis cost.
