In this paper we calculate the universal relaxation times for electron and
nucleon fermionic gases. We argue that the universal relaxation time tau(i) is
equal tau(i)=h/m square v(i) where v(i)=alpha(i)c and alpha(1)=0.15 for nucleon
gas and alpha(2)=1/137 for electron gas, c=light velocity. With the universal
relaxation time we formulate the thermal Proca equation for fermionic gases.
  Key words: universal relaxation time, thermal universal Proca equation.
