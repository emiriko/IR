We study the effects of polarizable substrates such as SiO2 and SiC on the
carrier dynamics in graphene. We find that the quasiparticle spectrum acquires
a finite broadening due to the long-range interaction with the polar modes at
the interface between graphene and the substrate. This mechanism results in a
density dependent electrical resistivity, that exhibits a sharp increase around
room temperature, where it can become the dominant limiting factor of electron
transport. The effects are weaker in doped bilayer graphene, due to the more
conventional parabolic band dispersion.
