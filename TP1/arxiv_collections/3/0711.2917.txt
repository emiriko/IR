Wikipedia is a useful source of knowledge that has many applications in
language processing and knowledge representation. The Wikipedia category graph
can be compared with the class hierarchy in an ontology; it has some
characteristics in common as well as some differences. In this paper, we
present our approach for answering entity ranking queries from the Wikipedia.
In particular, we explore how to make use of Wikipedia categories to improve
entity ranking effectiveness. Our experiments show that using categories of
example entities works significantly better than using loosely defined target
categories.
