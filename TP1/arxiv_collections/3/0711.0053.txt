A subset of neutrino-induced upward through-going muons in the
Super-Kamiokande detector consists of high energy muons which lose energy
through radiative processes such as bremsstrahlung, e^{+} e^{-} pair production
and photonuclear interactions. These ``upward showering muons'' comprise an
event sample whose mean parent neutrino energy is approximately 1 TeV. We show
that the zenith angle distribution of upward showering muons is consistent with
negligible distortion due to neutrino oscillations, as expected of such a
high-energy neutrino sample. We present astronomical searches using these high
energy events, such as those from WIMP annihilations in the Sun, Earth and
Galactic Center, some suspected point sources, as well as searches for diffuse
flux from the interstellar medium.
