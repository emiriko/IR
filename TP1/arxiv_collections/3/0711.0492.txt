We present a comprehensive study of the low-field magnetoresistance in carbon
doped p-type GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures aiming at the investigation of
spin-orbit interaction effects. The following signatures of exceptionally
strong spin-orbit interactions are simultaneously observed: a beating in the
Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, a classical positive magnetoresistance due to
the presence of the two spin-split subbands, and a weak anti-localization dip
in the magnetoresistance. The spin-orbit induced splitting of the heavy hole
subband at the Fermi level is determined to be around 30% of the total Fermi
energy. The phase coherence length of holes of around 2.5 $\mu$m at a
temperature of 70 mK, extracted from weak anti-localization measurements, is
promissing for the fabrication of phase-coherent p-type nanodevices.
