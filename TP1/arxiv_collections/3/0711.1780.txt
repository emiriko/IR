Simultaneously, the vibrational nuclear dynamics and full dimensional
electronic dynamics of the deuterium molecular ion exposed to the linear
polarized intense laser field are studied. The time dependent Schr\"odinger
equation of the aligned D2+ with the electric laser field is solved for the
simulation of the complicated dissociative ionization processes and compared
with the recent related experimental results. In this work, the R-dependent
ionization rate and the enhanced ionization phenomenon beyond the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation (BOA) are introduced and calculated. The
substructure of the nuclear kinetic energy release spectra are revealed as the
Coulomb explosion energy spectra and dissociation energy spectra in the
dissociation-ionization channel. The significant and trace of these distinct
sub-spectra in the total spectra comparatively are displayed and discussed.
