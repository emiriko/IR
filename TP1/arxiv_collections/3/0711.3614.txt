The metamagnetic transitions in single-crystal ErNi$_2$B$_2$C have been
studied at 1.9 K with a Quantum Design torque magnetometer. The critical fields
of the transitions depend crucially on the angle between applied field and the
easy axis [100]. Torque measurements have been made while changing angular
direction of the magnetic field (parallel to basal tetragonal $ab$-planes) in a
wide angular range (more than two quadrants). Sequences of metamagnetic
transitions with increasing field are found to be different for the magnetic
field along (or close enough to) the easy [100] axis from that near the hard
[110] axis. The study have revealed new metamagnetic states in ErNi$_{2}$B$_2$C
which were not apparent in previous longitudinal-magnetization and neutron
studies.
