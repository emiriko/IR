It has been claimed that different types of causes must be considered in
biological systems, including top-down as well as same-level and bottom-up
causation, thus enabling the top levels to be causally efficacious in their own
right. To clarify this issue, important distinctions between information and
signs are introduced here and the concepts of information control and
functional equivalence classes in those systems are rigorously defined and used
to characterise when top down causation by feedback control happens, in a way
that is testable. The causally significant elements we consider are equivalence
classes of lower level processes, realised in biological systems through
different operations having the same outcome within the context of information
control and networks.
