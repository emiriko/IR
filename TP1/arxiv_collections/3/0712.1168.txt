Analytic expressions are given for the baryonic, electric and strangeness
chemical potentials which explicitly show the importance of various terms.
Simple scaling relations connecting these chemical potentials are found.
Applications to particle ratios and to fluctuations and related thermal
properties such as the isothermal compressibility kappaT are illustrated. A
possible divergence of kappaT is discussed.
