Crystallization and vapor condensation are considered as processes of
sequential entering of single atoms/molecules into condensate. The latent heat
can be carry away by radiation of characteristic frequencies generated in the
course of transition. The estimated dependences of latent (radiated) energy of
boiling on temperature confirm and prove the well-known empirical Trouton's
rule applicable to many simple substances. It leads to the estimation of
interrelation of critical parameters of corresponding substances. Experimental
results of the authors and other researchers concerning crystallization from
the melt of different substances (alkali halides, sapphire, tellurium, ice,
copper) are presented, as well as condensation of water vapor, the
correspondence to the offered model is established. It allows developing of the
spectroscopy of phase transitions, and can lead to control of crystallization
process, to crystallization stimulated by the characteristic radiation, etc.
Formation of clouds in our atmosphere should be accompanied by characteristic
radiation detectable for meteorological warnings.
