We calculate the doublet and quartet neutron-deuteron scattering lengths
using a nonlocal nucleon-nucleon interaction fully derived from quark-quark
interactions. We use as input the $NN$ $^1S_0$ and $^3S_1$-${}^3 D_1$ partial
waves. Our result for the quartet scattering length agrees well with the
experimental value while the result for the doublet scattering length does not.
However, if we take the result for the doublet scattering length together with
the one for the triton binding energy they agree well with the so-called
Phillips line.
