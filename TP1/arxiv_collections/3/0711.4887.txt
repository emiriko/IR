We investigate the evolution of cooperation on a non - growth network model
with death/birth dynamics. Nodes reproduce under selection for higher payoffs
in a prisoners dilemma game played between network neighbours. The mean field
characteristics of the model are explored and an attempt is made to understand
the size dependent behaviour of the model in terms of fluctuations in the
strategy densities. We also briefly comment on the role of strategy mutation in
regulating the strategy densties.
