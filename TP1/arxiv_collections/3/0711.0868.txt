We perform simulations of an effective theory of SU(2) Wilson lines in three
dimensions. We include a non-perturbative "fuzzy-bag" contribution which is
added to the one-loop perturbative potential for the Wilson line. We confirm
that, at moderately weak coupling, this leads to eigenvalue repulsion in a
finite region above the deconfining phase transition which shrinks in the
extreme weak-coupling limit. A non-trivial Z(N) symmetric vacuum arises in the
confined phase.
