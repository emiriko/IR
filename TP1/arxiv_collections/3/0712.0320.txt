We discuss experimental situations that consist of multiple preparation and
measurement stages. This leads us to a new approach to quantum mechanics. In
particular, we introduce the idea of multi-time quantum states which are the
appropriate tools for describing these experimental situations. We also
describe multi-time measurements and discuss their relation to multi-time
states. A consequence of our new formalism is to put states and operators on an
equal footing. Finally we discuss the implications of our new approach to
quantum mechanics for the problem of the flow of time.
