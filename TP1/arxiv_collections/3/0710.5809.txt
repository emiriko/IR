We study the properties of massless and massive quarks coupled with a scalar
and pseudoscalar boson at finite temperature in Yukawa models at the one-loop
order. The behavior of the spectral function and the pole structure of the
propagator are analyzed as functions of temperature $T$ and the quark mass
$m_f$. It is shown that the three-peak structure of the spectral function found
in a previous work for massless quarks is formed at temperatures comparable to
the boson mass even for finite $m_f$, but gradually ceases to exist as $m_f$
becomes larger. We identify the three poles of the quark propagator
corresponding to the collective excitations of the quark in the complex energy
plane. It is shown that the three trajectories made by the poles along with a
variation of $T$ undergo a structural rearrangement at a critical quark mass
when $m_f$ is increased. This suggests that the physics content of the
collective quark excitations is changed in a drastic way at this point. The
results are nicely accounted for with the notion of the level mixing induced by
a resonant scattering of the massive boson with quarks and holes of thermally
excited anti-quarks.
