A complete scheme for production and cooling a muon beam for three specified
muon colliders is presented. Parameters for these muon colliders are given. The
scheme starts with the front end of a proposed neutrino factory that yields
bunch trains of both muon signs. Emittance exchange cooling in slow helical
lattices reduces the longitudinal emittance until it becomes possible to merge
the trains into single bunches, one of each sign. Further cooling in all
dimensions is applied to the single bunches in further slow helical lattices.
Final transverse cooling to the required parameters is achieved in 50 T
solenoids using high Tc superconductor at 4 K. Preliminary simulations of each
element are presented.
