In this article, we develop an intuitive and efficient, numerical technique
to solve the quantum evolution equation of generic lattice-refined models in
loop quantum cosmology. As an application of this method, we extensively study
the solutions of the recently introduced, lattice-refined anisotropic model of
the Schwarzschild interior geometry. Our calculations suggest that the results
obtained from the approach are accurate, robust and are in complete agreement
with the expectations from the von Neumann stability analysis of the model.
