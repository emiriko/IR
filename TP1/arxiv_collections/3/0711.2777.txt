The Schroedinger operators on the Newtonian space-time are defined in a way
which make them independent on the class of inertial observers. In this picture
the Schroedinger operators act not on functions on the space-time but on
sections of certain one-dimensional complex vector bundle -- the Schroedinger
line bundle. This line bundle has trivializations indexed by inertial observers
and is associated with an U(1)-principal bundle with an analogous list of
trivializations -- the Schroedinger principal bundle. For the Schroedinger
principal bundle a natural differential calculus for `wave forms' is developed
that leads to a natural generalization of the concept of Laplace-Beltrami
operator associated with a pseudo-Riemannian metric. The free Schroedinger
operator turns out to be the Laplace-Beltrami operator associated with a
naturally distinguished invariant pseudo-Riemannian metric on the Schroedinger
principal bundle. The presented framework is proven to be strictly related to
the frame-independent formulation of analytical Newtonian mechanics and
Hamilton-Jacobi equations, that makes a bridge between the classical and
quantum theory.
