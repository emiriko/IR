We suggest kinetic models of dissipation for an ensemble of interacting
oriented particles, for example, moving magnetized particles. This is achieved
by introducing a double bracket dissipation in kinetic equations using an
oriented Poisson bracket, and employing the moment method to derive continuum
equations for magnetization and density evolution. We show how our continuum
equations generalize the Debye-Hueckel equations for attracting round
particles, and Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations for spin waves in magnetized
media. We also show formation of singular solutions that are clumps of aligned
particles (orientons) starting from random initial conditions. Finally, we
extend our theory to the dissipative motion of self-interacting curves.
