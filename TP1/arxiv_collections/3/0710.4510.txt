In this paper we prove that the sheaf of $\Lscr$-poly-differential operators
for a locally free Lie algebroid $\Lscr$ is formal when viewed as a sheaf of
$G_\infty$-algebras via Tamarkin's morphism of DG-operads $G_\infty\r
B_\infty$.
  In an appendix we prove a strengthening of Halbout's globalization result for
Tamarkin's local quasi-isomorphism.
