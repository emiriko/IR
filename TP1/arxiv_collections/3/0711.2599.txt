In \cite{LZ2} it is proved that for certain class of perturbations of the
hyperbolic equation $u_t=f(u) u_x$, there exist changes of coordinate, called
quasi-Miura transformations, that reduce the perturbed equations to the
unperturbed one. We prove in the present paper that if in addition the
perturbed equations possess Hamiltonian structures of certain type, the same
quasi-Miura transformations also reduce the Hamiltonian structures to their
leading terms. By applying this result, we obtain a criterion of the existence
of Hamiltonian structures for a class of scalar evolutionary PDEs and an
algorithm to find out the Hamiltonian structures.
