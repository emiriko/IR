The preparation of Ag 2+x Se thin films with thicknesses between 4 nm and
3000 nm by pulsed laser deposition on single crystalline NaCl and MgO
substrates is reported. The films are perfectly dense and show a good lateral
uniformity with a small number of defects. The microstructure of the films
corresponds to a nanoparquet, being composed of two different phases of silver
selenide. One phase is identified as the Naumannite low temperature phase of
silver selenide, the structure of the other phase has not been reported in
detail before and probably represents a metastable phase. Silver-rich films
contain silver precipitates with typical sizes on the nanoscale. Their presence
and their size appears to be responsible for the large and linear
magnetoresistance effect of silver-rich silver selenide.
