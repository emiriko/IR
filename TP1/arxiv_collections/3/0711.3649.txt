We study the modification of the far-field cross sections and the near-field
enhancement for gold and silver nanospheres illuminated by a tightly focused
beam. Using a multipole-expansion approach we obtain an analytical solution to
the scattering problem and provide insight on the effects of focusing on the
optical response. Large differences with respect to Mie theory are found
especially when the nanoparticle supports quadrupole or higher-order
resonances.
