We investigate the effects of possible decay of neutrinos from a neutrino
factory in a long baseline experiment. We consider the neutrinos from a factory
at CERN and the detector to be the 50 kTon iron calorimeter (ICAL) detector
proposed for India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO). We found considerable
depletion of muon yield at INO for certain value of decay parameters.
