The liquid-gas phase transition in hot neutron-rich nuclear matter is
investigated within a self-consistent thermal model using different
interactions with or without isospin and/or momentum dependence. The boundary
of the phase-coexistence region is shown to be sensitive to the density
dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy as well as the isospin and momentum
dependence of the nuclear interaction.
