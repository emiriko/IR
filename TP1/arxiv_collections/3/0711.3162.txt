The unoccupied electronic states of LaCoO$_3$ and PrCoO$_3$ are studied using
room temperature inverse photoemission spectroscopy and \emph{ab initio}
GGA+$\emph{U}$ band structure calculations. A fairly good agreement between
experiment and theory is obtained. The intensity of the peak just above the
Fermi-level is found to be very much sensitive to the hybridization of Co 3$d$
and O 2$p$ orbitals. Moreover, the band just above the Fermi-level is of Co
3$d$ character with little contribution from O 2$p$ states.
