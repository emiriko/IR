Assessing IC manufacturing process fluctuations and their impacts on IC
interconnect performance has become unavoidable for modern DSM designs.
However, the construction of parametric interconnect models is often hampered
by the rapid increase in computational cost and model complexity. In this paper
we present an efficient yet accurate parametric model order reduction algorithm
for addressing the variability of IC interconnect performance. The efficiency
of the approach lies in a novel combination of low-rank matrix approximation
and multi-parameter moment matching. The complexity of the proposed parametric
model order reduction is as low as that of a standard Krylov subspace method
when applied to a nominal system. Under the projection-based framework, our
algorithm also preserves the passivity of the resulting parametric models.
