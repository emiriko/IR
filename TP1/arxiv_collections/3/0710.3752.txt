We present results of the search for coincident burst excitations over a 24
hours long data set collected by AURIGA, EXPLORER, NAUTILUS and Virgo detectors
during September 2005. The search of candidate triggers was performed
independently on each of the data sets from single detectors. We looked for
two-fold time coincidences between these candidates using an algorithm
optimized for a given population of sources and we calculated the efficiency of
detection through injections of templated signal waveforms into the streams of
data. To this purpose we have considered the case of signals shaped as damped
sinusoids coming from the galactic center direction. In this framework our
method targets an optimal balance between high efficiency and low false alarm
rate, aiming at setting confidence intervals as stringent as possible in terms
of the rate of the selected source models.
