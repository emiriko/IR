We study the low-temperature transport properties of the systems of parallel
quantum dots described by the N-impurity Anderson model. We calculate the
quasiparticle scattering phase shifts, spectral functions and correlations as a
function of the gate voltage for N up to 5. For any N, the conductance at the
particle-hole symmetric point is unitary. For N >= 2, a transition from
ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic impurity spin correlations occurs at some
gate voltage. For N >= 3, there is an additional transition due to an abrupt
change in average impurity occupancy. For odd N, the conductance is
discontinuous through both quantum phase transitions, while for even N only the
magnetic transition affects the conductance. Similar effects should be
experimentally observable in the systems of quantum dots with ferromagnetic
conduction-band-mediated inter-dot exchange interactions.
