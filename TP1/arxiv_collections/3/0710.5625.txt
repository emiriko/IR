We present an approach, called the "Shadow Method," for the identification of
disease loci from dense genetic marker maps in complex, potentially incomplete
pedigrees. "Shadow" is a simple method based on an analysis of the patterns of
obligate meiotic recombination events in genotypic data. This method can be
applied to any high density marker map and was specifically designed to exploit
the fact that extremely dense marker maps are becoming more readily available.
We also describe how to interpret and associate meaningful P-Values to the
results. Shadow has significant advantages over traditional parametric linkage
analysis methods in that it can be readily applied even in cases in which the
topology of a pedigree or pedigrees can only be partially determined. In
addition, Shadow is robust to variability in a range of parameters and in
particular does not require prior knowledge of mode of inheritance, penetrance
or clinical misdiagnosis rate. Shadow can be used for any SNP data, but is
especially effective when applied to dense samplings. Our primary example uses
data from Affymetrix 100k SNPChip samples in which we illustrate our approach
by analyzing simulated data as well as genome-wide SNP data from two pedigrees
with inherited forms of kidney failure, one of which is compared with a typical
LOD score analysis.
