We investigate superconductor/insulator/ferromagnet/superconductor (SIFS)
tunnel Josephson junctions in the dirty limit, using the quasiclassical theory.
We formulate a quantitative model describing the oscillations of critical
current as a function of thickness of the ferromagnetic layer and use this
model to fit recent experimental data. We also calculate quantitatively the
density of states (DOS) in this type of junctions and compare DOS oscillations
with those of the critical current.
