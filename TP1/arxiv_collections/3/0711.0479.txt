We report a measurement of the spin-echo decay of a single electron spin
confined in a semiconductor quantum dot. When we tip the spin in the transverse
plane via a magnetic field burst, it dephases in 37 ns due to the Larmor
precession around a random effective field from the nuclear spins in the host
material. We reverse this dephasing to a large extent via a spin-echo pulse,
and find a spin-echo decay time of about 0.5 microseconds at 70 mT. These
results are in the range of theoretical predictions of the electron spin
coherence time governed by the dynamics of the electron-nuclear system.
