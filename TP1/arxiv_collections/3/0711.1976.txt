In this short comment to a recent contribution by E. Manousakis [1] it is
argued that the reported agreement between the measured time evolution of
conscious states during binocular rivalry and predictions derived from quantum
mechanical formalisms does not require any direct effect of QM. The recursive
consumption analysis process in the Ouroboros Model can yield the same
behavior.
