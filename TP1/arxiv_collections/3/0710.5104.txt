We develop an exact method for computing the Casimir energy between arbitrary
compact objects, both with boundary conditions for a scalar field and
dielectrics or perfect conductors for the electromagnetic field. The energy is
obtained as an interaction between multipoles, generated by quantum source or
current fluctuations. The objects' shape and composition enter only through
their scattering matrices. The result is exact when all multipoles are
included, and converges rapidly. A low frequency expansion yields the energy as
a series in the ratio of the objects' size to their separation. As examples, we
obtain this series for two spheres with Robin boundary conditions for a scalar
field and dielectric spheres for the electromagnetic field. The full
interaction at all separations is obtained for spheres with Robin boundary
conditions and for perfectly conducting spheres.
