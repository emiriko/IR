We explore production mechanism and final state interaction in the $pp \to
nK^ + \Sigma ^ +$ channel based on the inconsistent experimental data published
respectively by COSY-11 and COSY-ANKE. The scattering parameter $a> 0$ for
$n\Sigma ^ +$ interaction is favored by large near-threshold cross section
within a nonrelativistic parametrization investigation, and a strong $n\Sigma ^
+$ interaction comparable to $pp$ interaction is also indicated. Based on this
analysis we calculate the contribution from resonance $\Delta ^* (1920)$
through $\pi ^ +$ exchange within resonance model, and the numerical result
suggests a rather small near-threshold total cross section, which is consistent
with the COSY-ANKE data. With an additional sub-threshold resonance $\Delta
^*(1620)$, the model gives a much better description to the rather large
near-threshold total cross section published by COSY-11.
