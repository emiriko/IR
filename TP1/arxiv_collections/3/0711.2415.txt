Beisert et al. have identified an integrable SU(2,2) quantum spin chain which
gives the one-loop anomalous dimensions of certain operators in large N QCD. We
derive a set of nonlinear integral equations (NLIEs) for this model, and
compute the scattering matrix of the various (in particular, magnon)
excitations.
