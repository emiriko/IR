Recent productions of large numbers of cold antiprotons as well as the
formation of antihydrogens at CERN and Fermilab have raised basic questions
about possible coexistence of matter and antimatter in nature. In the present
work, previous mathematical considerations are revisited which support the
possible coexistence of Antihydrogen with Hydrogen, Deuterium and Tritium
atoms. In particular, the main objective of the present work is to present
computational treatments which confirm the possible formation of these quasi
molecules in laboratory. These treatments are based on a nonadiabatic picture
of the system in which generalized basis functions are adjusted within the
framework of Rayleigh-Ritz' variational method. Thus, it is ruled out in the
present work the Born-Oppenheimer adiabatic picture of the system, which
demands the existence of bound states composed of fixed quasi heavy atoms
(containing at least two baryons, e.g. protonium (Pn), with mean lifetime
1.0x10^^-6 s) and quasi light atoms (composed of two leptons, e.g. positronium
(Ps), with mean lifetime 125x10^^-12 s for para-Ps and 142.05x10^^-9 s for
ortho-Ps). Our calculations of the binding energies and internal structure of
Antihydrogen-Hydrogen, Antihydrogen-Deuterium and Antihydrogen-Tritium show
that these quasi molecules are bound and could be formed in nature. On the
other hand, having in mind the adiabatic picture of the systems, our results
suggest the possible formation of these molecules as resonant states in
Antihydrogen-Atom interaction. Nevertheless, several arguments are accumulated
in the conclusion as consequences of the proposed bound states.
