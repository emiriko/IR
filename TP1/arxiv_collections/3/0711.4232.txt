This reading is a continuation of the earlier reading Nyambuya (2008); where
three new Curved Spacetime Dirac Equations have been derived mainly to try and
account in a natural way for the observed anomalous gyromagnetic ratio of
fermions and the suggestions is that particles including the Electron, which is
thought to be a point particle, do have a finite spatial size and this is one
of the reasons for the observed anomalous gyromagnetic ratio. Combining the
idea in Nyambuya (2008) which lead to the derivation of the three new Curved
Spacetime Dirac Equations, and the proposed Unified Field Theory (Nyambuya
2007), a total of 12 equations each with 16 sub-components are generated thus
leading to a total of 192 equations for the Curved Spacetime Dirac Equation.
Some symmetries of these equations are investigated, i.e., the Lorentz
symmetry, charge conjugation symmetry (C), time reversal symmetry (T), Space
reversal (P) and a combination of the C, P and T - symmetries. It is shown that
these equations are Lorentz invariant, obey C-symmetry and that some violate T
and P-symmetry while others do not and that they all obey PT-symmetry. These
symmetries show (or modestly said -- seem to suggest) that anti-particles have
positive mass and energy but a negative rest-mass and the opposite sign in
electronic charge. Through the inspection of these symmetries, a suggestion is
(here) made to the effect that the rest-mass of a particle must be related to
the electronic charge of that particle thus leading us to a possible resolution
of whether or not Neutrinos do have a none-zero rest-mass. Additionally, we
demonstrate that these equations have the potency to explain naturally the
observed lepton generation phenomena.
