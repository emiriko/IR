We investigate the numerical approximation of (discontinuous) entropy
solutions to nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws posed on a Lorentzian
manifold. Our main result establishes the convergence of monotone and
first-order finite volume schemes for a large class of (space and time)
triangulations. The proof relies on a discrete version of entropy inequalities
and an entropy dissipation bound, which take into account the manifold geometry
accurately and generalize techniques and estimates that were known in the
(flat) Euclidian setting, only. The strong convergence of the scheme then is
then a consequence of the well-posed theory recently developed by Ben-Artzi and
LeFloch for conservation laws on manifolds.
