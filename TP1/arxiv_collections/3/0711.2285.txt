Precision determination of the CKM angle $\gamma/\phi_3$ depends upon
constraints on charm mixing amplitudes, measurements of doubly-Cabibbo
suppressed amplitudes and relative phases, and studies of charm Dalitz plots
tagged by flavor or CP eigenstates. In this note we describe the technique used
at CLEO-c to constrain the $K_{S,L}\pi\pi$ model uncertainty, and its impact on
$\gamma/\phi_3$ measurements at B-factories presented at the Charm 2007
Workshop.
