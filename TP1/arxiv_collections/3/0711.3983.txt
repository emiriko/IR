Classes of self-dual codes and dual-containing codes are constructed. The
codes are obtained within group rings and, using an isomorphism between group
rings and matrices, equivalent codes are obtained in matrix form. Distances and
other properties are derived by working within the group ring. Quantum codes
are constructed from the dual-containing codes.
