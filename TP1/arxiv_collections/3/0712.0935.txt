We study the effect of electron-phonon interaction on current and
zero-frequency shot noise in resonant tunneling through a series
triple-quantum-dot coupling to a local phonon mode by means of a
nonperturbative mapping technique along with the Green function formulation. By
fixing the energy difference between the first two quantum dots to be equal to
phonon frequency and sweeping the level of the third quantum dot, we find a
largely enhanced current spectrum due to phonon effect, and in particular we
predict current peaks corresponding to phonon-absorption and -emission assisted
resonant tunneling processes, which shows that this system can be acted as a
sensitive phonon-signal detector or as a cascade phonon generator.
