In this paper, we provide a rigorous analysis of preferential attachment with
fitness, a random graph model introduced by Bianconi and Barabasi. Depending on
the shape of the fitness distribution, we observe three distinct phases: a
first-mover-advantage phase, a fit-get-richer phase and an innovation-pays-off
phase.
