This is a response to the comment, arXiv:0709.4651. It is noted that while
the comment raises an extremely interesting and subtle point, the original
conclusion that theoretically consistent exceptions exist for the proposed
general bound for the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density, appears to
remain unaffected by the issue raised.
