We present preliminary results for the light harden spectrum in $N_f=2+1$
lattice QCD obtained with the nonperturbatively $O(a)$-improved Wilson quark
action and the Iwasaki gauge action. Simulations are carried out at
$\beta=1.90$ on a $32^3 \times 64$ lattice using the PACS-CS computer. We
employ L\"uscher's domain-decomposed HMC algorithm to reduce the up-down quark
masses toward the physical value. The pseudoscalar meson masses range from 730
MeV down to 210 MeV. We compare the light harden spectrum extrapolated to the
physical point with the experimental values.
