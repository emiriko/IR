Semigroups describing the time evolution of open quantum systems in finite
dimensional spaces have generators of a special form, known as Lindblad
generators. The simple generators, characterized by only one operator, are
analyzed. The complete set of all the stationary states is presented in detail,
including a formula to calculate a stationary state from the generating
operator. Also the opposite task can be fulfilled, to construct an evolution
leading to a prescribed stationary state.
