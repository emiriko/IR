We investigate a microscopical structure in a chain of cars waiting at a red
signal on signal-controlled crossroads. Presented is an one-dimensional
space-continuous thermodynamical model leading to an excellent agreement with
the data measured.Moreover, we demonstrate that an inter-vehicle spacing
distribution disclosed in relevant traffic data agrees with the thermal-balance
distribution of particles in the thermodynamical traffic gas (discussed in [1])
with a high inverse temperature (corresponding to a strong traffic congestion).
Therefore, as we affirm, such a system of stationary cars can be understood as
a specific state of the traffic sample operating inside a congested traffic
stream.
