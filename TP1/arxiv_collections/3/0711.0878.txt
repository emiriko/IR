We propose a scheme for nonlinearizing linear equations to generate
integrable nonlinear systems of both the AKNS and the KN classes, based on the
simple idea of dimensional analysis and detecting the building blocks of the
Lax pair. Along with the well known equations we discover a novel integrable
hierarchy of higher order nonholonomic deformations for the AKNS family, e.g.
for the KdV, the mKdV, the NLS and the SG equation, showing thus a two-fold
universality of the recently found deformation for the KdV equation.
