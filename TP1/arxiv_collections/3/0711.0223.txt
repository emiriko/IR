A recently introduced Importance Sampling strategy based on a least squares
optimization is applied to the Monte Carlo simulation of Libor Market Models.
Such Least Squares Importance Sampling (LSIS) allows the automatic optimization
of the sampling distribution within a trial class by means of a quick
presimulation algorithm of straightforward implementation. With several
numerical examples we show that LSIS can be extremely effective in reducing the
variance of Monte Carlo estimators often resulting, especially when combined
with stratified sampling, in computational speed-ups of orders of magnitude.
