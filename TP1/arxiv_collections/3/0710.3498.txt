We present the CDF results using 1.0 fb^{-1} of data on the mixing frequency
measurement in the B_s system and the lifetime measurements of several B
hadrons. We obtain \Delta m_s=17.77 +- 0.1 +- 0.07 ps^{-1} and
c\tau(\Lambda_b)=473.8 +- 23.1 +- 3.5 \mu m. The later one is more than 3 sigma
above the world average, but in reasonable agreement with HQE calculations.
