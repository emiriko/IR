We describe a efficient way to photoionize strontium atoms in a linear
radio-frequency trap. We use a 2-photon second order process to excite the
autoionization resonance (4d2 + 5p2) 1D2. A doubled pulsed Ti:Saphire laser
system is used at 431nm to provide 100fsec pulses at 82Mhz. The fabrication of
the laser systems for addressing the Sr+ transitions necessary for laser
cooling and excitation of quantum jumps, vacuum system and ion trap structure
are also described in detail. With the current setup a easy and repeatable
trapping of linear ion chains is achieved at UHV pressures.
