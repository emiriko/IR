We investigate experimentally transport through ring-shaped devices etched in
graphene and observe clear Aharonov-Bohm conductance oscillations. The
temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude indicates that below 1 K
the phase coherence length is comparable to or larger than the size of the
ring. An increase in the amplitude is observed at high magnetic field, when the
cyclotron diameter becomes comparable to the width of the arms of the ring. By
measuring the dependence on gate voltage, we also observe an unexpected linear
dependence of the oscillation amplitude on the ring conductance, which had not
been reported earlier in rings made using conventional metals or semiconducting
heterostructures.
