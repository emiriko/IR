Constituent quark models provide a reasonable description of the baryon mass
spectra. However, even in the light- and strange-flavor sectors several
intriguing shortcomings remain. Especially with regard to strong decays of
baryon resonances no consistent picture has so far emerged, and the existing
experimental data cannot be explained in a satisfactory manner. Recently first
covariant calculations with modern constituent quark models have become
available for all pi, eta, and K decay modes of the low-lying light and strange
baryons. They generally produced a remarkable underestimation of the
experimental data for partial decay widths. We summarize the main results and
discuss their impact on the classification of baryon resonances into flavor
multiplets. These findings are of particular relevance for future efforts in
the experimental investigation of baryon resonances.
