We compute the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to the
six most important event shape variables related to three-particle final states
in electron-positron annihilation. The corrections are sizeable for all
variables, however their magnitude is substantially different for different
observables. We observe that the NNLO corrections yield a considerably better
agreement between theory and experimental data both in shape and normalisation
of the event shape distributions. The renormalisation scale dependence of the
theoretical prediction is substantially reduced compared to the previously
existing NLO results. Our results will allow a precise determination of the
strong coupling constant from event shape data collected at LEP.
