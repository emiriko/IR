We give a brief summary of the unparticle scenario proposed by Georgi. The
CP-even phase of the propagator is exploited to study the CP-asymmetry in B+
--> tau+ + nu, which is neither experimentally searched for nor predicted by
any other model. Furthermore we show that the novel CP-violation is consistent
with the CPT theorem by identifying the CP-compensating mode in the unparticle
sector.
