We construct a Bell inequality from the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality
for two qubits that provides a stronger bound on the correlations of entangled
states than allowed by the CHSH inequality. The argument involved here can be
generalized to $n$ qubits. The inequalities obtained are violated by all the
generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states of multiqubits.
