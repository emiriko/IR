We examine the effect a spatially non-uniform spin current with a component
polarized partially out of the plane has on a low saturation magnetization
nanomagnet free layer. Micromagnetic simulations indicate that the spin torque
efficiency acting upon the reversing nanomagnet can be enhanced through this
process, resulting in faster switching with smaller currents. In doing so, we
determine that micromagnetic structure within the nanomagnets can be beneficial
for reversal processes. We verify this enhancement experimentally in devices
with a tapered nanopillar geometry that generates a spin current polarized
partly out of plane. Finally, to take even better advantage of these effects,
we examine micromagnetically the benefits of a tapered three-magnetic-layer
structure that further reduces reversal times while maintaining the thermal
stability of the free layer.
