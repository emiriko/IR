Harmonic emission from cluster nanoplasmas subject to short intense infrared
laser pulses is studied. In a previous publication [M. Kundu et al., Phys. Rev.
A 76, 033201 (2007)] we reported particle-in-cell simulation results showing
resonant enhancements of low-order harmonics when the Mie plasma frequency of
the ionizing and expanding cluster resonates with the respective harmonic
frequency. Simultaneously we found that high-order harmonics were barely
present in the spectrum, even at high intensities. The current paper is focused
on the analytical modeling of the process. We show that dynamical stochasticity
owing to nonlinear resonance inhibits the emission of high order harmonics.
