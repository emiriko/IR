We show how to implement cryptographic primitives based on the realistic
assumption that quantum storage of qubits is noisy. We thereby consider
individual-storage attacks, i.e. the dishonest party attempts to store each
incoming qubit separately. Our model is similar to the model of bounded-quantum
storage, however, we consider an explicit noise model inspired by present-day
technology. To illustrate the power of this new model, we show that a protocol
for oblivious transfer (OT) is secure for any amount of quantum-storage noise,
as long as honest players can perform perfect quantum operations. Our model
also allows the security of protocols that cope with noise in the operations of
the honest players and achieve more advanced tasks such as secure
identification.
