With the help of metadynamics it is possible to calculate efficiently the
free energy of systems displaying high energy barriers as a function of few
selected "collective variables". In doing this, the contribution of all the
other degrees of freedom ("microscopic" variables) is averaged out and, thus,
lost. In the following, it is shown that it is possible to calculate the
thermal average of these microscopic degrees of freedom during the
metadynamics, not loosing this piece of information.
