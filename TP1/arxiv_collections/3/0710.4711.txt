This paper presents a novel FPGA architecture for implementing various styles
of asynchronous logic. The main objective is to break the dependency between
the FPGA architecture dedicated to asynchronous logic and the logic style. The
innovative aspects of the architecture are described. Moreover the structure is
well suited to be rebuilt and adapted to fit with further asynchronous logic
evolutions thanks to the architecture genericity. A full-adder was implemented
in different styles of logic to show the architecture flexibility.
