We discuss quantum mechanical decay of color magnetic field generated
initially at high energy heavy ion collisions. It is caused by Nielsen-Olesen
unstable modes and is accomplished possibly in a period $<1$fm/c. We show that
the decay products, i.e. incoherent gluons may be thermalized in a sufficiently
short period ($< 1$fm/c). The precise determination of the period is made by
calculating two point function of the color magnetic field in a model of color
glass condensate.
