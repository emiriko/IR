Proving the quantum Hamming bound for degenerate nonbinary stabilizer codes
has been an open problem for a decade. In this note, I prove this bound for
double error-correcting degenerate stabilizer codes. Also, I compute the
maximum length of single and double error-correcting MDS stabilizer codes over
finite fields.
