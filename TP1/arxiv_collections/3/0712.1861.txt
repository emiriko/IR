The Standard Model for CP violation, the CKM model, works very well in
explaining all laboratory experimental data. However, this model does not
address the question that where it comes from. The origin of CP violation is
still a mystery. In this talk I discuss a model\cite{model} addressing this
problem in which the CP violating phase in the CKM matrix is identical to the
phase in the Higgs potential resulting from spontaneous CP violation.
