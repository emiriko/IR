Let $G$ be a unimodular Lie group, $X$ a compact manifold with boundary, and
$M$ be the total space of a principal bundle $G\to M\to X$ so that $M$ is also
a strongly pseudoconvex complex manifold. In this work, we show that if $G$
acts by holomorphic transformations in $M$, then the complex Laplacian
$\square$ on $M$ has the following properties: The kernel of $\square$
restricted to the forms $\Lambda^{p,q}$ with $q$ positive is a closed,
$G$-invariant subspace in $L^{2}(M,\Lambda^{p,q})$ of finite $G$-dimension.
Secondly, we show that if $q$ is positive, then the image of $\square$ contains
a closed, $G$-invariant subspace of finite codimension in
$L^{2}(M,\Lambda^{p,q})$. These two properties taken together amount to saying
that $\square$ is a $G$-Fredholm operator. The boundary Laplacian has similar
properties.
