Ignition delay times of cyclopentene-oxygen-argon mixtures were measured
behind reflected shock waves. Mixtures contained 0.5 or 1 % of hydrocarbons for
equivalence ratios ranging from 0.5 to 1.5. Reflected shock waves conditions
were: temperatures from 1300 to 1700 K and pressures from 7 to 9 atm. When
comparing to previous results obtained under similar conditions, it can be
observed that the reactivity of cyclopentene is much lower than that of
cyclohexene, but very close to that of cyclopentane. A kinetic mechanism
recently proposed for the combustion of cyclopentene in a flame has been used
to model these results and a satisfactory agreement has been obtained. The main
reaction pathways have been derived from flow rate, simulated temporal profiles
of products and sensitivity analyses.
