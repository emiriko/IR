We investigate classical anomalous electrical transport in a driven,
resistively and capacitively shunted Josephson junction device. Novel transport
phenomena are identified in chaotic regimes when the junction is subjected to
both, a time periodic (ac) and a constant, biasing (dc) current. The dependence
of the voltage across the junction on the dc-current exhibits a rich diversity
of anomalous transport characteristics: In particular, depending on the chosen
parameter regime we can identify so termed absolute negative conductance around
zero dc-bias, the occurrence of negative differential conductance and, after
crossing a zero conductance, the emergence of a negative nonlinear conductance
in the non-equilibrium response regime remote from zero dc-bias.
