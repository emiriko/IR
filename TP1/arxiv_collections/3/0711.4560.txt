We calculate the spin-transfer torque in Fe/MgO/Fe tunnel junctions and
compare the results to those for all-metallic junctions. We show that the
spin-transfer torque is interfacial in the ferromagnetic layer to a greater
degree than in all-metallic junctions. This result originates in the half
metallic behavior of Fe for the $\Delta_1$ states at the Brillouin zone center;
in contrast to all-metallic structures, dephasing does not play an important
role. We further show that it is possible to get a component of the torque that
is out of the plane of the magnetizations and that is linear in the bias.
However, observation of such a torque requires highly ideal samples. In samples
with typical interfacial roughness, the torque is similar to that in
all-metallic multilayers, although for different reasons.
