We derive the leptonic neutral current in the simplest little Higgs model and
compute the contribution of the model to the decay width $Z \to e^+e^-$. Using
the precision electroweak data we obtain a strong lower bound $f\geq 5.6$ TeV
at 95% C.L. on the characteristic energy scale of the model. It results in a
lower bound for the new gauge bosons $W^{\prime\pm}$ and $Z^{\prime}$ as being
$M_{W^{\prime\pm}}\geq 2.6$ TeV and $M_{Z^{\prime}}\geq 3.1$ TeV, respectively.
We also present the allowed values of the $k=f_1/f_2$ which is the parameter
relating the two vacuum expectation values of the scalar triplets in the model,
and the $\mu$ parameter of a quadratic term, involving the triplets, necessary
to provide an acceptable mass range for the standard Higgs boson.
