We study a model of strongly interacting spinless fermions on an anisotropic
triangular lattice. At half-filling and the limit of strong repulsive
nearest-neighbor interactions, the fermions align in stripes and form an
insulating state. When a particle is doped, it either follows a one-dimensional
free motion along the stripes or fractionalizes perpendicular to the stripes.
The two propagations yield a dimensional tuning of the electronic state. We
study the stability of this phase and derive an effective model to describe the
low-energy excitations. Spectral functions are presented which can be used to
experimentally detect signatures of the charge excitations.
