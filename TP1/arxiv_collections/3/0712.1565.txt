Cavity polaritons have been shown these last years to exhibit a rich variety
of non-linear behaviors which could be used in new polariton based devices.
Operation in the strong coupling regime under electrical injection remains a
key step toward a practical polariton device. We report here on the realization
of a polariton based light emitting diode using a GaAs microcavity with doped
Bragg mirrors. Both photocurrent and electroluminescence spectra are governed
by cavity polaritons up to 100 K.
