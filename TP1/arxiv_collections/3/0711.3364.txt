Grain is a data analysis framework developed to be used with the novel Total
Data Readout data acquisition system. In Total Data Readout all the electronics
channels are read out asynchronously in singles mode and each data item is
timestamped. Event building and analysis has to be done entirely in the
software post-processing the data stream. A flexible and efficient event parser
and the accompanying software framework have been written entirely in Java. The
design and implementation of the software are discussed along with experiences
gained in running real-life experiments.
