We investigated the time-dependent polarization switching behaviors of
(111)-preferred polycrystalline Pb(ZrxTi1-x)O3 thin films with various Zr
concentrations. We could explain all the polarization switching behaviors well
by assuming Lorentzian distributions in the logarithmic polarization switching
time [Refer to J. Y. Jo et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. (in press)]. Based on this
analysis, we found that the Zr ion-substitution for Ti ions would induce broad
distributions in the local field due to defect dipoles, which makes the
ferroelectric domain switching occur more easily.
