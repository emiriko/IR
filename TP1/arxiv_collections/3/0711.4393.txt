Fakhruddin has proved that for two lattice polygons P and Q any lattice point
in their Minkowski sum can be written as a sum of a lattice point in P and one
in Q, provided P is smooth and the normal fan of P is a subdivision of the
normal fan of Q. We give a shorter combinatorial proof of this fact that does
not need the smoothness assumption on P.
