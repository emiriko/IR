In the stories of Carnacki, created by the English writer William H. Hodgson
and written between 1910 and 1912, we find an interesting mixture of science
and fantasy. In spite of the fact that Carnacki is a ghost finder, who
investigates in an environment where supernatural is acting, we see the
character using technology and sometimes discussing of physics phenomena such
as X-rays. The Carnacki's stories can be seen as mirrors of the physics and
technology knowledge at the beginning of Twentieth Century, in the society
outside scientific circles.
