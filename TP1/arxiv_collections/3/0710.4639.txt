In signal integrity analysis, the joint effect of propagated noise through
library cells, and of the noise injected on a quiet net by neighboring
switching nets through coupling capacitances, must be considered in order to
accurately estimate the overall noise impact on design functionality and
performances. In this work the impact of the cell non-linearity on the noise
glitch waveform is analyzed in detail, and a new macromodel that allows to
accurately and efficiently modeling the non-linear effects of the victim driver
in noise analysis is presented. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, and confirm that existing noise analysis
approaches based on linear superposition of the propagated and
crosstalk-injected noise can be highly inaccurate, thus impairing the sign-off
functional verification phase.
