Revisiting the old problem of existence of interacting models of QFT with new
conceptual ideas and mathematical tools, one arrives at a novel view about the
nature of QFT. The recent success of algebraic methods in establishing the
existence of factorizing models suggests new directions for a more intrinsic
constructive approach beyond Lagrangian quantization. Holographic projection as
a simplifying tool for certain aspects of QFT turn out to be an indispensible
part of these new attempts.
