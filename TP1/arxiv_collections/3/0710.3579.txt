It is proved that a germ of a real analytic CR map from a smooth
real-analytic minimal CR manifold M to an essentially finite real-algebraic
generic submanifold M' of P^N of the same CR-dimension extends as a holomorphic
correspondence along M. Applications are given for pseudoconcave submanifolds
of P^N.
