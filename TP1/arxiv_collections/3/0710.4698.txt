Automated synthesis of monitors from high-level properties plays a
significant role in assertion-based verification. We present here a methodology
to synthesize assertion monitors from visual specifications given in CESC
(Clocked Event Sequence Chart). CESC is a visual language designed for
specifying system level interactions involving single and multiple clock
domains. It has well-defined graphical and textual syntax and formal semantics
based on synchronous language paradigm enabling formal analysis of
specifications. In this paper we provide an overview of CESC language with few
illustrative examples. The algorithm for automated synthesis of assertion
monitors from CESC specifications is described. A few examples from standard
bus protocols (OCP-IP and AMBA) are presented to demonstrate the application of
monitor synthesis algorithm.
