This paper gives an overview of a new technique, named pseudo-ring testing
(PRT). PRT can be applied for testing wide type of random access memories
(RAM): bit- or word-oriented and single- or dual-port RAM's. An essential
particularity of the proposed methodology is the emulation of a linear
automaton over Galois field by memory own components.
