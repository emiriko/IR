We analyze a possibility of using the two qubit output state from
Buzek-Hillery quantum copying machine (not necessarily universal quantum
cloning machine) as a teleportation channel. We show that there is a range of
values of the machine parameter $\xi$ for which the two qubit output state is
entangled and violates Bell-CHSH inequality and for a different range it
remains entangled but does not violate Bell-CHSH inequality. Further we observe
that for certain values of the machine parameter the two-qubit mixed state can
be used as a teleportation channel. The use of the output state from the
Buzek-Hillery cloning machine as a teleportation channel provides an additional
appeal to the cloning machine and motivation of our present work.
