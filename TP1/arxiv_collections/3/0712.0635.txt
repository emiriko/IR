Dilepton production in nucleus-nucleus collisions at 1-2 A GeV as well as in
elementary pp and pd reactions is studied within the microscopic HSD transport
approach which includes the off-shell dynamics of vector mesons explicitly. The
study addresses additionally the production of $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ mesons since
their Dalitz decays provide a sizeable contribution to the dilepton invariant
mass spectra up to about 0.5 GeV. Our transport results agree with the TAPS
experimental data on $\pi$ and $\eta$ multiplicities in C+C collisions from 0.8
to 2 A GeV. We find that the 'DLS-puzzle' - which addresses an underestimation
of the $e^+e^-$ yield in the mass range from 0.2 to 0.5 GeV in C+C and Ca+Ca
collisions - may be solved when incorporating a stronger bremsstrahlung
contribution in line with recent OBE calculations. Moreover, the HSD results
with 'enhanced' bremsstrahlung cross sections agree very well with the HADES
experimental data for the dilepton mass spectra for C+C at 1 and 2 A GeV,
especially when including a collisional broadening in the vector-meson spectral
functions. Detailed predictions for dilepton spectra from pp and pn/pd
reactions at 1.25 GeV, 2.2 GeV and 3.5 GeV are presented which will allow to
verify/falsify the larger bremsstrahlung contributions from the experimental
side in the near future.
