We show that the resonance-like structure found by the \emph{CELSIUS-WASA
Collaboration} in the two-photon invariant mass spectrum of the reaction $pp
\to pp \gamma \gamma$ is rather a signature of the $NN$-decoupled dibaryon
resonance $d^\star_1$(1956) that is produced in the radiative process $pp \to
\gamma d^\star_1$ and then undergoes radiative decay into two protons
$d^\star_1 \to pp \gamma$. It is found that a contribution of the dibaryon
mechanism $pp \to \gamma d^\star_1 \to pp \gamma \gamma$ of the reaction $pp
\to pp \gamma \gamma$ to the invariant mass spectrum of its photon pairs can
reasonably well reproduce the experimentally observed spectrum in the vicinity
of the resonance-like structure.
