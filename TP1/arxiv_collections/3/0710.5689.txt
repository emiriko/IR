Employing a twisted superspace with eight supercharges, we describe an
off-shell formulation of N=4 D=3 twisted super Yang-Mills in the continuum
spacetime which underlies the recent proposal of N=4 D=3 twisted super
Yang-Mills on a lattice (arXiv:0707.3533[hep-lat]). By a dimensional reduction
from the N=2 D=4, we explore the two possible topological twists of N=4 D=3 and
then show that the lattice formulation given in arXiv:0707.3533[hep-lat] is
essentially categorized as the B-type. We also show that, amongst the two
inequivalent twists of N=4 D=3, only the B-type SYM can be realized on the
lattice consistently with the Leibniz rule and the gauge covariance on the
lattice.
