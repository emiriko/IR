By assuming that a particle of energy hbar.omega is actually a dissipative
system maintained in a nonequilibrium steady state by a constant throughput of
energy (heat flow), the exact Schroedinger equation is derived, both for
conservative and nonconservative systems. Thereby, only universal properties of
oscillators and nonequilibrium thermostatting are used, such that a maximal
model independence of the hypothesised sub-quantum physics is guaranteed. It is
claimed that this represents the shortest derivation of the Schroedinger
equation from (modern) classical physics in the literature, and the only exact
one, too. Moreover, a "vacuum fluctuation theorem" is presented, with
particular emphasis on possible applications for a better understanding of
quantum mechanical nonlocal effects.
