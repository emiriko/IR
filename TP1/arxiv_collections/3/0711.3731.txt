We investigate aspects of the dynamics of a continuous atom-laser scheme
based on the merging of independently formed atomic condensates. Our
theoretical analysis covers the Markovian as well as the non-Markovian
operational regimes, and is based on a semiclassical (mean-field) two-mode
model. The role of the relative phase between the two condensates and the
effect of interatomic interactions on the evolution of the trapped populations
and the distribution of outcoupled atoms are discussed.
