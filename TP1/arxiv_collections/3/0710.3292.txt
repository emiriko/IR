We define a new version of sandpile model which is very similar to Abelian
Sandpile Model (ASM), but the height variables are continuous ones. With the
toppling rule we define in our model, we show that the model can be mapped to
ASM, so the general properties of the two models are identical. Yet the new
model allows us to investigate some problems such as effect of very small mass
on the height probabilities, different boundary conditions, etc.
