Inspired by the realignment or computable cross norm criterion, we present a
new result about the characterization of quantum entanglement. Precisely, an
interesting class of inequalities satisfied by all separable states of a
bipartite quantum system is derived. These inequalities induce new separability
criteria that generalize the realignment criterion.
