The present contribution reports the first systematic finite-nucleus
calculations performed using the Energy Density Functional method and a
non-empirical pairing functional derived from low-momentum interactions. As a
first step, the effects of Coulomb and the three-body force are omitted while
only the bare two-nucleon interaction at lowest order is considered. To cope
with the finite-range and non-locality of the bare nuclear interaction, the 1S0
channel of Vlowk is mapped onto a convenient operator form. For the first time,
neutron-neutron and proton-proton pairing correlations generated in finite
nuclei by the direct term of the two-nucleon interaction are characterized in a
systematic manner. Eventually, such predictions are compared to those obtained
from empirical local functionals derived from density-dependent zero range
interactions. The characteristics of the latter are analyzed in view of that
comparison and a specific modification of their isovector density dependence is
suggested to accommodate Coulomb effects and the isovector trend of neutron
gaps at the same time.
