In this article, we present an analytical direct method, based on a Numerov
three-point scheme, which is sixth order accurate and has a linear execution
time on the grid dimension, to solve the discrete one-dimensional Poisson
equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Our results should improve
numerical codes used mainly in self-consistent calculations in solid state
physics.
