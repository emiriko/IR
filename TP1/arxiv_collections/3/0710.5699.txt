Leptoquark-Higgs interactions induce mixing between leptoquark states with
different chiralities once the electro-weak symmetry is broken. In such LQ
models Majorana neutrino masses are generated at 1-loop order. Here we
calculate the neutrino mass matrix and explore the constraints on the parameter
space enforced by the assumption that LQ-loops explain current neutrino
oscillation data. LQs will be produced at the LHC, if their masses are at or
below the TeV scale. Since the fermionic decays of LQs are governed by the same
Yukawa couplings, which are responsible for the non-trivial neutrino mass
matrix, several decay branching ratios of LQ states can be predicted from
measured neutrino data. Especially interesting is that large lepton flavour
violating rates in muon and tau final states are expected. In addition, the
model predicts that, if kinematically possible, heavier LQs decay into lighter
ones plus either a standard model Higgs boson or a $Z^0/W^{\pm}$ gauge boson.
Thus, experiments at the LHC might be able to exclude the LQ mechanism as
explanation of neutrino data.
