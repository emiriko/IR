This article provides a convenient framework for quantitative evaluation of
the entanglement generated when two structureless, distinguishable particles
scatter non-relativistically in one dimension. It explores how three factors
determine the amount of entanglement generated: the momentum distributions of
the incoming particles, their masses, and the interaction potential. Two
important scales emerge, one set by the kinematics and one set by the dynamics.
This method also provides two approximate analytic formulas useful for
numerical evaluation of entanglement and reveals an interesting connection
between purity, linear coordinate transformations, and momentum uncertainties.
