Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a powerful tool in linear algebra.We
propose an extension of SVD for both the qualitative detection and quantitative
determination of nonlinearity in a time series. The paper illustrates nonlinear
SVD with the help of data generated from nonlinear maps and flows (differential
equations).
