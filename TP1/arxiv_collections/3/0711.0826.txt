Discrete systems with long-range interactions are considered. Continuous
medium models as continuous limit of discrete chain system are defined.
Long-range interactions of chain elements that give the fractional equations
for the medium model are discussed. The chain equations of motion with
long-range interaction are mapped into the continuum equation with the Riesz
fractional derivative. We formulate the consistent definition of continuous
limit for the systems with long-range interactions. In this paper, we consider
a wide class of long-range interactions that give fractional medium equations
in the continuous limit. The power-law interaction is a special case of this
class.
