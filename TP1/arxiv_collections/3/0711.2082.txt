We present an implementation of the steady state Keldysh approach in a
Green's function multiple scattering scheme to calculate the non-equilibrium
spin density. This density is used to obtain the spin transfer torque in
junctions showing the magnetoresistance effect. We use our implementation to
study the spin transfer torque in metallic Co/Cu/Co junctions.
