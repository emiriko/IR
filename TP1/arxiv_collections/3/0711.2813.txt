A compact correlation-function expansion is developed for nth order optical
susceptibilities in the frequency domain using the Keldysh-Schwinger loop. By
not keeping track of the relative time ordering of bra and ket interactions at
the two branches of the loop, the resulting expressions contain only n+1 basic
terms, compared to the 2n terms required for a fully time-ordered density
matrix description. Superoperator Green's function expressions for the nth
order suscpeptibility derived using both expansions reflect different types of
interferences between pathways .These are demonstrated for correlation-induced
resonances in four wave mixing signals.
