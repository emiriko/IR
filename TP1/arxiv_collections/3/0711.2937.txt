We use Density Functional Theory to study interacting spinless electrons on a
one-dimensional quantum ring in the density range where the system undergoes
Wigner crystallization. The Wigner transition leads to a drastic ``collective''
electron localization due to the Wigner crystal pinning, provided a weak
impurity potential is applied. To reveal this localization we examine a
persistent current in a ring penetrated by a magnetic flux. Using the DFT-OEP
method we calculated the current as a function of the interaction parameter
r_S. We find that in the limit of vanishing impurity potential the persistent
current stays constant up to a critical value of r_S^c=2.05 but shows a drastic
exponential decay for larger r_S which reflects a formation of a pinned Wigner
crystal. Above r_S^c the amplitude of the electron density oscillations exactly
follows the (r_S-r_S^c)^{1/2} behaviour, confirming a second-order phase
transition as expected in the mean-field-type OEP approximation.
