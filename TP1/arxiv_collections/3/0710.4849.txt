It is shown that the energy of protons accelerated in laser-matter
interaction experiments may be significantly increased through the process of
splitting the incoming laser pulse into multiple interaction stages of equal
intensity. From a thermodynamic point of view, the splitting procedure can be
viewed as an effective way of increasing the efficiency of energy transfer from
the laser light to protons, which peaks for processes having the least amount
of entropy gain. It is predicted that it should be possible to achieve $\apprge
100%$ increase in the energy efficiency in a six-stage laser proton accelerator
compared to a single laser-target interaction scheme.
