New solid-state physics based approach is developed for analysis of the
paraxial light propagation in two-dimensional (2D) photonic lattices of coupled
dielectric waveguides or microcavities. In particular, using Maxwell's
equations, a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian eigenproblem with respect to the spinor
wave function of a photon is obtained for energy-dissipating photonic
microstructures. The Hamiltonian is suitable for almost the entire subclass of
2D structures encompassing arrays of semiconductor microcavities and
microstructured photonic crystal fibers, characterized by light propagating
mostly normal to the periodic lattice plane. Methods of numerical solution are
discussed and the formalism is applied to a square array of coupled
semiconductor microcavities, revealing reach possibilities for tailoring
photonic band structure both in the photon energy and photon lifetime energy
broadening domains. In particular, a feasibility to open a double photonic
crystal band gap simultaneously in the energy and lifetime energy broadening
domains is demonstrated.
