Excitation functions were measured for the $^{55}$Mn(n,2n)$^{54}$Mn,
$^{55}$Mn(n,$\alpha$)$^{52}$V, $^{63}$Cu(n,$\alpha$)$^{60}$Co,
$^{65}$Cu(n,2n)$^{64}$Cu, and $^{65}$Cu(n,p)$^{65}$Ni reactions from 13.47 to
14.83 MeV. The experimental cross sections are compared with the results of
calculations including all activation channels for the stable isotopes of Mn
and Cu, for neutron incident energies up to 50 MeV. Within the energy range up
to 20 MeV the model calculations are most sensitive to the parameters related
to nuclei in the early stages of the reaction, while the model assumptions are
better established by analysis of the data in the energy range 20-40 MeV. While
the present analysis has taken advantage of both a new set of accurate measured
cross sections around 14 MeV and the larger data basis fortunately available
between 20 and 40 MeV for the Mn and Cu isotopes, the need of additional
measurements below as well as above 40 MeV is pointed out. Keywords: 55Mn,
