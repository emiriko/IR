Associated to any Coxeter system $(W,S)$, there is a labeled simplicial
complex $L$ and a contractible CW-complex $\Sigma_L$ (the Davis complex) on
which $W$ acts properly and cocompactly. $\Sigma_L$ admits a cellulation under
which the nerve of each vertex is $L$. It follows that if $L$ is a
triangulation of $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$, then $\Sigma_L$ is a contractible
$n$-manifold. In this case, the orbit space, $K_L:=\Sigma_L/W$, is a
\emph{Coxeter orbifold}. We prove a result analogous to the JSJ-decomposition
for 3-dimensional manifolds: Every 3-dimensional Coxeter orbifold splits along
Euclidean suborbifolds into the \emph{characteristic suborbifold} and simple
(hyperbolic) pieces. It follows that every 3-dimensional Coxeter orbifold has a
decomposition into pieces which have hyperbolic, Euclidean, or the geometry of
$\mathbb{H}^2\times\mathbb{R}$. (We leave out the case of spherical Coxeter
orbifolds.) A version of Singer's conjecture in dimension 3 follows: That the
reduced $\ell^2$-homology of $\Sigma_L$ vanishes.
