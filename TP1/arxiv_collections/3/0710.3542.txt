We present a study of the temperature and density dependence of the
resistivity of an extremely high quality two-dimensional hole system grown on
the (100) surface of GaAs. For high densities in the metallic regime ($p\agt 4
\times 10^{9}$ cm$^{-2}$), the nonmonotonic temperature dependence ($\sim
50-300$ mK) of the resistivity is consistent with temperature dependent
screening of residual impurities. At a fixed temperature of $T$= 50 mK, the
conductivity vs. density data indicates an inhomogeneity driven
percolation-type transition to an insulating state at a critical density of
$3.8\times 10^9$ cm$^{-2}$.
