Recently the strong demands in wireless communication requires expanding
development for the application of RF MEMS (Radio Frequency micro electro
mechanical systems) sensing devices such as micro-switches, tunable capacitors
because it offers lower power consumption, lower losses, higher linearity and
higher Q factors compared with conventional communications components. To
accelerate commercialisation of RF MEMS products, development for packaging
technologies is one of the most critical issues should be solved beforehand.
