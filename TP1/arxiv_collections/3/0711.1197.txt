We hypothesize possible new types of forces that would be the result of new
types of interactions, static and a slow transient, between objects with
related information contents (pattern). Such mechanism could make material
composition dependence claimed by Fishbach, et al in Eotvos type experiments
plausible. We carried out experiments by using a high-resolution scale with the
following memories: USB-2 flash drives (1-16GB), DVD and CD disks to determine
if such an interaction exist/detectable with a scale resolution of 10 microgram
with these test objects. We applied zero information, white noise and 1/f noise
type data. Writing or deleting the information in any of these devices causes
peculiar negative weight transients, up to milligrams (mass fraction around
10^-5), which is followed by various types of relaxation processes. These
relaxations have significantly different dynamics compared to transients
observed during cooling after stationary external heating. Interestingly, a
USB-1 MP3 player has also developed comparable transient mass loss during
playing music. A classical interpretation of the negative weight transients
could be absorbed water in hygroscopic components however comparison of
relaxation time constants with air humidity data does not support an obvious
explanation. Another classical interpretation with certain contribution is the
lifting Bernoulli force caused by the circulation due to convection of the warm
air. However, in this case all observed time constants with a device should
have been the same unless some hidden parameter causes the observed variations.
Further studies are warranted to clarify if there is indeed a new force, which
is showing up as negative mass at weight measurement when high-density
structural information is changed or read out (measured).
