We present a detailed analysis on nonstandard neutrino interactions (NSI)
with electrons including all muon and electron (anti)-neutrino data from
existing accelerators and reactors, in conjunction with the ``neutrino
counting'' data (e- e+ -> nu nu gamma) from the four LEP collaborations. First
we perform a one-parameter-at-a-time analysis, showing how most constraints
improve with respect to previous results reported in the literature. We also
present more robust results where the NSI parameters are allowed to vary freely
in the analysis. We show the importance of combining LEP data with the other
experiments in removing degeneracies in the global analysis constraining
flavor-conserving NSI parameters which, at 90 % and 95 % C.L., must lie within
unique allowed regions. Despite such improved constraints, there is still
substantial room for improvement, posing a big challenge for upcoming
experiments.
