An overview of the theory and phenomenology of hadrons and QCD is provided
from a Dyson-Schwinger equation viewpoint. Following a discussion of the
definition and realisation of light-quark confinement, the nonperturbative
nature of the running mass in QCD and inferences from the gap equation relating
to the radius of convergence for expansions of observables in the current-quark
mass are described. Some exact results for pseudoscalar mesons are also
highlighted, with details relating to the U_A(1) problem, and calculated masses
of the lightest J=0,1 states are discussed. Studies of nucleon properties are
recapitulated upon and illustrated: through a comparison of the ln-weighted
ratios of Pauli and Dirac form factors for the neutron and proton; and a
perspective on the contribution of quark orbital angular momentum to the spin
of a nucleon at rest. Comments on prospects for the future of the study of
quarks in hadrons and nuclei round out the contribution.
