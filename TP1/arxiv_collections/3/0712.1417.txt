The signs and values of the two-photon couplings $F_{M\gamma\gamma}$ of
mesons $(M)$ and their couplings $g_{MNN}$ to the nucleon as entering into the
$t$-channel parts of the difference of the electromagnetic polarizabilities
$(\alpha-\beta)$ and the backward angle spin polarizabilities $\gamma_\pi$ are
determined. The excellent agreement achieved with the experimental
polarizabilities of the proton makes it possible to make reliable predictions
for the neutron. The results obtained are $\alpha_n=13.4\pm 1.0$,
$\beta_n=1.8\mp 1.0$ ($10^{-4}$ fm$^3$), and $\gamma^{(n)}_\pi=57.6\pm 1.8$
($10^{-4}$ fm$^4$). New empirical information on the flavor wave functions of
the $f_0(980)$ and the $a_0(980)$ meson is obtained.
