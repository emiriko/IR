We present an approach for the analytical treatment of excitable systems with
noise-induced dynamics in the presence of time delay. An excitable system is
modeled as a bistable system with a time delay, while another delay enters as a
control term taken after [Pyragas 1992] as a difference between the current
system state and its state "tau" time units before. This approach combines the
elements of renewal theory to estimate the essential features of the resulting
stochastic process as functions of the parameters of the controlling term.
