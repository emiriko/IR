We have measured transport properties as a function of temperature and
pressure up to 30GPa in the NaxCoO2 system. For the x=0.5 sample the transition
temperature at 53K increases with pressure, while paradoxically the sample
passes from an insulating to a metallic ground state. A similar transition is
observed in the x=0.31 sample under pressure. Compression on the x=0.75 sample
transforms the sample from a metallic to an insulating state. We discuss our
results in terms of interactions between band structure effects and Na+ order.
