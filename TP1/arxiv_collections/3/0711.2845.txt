In a lattice formulation of SU(2)-gluodynamics, the spontaneous generation of
chromomagnetic fields at high temperature is investigated. A procedure to
determine this phenomenon is developed. By means of the $\chi^2$-analysis of
the data set accumulating $5-10\times 10^6$ Monte Carlo configurations, the
spontaneous creation of the Abelian color magnetic field is indicated. The
common generation of the magnetic field and $A_0$-condensate is also studied.
It is discovered that the field configuration consisting of the magnetized
vacuum and the $A_0$-condensate is stable.
