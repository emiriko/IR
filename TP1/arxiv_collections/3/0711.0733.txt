The Lepton Flavour Violating (LFV) processes $\mu \to e \gamma$ and $\tau \to
\mu \gamma$ are estimated in a model of electroweak-scale right-handed
neutrinos. The present bounds on the branching ratios, $B(\mu \to e \gamma)<
1.2 \times 10^{-11}$, $B(\tau \to \mu \gamma) < 6.8 \times 10^{-8}$ (BaBar) and
$< 4.5 \times 10^{-8}$ (Belle), puts strong constraints on the parameters of
the model. This constraint links low energy rare decay processes to high-energy
phenomena (e.g. decay lengths of the mirror charged leptons which are important
in the search for the telltale like-sign dilepton events present in the model
of electroweak-scale right-handed neutrinos).
