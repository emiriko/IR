We consider a clean two-dimensional interacting electron gas subject to a
random perpendicular magnetic field, h({\bf r}). The field is nonquantizing, in
the sense, that {\cal N}_h-a typical flux into the area \lambda_{\text{\tiny
F}}^2 in the units of the flux quantum (\lambda_{\text{\tiny F}} is the de
Broglie wavelength) is small, {\cal N}_h\ll 1. If the spacial scale, \xi, of
change of h({\bf r}) is much larger than \lambda_{\text{\tiny F}}, the
electrons move along semiclassical trajectories. We demonstrate that a weak
field-induced curving of the trajectories affects the interaction-induced
electron lifetime in a singular fashion: it gives rise to the correction to the
lifetime with a very sharp energy dependence. The correction persists within
the interval \omega \sim \omega_0= E_{\text{\tiny F}}{\cal N}_h^{2/3} much
smaller than the Fermi energy, E_{\text{\tiny F}}. It emerges in the third
order in the interaction strength; the underlying physics is that a small phase
volume \sim (\omega/E_{\text{\tiny F}})^{1/2} for scattering processes,
involving {\em two} electron-hole pairs, is suppressed by curving. Even more
surprising effect that we find is that {\em disorder-averaged} interaction
correction to the density of states, \delta\nu(\omega), exhibits {\em
oscillatory} behavior, periodic in \bigl(\omega/\omega_0\bigr)^{3/2}. In our
calculations of interaction corrections random field is incorporated via the
phases of the Green functions in the coordinate space. We discuss the relevance
of the new low-energy scale for realizations of a smooth random field in
composite fermions and in disordered phase of spin-fermion model of
ferromagnetic quantum criticality.
