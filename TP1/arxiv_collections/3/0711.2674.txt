IEEE 754r is the ongoing revision to the IEEE 754 floating point standard and
a major enhancement to the standard is the addition of decimal format.
Furthermore, in the recent years reversible logic has emerged as a promising
computing paradigm having its applications in low power CMOS, quantum
computing, nanotechnology, and optical computing. The major goal in reversible
logic is to minimize the number of reversible gates and garbage outputs. Thus,
this paper proposes the novel concept of partial reversible gates that will
satisfy the reversibility criteria for specific cases in BCD arithmetic. The
partial reversible gate is proposed to minimize the number of reversible gates
and garbage outputs, while designing the reversible BCD arithmetic circuits.
