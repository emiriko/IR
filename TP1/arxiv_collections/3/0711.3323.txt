As an alternative to the time-consuming solder pre-forms and pastes currently
used, a co-electroplating method of eutectic Au-Sn alloy was used in this
study. Using a co-electroplating process, it was possible to plate the Au-Sn
solder directly onto a wafer at or near the eutectic composition from a single
solution. Two distinct phases, Au5Sn and AuSn, were deposited at a composition
of 30at.%Sn. The Au-Sn flip-chip joints were formed at 300 and 400 degrees
without using any flux. In the case where the samples were reflowed at 300
degrees, only an (Au,Ni)3Sn2 IMC layer formed at the interface between the
Au-Sn solder and Ni UBM. On the other hand, two IMC layers, (Au,Ni)3Sn2 and
(Au,Ni)3Sn, were found at the interfaces of the samples reflowed at 400
degrees. As the reflow time increased, the thickness of the (Au,Ni)3Sn2 and
(Au,Ni)3Sn IMC layers formed at the interface increased and the eutectic
lamellae in the bulk solder coarsened.
