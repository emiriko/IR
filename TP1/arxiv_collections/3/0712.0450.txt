This note includes five sections. In section 2 a number of aesthetically
motivated f(R) Lagrangians is proposed and frivolously explored in the metric
formalism with variable Newton constant G(x). In section 3 the idea of
deforming the terms in a given f(R) gravity-matter action S, and prior to
extremizing it, is promoted with the aim of reducing S via an algebraic mixing
between few selected gravity and matter terms without invoking new fields. The
result of this is a number of constraint equations among the fields and often
eccentric looking field equations derived from the reduced action. Section 4
has a similar upshot as section 3 but the difference is the action term mixing
is carried out only after extremizing S and prior to any integration by part.
Section 5 pertains to G(x) ontology where various personal views on G(x)
gravity are expressed in the context of the Standard Model fermions (SMF). The
prospect of mitigating gravity field effects for the SMF is investigated at the
end via the variable speed of light (VSL) and new global Lorentz
transformations fusing two upper speeds: the light speed c and a proper maximal
speed given in the text assigned to all point mass mo and involving the Planck
mass. The new LT in combination with VSL also houses a family of special
noninertial frames in linear motions. The (spin sensitive) spacetime and
momentum dependent VSL is modeled via the Hamiltonian formalism with the aim of
canceling the effect of Newtonian gravity felt by a SMF test particle. I also
model variable G for yielding finite gravity at all distances, including zero.
Excising gravity from the SMF rank (via VSL plus G(x), or by gauging to zero
the SMF gravitational masses) has epic brunt on quantum gravity, local SUSY,
superstring models, leptoquarks (if any) and cosmology.
