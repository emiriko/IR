This thesis is concerned with the development and application of conformal
techniques to numerical calculations of asymptotically flat spacetimes. The
conformal compactification technique enables us to calculate spatially
unbounded domains, thereby avoiding the introduction of an artificial timelike
outer boundary. We construct in spherical symmetry an explicit scri-fixing
gauge, i.e. a conformal and a coordinate gauge in which the spatial coordinate
location of null infinity is independent of time so that no resolution loss in
the physical part of the conformal extension appears. Going beyond spherical
symmetry, we develop a method to include null infinity in the computational
domain. With this method, hyperboloidal initial value problems for the Einstein
equations can be solved in a scri-fixing general wave gauge. To study spatial
infinity, we discuss the conformal Gauss gauge and the reduced general
conformal field equations from a numerical point of view. This leads us to the
first numerical calculation of the entire Schwarzschild-Kruskal solution
including spatial, null and timelike infinity and the domain close to the
singularity. After developing a three dimensional, frame based evolution code
with smooth inner and outer boundaries we calculate a radiative axisymmetric
vacuum solution in a neighbourhood of spatial infinity represented as a
cylinder including a piece of null infinity. In this context, a certain
component of the rescaled Weyl tensor representing the radiation field is
calculated unambiguously with respect to an adapted tetrad at null infinity.
