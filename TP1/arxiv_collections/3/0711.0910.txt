Evidence is presented for the first time that the sharp and continuous
spectral changes observed in PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 (PZT) between 350 and 10 K with
the 647.1 nm wavelength are due to a resonance Raman effect. Such a phenomenon
can be explained by means of a self-trapped exciton emission oxygen deficient
complex (TiTi' - VO-) of PZT powder whose energy is close to the radiation line
of the laser. This kind of approach should also be very useful to distinguish
the phase transition sequence for other related ferro/ piezoelectric systems.
