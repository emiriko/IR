We consider self-avoiding walk, percolation and the Ising model with long and
finite range. By means of the lace expansion we prove mean-field behavior for
these models if $d>2(\alpha\wedge2)$ for self-avoiding walk and the Ising
model, and $d>3(\alpha\wedge2)$ for percolation, where $d$ denotes the
dimension and $\alpha$ the power-law decay exponent of the coupling function.
We provide a simplified analysis of the lace expansion based on the
trigonometric approach in Borgs et al. (2007)
