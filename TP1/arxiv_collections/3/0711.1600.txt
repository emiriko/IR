Charmonium is an attractive system for the application of lattice QCD
methods. While the sub-threshold spectrum has been considered in some detail in
previous works, it is only very recently that excited and higher-spin states
and further properties such as radiative transitions and two-photon decays have
come to be calculated. I report on this recent progress with reference to work
done at Jefferson Lab.
