We performed the first direct calculation of the probability of pionium
(pi+pi- atom) ionization in the target. The dependence of the probability of
pionium ionization in the target as a function of the pionium lifetime is
established. These calculations are of interest of the DIRAC experiment at
CERN, which aims to measure the pionium lifetime with high precision.
