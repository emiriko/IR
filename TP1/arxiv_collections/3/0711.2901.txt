We present the first measurement of the production cross section of a W boson
with a single charm quark (c) in p-pbar collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV, using
soft muon tagging of c jets. In a data sample of ~1.8 fb-1, recorded with the
CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron, we select events with W+1 or 2 jets.
We use the charge correlation between the W and the muon from the semileptonic
decay of a charm hadron to extract the Wc signal. We measure
sigma_{Wc}(p_{Tc}>20 GeV/c, |\eta_c|<1.5)\times BR(W->\ell\nu) = 9.8+/-3.2 pb,
in agreement with theoretical expectations.
