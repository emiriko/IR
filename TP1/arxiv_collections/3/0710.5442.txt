Hypoelliptic diffusion processes can be used to model a variety of phenomena
in applications ranging from molecular dynamics to audio signal analysis. We
study parameter estimation for such processes in situations where we observe
some components of the solution at discrete times. Since exact likelihoods for
the transition densities are typically not known, approximations are used that
are expected to work well in the limit of small inter-sample times $\Delta t$
and large total observation times $N\Delta t$. Hypoellipticity together with
partial observation leads to ill-conditioning requiring a judicious combination
of approximate likelihoods for the various parameters to be estimated. We
combine these in a deterministic scan Gibbs sampler alternating between missing
data in the unobserved solution components, and parameters. Numerical
experiments illustrate asymptotic consistency of the method when applied to
simulated data. The paper concludes with application of the Gibbs sampler to
molecular dynamics data.
