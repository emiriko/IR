We calculate the Kondo temperature ($T_K$) and crystal-field levels of
strongly correlated multiorbital systems solving the Anderson Impurity Model
with the finite U Non-Crossing Approximation (UNCA) in its simplest scheme,
that is, considering the self energies at lowest order in the 1/N diagrammatic
expansion. We introduced an approximation to the vertex function that includes
the double energy dependence and investigate its effect on the values of $T_K$
for simple electronic models. We also analyze the competition between the two
spin flip mechanisms, involving virtual transitions to empty and doubly
occupied states, in the determination of the ground state symmetry by including
an extra diagram of higher order in $1/N.$ We finally combine the resulting
simple formalism with {\it ab initio} calculated electronic structures to
obtain $T_K$'s, ground states, and crystal field splittings in excellent
agreement with experimental results for two particular Ce compounds, namely
CeIn$_3$ and CeSn$_3$.
