We present the results of our recent studies of a Thick Gaseous Electron
Multiplier (THGEM)-based detector, operated in Ar, Xe and Ar:Xe (95:5) at
various gas pressures. Avalanche-multiplication properties and energy
resolution were investigated with soft x-rays for different detector
configurations and parameters. Gains above 10E4 were reached in a double-THGEM
detector, at atmospheric pressure, in all gases, in almost all the tested
conditions; in Ar:Xe (95:5) similar gains were reached at pressures up to 2
bar. The energy resolution dependence on the gas, pressure, hole geometry and
electric fields was studied in detail, yielding in some configurations values
below 20% FWHM with 5.9 keV x-rays.
