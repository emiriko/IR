This paper describes a flexible logic BIST scheme that features high fault
coverage achieved by fault-simulation guided test point insertion, real
at-speed test capability for multi-clock designs without clock frequency
manipulation, and easy physical implementation due to the use of a low-speed SE
signal. Application results of this scheme to two widely used IP cores are also
reported.
