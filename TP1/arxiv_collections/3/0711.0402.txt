The effect of dipolar interactions among cylindrical nanodots, with a
vortex-core magnetic configuration, is analyzed by means of analytical
calculations. The cylinders are placed in a N x N square array in two
configurations - core oriented parallel to each other and with antiparallel
alignment between nearest neighbors. Results comprise the variation in the core
radius with the number of interacting dots, the distance between them and dot
height. The dipolar interdot coupling leads to a decrease (increase) of the
core radius for parallel (antiparallel) arrays.
