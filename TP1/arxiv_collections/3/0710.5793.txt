Let spt(n) denote the total number of appearances of smallest parts in the
partitions of n. Recently, Andrews showed how spt(n) is related to the second
rank moment, and proved some surprising Ramanujan-type congruences mod 5, 7 and
13. We prove a generalization of these congruences using known relations
between rank and crank moments. We obtain explicit Ramanujan-type congruences
for spt(n) mod p for p = 11, 17, 19, 29, 31 and 37. Recently, Bringmann and Ono
proved that Dyson's rank function has infinitely many Ramanujan-type
congruences. Their proof is non-constructive and utilizes the theory of weak
Maass forms. We construct two explicit nontrivial examples mod 11 using
elementary congruences between rank moments and half-integer weight Hecke
eigenforms.
