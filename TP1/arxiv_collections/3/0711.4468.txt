It was indicated [Yu 2007 Phys. Rev. A 75 066301] that a previous proposed
quantum secret sharing (QSS) protocol based on Smolin states [Augusiak 2006
Phys. Rev. A 73 012318] is insecure against an internal cheater. Here we build
a different QSS protocol with Smolin states alone, and prove it to be secure
against known cheating strategies. Thus we open a promising venue for building
secure QSS using merely Smolin states, which is a typical kind of bound
entangled states. We also propose a feasible scheme to implement the protocol
experimentally.
