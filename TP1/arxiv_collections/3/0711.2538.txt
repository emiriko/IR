We study the effect of confinement on diffusion limited bimolecular reactions
within a lattice model where a small number of reactants diffuse amongst a much
larger number of inert particles. When the number of inert particles is held
constant the rate of the reaction is slow for small reaction volumes due to
limited mobility from crowding, and for large reaction volumes due to the
reduced concentration of the reactants. The reaction rate proceeds fastest at
an intermediate confinement corresponding to volume fraction near 1/2 and 1/3
in two and three dimensions, respectively. We generalize the model to
off-lattice systems with hydrodynamic coupling and predict that the optimal
reaction rate for monodisperse colloidal systems occurs when the volume
fraction is ~0.18. Finally, we discuss the application of our model to
bimolecular reactions inside cells as well as the dynamics of confined
polymers.
