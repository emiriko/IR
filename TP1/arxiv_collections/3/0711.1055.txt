We define the class of "simple recursive games". A simple recursive game is
defined as a simple stochastic game (a notion due to Anne Condon), except that
we allow arbitrary real payoffs but disallow moves of chance. We study the
complexity of solving simple recursive games and obtain an almost-linear time
comparison-based algorithm for computing an equilibrium of such a game. The
existence of a linear time comparison-based algorithm remains an open problem.
