Two variable $\Lambda$ models, viz. $\Lambda \sim (\dot a/a)^2$ and $\Lambda
\sim \rho$ have been studied under the assumption that the equation of state
parameter $\omega$ is a function of time. The selected $\Lambda$ models are
found to be equivalent both in four and five dimensions. The possibility of
signature flip of the deceleration parameter is also shown.
