A description for regulatory genetic network based on generalized potential
energy is constructed. The potential energy is derived from the steady state
solution of linearized Fokker-Plank equation, and the result is shown to be
equivalent to the system of coupled oscillators. The correspondence between the
quantities from the mechanical picture and the steady-state fluctuations is
established. Explicit calculation is given for auto-regulatory networks in
which, the force constant associated with the degree of protein is very weak.
Negative feedback not only suppresses the fluctuations but also increases the
steepness of the potential. The results for the fluctuations agree completely
with those obtained from linear noise Fokker-Planck equation.
