We analyze the effect of flavor changing neutral currents within 331 models.
In particular, we concentrate in the so-called "economical" models, which have
a minimal scalar sector. Taking into account the experimental measurements of
observables related to neutral K and B meson mixing, we study the resulting
bounds for angles and phases in the mixing matrix for the down quark sector,
and the mass and mixing parameters related to the new Z' gauge boson.
