Let K be the Lie superalgebra of contact vector fields on the supersymmetric
line. We compute the action of K on the modules of differential and
pseudodifferential operators between spaces of tensor densities, in terms of
their conformal symbols. As applications we deduce the geometric subsymbols,
1-cohomology, and various uniserial subquotients of these modules. We also
outline the computation of the K-equivalences and symmetries of their
subquotients.
