We show that any finite set S in a characteristic zero integral domain can be
mapped to the finite field of order p, for infinitely many primes p, preserving
all algebraic incidences in S. This can be seen as a generalization of the
well-known Freiman isomorphism lemma, and we give several combinatorial
applications (such as sum-product estimates).
