We present a new analysis of J/psi production yields in deuteron-gold
collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV using data taken by the PHENIX experiment in
2003 and previously published in [S.S. Adler et al., Phys. Rev. Lett 96, 012304
(2006)]. The high statistics proton-proton J/psi data taken in 2005 is used to
improve the baseline measurement and thus construct updated cold nuclear matter
modification factors R_dAu. A suppression of J/psi in cold nuclear matter is
observed as one goes forward in rapidity (in the deuteron-going direction),
corresponding to a region more sensitive to initial state low-x gluons in the
gold nucleus. The measured nuclear modification factors are compared to
theoretical calculations of nuclear shadowing to which a J/psi (or precursor)
break-up cross-section is added. Breakup cross sections of sigma_breakup =
2.8^[+1.7_-1.4] (2.2^[+1.6_-1.5]) mb are obtained by fitting these calculations
to the data using two different models of nuclear shadowing. These breakup
cross section values are consistent within large uncertainties with the 4.2 +/-
0.5 mb determined at lower collision energies. Projecting this range of cold
nuclear matter effects to copper-copper and gold-gold collisions reveals that
the current constraints are not sufficient to firmly quantify the additional
hot nuclear matter effect.
