In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model squark mixing can significantly
change the pattern of charged-Higgs production. We find that non-minimal flavor
structures can have a sizeable impact on the charged-Higgs production cross
section, whereas charged-Higgs searches may be able to probe flavor structures
not accessible to rare kaon, bottom or charm experiments, and can invalidate
the assumption of minimal flavor violation.
