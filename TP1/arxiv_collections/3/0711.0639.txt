We study the temperature dependence of strain under constant magnetic-fields
in Ni-Mn based ferromagnetic Heusler alloys in the form Ni-Mn-$X$ ($X$: Ga, In,
Sn, Sb) which undergo a martensitic transformation. We discuss the influence of
the applied magnetic-field on the nucleation of ferromagnetic martensite and
extract information on the easy-axis of magnetization in the martensitic state.
