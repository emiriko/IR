In s-wave superconductors the Cooper pair wave function is isotropic in
momentum space. This property may also be expected for Cooper pairs entering a
normal metal from a superconductor due to the proximity effect. We show,
however, that such a deduction is incorrect and the pairing function in a
normal metal is surprisingly anisotropic because of quasiparticle interference.
We calculate angle resolved quasiparticle density of states in NS bilayers
which reflects such anisotropic shape of the pairing function. We also propose
a magneto-tunneling spectroscopy experiment which could confirm our
predictions.
