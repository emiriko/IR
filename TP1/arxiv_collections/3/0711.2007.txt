The Solar System Odyssey mission uses modern-day high-precision experimental
techniques to test the laws of fundamental physics which determine dynamics in
the solar system. It could lead to major discoveries by using demonstrated
technologies. The mission proposes to perform a set of precision gravitation
experiments from the vicinity of Earth to the outer Solar System. Its
scientific objectives can be summarized as follows: i) test of the gravity
force law in the Solar System up to and beyond the orbit of Saturn; ii) precise
investigation of navigation anomalies at the fly-bys; iii) measurement of
Eddington's parameter at occultations; iv) mapping of gravity field in the
outer solar system and study of the Kuiper belt. To this aim, the Odyssey
mission is built up on a main spacecraft, designed to fly up to 13 AU, with the
following components: a) a high-precision accelerometer, with bias-rejection
system, measuring the deviation of the trajectory from the geodesics; b)
Ka-band transponders, as for Cassini, for a precise range and Doppler
measurement up to 13 AU, with additional VLBI equipment; c) optional laser
equipment, which would allow one to improve the range and Doppler measurement.
In this baseline concept, the main spacecraft is designed to operate beyond the
Saturn orbit, up to 13 AU. It experiences multiple planetary fly-bys at Earth,
Mars or Venus, and Jupiter. The cruise and fly-by phases allow the mission to
achieve its baseline scientific objectives (i) to iii) in the above list). In
addition to this baseline concept, the Odyssey mission proposes the release of
the Enigma radio-beacon at Saturn, allowing one to extend the deep space
gravity test up to at least 50 AU, while achieving the scientific objective of
a mapping of gravity field in the outer Solar System.
