We show that the cycloidal magnetic order of a multiferroic can arise in the
absence of spin and lattice anisotropies, for e.g., in a cubic material, and
this explains the occurrence of such a state in CoCr$_2$O$_4$. We discuss the
case when this order coexists with ferromagnetism in a so called `conical
cycloid' state, and show that a direct transition to this state from the
ferromagnet is necessarily first order. On quite general grounds, the reversal
of the direction of the uniform magnetization in this state can lead to the
reversal of the electric polarization as well, without the need to invoke
`toroidal moment' as the order parameter.
