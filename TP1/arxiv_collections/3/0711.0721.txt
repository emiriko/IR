In quantum estimation theory and quantum tomography, the quantum state
obtained by sampling converges to the `true' unknown density matrix under
topologies that are different from the natural notion of distance in the space
of quantum states, i.e. the trace class norm. In this paper, we address such
problem, finding relations between the rates of convergence in the Schatten
$p$-norms and in the trace class norm.
