We study the rolling tachyon and the dissipative quantum mechanics using the
Thirring model with a boundary mass. We construct a boundary state for the
dissipative quantum system in one dimension, which describes the system at the
off-critical points as well as at the critical point. Then we extend the
Thirring model with a boundary mass in order to depict the time evolution of an
unstable D-branes with one direction wrapped on a circle of radius $R$, which
is termed the inhomogeneous rolling tachyon. The analysis based on the Thirring
model shows that the time dependent evolution of the inhomogeneous tachyon is
possible only when $\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}< R < 2$.
