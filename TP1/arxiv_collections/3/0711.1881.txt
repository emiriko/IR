We revisit the light-cone wave function representation for generalized parton
distributions with $\zeta\neq 0$. After translating the $t$-slope into a
$\Delta_\perp^2$-slope, the two-dimensional Fourier transform of GPDs is
interpreted as the transition matrix element as a function of the separation
between the active quark and the center of momentum of the spectators. In the
limit $x\to \zeta$ it is discussed how this information can be used to learn
about the dependence of the mean separation between the active quark and the
spectators on the momentum fraction carried by the active quark.
