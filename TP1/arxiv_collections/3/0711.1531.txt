We study the relation of Yangians and spinons in the SU(n) Haldane--Shastry
model. The representation theory of the Yangian is shown to be intimately
related to the fractional statistics of the spinons. We construct the spinon
Hilbert space from tensor products of the fundamental representations of the
Yangian.
