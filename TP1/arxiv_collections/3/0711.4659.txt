In a newly introduced time scale $\tau$, much smaller than the usual $t$, any
object is assumed to be a point-like particle, having a definite position. It
fluctuates without dynamics and the wave function $\Psi$ is defined by
averaging the square root of the density. In $t$-scale, the Schr$\ddot{\rm
o}$dinger equation holds and for a macrovariable just a classical path is
picked up as a peak of $\Psi$ by the stationary phase, which is the observable
signal. In the measuring process, the stationary phase branches into many but
one branch is selected by underlying determinism, leading to the correct
detection probability.
