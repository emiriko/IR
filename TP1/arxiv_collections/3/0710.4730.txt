Recent experimental data support the presence of quark coalescence in heavy
ion collisions at RHIC energies. Hadronization of quark matter and hadron
formation in heavy ion collisions can be described by the coalescence process,
and measured data are reproduced successfully. On the other hand, the
theoretical coalescence calculations are based on a non-relativistic
description. Here we investigate the robustness of the coalescence description,
using different wave-function overlap during hadron formation.
