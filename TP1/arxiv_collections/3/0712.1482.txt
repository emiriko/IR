We present a guided atom laser. A Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is created
in a crossed hybrid magnetic and an elongated optical trap, which acts as a
matterwave guide. Atoms are extracted from the BEC by radio frequency (rf)
outcoupling and then guided in the horizontal optical matterwave guide. This
method allows to control the acceleration of the beam and to achieve large de
Broglie wavelength. We also measure the longitudinal energy of the guided atom
laser using atom optical elements based on a blue light barrier.
