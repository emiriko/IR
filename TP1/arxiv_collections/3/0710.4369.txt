We describe a simple framework to assess the LISA scientific performance
(more specifically, its sensitivity and expected parameter-estimation precision
for prescribed gravitational-wave signals) under the assumption of failure of
one or two inter-spacecraft laser measurements (links) and of one to four
intra-spacecraft laser measurements. We apply the framework to the simple case
of measuring the LISA sensitivity to monochromatic circular binaries, and the
LISA parameter-estimation precision for the gravitational-wave polarization
angle of these systems. Compared to the six-link baseline configuration, the
five-link case is characterized by a small loss in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
in the high-frequency section of the LISA band; the four-link case shows a
reduction by a factor of sqrt(2) at low frequencies, and by up to ~2 at high
frequencies. The uncertainty in the estimate of polarization, as computed in
the Fisher-matrix formalism, also worsens when moving from six to five, and
then to four links: this can be explained by the reduced SNR available in those
configurations (except for observations shorter than three months, where five
and six links do better than four even with the same SNR). In addition, we
prove (for generic signals) that the SNR and Fisher matrix are invariant with
respect to the choice of a basis of TDI observables; rather, they depend only
on which inter-spacecraft and intra-spacecraft measurements are available.
