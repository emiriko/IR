In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{76}, 031202 (2007)], Schmidt has
proposed a Fundamental Measure Density Functional Theory for one-dimensional
nonadditive hard-rod fluid mixtures and has compared its predictions for the
bulk structural properties with Monte Carlo simulations. The aim of this Brief
Report is to recall that the problem admits an exact solution in the bulk,
which is briefly summarized in a self-contained way.
