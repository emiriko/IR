Shoutir Kishore Chatterjee was born in Ranchi, a small hill station in India,
on November 6, 1934. He received his B.Sc. in statistics from the Presidency
College, Calcutta, in 1954, and M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in statistics from the
University of Calcutta in 1956 and 1962, respectively. He was appointed a
lecturer in the Department of Statistics, University of Calcutta, in 1960 and
was a member of its faculty until his retirement as a professor in 1997.
Indeed, from the 1970s he steered the teaching and research activities of the
department for the next three decades. Professor Chatterjee was the National
Lecturer in Statistics (1985--1986) of the University Grants Commission, India,
the President of the Section of Statistics of the Indian Science Congress
(1989) and an Emeritus Scientist (1997--2000) of the Council of Scientific and
Industrial Research, India. Professor Chatterjee, affectionately known as SKC
to his students and admirers, is a truly exceptional person who embodies the
spirit of eternal India. He firmly believes that ``fulfillment in man's life
does not come from amassing a lot of money, after the threshold of what is
required for achieving a decent living is crossed. It does not come even from
peer recognition for intellectual achievements. Of course, one has to work and
toil a lot before one realizes these facts.''
