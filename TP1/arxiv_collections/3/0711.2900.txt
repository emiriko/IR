We report measured dipolar asymmetry ratios at the LIII edges of the heavy
rare earth metals. The results are compared with a first principles calculation
and excellent agreement is found. A simple model of the scattering is
developed, enabling us to re-interpret the resonant x-ray scattering in these
materials and to identify the peaks in the asymmetry ratios with features in
the spin and orbital moment densities.
