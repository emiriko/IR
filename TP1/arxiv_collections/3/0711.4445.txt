A two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate coupled by a high-frequency modulation
field is found to display rich features. An effective stationary Hamiltonian
approach reveals the emergence of additional degenerate eigenstates as well as
new topological structures of the spectrum. Possible applications, such as the
suppression of nonlinear Landau-Zener tunneling, are discussed. An interesting
phenomenon, which we call "deterministic symmetry-breaking trapping" associated
with separatrix crossing, is also found in an adiabatic process.
