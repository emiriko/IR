Weak scale supersymmetry provides elegant solutions to many of the problems
of the standard model, but it also generically gives rise to excessive flavor
and CP violation. We show that if the mechanism that suppresses the Yukawa
couplings also suppresses flavor changing interactions in the supersymmetry
breaking parameters, essentially all the low energy flavor and CP constraints
can be satisfied. The standard assumption of flavor universality in the
supersymmetry breaking sector is not necessary. We study signatures of this
framework at the LHC. The mass splitting among different generations of squarks
and sleptons can be much larger than in conventional scenarios, and even the
mass ordering can be changed. We find that there is a plausible scenario in
which the NLSP is a long-lived right-handed selectron or smuon decaying into
the LSP gravitino. This leads to the spectacular signature of monochromatic
electrons or muons in a stopper detector, providing strong evidence for the
framework.
