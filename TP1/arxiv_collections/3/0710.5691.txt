Stability of Yang-Mills fields system in the background field is investigated
basing on Toda criterion, Poincare sections and the values of the maximal
Lyapunov exponents. The existence of the region of regular motion at low
densities of energy is demonstrated. Critical energy density of the order-chaos
transition is analyzed for the different values of the model parameter.
