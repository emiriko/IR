We report a vapor-cell magneto-optical trapping of Hg isotopes on the
${}^1S_0-{}^3P_1$ intercombination transition. Six abundant isotopes, including
four bosons and two fermions, were trapped. Hg is the heaviest non-radioactive
atom trapped so far, which enables sensitive atomic searches for ``new
physics'' beyond the standard model. We propose an accurate optical lattice
clock based on Hg and evaluate its systematic accuracy to be better than
$10^{-18}$. Highly accurate and stable Hg-based clocks will provide a new
avenue for the research of optical lattice clocks and the time variation of the
fine-structure constant.
