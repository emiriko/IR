Searches for physics beyond the Standard Model are reported from
electron-proton collisions at a center of mass energy of 318 GeV. Results on a
completely model independent search for deviations from Standard Model
predictions at large transverse momenta are reported as well as generic
searches for contact interactions, leptoquarks and excited fermions from the H1
and ZEUS experiments.
