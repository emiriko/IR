Using both fractional derivatives, defined in the Riemann-Liouville and
Caputo senses, and classical derivatives of the integer order we examine
different numerical approaches to ordinary differential equations. Generally we
formulate some algorithms where four discrete forms of the Caputo derivative
and three different numerical techniques of solving ordinary differential
equations are proposed. We then illustrate how to introduce classical initial
conditions into equations where the Riemann-Liouville derivative is included.
