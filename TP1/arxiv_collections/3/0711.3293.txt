The purpose of this article is to present a simple solution of the classic
dog-and-rabbit chase problem which emphasizes the use of concepts of elementary
kinematics and, therefore, can be used in introductory mechanics course. The
article is based on the teaching experience of introductory mechanics course at
Novosibirsk State University for first year physics students which are just
beginning to use advanced mathematical methods in physics problems. We hope it
will be also useful for students and teachers at other universities too.
