Complex applications implemented as Systems on Chip (SoCs) demand extensive
use of system level modeling and validation. Their implementation gathers a
large number of complex IP cores and advanced interconnection schemes, such as
hierarchical bus architectures or networks on chip (NoCs). Modeling
applications involves capturing its computation and communication
characteristics. Previously proposed communication weighted models (CWM)
consider only the application communication aspects. This work proposes a
communication dependence and computation model (CDCM) that can simultaneously
consider both aspects of an application. It presents a solution to the problem
of mapping applications on regular NoCs while considering execution time and
energy consumption. The use of CDCM is shown to provide estimated average
reductions of 40% in execution time, and 20% in energy consumption, for current
technologies.
