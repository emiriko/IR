High resolution magnetoresistance data in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite
thin samples manifest non-homogenous superconductivity with critical
temperature $T_c \sim 25 $K. These data exhibit: i) hysteretic loops of
resistance versus magnetic field similar to Josephson-coupled grains, ii)
quantum Andreev's resonances and iii) absence of the Schubnikov-de Haas
oscillations. The results indicate that graphite is a system with
non-percolative superconducting domains immersed in a semiconducting-like
matrix. As possible origin of the superconductivity in graphite we discuss
interior-gap superconductivity when two very different electronic masses are
present.
