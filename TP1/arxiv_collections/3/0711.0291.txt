Diffraction gratings have been proposed as core optical elements in future
laser-interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. In this paper we derive
equations for the coupling between alignment noise and phase noise at
diffraction gratings. In comparison to a standard reflective component (mirror
or beam splitter) the diffractive nature of the gratings causes an additional
coupling of geometry changes into alignment and phase noise. Expressions for
the change in angle and optical path length of each outgoing beam are provided
as functions of a translation or rotation of the incoming beam with respect to
the grating. The analysis is based entirely on the grating equation and the
geometry of the setup. We further analyse exemplary optical setups which have
been proposed for the use in future gravitational wave detectors. We find that
the use of diffraction gratings yields a strong coupling of alignment noise
into phase noise. By comparing the results with the specifications of current
detectors we show that this additional noise coupling results in new,
challenging requirements for the suspension and isolation systems for the
optical components.
