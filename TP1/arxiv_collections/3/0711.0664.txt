In this work we relate the well-known no-go theorem that two non-orthogonal
(mixed) quantum states cannot be perfectly discriminated, to the general
principle in physics, the no-signalling condition. In fact, we derive the
minimum error in discrimination between two quantum states, using the
no-signalling condition.
