An exact and general expression for the analytic wavelet transform of a
real-valued signal is constructed, resolving the time-dependent effects of
non-negligible amplitude and frequency modulation. The analytic signal is first
locally represented as a modulated oscillation, demodulated by its own
instantaneous frequency, and then Taylor-expanded at each point in time. The
terms in this expansion, called the instantaneous modulation functions, are
time-varying functions which quantify, at increasingly higher orders, the local
departures of the signal from a uniform sinusoidal oscillation. Closed-form
expressions for these functions are found in terms of Bell polynomials and
derivatives of the signal's instantaneous frequency and bandwidth. The analytic
wavelet transform is shown to depend upon the interaction between the signal's
instantaneous modulation functions and frequency-domain derivatives of the
wavelet, inducing a hierarchy of departures of the transform away from a
perfect representation of the signal. The form of these deviation terms
suggests a set of conditions for matching the wavelet properties to suit the
variability of the signal, in which case our expressions simplify considerably.
One may then quantify the time-varying bias associated with signal estimation
via wavelet ridge analysis, and choose wavelets to minimize this bias.
