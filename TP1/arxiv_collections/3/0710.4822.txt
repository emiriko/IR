Recently, photon subtracted Gaussian states (PSGSs) were generated by several
experimental groups. Those states were called "Schr\"odinger kittens" due to
their similarities to superpositions of coherent states (SCSs) with small
amplitudes. We compare the ideal SCSs and the PSGSs for experimental tests of
certain types of Bell inequalities. In particular, we analyze the effects of
the key experimental components used to generate PSGSs: mixedness of the
Gaussian states, limited transmittivity of the beam splitter and the avalanche
photodetector which cannot resolve photon numbers. As a result of this
analysis, the degrees of mixedness and the beam splitter transmittivity that
can be allowed for successful tests of Bell inequalities are revealed.
