Graph states are generalized from qubits to collections of $n$ qudits of
arbitrary dimension $D$, and simple graphical methods are used to construct
both additive and nonadditive quantum error correcting codes. Codes of distance
2 saturating the quantum Singleton bound for arbitrarily large $n$ and $D$ are
constructed using simple graphs, except when $n$ is odd and $D$ is even.
Computer searches have produced a number of codes with distances 3 and 4, some
previously known and some new. The concept of a stabilizer is extended to
general $D$, and shown to provide a dual representation of an additive graph
code.
