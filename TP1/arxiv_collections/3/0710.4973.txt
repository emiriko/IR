We observe a sequence of the anchoring transitions in nematic liquid crystals
(NLC) sandwiched between the hydrophobic polyimide substrates treated with the
plasma beam. There is a pronounced continuous transition from homeotropic to
low tilted (nearly planar) alignment with the easy axis parallel to the
incidence plane of the plasma beam (the zenithal transition) that takes place
as the exposure dose increases. In NLC with positive dielectric anisotropy, a
further increase in the exposure dose results in in-plane reorientation of the
easy axis by 90 degrees (the azimuthal transition). This transition occurs
through the two-fold degenerated alignment characteristic for the second order
anchoring transitions. In contrast to critical behavior of anchoring, the
contact angle of NLC and water on the treated substrates monotonically declines
with the exposure dose. It follows that the surface concentration of
hydrophobic chains decreases continuously. The anchoring transitions under
consideration are qualitatively interpreted by using a simple phenomenological
model of competing easy axes which is studied by analyzing anchoring diagrams
of the generalized polar and non-polar anchoring models.
