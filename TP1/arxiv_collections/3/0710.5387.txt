In this paper, we present a new cosmological model using fractal manifold. We
prove that a space defined by this kind of manifold is an expanding space. This
model provides us with consistent arguments pertaining to the relationship
between variation of geometry and movement of matter. This study leads to the
existence of new fundamental principles. A clear picture is then portrayed
about the expansion of the universe represented by fractal manifold.
