The effects of low carrier density and carrier compensation on mixed-state
thermal transport are investigated beyond the quasiclassical approximation. It
is shown that, contrary to the usual observations, the interplay of the two
effects leads to an {\it increase} in the thermal conductivity immediately
below the upper critical field $H_{c2}$. Our result can account for the
anomalous behavior of the mixed-state thermal conductivity near $H_{c2}$
recently observed in URu$_2$Si$_2$.
