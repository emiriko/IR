We report on the results of a search for standard model Higgs bosons produced
in association with W bosons from p-pbar collisions at root s = 1.96 TeV. The
search uses a data sample corresponding to approximately 1 fb-1 of integrated
luminosity. Events consistent with the W to l-nu and H to b-bbar signature are
selected by triggering on a high-pT electron or muon candidate and tagging one
or two of the jet candidates as having originated from b quarks. A neural
network filter rejects a fraction of tagged charm and light flavor jets,
increasing the b-jet purity in the sample and thereby reducing the background
to Higgs boson production. We observe no excess l-nu-b-bbar production beyond
the background expectation, and we set 95% confidence level upper limits on the
production cross section times branching fraction sigma(p-pbar to WH) times
Br(H to b-bbar) ranging from 3.9 to 1.3 pb, for specific Higgs boson mass
hypotheses in the range 110 to 150 GeV/c2, respectively.
