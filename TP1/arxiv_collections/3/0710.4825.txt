The importance of embedded systems in driving innovation in automotive
applications continues to grow. Understanding the specific needs of developers
targeting this market is also helping to drive innovation in RISC core design.
This paper describes how a RISC instruction set architecture has evolved to
better meet those needs, and the key implementation features in two very
different RISC cores are used to demonstrate the challenges of designing for
real-time automotive systems.
