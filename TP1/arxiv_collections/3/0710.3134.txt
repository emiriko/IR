In this paper we consider the effects of the interaction between droplets or
other deformable objects in an emulsion under random stirring of the host
fluid. Our main interest is to obtain autocorrelation functions of the shape
fluctuations in such randomly stirred host fluids, beyond the dilute limit
regime. Thus, a system of deformable objects immersed in a host liquid that is
randomly stirred is considered, where the objects interact with each other via
the host liquid. Keeping expressions in the first order in the density of
objects and in deviation of objects shapes from spherical, the shape of each
object is expanded in spherical harmonic modes and the correlations of these
modes are derived. The special case of objects that are governed by surface
tension is investigated. The interaction between objects is explicitly
formulated and the deformation correlations are obtained.
