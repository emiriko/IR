We have performed exhaustive multicanonical Monte Carlo simulations of three
12-residue synthetic peptides in order to investigate the thermodynamic and
structural properties as well as the characteristic helix-coil transitions. In
these studies, we employ a realistic model where the interactions between all
atoms are taken into account. Effects of solvation are also simulated by using
an implicit solvent model.
