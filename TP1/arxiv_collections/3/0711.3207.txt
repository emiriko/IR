We report a search for R-parity violating production and decay of sneutrino
particles in the e+mu final state with 1.04+-0.06 fb-1 of data collected with
the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider in 2002--2006. Good agreement
between the data and the standard model prediction is observed. With no
evidence for new physics, we set limits on the R-parity violating couplings
$\lambda^{\prime}_{311}$ and $\lambda_{312}$ as a function of sneutrino mass.
