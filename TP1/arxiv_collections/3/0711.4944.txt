PURPOSE: We have conducted experiments with an innovatively designed robot
endoscope holder for laparoscopic surgery that is small and low cost. MATERIALS
AND METHODS: A compact light endoscope robot (LER) that is placed on the
patient's skin and can be used with the patient in the lateral or dorsal supine
position was tested on cadavers and laboratory pigs in order to allow
successive modifications. The current control system is based on voice
recognition. The range of vision is 360 degrees with an angle of 160 degrees .
Twenty-three procedures were performed. RESULTS: The tests made it possible to
advance the prototype on a variety of aspects, including reliability,
steadiness, ergonomics, and dimensions. The ease of installation of the robot,
which takes only 5 minutes, and the easy handling made it possible for 21 of
the 23 procedures to be performed without an assistant. CONCLUSION: The LER is
a camera holder guided by the surgeon's voice that can eliminate the need for
an assistant during laparoscopic surgery. The ease of installation and
manufacture should make it an effective and inexpensive system for use on
patients in the lateral and dorsal supine positions. Randomized clinical trials
will soon validate a new version of this robot prior to marketing.
