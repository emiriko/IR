In this paper, we consider the classification of irreducible ${\bf
  Z}$- and ${\bf Z}^2$-graded modules with finite dimensional homogeneous
subspaces over the Virasoro-like algebra. We first prove that such a module is
a uniformly bounded module or a generalized highest weight module. Then we
determine all generalized highest weight irreducible modules. As a consequence,
we also determine all the modules with nonzero center. Finally, we prove that
there does not exist any nontrivial ${\bf Z}$-graded modules of intermediate
series.
