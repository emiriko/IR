In this work we compute the Stokes matrices of the ordinary differential
equation satisfied by the hypergeometric integrals associated to an arrangement
of hyperplanes in generic position. This generalizes the computation done by
Ramis and Duval for confluent hypergeometric functions, which correspond to the
arrangement of two points on the line. The proof is based on an explicit
description of a base of canonical solutions as integrals on the cones of the
arrangement, and combinatorial relations between integrals on cones and on
domains.
