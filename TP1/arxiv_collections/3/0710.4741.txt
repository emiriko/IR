Harmonic and transient eddy currents in a liquid metal positioned above an
excitation coil are determined by measuring the voltage drop in a simple
potential probe. The resulting spatio-temporal eddy current field is compared
with the corresponding analytical expressions for a conducting half-space.
Further, a deformation of the eddy current distribution due to a non-conducting
torus immersed into the liquid metal is measured and compared with numerical
results. The method can be generalized to arbitrary geometries, and might help
to validate numerical models for non-destructive testing and magnetic
inductance tomography.
