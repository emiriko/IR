The Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the Kagom\'{e} lattice is studied in the
framework of Schwinger-boson mean-field theory. Two solutions with different
symmetries are presented. One solution gives a conventional quantum state with
$\mathbf{q}=0$ order for all spin values. Another gives a gapped spin liquid
state for spin $S=1/2$ and a mixed state with both $\mathbf{q}=0$ and
$\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ orders for spin $S>1/2$. We emphasize that the mixed
state exhibits two sets of peaks in the static spin structure factor. And for
the case of spin $S=1/2$, the gap value we obtained is consistent with the
previous numerical calculations by other means. We also discuss the
thermodynamic quantities such as the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility
at low temperatures and show that our result is in a good agreement with the
Mermin-Wagner theorem.
