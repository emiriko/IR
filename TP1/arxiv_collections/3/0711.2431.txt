The ALICE experiment at LHC will detect and identify prompt photons and light
neutral-mesons with the PHOS detector and the additional EMCal electromagnetic
calorimeter. Charged particles will be detected and identified by the central
tracking system. In this article, the possibility of studying the interaction
of jets with the nuclear medium, using prompt photons as a tool to tag jets, is
investigated by simulations. New methods to identify prompt photon-jet events
and to distinguish them from the jet-jet background are presented.
