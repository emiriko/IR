We generate spatially multimode twin beams using 4-wave mixing in a hot
atomic vapor in a phase-insensitive traveling-wave amplifier configuration. The
far-field coherence area measured at 3.5 MHz is shown to be much smaller than
the angular bandwidth of the process and bright twin images with independently
quantum-correlated sub-areas can be generated with little distortion. The
available transverse degrees of freedom form a high-dimensional Hilbert space
which we use to produce quantum-correlated twin beams with finite orbital
angular momentum.
