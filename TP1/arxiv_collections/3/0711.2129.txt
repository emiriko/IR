It is shown that strongly correlated electrons on frustrated lattices like
pyrochlore, checkerboard or kagome lattice can lead to the appearance of closed
and open strings. They are resulting from nonlocal subsidiary conditions which
propagating strongly correlated electrons require. The dynamics of the strings
is discussed and a number of their properties are pointed out. Some of them are
reminiscent of particle physics.
