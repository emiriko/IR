We propose a method that enables efficient storage and retrieval of a
photonic excitation stored in an ensemble quantum memory consisting of
Lambda-type absorbers with non-zero Stokes shift. We show that this can be used
to implement a multimode quantum memory storing multiple frequency-encoded
qubits in a single ensemble, and allowing their selective retrieval. The
read-out scheme applies to memory setups based on both
electromagnetically-induced transparency and stimulated Raman scattering, and
spatially separates the output signal field from the control fields.
