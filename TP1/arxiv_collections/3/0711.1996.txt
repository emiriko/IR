We present a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker quantum cosmological model in the
presence of Chaplygin gas and perfect fluid for early and late time epoches. In
this work, we consider perfect fluid as an effective potential and apply
Schutz's variational formalism to the Chaplygin gas which recovers the notion
of time. These give rise to Schr\"odinger-Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the scale
factor. We use the eigenfunctions in order to construct wave packets and study
the time dependent behavior of the expectation value of the scale factor using
the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. We show that contrary to
the classical case, the expectation value of the scale factor avoids
singularity at quantum level. Moreover, this model predicts that the expansion
of Universe is accelerating for the late times.
