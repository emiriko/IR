We have calculated the leading Yukawa corrections to the chargino, neutralino
and gluino pole masses in the DR-bar scheme in the Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model (MSSM) with the full set of complex parameters. We have
performed a numerical analysis for a particular point in the parameter space
and found typical corrections of a few tenths of a percent thus exceeding the
experimental resolution as expected at the ILC. We provide a computer program
which calculates two-loop pole masses for SUSY fermions with complex parameters
up to the respective order in pertubation theory.
