A new class of models based on hysteresis functions is developed to describe
atomic force microscopes operating in dynamic mode. Such models are able to
account for dissipative phenomena in the tip-sample interaction which are
peculiar of this operation mode. The model analysis, which can be pursued using
frequency domain techniques, provides a clear insight of specific nonlinear
behaviours. Experiments show good agreement with the identified models.
