Static program analysis by abstract interpretation is an efficient method to
determine properties of embedded software. One example is value analysis, which
determines the values stored in the processor registers. Its results are used
as input to more advanced analyses, which ultimately yield information about
the stack usage and the timing behavior of embedded software.
