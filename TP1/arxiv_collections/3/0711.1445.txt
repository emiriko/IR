We discuss how the surface gravity can be classically defined for dynamical
black holes. In particular we focus on defining the surface gravity for locally
defined horizons and compare a number definitions proposed in the literature.
We illustrate the differences between the various proposals in the case of an
arbitrary dynamical, spherically symmetric black hole spacetime. We also
discuss how the trapping horizon formalism of Hayward can be related to other
constructions.
