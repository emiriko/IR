By introducing a mass asymmetry in a non-Borromean three-body system, without
changing the energy relations, the virtual state pole cannot move from the
negative real axis of the complex energy plane (with nonzero width) and become
a resonance, because the analytical structure of the unitarity cuts remains the
same.
