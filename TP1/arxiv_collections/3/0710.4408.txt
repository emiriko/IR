We propose a scheme for the generation of a two-mode field squeezed state in
cavity QED. It is based on two-channel Raman excitations of a beam of
three-level atoms with random arrival times by two classical fields and two
high-Q resonator modes. It is shown that by suitably choosing the intensities
and detunings of fields the dynamical processes can be selective and two-mode
squeezing between the cavity modes can be generated at steady state. This
proposal does not need the preparation of the initial states of atoms and
cavity modes, and is robust against atomic spontaneous decay.
