This paper presents a scheme for efficient channel usage between simulator
and accelerator where the accelerator models some RTL sub-blocks in the
accelerator-based hardware/software co-simulation while the simulator runs
transaction-level model of the remaining part of the whole chip being verified.
With conventional simulation accelerator, evaluations of simulator and
accelerator alternate at every valid simulation time, which results in poor
simulation performance due to startup overhead of simulator-accelerator channel
access. The startup overhead can be reduced by merging multiple transactions on
the channel into a single burst traffic. We propose a predictive packetizing
scheme for reducing channel traffic by merging as many transactions into a
burst traffic as possible based on 'prediction and rollback.' Under ideal
condition with 100% prediction accuracy, the proposed method shows a
performance gain of 1500% compared to the conventional one.
