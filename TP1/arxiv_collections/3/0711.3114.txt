The physics of charm has become one of the best laboratories exposing the
limitations of the naive constituent quark model and also giving hints into a
more mature description of hadron spectroscopy. Recent discoveries are a
challenge that have revolutionized our understanding of the hadron spectra. In
this talk we address the study of many-quark components in charmonium spectra.
To make the physics clear we also discuss exotic many-quark systems.
