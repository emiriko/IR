Necessary and sufficient conditions for deterministic remote extraction and
destruction of qubit information encoded in bipartite states using only local
operations and classical communications (LOCC) are presented. The conditions
indicate that there is a way to asymmetrically spread qubit information between
two parties such that it can be remotely extracted with unit probability at one
of the parties but not at the other as long as they are using LOCC. Remote
destruction can also be asymmetric between the two parties, but the conditions
are incompatible with those for remote extraction.
