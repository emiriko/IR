We study co--rotational wave maps from $(3+1)$--Minkowski space to the
three--sphere $S^3$. It is known that there exists a countable family $\{f_n\}$
of self--similar solutions. We investigate their stability under linear
perturbations by operator theoretic methods. To this end we study the spectra
of the perturbation operators, prove well--posedness of the corresponding
linear Cauchy problem and deduce a growth estimate for solutions. Finally, we
study perturbations of the limiting solution which is obtained from $f_n$ by
letting $n \to \infty$.
