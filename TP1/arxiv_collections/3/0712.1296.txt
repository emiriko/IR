In this note, we give a generalization of the inversion formulas of
Pestov-Uhlmann for the geodesic ray transform of functions and vector fields on
simple 2-dimensional manifolds of constant curvature. The inversion formulas
given here hold for 2-dimensional simple manifolds whose curvatures close to a
constant.
