A meteor shower is a luminous phenomenon that takes place by the entry into
the Earths atmosphere of a cascade of particles coming from a stream
intersected by our planet in its orbit. Here we investigate the possibility of
a description of the mass distribution of meteoroids in meteor showers int
terms of a non extensive formulation, which could shed light and give some
insight into the origin of such particles.
