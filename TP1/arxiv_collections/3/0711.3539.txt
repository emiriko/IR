The formulation of quantum theory does not comply with the notion of
objective existence of elementary particles. Objective existence independent of
observation implies the distinguishability of elementary particles. In other
words: If elementary particles have an objective existence independent of
observations, then they are distinguishable. Or if elementary particles are
indistinguishable then matter cannot have existence independent of our
observation. This paper presents a simple deduction of the above statements,
their compatibility with quantum theory, an example of quantum uniqueness
situation and a suggested experiment. The conclusion is a short discussion
about the redundancy of such phenomena.
