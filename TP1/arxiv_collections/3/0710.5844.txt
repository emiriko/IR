Proposals that quantum gravity gives rise to non-commutative spacetime
geometry and deformations of Poincare symmetry are examined in the context of
(2+1)-dimensional quantum gravity. The results are expressed in five lessons,
which summarise how the gravitational constant, Planck's constant and the
cosmological constant enter the non-commutative and non-cocommutative
structures arising in (2+1)-dimensional quantum gravity. It is emphasised that
the much studied bicrossproduct kappa-Poincare algebra does not arise directly
in (2+1)-dimensional quantum gravity.
