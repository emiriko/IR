One of the main elements of the self-consistent generalized Langevin equation
(SCGLE) theory of colloid dynamics [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 62}, 3382 (2000); ibid
{\bf 72}, 031107 (2005)] is the introduction of exact short-time moment
conditions in its formulation. The need to previously calculate these exact
short-time properties constitutes a practical barrier for its application. In
this note we report that a simplified version of this theory, in which this
short-time information is eliminated, leads to the same results in the
intermediate and long-time regimes. Deviations are only observed at short
times, and are not qualitatively or quantitatively important. This is
illustrated by comparing the two versions of the theory for representative
model systems.
