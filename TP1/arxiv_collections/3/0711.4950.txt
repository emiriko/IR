A short review on light scalar mesons is performed both in experiment and
theory. A naive model, constrained by D branching ratios, is derived in order
to make predictions on the wave functions of the $f_0(600)$ and $a_0(980)$
mesons. This leads us to compute transition form factors between the
pseudoscalar $B$ and scalar mesons.
