Let Lambda be a numerical semigroup. Assume there exists an algebraic
function field over GF(q) in one variable which possesses a rational place that
has Lambda as its Weierstrass semigroup. We ask the question as to how many
rational places such a function field can possibly have and we derive an upper
bound in terms of the generators of Lambda and q. Our bound is an improvement
to a bound by Lewittes which takes into account only the multiplicity of Lambda
and q. From the new bound we derive significant improvements to Serre's upper
bound in the cases q=2, 3 and 4. We finally show that Lewittes' bound has
important implications to the theory of towers of function fields.
