We present a first-principles study to understand the phenomena of interlayer
exchange coupling in Fe/Nb multilayers using the linearized-muffin-tin-orbitals
method within the generalized gradient approximation. We find that the exchange
coupling oscillates with both short and long periodicities, which have been
examined in terms of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) model as well as
the quantum well (QW) model. We have investigated the behavior of the exchange
coupling by artificially varying moments of Fe atoms in ferromagnetic layers.
For a small moment of Fe, the coupling shows bilinearity in the magnetic
moments, implying its RKKY character. However, at higher moments close to that
of bulk Fe, the saturation of long-period oscillations is in accordance with
the QW model. Quantum well dispersions around the Fermi level demonstrate that
the majority-spin bands contribute largely to the formation of quantum well
states, which we analyze quantitatively by making use of the phase accumulation
model. Our analysis indicates that the quantum well model gives a better
description of the oscillatory behavior of the exchange coupling in Fe/Nb
multilayers.
