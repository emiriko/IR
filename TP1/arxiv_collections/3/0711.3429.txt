A family of quantum anharmonic oscillators is studied in any finite spatial
dimension in the scheme of first quantization and the investigation of their
eigenenergies is presented. The statistical properties of the calculated
eigenenergies are compared with the theoretical predictions inferred from the
Random Matrix theory. Conclusions are derived.
