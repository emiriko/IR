We show a calculable example of stable supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking models
with O(10) eV gravitino mass based on the combination of D-term gauge mediation
and U(1)' mediation. A potential problem of the negative mass squared for the
SUSY standard model (SSM) sfermions in the D-term gauge mediation is solved by
the contribution from the U(1)' mediation. On the other hand, the splitting
between the SSM gauginos and sfermions in the U(1)' mediation is circumvented
by the contributions from the D-term gauge mediation. Since the U(1)' mediation
does not introduce any new SUSY vacua, we achieve a completely stable model
under thermal effects. Our model, therefore, has no cosmological difficulty.
