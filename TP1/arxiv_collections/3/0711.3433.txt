The paper is devoted to the generalization of Lusztig's q-analog of weight
multiplicities to the Lie superalgebras gl(n,m) and spo(2n,M). We define such
q-analogs K_{lambda,mu}(q) for the typical modules and for the irreducible
covariant tensor gl(n,m)-modules of highest weight lambda. For gl(n,m), the
defined polynomials have nonnegative integer coefficients if the weight mu is
dominant. For spo(2n,M), we show that the positivity property holds when mu is
dominant and sufficiently far from a specific wall of the fundamental chamber.
We also establish that the q-analog associated to an irreducible covariant
tensor gl(n,m)-module of highest weight lambda and a dominant weight mu is the
generating series of a simple statistic on the set of semistandard
hook-tableaux of shape lambda and weight mu. This statistic can be regarded as
a super analog of the charge statistic defined by Lascoux and Schutzenberger.
