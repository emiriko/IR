We present a systematic comparison of the most recent thermodynamic
measurements of a trapped Fermi gas at unitarity with predictions from strong
coupling theories and quantum Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The accuracy of the
experimental data, of the order of a few percent, allows a precise test of
different many-body approaches. We find that a Nozieres and Schmitt-Rink
treatment of fluctuations is in excellent agreement with the experimental data
and available MC calculations at unitarity.
