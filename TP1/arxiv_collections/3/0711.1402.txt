We show that every modular category is equivalent as an additive ribbon
category to the category of finite-dimensional comodules of a Weak Hopf
Algebra. This Weak Hopf Algebra is finite-dimensional, split cosemisimple,
weakly cofactorizable, coribbon and has trivially intersecting base algebras.
In order to arrive at this characterization of modular categories, we develop a
generalization of Tannaka-Krein reconstruction to the long version of the
canonical forgetful functor which is lax and oplax monoidal, but not in general
strong monoidal, thereby avoiding all the difficulties related to non-integral
Frobenius-Perron dimensions.
