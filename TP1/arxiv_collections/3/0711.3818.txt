We establish a quenched Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for a smooth observable
of random sequences of iterated linear hyperbolic maps on the torus. To this
end we also obtain an annealed CLT for the same system. We show that, almost
surely, the variance of the quenched system is the same as for the annealed
system. Our technique is the study of the transfer operator on an anisotropic
Banach space specifically tailored to use the cone condition satisfied by the
maps.
