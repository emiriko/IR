In this paper, we show that the tilting modules over a cluster-tilted algebra
$A$ lift to tilting objects in the associated cluster category $\mathcal{C}_H$.
As a first application, we describe the induced exchange relation for tilting
$A$-modules arising from the exchange relation for tilting object in
$\mathcal{C}_H$. As a second application, we exhibit tilting $A$-modules having
cluster-tilted endomorphism algebras.
