From the constructions of the quantum spacetime, a four dimensional quantized
spacetime can be embedded in a five dimensional continuous spacetime. Thus to
observe from the five dimensional continuous spacetime where the four
dimensional quantized spacetime is embedded, there exist the energy-momentum
flows between the five dimensional continuous spacetime and the four
dimensional quantized spacetime. This makes the energy-momentum not locally
conserved generally on the four dimensional quantized spacetime. We propose
that energy-momentum tensors of noncommutative field theories constructed from
the Noether approach are just the correct forms for the energy-momentum tensors
of noncommutative field theories. The non-vanishing of the total divergences of
the energy-momentum tensors of noncommutative field theories just reflect that
energy-momentum are not locally conserved on noncommutative spacetime. At the
same time, from the constructions of the quantum spacetime, we propose that the
total spacetime dimension of the quantum spacetime is infinite.
