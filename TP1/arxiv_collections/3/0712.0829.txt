We consider a classical spin model, of two-dimensional spins, with continuous
symmetry, and investigate the effect of a symmetry breaking unidirectional
quenched disorder on the magnetization of the system. We work in the mean field
regime. We show, by numerical simulations and by perturbative calculations in
the low as well as in the high temperature limits, that although the continuous
symmetry of the magnetization is lost, the system still magnetizes, albeit with
a lower value as compared to the case without disorder. The critical
temperature at which the system starts magnetizing, also decreases with the
introduction of disorder. However, with the introduction of an additional
constant magnetic field, the component of magnetization in the direction that
is transverse to the disorder field increases with the introduction of the
quenched disorder. We discuss the same effects also for three-dimensional
spins.
