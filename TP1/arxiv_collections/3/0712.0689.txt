These lectures present an introduction to AdS-CFT, and are intended both for
begining and more advanced graduate students, which are familiar with quantum
field theory and have a working knowledge of their basic methods. Familiarity
with supersymmetry, general relativity and string theory is helpful, but not
necessary, as the course intends to be as self-contained as possible. I will
introduce the needed elements of field and gauge theory, general relativity,
supersymmetry, supergravity, strings and conformal field theory. Then I
describe the basic AdS-CFT scenario, of ${\cal N}=4 $ Super Yang-Mills's
relation to string theory in $AdS_5\times S_5$, and applications that can be
derived from it: 3-point functions, quark-antiquark potential, finite
temperature and scattering processes, the pp wave correspondence and spin
chains. I also describe some general properties of gravity duals of gauge
theories.
