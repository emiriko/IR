Using data collected with the CDF Run II detector, new measurements on bottom
production cross-sections are presented. The latest achievements in bottom
hadron spectroscopy are discussed. The results are based on a large sample of
semileptonic and hadronic decays of bottom states made available by triggers
based on the precise CDF tracking system.
