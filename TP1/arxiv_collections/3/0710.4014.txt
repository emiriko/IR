The emission characteristics of intense laser driven protons are controlled
using ultra-strong (of the order of 10^9 V/m) electrostatic fields varying on a
few ps timescale. The field structures are achieved by exploiting the high
potential of the target (reaching multi-MV during the laser interaction).
Suitably shaped targets result in a reduction in the proton beam divergence,
and hence an increase in proton flux while preserving the high beam quality.
The peak focusing power and its temporal variation are shown to depend on the
target characteristics, allowing for the collimation of the inherently highly
divergent beam and the design of achromatic electrostatic lenses.
