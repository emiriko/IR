Theoretical studies on the geometry, electronic structure and spin
multiplicity of Sc, Ti and V doped Na$_n$ (n = 4, 5, 6) clusters have been
carried out within a gradient corrected density functional approach. Two
complementary approaches including all-electron calculations on free clusters,
and supercell calculations using planewave pseudopotential and projector
augmented wave formalisms have been carried out. It is shown that spin magnetic
moments of the transition metal atoms, the magnitude of host polarization, and
the sign of the host polarization all change with the number of alkali atoms.
In particular the transition metal atoms are shown to attain spin moments that
are higher than their atomic values. The role of hybridization between the
transition atom d-states and the alkali $sp$-states is highlighted to account
for the evolutions in the spin moments and host polarization.
