We propose a model for the quark masses and mixings based on an A_4 family
symmetry. Three scalar SU(2) doublets form a triplet of A_4. The three
left-handed-quark SU(2) doublets are also united in a triplet of A_4. The
right-handed quarks are singlets of A_4. The A_4-symmetric scalar potential
leads to a vacuum in which two of the three scalar SU(2) doublets have
expectation values with equal moduli. Our model makes an excellent fit of the
observed |V_ub/V_cb|. The symmetry CP is respected in the charged gauge
interactions of the quarks.
