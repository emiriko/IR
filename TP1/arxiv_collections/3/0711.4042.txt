The extension of chiral theories to the description of resonances, via the
incorporation of unitarity in coupled channels, has provided us with a new
theoretical perspective on the nature of some of the observed excited hadrons.
In this contribution some of the early achievements in the field of baryonic
resonances are reviewed, the recent evidence of the two-pole nature of the
Lambda(1405) is discussed and results on charmed baryon resonances are
presented.
