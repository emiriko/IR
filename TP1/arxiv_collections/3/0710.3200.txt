The ultrafast dynamics of surface electromagnetic waves photogenerated on
aluminum film perforated with subwavelength holes array was studied in the
visible spectral range by the technique of transient photomodulation with 100
fs time resolution. We observed a pronounced blueshift of the resonant
transmission band that reveals the important role of plasma attenuation in the
optical response of nanohole arrays. The blueshift is inconsistent with
plasmonic mechanism of extraordinary transmission and points to the crucial
role of interference in the formation of transmission bands. The transient
photomodulation spectra were successfully modeled within the Boltzmann equation
approach for the electron-phonon relaxation dynamics, involving non-equilibrium
hot electrons and quasi-equilibrium phonons.
