We propose a novel protocol for the creation of macroscopic quantum
superposition (MQS) states based on a measurement of a non-monotonous function
of a quantum collective variable. The main advantage of this protocol is that
it does not require switching on and off nonlinear interactions in the system.
We predict this protocol to allow the creation of multiatom MQS by measuring
the number of atoms coherently outcoupled from a two-component (spinor)
Bose-Einstein condensate.
