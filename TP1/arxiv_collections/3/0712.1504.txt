We present a theory for the full distribution of current fluctuations in
incoherent diffusive superconducting junctions, subjected to a voltage bias.
This theory of full counting statistics of incoherent multiple Andreev
reflections is valid for arbitrary applied voltage. We present a detailed
discussion of the properties of the first four cumulants as well as the low and
high voltage regimes of the full counting statistics. The work is an extension
of the results of Pilgram and the author, Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 086806 (2005).
