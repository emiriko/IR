Let $X$ be a complex analytic curve. In this paper we prove that the
subanalytic sheaf of tempered holomorphic solutions of $\mathcal D_X$-modules
induces a fully faithful functor on a subcategory of germs of formal holonomic
$\mathcal D_X$-modules. Further, given a germ $\mathcal M$ of holonomic
$\mathcal D_X$-module, we obtain some results linking the subanalytic sheaf of
tempered solutions of $\mathcal M$ and the classical formal and analytic
invariants of $\mathcal M$.
