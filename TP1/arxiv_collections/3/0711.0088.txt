Within a variational approach to solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation we
investigate dynamical properties of a rotating Bose-Einstein condensate which
is confined in an anharmonic trap. In particular, we calculate the
eigenfrequencies of low-energy excitations out of the equilibrium state and the
aspect ratio of the condensate widths during the free expansion.
