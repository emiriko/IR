We report Hartree-Fock (HF) based pseudopotentials suitable for plane-wave
calculations. Unlike typical effective core potentials, the present
pseudopotentials are finite at the origin and exhibit rapid convergence in a
plane-wave basis; the optimized pseudopotential method [A. M. Rappe et. al,
Phys. Rev. B 41 1227--30 (1990)] improves plane-wave convergence.
Norm-conserving HF pseudopotentials are found to develop long-range
non-Coulombic behavior which does not decay faster than 1/r, and is non-local.
This behavior, which stems from the nonlocality of the exchange potential, is
remedied using a recently developed self-consistent procedure [J. R. Trail and
R. J. Needs, J. Chem. Phys. 122, 014112 (2005)]. The resulting pseudopotentials
slightly violate the norm conservation of the core charge. We calculated
several atomic properties using these pseudopotentials, and the results are in
good agreement with all-electron HF values. The dissociation energies,
equilibrium bond lengths, and frequency of vibrations of several dimers
obtained with these HF pseudopotentials and plane waves are also in good
agreement with all-electron results.
