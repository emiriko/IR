All experimental measurements of particle physics today are beautifully
described by the Standard Model. However, there are good reasons to believe
that new physics may be just around the corner at the TeV energy scale. This
energy range is currently probed by the Tevatron and HERA accelerators and
selected results of searches for physics beyond the Standard Model are
presented here. No signals for new physics have been found and limits are
placed on the allowed parameter space for a variety of different particles.
