Global hyperbolicity is a central concept in Mathematical Relativity. Here,
we review the different approaches to this concept explaining both, classical
approaches and recent results. The former includes Cauchy hypersurfaces, naked
singularities, and the space of the causal curves connecting two events. The
latter includes structural results on globally hyperbolic spacetimes, their
embeddability in Lorentz-Minkowski, and the recently revised notions of both,
causal and conformal boundaries. Moreover, two criteria for checking global
hyperbolicity are reviewed. The first one applies to general splitting
spacetimes. The second one characterizes accurately global hyperbolicity and
spacelike Cauchy hypersurfaces for standard stationary spacetimes, in terms of
a naturally associated Finsler metric.
