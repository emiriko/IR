In this paper we describe how we applied a BIST-based approach to the test of
a logic core to be included in System-on-a-chip (SoC) environments. The
approach advantages are the ability to protect the core IP, the simple test
interface (thanks also to the adoption of the P1500 standard), the possibility
to run the test at-speed, the reduced test time, and the good diagnostic
capabilities. The paper reports figures about the achieved fault coverage, the
required area overhead, and the performance slowdown, and compares the figures
with those for alternative approaches, such as those based on full scan and
sequential ATPG.
