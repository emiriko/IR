We investigate the relation between Bell inequalities and nonlocal games by
presenting a systematic method for their bilateral conversion. In particular,
we show that while to any nonlocal game there naturally corresponds a unique
Bell inequality, the converse is not true. As an illustration of the method we
present a number of nonlocal games that admit better odds when played using
quantum resources
