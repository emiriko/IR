We investigate the continuum limit scaling of the scalar condensate in the
$N_f=2$ Schwinger model on the lattice. We employ maximally twisted mass Wilson
fermions and overlap fermions. We compute the scalar condensate by taking the
trace of the propagator (direct method) and by utilizing the integrated
Ward-Takahashi identity. While the scalar condensate comes out consistent using
these two methods for a given kind of lattice fermions, we find --quite
surprisingly-- large discrepancies for the scalar condensate between twisted
mass and overlap fermions. These discrepancies are only resolved when using the
point split current for twisted mass fermions.
