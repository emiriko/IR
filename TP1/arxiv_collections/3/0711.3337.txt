Vitrification in colloidal systems typically occurs at high densities driven
by sharply varying, short-ranged interactions. The possibility of glassy
behavior arising from smoothly varying, long-ranged particle interactions has
received relatively little attention. Here we investigate the behavior of
screened charged particles, and explicitly demonstrate that these systems
exhibit glassy properties in the regime of low temperature and low density.
Properties close to this low density (Wigner) glass transition share many
features with their hard-sphere counterparts, but differ in quantitative
aspects that may be accounted for via microscopic theoretical considerations.
