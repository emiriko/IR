Molecular beam epitaxy is employed to manufacture self-assembled InAs/GaAs
quantum dot Schottky resonant tunneling diodes. By virtue of a thin AlAs
insertion barrier, the thermal current is effectively reduced and electron
resonant tunneling through quantum dots under both forward and reverse biased
conditions is observed at relatively high temperature of 77K. The ground states
of quantum dots are found to be at ~0.19eV below the conduction band of GaAs
matrix. The theoretical computations are in conformity with experimental data.
