If the constitutive law linking the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor and
the right Cauchy-Green strain tensor derives from a potential, then the Cauchy
stress tensor and the logarithm of the left Cauchy-Green strain tensor are
linked by a related potential. We give a new and concise proof which is based
on an explicit formula expressing the derivative of the exponential of a
tensor.
