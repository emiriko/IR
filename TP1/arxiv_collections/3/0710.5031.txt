Let M be a smooth CR manifold of CR dimension n and CR codimension k, which
is not compact, but has the local extension property E. We introduce the notion
of "elementary pseudoconcavity" for M, which extends to CR manifolds the
concept of a "pseudoconcave" complex manifold. This notion is then used to
obtain generalizations, to the noncompact case, of the results of our previous
paper about algebraic dependence, transcendence degree and related matters for
the field K(M) of CR meromorphic functions on M.
