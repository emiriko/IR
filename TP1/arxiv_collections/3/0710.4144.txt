We theoretically investigate image propagation and storage in hot atomic
vapor. A $4f$ system is adopted for imaging and an atomic vapor cell is placed
over the transform plane. The Fraunhofer diffraction pattern of an object in
the object plane can thus be transformed into atomic Raman coherence according
to the idea of ``light storage''. We investigate how the stored diffraction
pattern evolves under diffusion. Our result indicates, under appropriate
conditions, that an image can be reconstructed with high fidelity. The main
reason for this procedure to work is the fact that diffusion of opposite-phase
components of the diffraction pattern interfere destructively.
