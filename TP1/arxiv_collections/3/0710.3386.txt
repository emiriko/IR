We introduce a model for diffusion of two classes of particles ($A$ and $B$)
with priority: where both species are present in the same site the motion of
$A$'s takes precedence over that of $B$'s. This describes realistic situations
in wireless and communication networks. In regular lattices the diffusion of
the two species is normal but the $B$ particles are significantly slower, due
to the presence of the $A$ particles. From the fraction of sites where the $B$
particles can move freely, which we compute analytically, we derive the
diffusion coefficients of the two species. In heterogeneous networks the
fraction of sites where $B$ is free decreases exponentially with the degree of
the sites. This, coupled with accumulation of particles in high-degree nodes
leads to trapping of the low priority particles in scale-free networks.
