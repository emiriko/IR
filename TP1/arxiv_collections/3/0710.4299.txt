A class of boundary conditions for canonical general relativity are proposed
and studied at the quasi-local level. It is shown that for untrapped or
marginal surfaces, fixing the area element on the 2-surface (rather than the
induced 2-metric) and the angular momentum surface density is enough to have a
functionally differentiable Hamiltonian, thus providing definition of conserved
quantities for the quasi-local regions. If on the boundary the evolution vector
normal to the 2-surface is chosen to be proportional to the dual expansion
vector, we obtain a generalization of the Hawking energy associated with a
generalized Kodama vector. This vector plays the role for the stationary
untrapped boundary conditions which the stationary Killing vector plays for
stationary black holes. When the dual expansion vector is null, the boundary
conditions reduce to the ones given by the non-expanding horizons and the null
trapping horizons.
