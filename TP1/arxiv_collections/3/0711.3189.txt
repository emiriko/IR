We analyze the fusion data for $^{16}$O+$^{208}$Pb using coupled-channels
calculations. We include couplings to the low-lying surface excitations of the
projectile and target and study the effect of the ($^{16}$O,$^{17}$O)
one-neutron pickup. The hindrance of the fusion data that is observed at
energies far below the Coulomb barrier cannot be explained by a conventional
ion-ion potential and defining the fusion in terms of ingoing-wave boundary
conditions (IWBC). We show that the hindrance can be explained fairly well by
applying the M3Y double-folding potential which has been corrected with a
calibrated, repulsive term that simulates the effect of nuclear
incompressibility.
  We show that the coupling to one-neutron transfer channels plays a crucial
role in improving the fit to the data. The best fit is achieved by increasing
the transfer strength by 25% relative to the strength that is required to
reproduce the one-neutron transfer data. The larger strength is not unrealistic
because the calculated inelastic plus transfer cross section is in good
agreement with the measured quasielastic cross section. We finally discuss the
problem of reproducing the fusion data at energies far above the Coulomb
barrier. Here we do not account for the data when we apply the IWBC but the
discrepancy is essentially eliminated by applying the M3Y+repulsion potential
and a weak, short-ranged imaginary potential.
