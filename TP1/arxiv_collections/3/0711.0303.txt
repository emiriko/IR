Applications of negative index materials (NIM) presently are severely limited
by absorption. Next to improvements of metamaterial designs, it has been
suggested that dense gases of atoms could form a NIM with negligible losses. In
such gases, the low absorption is facilitated by quantum interference. Here, we
show that additional gain mechanisms can be used to tune and effectively remove
absorption in a dense gas NIM. In our setup, the atoms are coherently prepared
by control laser fields, and further driven by a weak incoherent pump field to
induce gain. We employ nonlinear optical Bloch equations to analyze the optical
response. Metastable Neon is identified as a suitable experimental candidate at
infrared frequencies to implement a lossless active negative index material.
