I introduce a doped two-dimensional quantum dimer model describing a doped
Mott insulator and retaining the original Fermi statistics of the electrons.
This model shows a rich phase diagram including a d-wave hole-pair
unconventional superconductor at small enough doping and a bosonic superfluid
at large doping. The hole kinetic energy is shown to favor binding of
topological defects to the bare fermionic holons turning them into bosons, in
agreement with arguments based on RVB wave-functions. Results are discussed in
the context of cuprates superconductors.
