A convex surface that is flat everywhere but on finitely many smooth curves
(or "seams") and points is a seam form. We show that the only creases through
the flat components of a seam form are either between vertices or tangent to
the seams. As corollaries we resolve open problems about certain special seam
forms: the flat components of a D-form have no creases at all, and the flat
component of a pita-form has at most one crease, between the seam's endpoints.
