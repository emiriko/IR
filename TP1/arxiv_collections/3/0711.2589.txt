Higgs boson production by the gluon fusion and its decay into two photons at
the LHC are investigated in the context of the gauge-Higgs unification
scenario. The qualitative behaviors for these processes in the gauge-Higgs
unification are quite distinguishable from those of the Standard Model and the
universal extra dimension scenario because of the overall sign difference for
the effective couplings induced by one-loop corrections through Kaluza-Klein
(KK) modes. For the KK mode mass smaller than 1 TeV, the Higgs productions
cross section and its branching ratio into two photons are sizably deviated
from those in the Standard Model. Associated with the discovery of Higgs boson,
this deviation may be measured at the LHC.
