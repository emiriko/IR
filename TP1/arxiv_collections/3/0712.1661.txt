The mechanism for entanglement of two flux qubits each interacting with a
single mode electromagnetic field is discussed. By performing a Bell state
measurements (BSM) on photons we find the two qubits in an entangled state
depending on the system parameters. We discuss the results for two initial
states and take into consideration the influence of decoherence.
