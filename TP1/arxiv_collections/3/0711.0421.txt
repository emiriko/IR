The symplectic quantization technique is applied to open free membrane and
strings in pp-wave background and background gauge field obtained by
compactifying the open membrane in the presence of a background anti-symmetric
3--form field. In both cases, first the Poisson brackets among the Fourier
modes are obtained and then the Poisson brackets among the membrane(string)
coordinates are computed. The full noncommutative phase-space structure is
reproduced in case of strings in pp-wave background and background gauge field.
We feel that this method of obtaining the Poisson algebra is more elegant than
previous approaches discussed in the literature.
