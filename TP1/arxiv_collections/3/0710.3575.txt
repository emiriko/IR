Using a new general approach to limits in optical structures that counts
orthogonal waves generated by scattering, we derive an upper limit to the
number of bits of delay possible in one-dimensional slow light structures that
are based on linear optical response to the signal field. The limit is
essentially the product of the length of the structure in wavelengths and the
largest relative change in dielectric constant anywhere in the structure at any
frequency of interest. It holds for refractive index, absorption or gain
variations with arbitrary spectral or spatial form. It is otherwise completely
independent of the details of the structure's design, and does not rely on
concepts of group velocity or group delay.
