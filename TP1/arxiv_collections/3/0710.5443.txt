In this work we re-examine the correlation between B(d,s)-anti-B(d,s) mixing
and Lepton Flavour Violation in the light of recent experimental measurements
in the $B_s$ system. We perform a generic SUSY analysis of the allowed down
squark mass insertion parameter space. In the SUSY GUT scenario this parameter
space is then used to make predictions for LFV branching ratios. We find that
the recent measurement for the CP phase $\phi_s$ excludes the lowest rates for
tau --> mu + gamma and provides a lower bound of ~ 3E-9 for tan beta = 10.
Future experimental improvements in the bound on tau --> mu + gamma and the
measurement of phi(s) will constitute a strong test of the SUSY GUT scenario.
