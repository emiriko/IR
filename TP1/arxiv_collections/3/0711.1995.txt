Three years ago, we introduced a new way to quantize the static Schwarzschild
black hole(SSBH), there the SSBH was first treated as a single periodic
Euclidean system and then the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantum condition of action was
used to obtain a quantum theory of Schwarzschild black hole.[1] Now in this
short report, we try to extend the above method to quantize the static de
Sitter(SDS) space-time and establish a quantum theory of both SDS space and
dark energy.
