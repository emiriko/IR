We discuss possible actions for the d=2, N=(2,2) large vector multiplet that
gauges isometries of generalized Kahler geometries. We explore two scenarios
that allow us to write kinetic and superpotential terms for the scalar
field-strengths, and write kinetic terms for the spinor invariants that can
introduce topological terms for the connections.
