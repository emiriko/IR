This paper presents an overview of recent experimental direct searches for
Higgs-boson and beyond-the-standard-model (BSM) physics shown in the plenary
session at the SUSY07 conference. The results reported correspond to an
integrated luminosity of up to 2 fb-1 of Run II data from $p\bar{p}$ collisions
collected by the CDF and D0 experiments at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider.
Searches covered include: the standard model (SM) Higgs boson (including
sensitivity projections), the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard
model (MSSM), charged Higgs bosons and extended Higgs models, supersymmetric
decays that conserve R-parity, gauge-mediated supersymmetric breaking models,
long-lived particles, leptoquarks, extra gauge bosons, extra dimensions, and
finally signature-based searches. Given the excellent performance of the
collider and the continued productivity of the experiments, the Tevatron
physics potential looks very promising for discovery in the coming larger data
sets. In particular, the Higgs boson could be observed if its mass is light or
near 160 GeV.
