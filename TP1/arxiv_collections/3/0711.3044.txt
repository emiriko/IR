The primary physics goals of a high luminosity e+e- flavor factory are
discussed, including the possibilities to perform detailed studies of the CKM
mechanism of quark mixing, and constrain virtual Higgs and non-standard model
particle contributions to the dynamics of rare B_{u,d,s} decays. The large
samples of D mesons and tau leptons produced at a flavor factory will result in
improved sensitivities to rare D processes - mixing, CP violation and rare
decays - and lepton flavor violation searches, respectively. Recent
developments in accelerator physics have demonstrated the feasibility to build
an accelerator that can achieve luminosities of ~10^36 cm-2 s^-1 at sqrt{s}=10
GeV. The capablity to run at sqrt{s}=3.770 GeV with luminosity of ~10^35 cm^-2
s^-1 is included in the initial design. This report emphasizes the charm
physics that can be probed at a Super Flavor Factory.
