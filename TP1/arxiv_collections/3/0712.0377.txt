At density 1.2 the Kob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones liquid partly
crystallizes in the temperature interval [0.39, 0.44] after typically 10-100
microseconds (Argon units). The crystallization is initiated by a phase
separation where the large (A) particles cluster in a volume void of B
particles. We investigate a modification of the Kob-Andersen system where the
attraction between particles of the same type is removed, thus disfavoring
phase separation. We have not been able to crystallize this new system.
