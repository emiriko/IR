The study of nanospintronic devices utilizing coherent transport through
molecular scale multiply-connected geometries in the presence of moderate
magnetic fields is presented. It is shown how two types of simple devices, spin
filters and spin splitters (or Stern-Gerlach devices) may be constructed from
molecular nanometric rings utilizing the Aharonov-Bohm effect. The current is
calculated within a single electron approximation and within a many-body master
equation approach where charging effects are accounted for in the Coulomb
Blockade regime. We provide rules and tools to develop and analyze efficient
spintronic devices based on nanometric interferometers.
