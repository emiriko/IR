A new model to simulate the time evolution of river delta formation process
is presented. It is based on the continuity equation for water and sediment
flow and a phenomenological sedimentation/ erosion law. Different delta types
are reproduced using different parameters and erosion rules. The structures of
the calculated patterns are analyzed in space and time and compared with real
data patterns. Furthermore our model is capable to simulate the rich dynamics
related to the switching of the mouth of the river delta. The simulation
results are then compared with geological records for the Mississippi river.
