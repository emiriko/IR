The question of robustness of a network under random ``attacks'' is treated
in the framework of critical phenomena. The persistence of spontaneous
magnetization of a ferromagnetic system to the random inclusion of
antiferromagnetic interactions is investigated. After examing the static
properties of the quenched version (in respect to the random antiferromagnetic
interactions) of the model, the persistence of the magnetization is analysed
also in the annealed approximation, and the difference in the results are
discussed.
