In this manuscript we comment on the criticism raised recently by Achasov and
Kiselev [Phys. Rev. D 76, 077501 (2007)] on our work on the radiative decays
phi to gamma a_0/f_0 [Eur. Phys. J. A 24, 437 (2005)]. Specifically, we
demonstrate that their criticism relies on results that violate
gauge-invariance and is therefore invalid.
