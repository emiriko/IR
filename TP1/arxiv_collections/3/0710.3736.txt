Tin coupons were shock damaged/melted under identical conditions with a
diverging high explosive shock wave. Proton Radiography images and velocimetry
data from experiments with seven different tin coupons of varying thickness are
analyzed. Comparing experiments with identical samples allowed us to
distinguish between repeatable and random features. Shapes and velocities of
the main fragments are deterministic functions of the coupon thickness; random
differences exist only at a small scale. Velocities of the leading layer and of
the main fragment differ by the same value independently of coupon thicknesses,
which is likely related to the separation energy of metal layers.
