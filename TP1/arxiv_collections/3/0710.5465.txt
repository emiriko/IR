Chaotic systems have been broadly exploited through the last two decades to
build encryption methods. Recently, two new image encryption schemes have been
proposed, where the encryption process involves a permutation operation and an
XOR-like transformation of the shuffled pixels, which are controlled by three
chaotic systems. This paper discusses some defects of the schemes and how to
break them with a chosen-plaintext attack.
