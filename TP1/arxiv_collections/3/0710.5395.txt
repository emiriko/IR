We investigate the ballistic motion of electrons in III-V semiconductor
quantum wells with Rashba spin-orbit coupling in a perpendicular magnetic
field. Taking into account the full quantum dynamics of the problem, we explore
the modifications of classical cyclotron orbits due to spin-orbit interaction.
As a result, for electron energies comparable with the cyclotron energy the
dynamics are particularly rich and not adequately described by semiclassical
approximations. Our study is complementary to previous semiclassical approaches
concentrating on the regime of weaker fields.
