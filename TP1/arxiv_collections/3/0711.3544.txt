A direct procedure for determining the propagator associated with a quantum
mechanical problem was given by the Path Integration Procedure of Feynman. The
Green function, which is the Fourier Transform with respect to the time
variable of the propagator, can be derived later. In our approach, with the
help of a Laplace transform, a direct way to get the energy dependent Green
function is presented, and the propagator can be obtained later with an inverse
Laplace transform. The method is illustrated through simple one dimensional
examples and for time independent potentials, though it can be generalized to
the derivation of more complicated propagators.
