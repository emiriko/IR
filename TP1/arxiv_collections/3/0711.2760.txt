It is suggested that a new area of CSCR (Computer Supported Collaborative
Research) is distinguished from CSCW (Computer Supported Collaborative Work)
and CSCL (Computer Supported Collaborative Learning) and that the demarcation
between the three areas could do with greater clarification and prescription.
  Although the areas of Human Computer Interaction (HCI), CSCW, and CSCL are
now relatively well established, the related field of Computer Supported
Collaborative Research (CSCR) is new and little understood. An analysis of the
principles and issues behind CSCR is undertaken with a view to determining
precisely its nature and scope and to delineate it clearly from CSCW and CSCL.
This determination is such that it is generally applicable to the building,
design and evaluation of collaborative research environments.
  A particular instance of the CSCR domain is then examined in order to
determine the requirements of a collaborative research environment for students
and supervisors (CRESS).
