The photoproduction process of neutral kaons on a liquid deuterium target is
investigated near the threshold region, Egamma = 0.8-1.1 GeV. K0 events are
reconstructed from positive and negative pions, and differential cross sections
are derived. Experimental momentum spectra are compared with those calculated
in the spectator model using a realistic deuteron wave function. Elementary
amplitudes as given by recent isobar models and a simple phenomenological model
are used to study the effect of the new data on the angular behavior of the
elementary cross section. The data favor a backward-peaked angular distribution
of the elementary n(gamma,K0)Lambda process, which provides additional
constraints on current models of kaon photoproduction. The present study
demonstrates that the n(gamma,K0)Lambda reaction can provide key information on
the mechanism of the photoproduction of strangeness.
