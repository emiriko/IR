A simple generalization of the MHD model accounting for the fluctuations of
the configurations due to kinetic effects in plasmas in short times small
scales is considered. The velocity of conductive fluid and the magnetic field
are considerd as the stochastic fields (or random trial trajectories) for which
the classical MHD equations play the role of the mean field equations in the
spirit of stochastic mechanics of E. Nelson.
