An explicit expression for the partition function of two-dimensional nearest
neighbour Ising models in the presence of a magnetic field is derived by a
systematic enumeration of all the spin configurations pertaining to a square
lattice of sixteen sites. The critical temperature is shown to be in excellent
agreement with the reported values while the corresponding dimensionless
magnetic field is obtained as 0.004.
