The antiproton-deuteron atoms are studied in models of various realistic,
popular nucleon-antinucleon potentials. The small energy shifts and decay
widths of the atoms, which stem from the short-ranged strong interactions
between the antiproton and deuteron, are evaluated in a well-established,
accurate approach based on the Sturmian functions. The investigation reveals
that none of the employed potentials, which reproduce the nucleon-antinucleon
scattering data quite well, is able to reproduce the experimental data of the
energy shifts of the 2p antiproton-deuteron atomic states. The energy shifts of
the 2p antiproton-deuteron atomic states are very sensitive to the
nucleon-antinucleon strong interactions, hence the investigation of the
antiproton-deuteron atoms is expected to provide a good platform for refining
the nucleon-antinucleon interaction, especially at zero energy.
