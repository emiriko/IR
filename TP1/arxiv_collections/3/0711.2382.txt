Using recent results on the occurrence times of a string of symbols in a
stochastic process with mixing properties, we present a new method for the
search of rare words in biological sequences generally modelled by a Markov
chain. We obtain a bound on the error between the distribution of the number of
occurrences of a word in a sequence (under a Markov model) and its Poisson
approximation. A global bound is already given by a Chen-Stein method. Our
approach, the psi-mixing method, gives local bounds. Since we only need the
error in the tails of distribution, the global uniform bound of Chen-Stein is
too large and it is a better way to consider local bounds. We search for two
thresholds on the number of occurrences from which we can regard the studied
word as an over-represented or an under-represented one. A biological role is
suggested for these over- or under-represented words. Our method gives such
thresholds for a panel of words much broader than the Chen-Stein method.
Comparing the methods, we observe a better accuracy for the psi-mixing method
for the bound of the tails of distribution. We also present the software PANOW
(available at http://stat.genopole.cnrs.fr/software/panowdir/) dedicated to the
computation of the error term and the thresholds for a studied word.
