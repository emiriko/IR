We have worked out covariant amplitudes for any two-body decay of a resonance
with an arbitrary non-zero mass, which involves arbitrary integer spins in the
initial and the final states. One key new ingredient for this work is the
application of the total intrinsic spin operator $\vec S$ which is given
directly in terms of the generators of the Poincar\'e group.
  Using the results of this study, we show how to explore the Lorentz factors
which appear naturally, if the momentum-space wave functions are used to form
the covariant decay amplitudes. We have devised a method of constructing our
covariant decay amplitudes, such that they lead to the Zemach amplitudes when
the Lorentz factors are set one.
