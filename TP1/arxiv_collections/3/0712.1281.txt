We elucidate a mechanism for obtaining polar behavior in magnetic perovskites
based on A-site disorder and demonstrate this mechanism by density functional
calculations for the double perovskite (La,Lu)MnNiO$_6$ with Lu concentrations
at and below 50%. We show that this material combines polar behavior and
ferromagnetism. The mechanism is quite general and may be applicable to a wide
range of magnetic perovskites.
