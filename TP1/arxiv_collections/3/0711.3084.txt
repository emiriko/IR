The lineshape of the Lambda(1405) was studied in the pp -> pK+ Y0 reaction at
a beam momentum of 3.65 GeV/c at COSY-Juelich. The ANKE spectrometer was used
to identify two protons, one positively charged kaon, and one negatively
charged pion in the final state. Invariant-mass and missing-mass techniques
were applied to separate two neighbouring neutral excited hyperon resonances,
the Sigma0(1385) and Lambda(1405). Both the shape and the position of the
Lambda(1405) distribution are similar to those measured in other reactions and
this information contributes to the ongoing debate regarding the structure of
this resonance.
