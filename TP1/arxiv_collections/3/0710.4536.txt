Motivated by a computer experiment for the design of a rocket booster, this
paper explores nonstationary modeling methodologies that couple stationary
Gaussian processes with treed partitioning. Partitioning is a simple but
effective method for dealing with nonstationarity. The methodological
developments and statistical computing details which make this approach
efficient are described in detail. In addition to providing an analysis of the
rocket booster simulator, our approach is demonstrated to be effective in other
arenas.
