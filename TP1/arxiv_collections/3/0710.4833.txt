We present a system for the boresighting of sensors using inertial
measurement devices as the basis for developing a range of dynamic real-time
sensor fusion applications. The proof of concept utilizes a COTS FPGA platform
for sensor fusion and real-time correction of a misaligned video sensor. We
exploit a custom-designed 32-bit soft processor core and C-based design &
synthesis for rapid, platform-neutral development. Kalman filter and sensor
fusion techniques established in advanced aviation systems are applied to
automotive vehicles with results exceeding typical industry requirements for
sensor alignment. Results of the static and the dynamic tests demonstrate that
using inexpensive accelerometers mounted on (or during assembly of) a sensor
and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) fixed to a vehicle can be used to
compute the misalignment of the sensor to the IMU and thus vehicle. In some
cases the model predications and test results exceeded the requirements by an
order of magnitude with a 3-sigma or 99% confidence.
