The dynamics of samples in the continuous-imaginary-time quantum world-line
Monte Carlo simulations with extended ensembles are investigated. In the case
of a conventional flat ensemble on the one-dimensional quantum S=1 bi-quadratic
model, the asymmetric behavior of Monte Carlo samples appears in the diffusion
process in the space of the number of vertices. We prove that a local
diffusivity is asymptotically proportional to the number of vertices, and we
demonstrate the asymmetric behavior in the flat ensemble case. On the basis of
the asymptotic form, we propose the weight of an optimal ensemble as
$1/\sqrt{n}$, where $n$ denotes the number of vertices in a sample. It is shown
that the asymmetric behavior completely vanishes in the case of the proposed
ensemble on the one-dimensional quantum S=1 bi-quadratic model.
