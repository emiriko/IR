The increasing complexity and the short life cycles of embedded systems are
pushing the current system-on-chip designs towards a rapid increasing on the
number of programmable processing units, while decreasing the gate count for
custom logic. Considering this trend, this work proposes a test planning method
capable of reusing available processors as test sources and sinks, and the
on-chip network as the test access mechanism. Experimental results are based on
ITC'02 benchmarks and on two open core processors compliant with MIPS and SPARC
instruction set. The results show that the cooperative use of both the on-chip
network and the embedded processors can increase the test parallelism and
reduce the test time without additional cost in area and pins.
