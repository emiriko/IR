Dynamics of the magnetization in ferromagnets is examined in the presence of
transport electrons allowing the latter to interact. It is found that the
existence of inhomogeneities such as domain wall (DW) structures, leads to
changes that affect the dynamical structure of the equations of motion for the
magnetization. Only in the limit of uniform magnetizations or sufficiently wide
DW's, the equations of motion maintain the form they have in the noninteracting
case. In this limit, results like the spin torques, the Gilbert parameter, and
the DW velocities become renormalized. However the length scale that defines
such a limit depends on the strength of the interaction. It is shown that if
large ferromagnetic fluctuations exist in the metallic band then the range for
which conformity with the noninteracting case holds extends to the limit of
arbitrarily narrow DW's.
