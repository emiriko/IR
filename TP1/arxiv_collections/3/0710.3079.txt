We provide a method of converting Lagrange and Finsler spaces and their
Legendre transforms to Hamilton and Cartan spaces into almost Kaehler
structures on tangent and cotangent bundles. In particular cases, the Hamilton
spaces contain nonholonomic lifts of (pseudo) Riemannian / Einstein metrics on
effective phase spaces. This allows us to define the corresponding Fedosov
operators and develop deformation quantization schemes for nonlinear mechanical
and gravity models on Lagrange- and Hamilton-Fedosov manifolds.
