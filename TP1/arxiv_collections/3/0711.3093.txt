In his preprint, arXiv:0711.0952v1, Behnam Farid argues that the Luttinger
theorem is valid not only for a metal but also for a Mott insulator if the
chemical potential is calculated by taking the limit of vanishing temperature
at fixed particle density. In contrast, we have found in our recent paper (Eur.
Phys. J. B 59, 495 (2007) or arXiv:cond-mat/0602656) on the basis of a
controlled strong coupling expansion that the Luttinger theorem is violated in
this limit for a particle-hole asymmetric two-band Mott insulator. In an
extensive discussion of our result Farid argues that an arbitrarily weak
breaking of particle-hole symmetry leads to a destruction of the Mott
insulating state at half filling. In this comment we point out that this is not
correct.
