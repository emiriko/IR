This article gives a natural decomposition of the suspension of generalized
moment-angle complexes or {\it partial product spaces} which arise as {\it
polyhedral product functors} described below.
  In the special case of the complements of certain subspace arrangements, the
geometrical decomposition implies the homological decomposition in
Goresky-MacPherson \cite{goresky.macpherson}, Hochster\cite{hochster}, Baskakov
\cite{baskakov}, Panov \cite{panov}, and Buchstaber-Panov
\cite{buchstaber.panov}. Since the splitting is geometric, an analogous
homological decomposition for a generalized moment-angle complex applies for
any homology theory. This decomposition gives an additive decomposition for the
Stanley-Reisner ring of a finite simplicial complex and generalizations of
certain homotopy theoretic results of Porter \cite{porter} and Ganea
\cite{ganea}. The spirit of the work here follows that of Denham-Suciu in
\cite{denham.suciu}.
