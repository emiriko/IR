In this article we discuss the problem of finding an interpretation of
quantum mechanics which provides an objective account of physical reality. In
the first place we discuss the problem of interpretation and analyze the
importance of such an objective account in physics. In this context we present
the problems which arise when interpreting the quantum wave function within the
orthodox formulation of quantum mechanics. In connection to this critic, we
expose the concept of 'entity' as an epistemological obstruction.
  In the second part of this paper we discuss the relation between actuality
and potentiality in classical and quantum physics, and continue to present the
concept of 'ontological potentiality' which is distinguished from the generic
Aristotelian notion of potentiality in terms of 'becoming actual'. In this
paper our main aim is to provide an objective interpretation of quantum
mechanics which allows us to discuss the meaning of physical reality according
to the theory. For this specific propose we present the concept of 'faculty' in
place of the concept of 'entity'. Within our theory of faculties, we continue
to discuss and interpret two paradigmatic experiments of quantum mechanics such
as the double-slit and Schrodinger's cat.
