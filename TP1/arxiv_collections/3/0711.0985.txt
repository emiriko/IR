The littlest Higgs model with T-parity ($LHT$ model) predicts the existence
of the T-odd scalars ($\phi^{\pm}$, $\phi^{0}$, and $\phi^{p}$). We consider
production of these new particles associated with T-odd gauge bosons at the
$LHC$. We find that the partonic process $q\bar{q'}\to\phi^{+}B_{H}$ can
generate a number of the characteristic signal events with a charged lepton and
large missing energy at the $LHC$.
