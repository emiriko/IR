We discuss how dynamical fermion computations may be made yet cheaper by
using symplectic integrators that conserve energy much more accurately without
decreasing the integration step size. We first explain why symplectic
integrators exactly conserve a ``shadow'' Hamiltonian close to the desired one,
and how this Hamiltonian may be computed in terms of Poisson brackets. We then
discuss how classical mechanics may be implemented on Lie groups and derive the
form of the Poisson brackets and force terms for some interesting integrators
such as those making use of second derivatives of the action (Hessian or force
gradient integrators). We hope that these will be seen to greatly improve
energy conservation for only a small additional cost and that their use will
significantly reduce the cost of dynamical fermion computations.
