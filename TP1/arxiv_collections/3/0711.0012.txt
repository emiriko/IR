In this paper we will show that using the cosmological constant as a new
thermodynamical state variable, the differential and integral mass formulas of
the first law of thermodynamics for asymptotic flat spacetimes can be extended
to be used at the two horizons of the (2+1) dimensional BTZ black hole. We also
extend this equations to the stringy description of the BTZ black hole, in
which two new systems that resemble the right and left modes of effective
string theory, are defined in terms of the inner and outer horizons.
