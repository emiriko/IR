We present the latest version 2.6 of FeynHiggs, a program for computing MSSM
Higgs-boson masses and related observables, such as mixing angles, branching
ratios, and couplings, including state-of-the-art higher-order contributions.
The most important new feature is the inclusion of the fully complex
O(\alpha_t\alpha_s) two-loop corrections, which enables FeynHiggs to give the
most precise Higgs-mass evaluation in the complex MSSM in the
Feynman-diagrammatic approach to date.
