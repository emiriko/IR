Squashed entanglement is a promising entanglement measure that can be
generalized to multipartite case, and it has all of the desirable properties
for a good entanglement measure. In this paper we present computable lower
bounds to evaluate the multipartite squashed entanglement. We also derive some
inequalities relating the squashed entanglement to the other entanglement
measure.
