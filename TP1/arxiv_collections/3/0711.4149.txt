Current quantum computer technology is sufficient to realize weak
measurements and the corresponding concept of weak values. We demonstrate how
the weak value anomaly can be tested, along with consistency and simultaneity
of weak values, using only discrete degrees of freedom. All you need is a
quantum computer with two--or better, three--qubits. We also give an
interpretation of the weak value as an effective field strength in a
postselected spin measurement.
