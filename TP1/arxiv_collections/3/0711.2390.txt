General formulas describing deuteron spin dynamics in storage rings with
allowance for the tensor electric and magnetic polarizabilities are derived. It
is found that an initially tensor-polarized deuteron beam can acquire a final
horizontal vector polarization of the order of 1%. This effect allows one to
measure the tensor magnetic polarizability of the deuteron in storage ring
experiments. We also confirm an existence of the effect found by Baryshevsky
and Gurinovich, hep-ph/0506135 and Baryshevsky, hep-ph/0510158; hep-ph/0603191
that the tensor magnetic polarizability of the deuteron causes the spin
rotation with two frequencies and experiences beating for polarized deuteron
beams in storage rings.
