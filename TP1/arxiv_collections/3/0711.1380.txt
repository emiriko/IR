Preliminaries for Many-Particle approach to quantization of Einstein-Hilbert
theory of gravitation are presented in this paper. Einstein-Friedmann Spacetime
is detailed discussed from this point of view. Von Neumann-Araki-Woods second
quantization in Fock space of canonical Hamilton field equations is presented.
In result Spacetime as system with Bose-Einstein statistics is described and
thermodynamics of the system is computed.
