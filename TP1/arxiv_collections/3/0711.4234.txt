Recent theoretical results on magnetotransport of electrons in a 2D system in
the range of moderately strong transverse magnetic fields are reviewed. The
phenomena discussed include: quasiclassical memory effects in systems with
various types of disorder, transport in lateral superlattices,
interaction-induced quantum magnetoresistance, quantum magnetooscillations in
dc and ac transport, and oscillatory microwave photoconductivity.
