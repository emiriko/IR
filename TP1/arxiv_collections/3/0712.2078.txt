In quantum mechanics with minimal length uncertainty relations the
Heisenberg-Weyl algebra of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is a
deformed SU(1,1) algebra. The eigenvalues and eigenstates are constructed
algebraically and they form the infinite-dimensional representation of the
deformed SU(1,1) algebra. Our construction is independent of prior knowledge of
the exact solution of the Schr\"odinger equation of the model. The approach can
be generalized to the $D$-dimensional oscillator with non-commuting
coordinates.
