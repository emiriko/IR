We introduce a novel type of time-averaged trap, in which the internal state
of the atoms is rapidly modulated to modify magnetic trapping potentials. In
our experiment, fast radiofrequency (rf) linear sweeps flip the spin of atoms
at a fast rate, which averages out magnetic forces. We use this procedure to
optimize the accumulation of metastable chomium atoms into an optical dipole
trap from a magneto-optical trap. The potential experienced by the metastable
atoms is identical to the bare optical dipole potential, so that this procedure
allows for trapping all magnetic sublevels, hence increasing by up to 80
percent the final number of accumulated atoms.
