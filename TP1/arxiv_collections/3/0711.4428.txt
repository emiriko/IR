Relativistic energy shifts of the low energy levels of Fe have been
calculated using the Dirac-Hartree-Fock and configuration interaction
techniques. The results are to be used in the search for the space-time
variation of the fine structure constant in quasar absorption spectra. The
values of the shifts are the largest among those used in the analysis so far.
This makes Fe a good candidate for the inclusion into the analysis.
