Applying the contact density chain-growth algorithm to lattice
heteropolymers, we identify the conformational transitions of a nongrafted
hydrophobic-polar heteropolymer with 103 residues in the vicinity of a polar, a
hydrophobic, and a uniformly attractive substrate. Introducing only two system
parameters, the numbers of surface contacts and intrinsic hydrophobic contacts,
respectively, we obtain surprisingly complex temperature and solvent dependent,
substrate-specific pseudo-phase diagrams.
