Exact calculations of the electron-positron pair production by a single
photon in the Coulomb field of a nucleus with simultaneous capture of the
electron into the K-shell are discussed for different nuclear charges. Using
the equivalent photon method of Weizsaecker and Williams, a simple expression
for the bound-free production of electron-positron pairs by colliding
very-high-energy fully stripped heavy ions is derived for nuclei of arbitrary
charge.
