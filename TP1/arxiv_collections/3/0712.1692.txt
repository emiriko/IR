Given a data set (t_i, y_i), i=1,..., n with the t_i in [0,1] non-parametric
regression is concerned with the problem of specifying a suitable function
f_n:[0,1] -> R such that the data can be reasonably approximated by the points
(t_i, f_n(t_i)), i=1,..., n. If a data set exhibits large variations in local
behaviour, for example large peaks as in spectroscopy data, then the method
must be able to adapt to the local changes in smoothness. Whilst many methods
are able to accomplish this they are less successful at adapting derivatives.
In this paper we show how the goal of local adaptivity of the function and its
first and second derivatives can be attained in a simple manner using weighted
smoothing splines. A residual based concept of approximation is used which
forces local adaptivity of the regression function together with a global
regularization which makes the function as smooth as possible subject to the
approximation constraints.
