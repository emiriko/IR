We devise a scheme that protects quantum coherent states of light from
probabilistic losses, thus achieving the first continuous-variable quantum
erasure-correcting code. If the occurrence of erasures can be probed, then the
decoder enables, in principle, a perfect recovery of the original light states.
Otherwise, if supplemented with postselection based on homodyne detection, this
code can be turned into an efficient erasure-filtration scheme. The
experimental feasibility of the proposed protocol is carefully addressed.
