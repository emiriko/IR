Based on \cite{DH94}, we introduce a bijective correspondence between first
order differential calculi and the graph structure of the symmetric lattice
that allows one to encode completely the interconnection structure of the graph
in the exterior derivative. As a result, we obtain the Grassmannian character
of the lattice as well as the mutual commutativity between basic vector-fields
on the tangent space.
  This in turn gives several similarities between the Clifford setting and the
algebra of endomorphisms endowed by the graph structure, such as the hermitian
structure of the lattice as well as the Clifford-like algebra of operators
acting on the lattice. This naturally leads to a discrete version of Clifford
Analysis.
