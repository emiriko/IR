The measurements at RHIC have revealed a new state of matter, which needs to
be further characterized in order to better understand its implications for the
early evolution of the universe and QCD. I will show that, in the near future,
complementary key measurements can be performed at RHIC, LHC, and FAIR. I will
focus on results than can be obtained using identified particles, a probe which
has been the basis for this conference over the past three decades. The
sophisticated detectors, built and planned, for all three accelerator
facilities enable us to measure leptons, photons, muons as well as hadrons and
resonances of all flavors almost equally well, which makes these experiments
unprecedented precision tools for the comprehensive understanding of the
physics of the early universe.
