We investigate the dispersion and the absorption properties of a weak probe
field in a three-level pump-probe atomic system. It is shown that the slope of
dispersion changes from positive to negative just with the intensity of the
coherent or indirect incoherent pumping fields. It is demonstrated that the
absorption free superluminal light propagation is appeared in this system.
