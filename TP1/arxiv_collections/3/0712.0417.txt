General relativistic deflection of light by mass, dipole, and quadrupole
moments of gravitational field of a moving massive planet in the Solar system
is derived in the approximation of the linearized Einstein equations. All terms
of order 1 microarcsecond are taken into account, parametrized, and classified
in accordance with their physical origin. We discuss the observational
capabilities of the near-future optical and radio interferometers for detecting
the Doppler modulation of the radial deflection, and the dipolar and
quadrupolar light-ray bendings by Jupiter and the Saturn.
