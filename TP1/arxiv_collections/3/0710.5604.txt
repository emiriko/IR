The aim of the NEMO 3 experiment is the search for neutrinoless double beta
decay and precise measurement of two-neutrino double beta decay of several
isotopes. The experiment has been taking data since 2003. Since no evidence for
neutrinoless double beta decay of Mo100 and Se82 has been found, a 90% C.L.
lower limit on the half-life of this process and corresponding upper limit on
the effective Majorana neutrino mass are derived. The data are also interpreted
in terms of alternative models, such as weak right-handed currents or Majoron
emission. In addition, NEMO 3 has performed precision measurements of the
two-neutrino double beta decay for seven different isotopes. The most recent
experimental results of NEMO 3 are presented in this paper.
