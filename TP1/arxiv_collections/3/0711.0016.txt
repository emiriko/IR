This paper introduces a conceptual framework, in the context of quantum
topology and the algebras underlying it, for analyzing relations obeyed by the
chromatic polynomial \chi(Q) of planar graphs. Using it we give new proofs and
substantially extend a number of classical results concerning the combinatorics
of the chromatic polynomial. In particular, we show that Tutte's golden
identity is a consequence of level-rank duality for SO(N) topological quantum
field theories and Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebras. This identity is a
remarkable feature of the chromatic polynomial relating \chi({\phi+2}) for any
triangulation of the sphere to (\chi({\phi+1}))^2 for the same graph, where
\phi denotes the golden ratio. The new viewpoint presented here explains that
Tutte's identity is special to these values of the parameter Q. A natural
context for analyzing such properties of the chromatic polynomial is provided
by the {\em chromatic algebra}, whose Markov trace is the chromatic polynomial
of an associated graph. We use it to show that another identity of Tutte's for
the chromatic polynomial at Q={\phi}+1 arises from a Jones-Wenzl projector in
the Temperley-Lieb algebra. We generalize this identity to each value Q=
2+2\cos(2\pi j/(n+1)) for j< n positive integers. When j=1, these Q are the
Beraha numbers, where the existence of such identities was conjectured by
Tutte. We present a recursive formula for this sequence of chromatic polynomial
relations.
