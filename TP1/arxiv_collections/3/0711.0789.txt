We present our finding that an especially simple scaling expression describes
the formation of a new state of quantum matter, the Kondo Fermi liquid (KL) in
heavy electron materials. Emerging at $T^*$ as a result of the collective
coherent hybridization of localized f electrons and conduction electrons, the
KL possesses a non-Landau density of states varying as
$(1-T/T^*)^{3/2}[1+\ln(T^*/T)]$. We show that four independent experimental
probes verify this scaling behavior and that for CeIrIn$_5$ the KL state
density is in excellent agreement with the recent microscopic calculations of
hybridization in this material by Shim, Haule, and Kotliar.
