Graphene nanoribbons are the counterpart of carbon nanotubes in
graphene-based nanoelectronics. We investigate the electronic properties of
chemically modified ribbons by means of density functional theory. We observe
that chemical modifications of zigzag ribbons can break the spin degeneracy.
This promotes the onset of a semiconducting-metal transition, or of an
half-semiconducting state, with the two spin channels having a different
bandgap, or of a spin-polarized half-semiconducting state -where the spins in
the valence and conduction bands are oppositely polarized. Edge
functionalization of armchair ribbons gives electronic states a few eV away
from the Fermi level, and does not significantly affect their bandgap. N and B
produce different effects, depending on the position of the substitutional
site. In particular, edge substitutions at low density do not significantly
alter the bandgap, while bulk substitution promotes the onset of
semiconducting-metal transitions. Pyridine-like defects induce a
semiconducting-metal transition.
