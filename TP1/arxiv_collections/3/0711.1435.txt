The PDG Tables list more scalar mesons than can fit into one quark model
nonet: indeed, even more than can belong to two multiplets. Consequently, some
of these must be states beyond the quark model. So which of these is ${\bar
q}q$ or ${\bar{qq}}qq$ or multi-meson molecule or largely glue? How experiment
can help us distinguish between these possibilities is discussed.
