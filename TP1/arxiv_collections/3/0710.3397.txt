In spite of the fact that statistical predictions of quantum theory (QT) can
only be tested if large amount of data is available a claim has been made that
QT provides the most complete description of an individual physical system.
Einstein's opposition to this claim and the paradox he presented in the article
written together with Podolsky and Rosen in 1935 inspired generations of
physicists in their quest for better understanding of QT. Seventy years after
EPR article it is clear that without deep understanding of the character and
limitations of QT one may not hope to find a meaningful unified theory of all
physical interactions, manipulate qubits or construct a quantum computer. In
this paper we present shortly the EPR paper and the discussion which followed
it. By emphasizing the difference between quantum phenomena and hypothetical
invisible sub phenomena we show that paradoxes are only found if incorrect
models of sub phenomena are used. The violation of Bell and CHSH inequalities
demonstrate clearly that "an entangled pair of photons" resembles neither "a
pair of Bertlmann's socks" nor "a pair of fair and random dices". Finally we
rephrase the EPR question by asking whether QT provides the complete
description of experimental data.
