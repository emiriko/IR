This paper reports the first application of a new technique to measure the
beta-decay half -lives of exotic nuclei in complex background conditions. Since
standard tools were not adapted to extract the relevant information, a new
analysis method was developed. The time distribution of background events is
established by recording time correlations in backward time. The beta half
lives of the nuclides and the detection efficiency of the set-up are determined
simultaneously from a least-squares fit of the ratio of the time-correlation
spectra recorded in forward and in backward time, using numerical functions.
The necessary numerical functions are calculated in a Monte-Carlo code using
the known operation parameters of the experiment and different values for the
two free parameters, half-life and detection efficiency, as input parameters.
