Atom-molecule equilibrium for molecular formation processes is discussed for
boson-fermion, fermion-fermion, and boson-boson mixtures of ultracold atomic
gases in the framework of quasichemical equilibrium theory. After presentation
of the general formulation, zero-temperature phase diagrams of the
atom-molecule equilibrium states are calculated analytically; molecular, mixed,
and dissociated phases are shown to appear for the change of the binding energy
of the molecules. The temperature dependences of the atom or molecule densities
are calculated numerically, and finite-temperature phase structures are
obtained of the atom-molecule equilibrium in the mixtures. The transition
temperatures of the atom or molecule Bose-Einstein condensations are also
evaluated from these results. Quantum-statistical deviations of the law of mass
action in atom-molecule equilibrium, which should be satisfied in mixtures of
classical Maxwell-Boltzmann gases, are calculated, and the difference in the
different types of quantum-statistical effects is clarified. Mean-field
calculations with interparticle interactions (atom-atom, atom-molecule, and
molecule-molecule) are formulated, where interaction effects are found to give
the linear density-dependent term in the effective molecular binding energies.
This method is applied to calculations of zero-temperature phase diagrams,
where new phases with coexisting local-equilibrium states are shown to appear
in the case of strongly repulsive interactions.
