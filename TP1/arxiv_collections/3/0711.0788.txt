The use of non-regular representations of the Heisenberg-Weyl commutation
relations has proved to be useful for studying conceptual and technical issues
in quantum gravity. Of particular relevance is the study of Loop Quantum
Cosmology (LQC), a symmetry reduced theory that is related to Loop Quantum
Gravity, and that is based on a non-regular, polymeric representation.
Recently, a soluble model was used by Ashtekar, Corichi and Singh to study the
relation between Loop Quantum Cosmology and the standard Wheeler-DeWitt theory
and in particular the passage to the limit in which the auxiliary parameter
(interpreted as "quantum geometry discreetness") is sent to zero in hope to get
rid of this `regulator ambiguity' in the LQC dynamics. In this note we outline
the first steps toward reformulating this question within the program developed
by the authors for studying the continuum limit of polymeric theories, which
was successfully applied to simple systems such as a Simple Harmonic Oscillator
and the Free Particle.
