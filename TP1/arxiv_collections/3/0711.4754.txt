Recently proposed idea of unparticles arising due to a scale invariant sector
in the theory can give rise to effective operators with different Lorentz
structures. We show that by using the different polarization options at the
future linear e+e- colliders, the nature of these effective operators can be
easily understood. The unique feature of a complex phase in the propagator of
the unparticle can also be understood uniquely for the different spins by
exploiting the initial beam polarizations at the International Linear Collider
(ILC).
