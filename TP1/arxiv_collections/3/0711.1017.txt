We show that weighted unitary 2-designs define optimal measurements on the
system-ancilla output state for ancilla-assisted process tomography of unital
quantum channels. Examples include complete sets of mutually unbiased
unitary-operator bases. Each of these specifies a minimal series of optimal
orthogonal measurements. General quantum channels are also considered.
