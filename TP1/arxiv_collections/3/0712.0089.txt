The ability of the coupled-channels model (MSL) developed in recently in Ref.
\cite{msl} to account simultaneously for the $\pi N$ scattering data and the
$\pi$ photoproduction reactions on the nucleon is presented. An accurate
description of $\pi N$ scattering has been obtained. A preliminary description
of $\pi$ photoproduction is also discussed.
