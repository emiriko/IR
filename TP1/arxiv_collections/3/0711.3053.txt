Highly segmented inorganic crystal has been shown to have good performance
for dark matter search. The energy resolution of ultra thin and large area
NaI(Tl) scintillator has been developed. The estimated sensitivity for
spin-dependent excitation of 127I was discussed. The recent status of low
background measurement at Oto Cosmo Observatory is reported
