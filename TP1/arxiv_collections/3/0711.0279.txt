Stochasticity is one of the most extensively researched topics in laboratory
and space plasmas since it has been successful in explaining the various
anomalous processes like transport, particle heating, particle loss etc. Since
there is a growing need for better understanding of this nonlinear process, it
has led to the development of new and more advanced data analysis techniques.
In this paper we present an analysis of the floating potential fluctuations
which show the existence of a stochastic multifractal process along with low
dimensional chaos. This has been shown primarily by wavelet analysis, and cross
checked using other nonlinear techniques.
