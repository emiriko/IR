We study the spectrum of the product of two Toeplitz operators. Assume that
the symbols of these operators are continuous and real-valued and that one of
them is non-negative. We prove that the spectrum of the product of finite
section Toeplitz matrices converges to the spectrum of the product of the
semi-infinite Toeplitz operators. We give an example showing that the supremum
of this set is not always the supremum of the product of the two symbols.
Finally, we provide an application in probability which is the first motivation
of this study. More precisely, we obtain a large deviation principle for
Gaussian quadratic forms.
