We measured the variable temperature infrared response of the spin ladder
candidate (DTTTF)2Cu(mnt)2 in order to distinguish between two competing ladder
models, rectangular versus zigzag, proposed for this family of materials. The
distortion along the stack direction below 235 K is consistent with a doubling
along b through the metal-insulator transition. While this would agree with
either of the ladder models, the concomitant transverse distortion rules out
the rectangular ladder model and supports the zigzag scenario. Intramolecular
distortions within the DTTTF building block molecule also give rise to on-site
charge asymmetry.
