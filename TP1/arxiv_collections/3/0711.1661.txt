LHCb is a dedicated flavor physics experiment that will observe the 14 TeV
proton-proton collisions at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Construction of
the LHCb detector is near completion, commissioning of the detector is well
underway, and LHCb will be fully operational and ready to take data in advance
of the projected May 2008 turn-on date for the LHC. The LHCb software trigger
will feature a dedicated channel for events containing D* mesons that will
dramatically enhance the statistical reach of LHCb in many charm physics
measurements. The LHCb charm physics program is initially focused on mixing and
CP violation measurements in two body decay modes of D0. A much broader program
is possible and will be explored as manpower allows. We intend to use both
promptly produced charm and secondary charm from B meson decays in
measurements. Initial studies have focused on using secondary D*+ mesons for
mixing measurements in two body decays. Preliminary Monte Carlo studies
indicate that LHCb may obtain a statistical precision of \sigma(x'^2) = +/-
0.064 x 10^{-3} (stat) and \sigma(y') = +/- 0.87 x 10^{-3} (stat) from a time
dependent mixing analysis of wrong sign two body D0 --> pi- K+ decays and a
statistical precision of \sigma(y_{CP}) = +/- 0.5 x 10^{-3} (stat) from a ratio
of the lifetimes of D0 decays to the final states K- K+ and K- pi+ in 10
fb^{-1} of data.
