The propagation of guided electromagnetic waves in open elliptical
metamaterial waveguide structures is investigated. The waveguide contains a
negative-index media core, where the permittivity, $\epsilon$ and permeability
$\mu$ are negative over a given bandwidth. The allowed mode spectrum for these
structures is numerically calculated by solving a dispersion relation that is
expressed in terms of Mathieu functions. By probing certain regions of
parameter space, we find the possibility exists to have extremely localized
waves that transmit along the surface of the waveguide.
