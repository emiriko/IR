An asymptotic model based on a reductive perturbative expansion of the drift
kinetic and the Maxwell equations is used to demonstrate that, near the
instability threshold, the nonlinear dynamics of mirror modes in a magnetized
plasma with anisotropic ion temperatures involves a subcritical
bifurcation,leading to the formation of small-scale structures with amplitudes
comparable with the ambient magnetic field.
