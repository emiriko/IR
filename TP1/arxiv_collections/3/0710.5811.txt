Pinning interaction between a screw dislocation and a void in fcc copper is
investigated by means of molecular dynamics simulation. A screw dislocation
bows out to undergo depinning on the original glide plane at low temperatures,
where the behavior of the depinning stress is consistent with that obtained by
a continuum model. If the temperature is higher than 300 K, the motion of a
screw dislocation is no longer restricted to a single glide plane due to cross
slip on the void surface. Several depinning mechanisms that involve multiple
glide planes are found. In particular, a depinning mechanism that produces an
intrinsic prismatic loop is found. We show that these complex depinning
mechanisms significantly increase the depinning stress.
