We demonstrate two solid-state sources of indistinguishable single photons.
High resolution laser spectroscopy and optical microscopy were combined at T =
1.4 K to identify individual molecules in two independent microscopes. The
Stark effect was exploited to shift the transition frequency of a given
molecule and thus obtain single photon sources with perfect spectral overlap.
Our experimental arrangement sets the ground for the realization of various
quantum interference and information processing experiments.
