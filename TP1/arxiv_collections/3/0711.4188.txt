A model of an emergent universe is obtained in brane world. Here the bulk
energy is in the form of cosmological constant, while the brane consists of a
fluid satisfying an equation of state of the form $p_{b}={1/3} \rho_{b}$, which
is effectively a radiation equation of state at high energies. It is shown that
with the positive bulk cosmological constant, one of our models represents an
emergent universe.
