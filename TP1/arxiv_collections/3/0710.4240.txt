The mass spectrum of the 3d 3-state Potts model is considered in the broken
phase (a) near the second order Ising critical point in the
temperature-magnetic field plane and (b) near the weakly first order transition
point at zero magnetic field. In the case (a), the mass spectrum is compared
with the prediction from universality of mass ratios in the 3d Ising class; in
the case (b) a mass ratio is determined to be compared with the corresponding
one in the spectrum of screening masses of the (3+1)d SU(3) pure gauge theory
at finite temperature in the deconfined phase near the transition.
