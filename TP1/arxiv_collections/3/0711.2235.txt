We use the dynamical cluster approximation, with a quantum Monte Carlo
cluster solver on clusters of up to 16 orbitals, to investigate the evolution
of the Fermi surface across the magnetic order-disorder transition in the
two-dimensional doped Kondo lattice model. In the paramagnetic phase we observe
the generic hybridized heavy fermion band structure with large Luttinger
volume. In the antiferromagnetic phase, the heavy fermion band drops below the
Fermi surface giving way to hole pockets centered around k=(pi/2,pi/2) and
equivalent points. In this phase Kondo screening does not break down but the
topology of the resulting Fermi surface is that of a spin-density wave
approximation in which the localized spins are frozen.
