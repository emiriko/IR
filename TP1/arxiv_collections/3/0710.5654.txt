We study combinatorial blocks of multipartitions, exploring further the
notions of weight, hub and core block introduced by the author in earlier
papers. We answer the question of which pairs (w,theta) occur as the weight and
hub of a block, and we examine the action of the affine Weyl group on the set
of blocks.
