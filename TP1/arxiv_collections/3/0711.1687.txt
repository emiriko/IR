The observed pattern of neutrino mass splittings and mixing angles indicates
that their family structure is significantly different from that of the charged
fermions. We investigate the implications of these data for the fermion mass
matrices in grand unified theories with a type-I seesaw mechanism. We show
that, with simple assumptions, naturalness leads to a strongly hierarchical
Majorana mass matrix for heavy right-handed neutrinos and a partially cascade
form for the Dirac neutrino matrix. We consider various model building
scenarios which could alter this conclusion, and discuss their consequences for
the construction of a natural model. We find that including partially lopsided
matrices can aid us in generating a satisfying model.
