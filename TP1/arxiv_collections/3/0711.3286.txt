Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) thin films were in situ deposited by pulsed laser
deposition (PLD) on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates using a template layer derived by
sol-gel method. A 0.1-$\mu$m-thick PZT layer with (111) or (100)-preferred
orientation was first deposited onto Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates using the sol-gel
method, and than a PZT layer with thickness of 1$\mu$m was in situ deposited by
PLD on the above-mentioned PZT layer. The crystalline phases and the preferred
orientations of the PZT films were investigated by X-ray diffraction analysis.
Surface and cross-sectional morphologies were observed by scanning electron
microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The electrical properties of
the films were evaluated by measuring their P-E hysteresis loops and dielectric
constants. The preferred orientation of the films can be controlled using the
template layer derived by the sol-gel method. The deposition temperature
required to obtain the perovskite phase in this process is approximately 460
degrees C, and is significantly lower than that in the case of direct film
deposition by PLD on the Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates.
