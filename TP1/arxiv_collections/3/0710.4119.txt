We determine the static quark free energies around the transition temperature
using 2+1 flavors of staggered fermions. Simulations are carried out on
N_t=4,6,8 and 10 lattices using physical quark masses. The free energies
extracted from Polyakov-loop correlators are extrapolated to the continuum
limit.
