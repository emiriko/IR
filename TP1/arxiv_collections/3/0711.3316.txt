This paper investigates how the power generated by electromagnetic based
vibrational power generators scales with the dimension of the generator. The
effects of scaling on the magnetic fields, the coil parameters and the
electromagnetic damping are presented. An analysis is presented for both
wire-wound coil technology and micro-fabricated coils.
