The replicator dynamics of players choosing either mixed or pure strategies
are usually regarded as equivalent, as long as strategies are played with
identical frequencies. In this paper we show that a population of pure
strategists can be invaded by mixed strategists in any two-player game with
equilibrium coexistence upon the addition of an arbitrarily small amount of
noise in the replication process.
