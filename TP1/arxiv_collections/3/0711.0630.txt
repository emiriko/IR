A framework for discussing relationships between different types of games is
proposed. Within the framework, quantum simultaneous games, finite quantum
simultaneous games, quantum sequential games, and finite quantum sequential
games are defined. In addition, a notion of equivalence between two games is
defined. Finally, the following three theorems are shown: (1) For any quantum
simultaneous game G, there exists a quantum sequential game equivalent to G.
(2) For any finite quantum simultaneous game G, there exists a finite quantum
sequential game equivalent to G. (3) For any finite quantum sequential game G,
there exists a finite quantum simultaneous game equivalent to G.
