A fast readout system for the upgrade of the COMPASS RICH detector has been
developed and successfully used for data taking in 2006 and 2007. The new
readout system for the multi-anode PMTs in the central part of the photon
detector of the RICH is based on the high-sensitivity MAD4
preamplifier-discriminator and the dead-time free F1-TDC chip characterized by
high-resolution. The readout electronics has been designed taking into account
the high photon flux in the central part of the detector and the requirement to
run at high trigger rates of up to 100 kHz with negligible dead-time. The
system is designed as a very compact setup and is mounted directly behind the
multi-anode photomultipliers. The data are digitized on the frontend boards and
transferred via optical links to the readout system. The read-out electronics
system is described in detail together with its measured performances.
