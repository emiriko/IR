Recently, Belle Collaboration has reported a resonant state produced in $B\to
K \pi\psi'$, which is called Z(4430). This state is charged, so it can not be
interpreted as an ordinary charmonium state. In this paper, we analyze the
octet to which this particle belongs and predict the masses of mesons in this
octet. Utilizing flavor SU(3) symmetry, we study production rates in several
kinds of B decays. The $\bar B^0\to Z_s^-\pi^+\to K^-\psi'\pi^+$ and $B^-\to
\bar Z_s^0 \pi^-\to K_S\psi'\pi^-$ decay channels, favored by
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements, can have branching ratios of
${\cal O}(10^{-5})$. This large branching ratio could be observed at the
running $B$ factories to detect $Z_s$ particles containing a strange quark. We
also predict large branching ratios of the $Z$ and $Z_c$ ($\bar cc\bar c D,
D=u,d,s$) particle production rates in non-leptonic $B_c$ decays and radiative
B decays. Measurements of these decays at the ongoing $B$ factories and the
forthcoming Large Hadron Collider (LHC)-b experiments are helpful to clarify
the mysterious $Z$ particles.
