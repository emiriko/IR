We present a review of bundle gerbes, emphasizing their relations to Lie
groups. Indeed, compact Lie groups do not only carry the structure of a
Riemannian manifold, but also canonical families of bundle gerbes. We recall
the construction of these bundle gerbes and their relation to loop groups. We
discuss several algebraic structures for bundle gerbes with connection such as
Jandl structures, gerbe modules and gerbe bimodules, and indicate their
applications to Wess-Zumino terms in two-dimensional field theories.
