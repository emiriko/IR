We develop a microscopic theory describing the peak in the temperature
dependence of the non-local resistance of three-terminal NSN devices. This peak
emerges at sufficiently high temperatures as a result of a competition between
quasiparticle/charge imbalance and subgap (Andreev) contributions to the
conductance matrix. Both the height and the shape of this peak demonstrate the
power law dependence on the superconductor thickness $L$ in contrast to the
zero-temperature non-local resistance which decays (roughly) exponentially with
increasing $L$. A similar behavior was observed in recent experiments.
