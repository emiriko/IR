We continue the program of constructing, within the Effective-One-Body (EOB)
approach, high accuracy, faithful analytic waveforms describing the
gravitational wave signal emitted by inspiralling and coalescing binary black
holes (BHs). We present the comparable-mass version of a new, resummed
3PN-accurate EOB quadrupolar waveform recently introduced in the
small-mass-ratio limit. We compare the phase and the amplitude of this waveform
to the recently published results of a high-accuracy numerical relativity (NR)
simulation of 15 orbits of an inspiralling equal-mass binary BHs system
performed by the Caltech-Cornell group. We find a remarkable agreement, both in
phase and in amplitude, between the new EOB waveform and the published
numerical data. More precisely: (i) in the gravitational wave (GW) frequency
domain $M\omega <0.08$ where the phase of one of the non-resummed ``Taylor
approximant'' (T4) waveform matches well with the numerical relativity one, we
find that the EOB phase fares as well, while (ii) for higher GW frequencies,
$0.08<M\omega\lesssim 0.14$, where the TaylorT4 approximant starts to
significantly diverge from the NR phase, we show that the EOB phase continues
to match well the NR one. We further propose various methods of tuning the two
inspiral flexibility parameters, $a_5$ and $v_{\rm pole}$, of the EOB waveform
so as to ``best fit'' EOB predictions to numerical data. We find that the
maximal dephasing between EOB and NR can then be reduced below $10^{-3}$ GW
cycles over the entire span (30 GW cycles) of the simulation. Our resummed EOB
amplitude agrees much better with the NR one than any of the previously
considered non-resummed, post-Newtonian one.
