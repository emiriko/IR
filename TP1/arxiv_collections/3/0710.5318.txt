In this paper, we study the phase diagram of a homogeneous Bose gas with a
repulsive interaction near a wide Feshbach resonance at zero temperature. The
Bose-Einstein-condensation (BEC) state of atoms is a metastable state. When the
scattering length $a$ exceeds a critical value depending on the atom density
$n$, $na^3>0.035$, the molecular excitation energy is imaginary and the atomic
BEC state is dynamically unstable against molecule formation. The BEC state of
diatomic molecules has lower energy, where the atomic excitation is gapped and
the molecular excitation is gapless. However when the scattering length is
above another critical value, $na^3>0.0164$, the molecular BEC state becomes a
unstable coherent mixture of atoms and molecules. In both BEC states, the
binding energy of diatomic molecules is reduced due to the many-body effect.
