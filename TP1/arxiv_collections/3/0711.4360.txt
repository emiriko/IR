We study two Higgs models for large $\tan\beta$ and relatively large second
Higgs mass. In this limit the second heavy Higgs should have small vev and
therefore couples only weakly to two gauge bosons. Furthermore, the couplings
to down type quarks can be significantly modified (so long as the second Higgs
is not overly heavy). Both these facts have significant implications for search
strategies at the LHC and ILC. We show how an effective theory and explicit
fundamental two Higgs model approach are related and consider the additional
constraints in the presence of supersymmetry or $Z_2$ flavor symmetries. We
argue that the best tests of the two Higgs doublet potential are likely to be
measurements of the light Higgs branching fractions. We show how higher
dimension operators that have recently been suggested to raise the light Higgs
mass are probably best measured and distinguished in this way.
