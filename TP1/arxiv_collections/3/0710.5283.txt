We discuss the theoretical input into the current RBC-UKQCD calculation of
$f_{B_{d, s}}$ and $B_{B_{d, s}}$ using a smeared static heavy quark
propagator, light domain-wall quarks and the Iwasaki gauge action. We present
the complete one-loop, mean-field improved matching of heavy-light current and
four-fermion lattice operators onto the static continuum theory renormalized in
$\bar{\text{MS}}$(NDR). The large degeneracies present in a static calculation
are addressed, and a method for extracting $f_B$ and $B_B$ using only box
sources is described; implications for future calculations are discussed.
