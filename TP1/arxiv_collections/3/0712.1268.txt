We present an ab initio DFT study of the magnetic moments that arise in
graphite by creating single carbon vacancies in a 3-D graphite network, using a
full potential, all electron, spin polarized electronic structure calculations.
In previous reports the appearance of magnetic moments was explained in a 2-D
graphene sheet just through the existence of the vacancies itself [1-5]. The
dependence of the arising magnetic moment on the nature and geometry of the
vacancies for different supercells is reported. We found that the highest value
of magnetic moment is obtained for a 3x3x1 supercell and that the highly
diluted 5x5x1 supercell shows no magnetic ordering. The results obtained in
this manuscript are indicative of the importance of interlayer interactions
present in a 3-D stacking. We conclude that this should not be underestimated
when vacancies-based studies on magnetism in graphitic systems are carried out.
