A recently introduced model for an autonomous swimmer at low Reynolds number
that is comprised of three spheres connected by two arms is considered when one
of the spheres has a large radius. The Stokes hydrodynamic flow associated with
the swimming strokes and net motion of this system can be studied analytically
using the Stokes Green's function of a point force in front of a sphere of
arbitrary radius $R$ provided by Oseen. The swimming velocity is calculated,
and shown to scale as $1/R^3$ with the radius of the sphere.
