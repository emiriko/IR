Scaling down of electronic systems has generated a large interest in the
research on miniature energy sources. In this paper a closer look is given to
the use of vibration based scavengers in industrial environments, where waste
energy is abundantly available as engine related vibrations or large amplitude
motions. The modeling of mechanical generators resulted in the design and
realization of two prototypes, based on electromagnetic and electrostatic
conversion of energy. Although the prototypes are not yet optimized against
size and efficiency, a power of 0.3 mW has been generated in a 5 Hz motion with
a 0.5 meter amplitude.
