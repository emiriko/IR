We present a fully analytical solution of the dynamics of two strongly-driven
atoms resonantly coupled to a dissipative cavity field mode. We show that an
initial atom-atom entanglement cannot be increased. In fact, the atomic Hilbert
space divides into two subspaces, one of which is decoherence free so that the
initial atomic entanglement remains available for applications, even in
presence of a low enough atomic decay rate. In the other subspace a measure of
entanglement, decoherence, and also purity, are described by a similar
functional behavior that can be monitored by joint atomic measurements.
Furthermore, we show the possible generation of Schr\"odinger-cat-like states
for the whole system in the transient regime, as well as of entanglement for
the cavity field and the atom-atom subsystems conditioned by measurements on
the complementary subsystem.
