Based on the idea that tensor unparticles can enhance the gravitational
interactions between standard model particles, potential black hole formation
in high energy collisions is examined. Modifications to the horizon radius
$r_H$ are derived, and the corresponding geometric cross-sections of such
objects are calculated. It is shown that $r_H$ increases dramatically to the
electroweak scale for masses $M_{BH} \sim 1-10 $TeV, yielding a geometric
cross-section $\sigma_{BH}=\pi r_H^2$ on the order of $leq 50$ pb. This
suggests that unparticle physics provides a mechanism for black hole formation
in future accelerators, without the requirement of extra spatial dimensions.
