The shape of two-dimensional invasion percolation clusters are studied
numerically for both non-trapping (NTIP) and trapping (TIP) invasion
percolation processes. Two different anisotropy quantifiers, the anisotropy
parameter and the asphericity are used for probing the degree of anisotropy of
clusters. We observe that in spite of the difference in scaling properties of
NTIP and TIP, there is no difference in the values of anisotropy quantifiers of
these processes. Furthermore, we find that in completely random media, the
invasion percolation clusters are on average slightly less isotropic than
standard percolation clusters. Introducing isotropic long-range correlations
into the media reduces the isotropy of the invasion percolation clusters. The
effect is more pronounced for the case of persisting long-range correlations.
The implication of boundary conditions on the shape of clusters is another
subject of interest. Compared to the case of free boundary conditions, IP
clusters of conventional rectangular geometry turn out to be more isotropic.
Moreover, we see that in conventional rectangular geometry the NTIP clusters
are more isotropic than TIP clusters.
