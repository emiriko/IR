We explore the subtle relationships between partial separability and
entanglement of subsystems in multiqubit quantum states and give experimentally
accessible conditions that distinguish between various classes and levels of
partial separability in a hierarchical order. These conditions take the form of
bounds on the correlations of locally orthogonal observables. Violations of
such inequalities give strong sufficient criteria for various forms of partial
inseparability and multiqubit entanglement. The strength of these criteria is
illustrated by showing that they are stronger than several other well-known
entanglement criteria (the fidelity criterion, violation of Mermin-type
separability inequalities, the Laskowski-\.Zukowski criterion and the
D\"ur-Cirac criterion), and also by showing their great noise robustness for a
variety of multiqubit states, including N-qubit GHZ states and Dicke states.
Furthermore, for N greater than or equal to 3 they can detect bound entangled
states. For all these states, the required number of measurement settings for
implementation of the entanglement criteria is shown to be only N+1. If one
chooses the familiar Pauli matrices as single-qubit observables, the
inequalities take the form of bounds on the anti-diagonal matrix elements of a
state in terms of its diagonal matrix elements.
