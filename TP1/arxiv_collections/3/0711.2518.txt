We present exact results for the spectrum of the Nth power of the Laplacian
in a bounded domain. We begin with the one dimensional case and show that the
whole spectrum can be obtained in the limit of large N. We also show that it is
a useful numerical approach valid for any N. Finally, we discuss implications
of this work and present its possible extensions for non integer N and for 3D
Laplacian problems.
