Recent preliminary results obtained by the CDF and DO Collaborations on
searches for Higgs bosons beyond the Standard Model at Run II of the Tevatron
are discussed. The data, corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 1
fb-1, are compared to theoretical expectations. No significant excess of signal
above the expected background is observed in any of the various final states
examined, and so limits at 95% Confidence Level (CL) are presented.
