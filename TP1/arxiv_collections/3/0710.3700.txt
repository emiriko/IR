We investigate nuclear matter, i.e. the nuclear equation-of-state (EOS) as
well as the relativistic mean fields in the chiral limit. The investigations
are based on a chiral nucleon-nucleon EFT interaction where the explicit and
implicit pion mass dependence is known up to next-to-leading order. The nuclear
bulk properties are found to remain fairly stable in the chiral limit. Based on
the same interaction the in-medium scalar condensate is derived, both in
Hartree-Fock approximation as well as from the Brueckner G-matrix, making
thereby use of the Hellman-Feynman theorem. Short distance physics which
determines the reduction of the in-medium nucleon mass is found to play only a
minor role for the reduction of the chiral condensate.
