We report on heavy quark mass calculations using Fermilab heavy quarks.
Lattice calculations of heavy-strange meson masses are combined with one-loop
(automated) lattice perturbation theory to arrive at the quark mass. Mesons are
constructed from Fermilab heavy quarks and staggered light quarks. We use the
MILC ensembles at three lattice spacings and sea quark mass ratios of $m_{\rm
u,d} / m_{\rm s} = 0.1$ to 0.4. Preliminary results for the bottom quark are
given in the potential subtracted scheme.
