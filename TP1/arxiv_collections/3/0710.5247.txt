Let $G$ be a simple algebraic group of type $A$ or $D$ defined over $\C$ and
$T$ be a maximal torus of $G$. For a dominant coweight $\lambda$ of $G$, the
$T$-fixed point subscheme $(\bar{Gr}_G^\lambda)^T$ of the Schubert variety
$\bar{Gr}_G^\lambda$ in the affine Grassmannian $Gr_G$ is a finite scheme. We
prove that there is a natural isomorphism between the dual of the level one
affine Demazure module corresponding to $\lambda$ and the ring of functions
(twisted by certain line bundle on $Gr_G$) of $(\bar{Gr}_G^\lambda)^T$. We use
this fact to give a geometric proof of the Frenkel-Kac-Segal isomorphism
between basic representations of affine algebras of $A,D,E$ type and lattice
vertex algebras.
