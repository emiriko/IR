We consider the Bethe Ansatz Equations for orbifolds of N =4 SYM w.r.t. an
arbitrary discrete group. Techniques used for the Abelian orbifolds can be
extended to the generic non-Abelian case with minor modifications. We show how
to make a transition between the different notations in the quiver gauge
theory.
