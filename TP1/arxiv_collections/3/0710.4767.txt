The relativistic hydrodynamic approach is used to describe production of
strangeness and/or heavy quarks in ultrarelativistic heavy ion reactions.
Production processes are important ingredients of dissipative effects in the
hadronic liquid. Beyond viscosity also chemo- and thermo-diffusion processes
are considered. This also allows to specify chemical and thermal freeze-out
conditions.
