Fix a number field k. We prove that if there is an algorithm for deciding
whether a smooth projective geometrically integral k-variety has a k-point,
then there is an algorithm for deciding whether an arbitrary k-variety has a
k-point and also an algorithm for computing X(k) for any k-variety X for which
X(k) is finite. The proof involves the construction of a one-parameter
algebraic family of Chatelet surfaces such that exactly one of the surfaces
fails to have a k-point.
