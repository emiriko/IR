We present a search for the associated production of charginos and
neutralinos in p-pbar collisions at 1.96 TeV. The data were collected at the
Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF II) and correspond to integrated
luminosities between 0.7 and 1.0 fb-1. We look for final states with one high
pT electron or muon, and two additional leptons. Our results are consistent
with the standard model expectations, and we set limits on the cross section as
a function of the chargino mass in three different supersymmetric scenarios.
For a specific MSSM scenario with no slepton mixing we set a 95 % C.L. limit at
151 GeV/c^2.
