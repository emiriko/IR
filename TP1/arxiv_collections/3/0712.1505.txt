The "High Acceptance DiElectron Spectrometer" (HADES) at GSI, Darmstadt, is
investigating the production of e+e- pairs in A+A, p+A and N+N collisions. The
latter program allows for the reconstruction of individual sources. This
strategy will be roughly outlined in this contribution and preliminary pp/pn
data is shown.
