We report on the observation of Feshbach resonances in an ultracold mixture
of two fermionic species, 6Li and 40K. The experimental data are interpreted
using a simple asymptotic bound state model and full coupled channels
calculations. This unambiguously assigns the observed resonances in terms of
various s- and p-wave molecular states and fully characterizes the ground-state
scattering properties in any combination of spin states.
