The adsorption of charged colloids (macroions) onto an oppositely charged
planar substrate is investigated theoretically. Taking properly into account
the finite size of the macroions, unusual behaviors are reported. It is found
that the role of the coions (the little salt-ions carrying the same sign of
charge as that of the substrate) is crucial to understand the mechanisms
involved in the process of macroion adsorption. In particular, the coions can
accumulate near the substrate's surface and lead to a counter-intuitive {\it
surface charge amplification}.
