Our current picture of black hole gravitational collapse relies on two
assumptions: i) the resulting singularity is hidden behind an event horizon --
weak cosmic censorship conjecture -- and ii) spacetime eventually settles down
to a stationarity state. In this setting, it follows that the minimal area
containing an apparent horizon is bound by the square of the total ADM mass
(Penrose inequality conjecture). Following Dain et al. 2002, we construct
numerically a family of axisymmetric initial data with one or several
marginally trapped surfaces. Penrose and related geometric inequalities are
discused for these data. As a by-product, it is shown how Penrose inequality
can be used as a diagnosis for an apparent horizon finder numerical routine.
