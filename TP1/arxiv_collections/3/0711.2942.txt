The effects of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations with the boundary on
charged particles is investigated. They may be observed via an electron
interference experiment near the conducting plate, where boundary effects of
vacuum fluctuations are found significant on coherence reduction of the
electrons. The dynamics of the charge under the influence of quantized
electromagnetic fields with a conducting plate is also studied. The
corresponding stochastic equation of motion is derived in the semiclassical
approximation, and the behavior of the charge's velocity fluctuations is
discussed.
