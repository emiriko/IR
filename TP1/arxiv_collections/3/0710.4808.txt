Transaction Level Modeling (TLM) approach is used to meet the simulation
speed as well as cycle accuracy for large scale SoC performance analysis. We
implemented a transaction-level model of a proprietary bus called AHB+ which
supports an extended AMBA2.0 protocol. The AHB+ transaction-level model shows
353 times faster than pin-accurate RTL model while maintaining 97% of accuracy
on average. We also present the development procedure of TLM of a bus
architecture.
