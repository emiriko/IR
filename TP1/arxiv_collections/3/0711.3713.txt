According to quantum field theory, the inflaton equation of motion does not
have the local form that is generally assumed for cosmological purposes. In
particular, earlier investigations of the nonequilibrium dynamics of an
inflaton that decays into scalar particles suggest that the loss of inflaton
energy is not well approximated by the local friction term derived from linear
response theory. We extend this analysis to the case of an inflaton that decays
into fermions, and reach broadly the same conclusion.
