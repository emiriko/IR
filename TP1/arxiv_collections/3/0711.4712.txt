The optical implementation of the recently proposed unambiguous
identification of coherent states is presented. Our system works as a
programmable discriminator between two, in general non-orthogonal weak coherent
states. The principle of operation lies in the interference of three light
beams - two program states and one unknown coherent state which can be equal to
whichever of the two program states. The experiment is based on fiber optics.
Its results confirm theoretical predictions and the experimental setup can be
straightforwardly extended for higher numbers of program states.
