This paper describes the application of statistical methods to political
polling data in order to look for correlations and memory effects. We propose
measures for quantifying the political memory using the correlation function
and scaling analysis. These methods reveal time correlations and self-affine
scaling properties respectively, and they have been applied to polling data
from Norway. Power-law dependencies have been found between correlation
measures and party size, and different scaling behaviour has been found for
large and small parties.
