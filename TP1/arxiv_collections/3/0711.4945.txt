The electric microfield distribution (MFD) at an impurity ion is studied for
two-component (TCP) electron-ion plasmas using molecular dynamics simulation
and theoretical models. The particles are treated within classical statistical
mechanics using an electron-ion Coulomb potential regularized at distances less
than the de Broglie length to take into account quantum-diffraction effects.
Corrections to the potential-of-mean-force exponential (PMFEX) approximation
recently proposed for MFD in a strongly coupled TCP [Phys. Rev. E 72, 036403
(2005)] are obtained and discussed. This has been done by a generalization of
the standard Baranger-Mozer and renormalized cluster expansion techniques
originally developed for the one-component plasmas to the TCPs. The results
obtained for a neutral point are compared with those from molecular dynamics
simulations. It is shown that the corrections do not help to improve the PMFEX
approximation for a TCP with low ionic charge Z. But starting with Z > 5 the
PMFEX model is substantially improved and the agreement with numerical
simulations is excellent. We have also found that with increasing coupling the
PMFEX approximation becomes invalid to predict the MFD at a neutral point while
its corrected version agrees satisfactory with the simulations.
