We demonstrate three-dimensional vibrational imaging of director structures
in liquid crystals using coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) polarized
microscopy. Spatial mapping of the structures is based on sensitivity of a
polarized CARS signal to orientation of anisotropic molecules in liquid
crystals. As an example, we study structures in a smectic material and
demonstrate that single-scan CARS and two-photon fluorescence images of
molecular orientation patterns are consistent with each other and with the
structure model.
