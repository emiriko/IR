As the communication requirements of current and future Multiprocessor
Systems on Chips (MPSoCs) continue to increase, scalable communication
architectures are needed to support the heavy communication demands of the
system. This is reflected in the recent trend that many of the standard bus
products such as STbus, have now introduced the capability of designing a
crossbar with multiple buses operating in parallel. The crossbar configuration
should be designed to closely match the application traffic characteristics and
performance requirements. In this work we address this issue of
application-specific design of optimal crossbar (using STbus crossbar
architecture), satisfying the performance requirements of the application and
optimal binding of cores onto the crossbar resources. We present a simulation
based design approach that is based on analysis of actual traffic trace of the
application, considering local variations in traffic rates, temporal overlap
among traffic streams and criticality of traffic streams. Our methodology is
applied to several MPSoC designs and the resulting crossbar platforms are
validated for performance by cycle-accurate SystemC simulation of the designs.
The experimental case studies show large reduction in packet latencies (up to
7x) and large crossbar component savings (up to 3.5x) compared to traditional
design approaches.
