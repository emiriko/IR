The most recent development of the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model, in which
the effect of the mean scalar field in-medium on the hyperfine interaction is
also included self-consistently, is used to compute the properties of finite
hypernuclei. The calculations for $\Lambda$ and $\Xi$ hypernuclei are of
comparable quality to earlier QMC results without the additional parameter
needed there. Even more significantly, the additional repulsion associated with
the increased hyperfine interaction in-medium completely changes the
predictions for $\Sigma$ hypernuclei. Whereas in the earlier work they were
bound by an amount similar to $\Lambda$ hypernuclei, here they are unbound, in
qualitative agreement with the experimental absence of such states. The
equivalent non-relativistic potential felt by the $\Sigma$ is repulsive inside
the nuclear interior and weakly attractive in the nuclear surface, as suggested
by the analysis of $\Sigma$-atoms.
