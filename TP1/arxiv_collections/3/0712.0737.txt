We report on quantitative comparisons between simulation results of a
bead-spring model and mode-coupling theory calculations for the structural and
conformational dynamics of a supercooled, unentangled polymer melt. We find
semiquantitative agreement between simulation and theory, except for processes
that occur on intermediate length scales between the compressibility plateau
and the amorphous halo of the static structure factor. Our results suggest that
the onset of slow relaxation in a glass-forming melt can be described in terms
of monomer-caging supplemented by chain connectivity. Furthermore, a unified
atomistic description of glassy arrest and of conformational fluctuations that
(asymptotically) follow the Rouse model, emerges from our theory.
