The production of isolated photons in deep-inelastic scattering $ep\to e
\gamma X$ is measured with the H1 detector at HERA. The measurement is
performed in the kinematic range of negative four-momentum transfer squared
$4<Q^2<150 $~GeV$^2$ and a mass of the hadronic system $W_X>50$ GeV. The
analysis is based on a total integrated luminosity of 227~pb$^{-1}$. The
production cross section of isolatedphotons with a transverse energy in the
range $3 < E_T^\gamma < 10$ GeV and pseudorapidity range $-1.2 < \eta^\gamma <
1.8$ is measured as a function of $E_T^\gamma$, $\eta^\gamma$ and $Q^2$.
Isolated photon cross sections are also measured for events with no jets or at
least one hadronic jet. The measurements are compared with predictions from
Monte Carlo generators modelling the photon radiation from the quark and the
electron lines, as well as with calculations at leading and next to leading
order in the strong coupling. The predictions significantly underestimate the
measured cross sections.
