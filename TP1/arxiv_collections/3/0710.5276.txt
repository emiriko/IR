Electronegativity is shown to control charge transfer, energy level
alignments, and electron currents in single molecule tunnel junctions, all of
which are governed by correlations contained within the density matrix. This is
demonstrated by the fact that currents calculated from the one-electron reduced
density matrix to second order in electron correlation are identical to the
currents obtained from the Green's function corrected to second order in
electron self-energy.
