In this letter we propose a multi-Higgs extension of the standard model with
Abelian and non-Abelian discrete symmetries in which the mass matrices of the
charged fermions obtained from renormalizable interactions are diagonal.
Corrections induced by non-renormalizable interactions deviate these matrices
from the diagonal form. Active neutrinos acquire mass only from
non-renormalizable interactions. The main entries of the neutrino mass matrix
arise only through dimension five operators, while the diagonal entries arise
only from dimension six operators.
