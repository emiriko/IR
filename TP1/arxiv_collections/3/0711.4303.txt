We discuss about effects of the non-standard interaction of neutrinos with
matter on the nu_e appearance search in the MINOS experiment. We consider the
effects of the complex phase of the interaction and of the uncertainty on
theta_23 also. We show that the oscillation probability can be so large that
can not be explained by the ordinary oscillation. We show also how much
constraints on the non-standard effects can be improved if the experiment does
not observe nu_e appearance signal.
