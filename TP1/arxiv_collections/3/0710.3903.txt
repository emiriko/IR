In this paper we study Lorentzian spacetimes for which all polynomial scalar
invariants constructed from the Riemann tensor and its covariant derivatives
are constant (CSI spacetimes) in three dimensions. We determine all such CSI
metrics explicitly, and show that for every CSI with particular constant
invariants there is a locally homogeneous spacetime with precisely the same
constant invariants. We prove that a three-dimensional CSI spacetime is either
(i) locally homogeneous or (ii) it is locally a Kundt spacetime. Moreover, we
show that there exists a null frame in which the Riemann (Ricci) tensor and its
derivatives are of boost order zero with constant boost weight zero components
at each order. Lastly, these spacetimes can be explicitly constructed from
locally homogeneous spacetimes and vanishing scalar invariant spacetimes.
