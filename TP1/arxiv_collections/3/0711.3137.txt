A new release of the Monte Carlo program Herwig++ (version 2.1) is now
available. This version includes a number of significant improvements
including: an eikonal multiple parton-parton scattering model of the underlying
event; the inclusion of Beyond the Standard Model physics; and a new hadronic
decay model tuned to LEP data. This version of the program is now fully ready
for the simulation of events in hadron-hadron collisions.
