A web-based interface dedicated for cluster computer which is publicly
accessible for free is introduced. The interface plays an important role to
enable secure public access, while providing user-friendly computational
environment for end-users and easy maintainance for administrators as well. The
whole architecture which integrates both aspects of hardware and software is
briefly explained. It is argued that the public cluster is globally a unique
approach, and could be a new kind of e-learning system especially for parallel
programming communities.
