When a stationary reflecting wall acting as a perfect mirror for an atomic
beam with well defined incident velocity is suddenly removed, the density
profile develops during the time evolution an oscillatory pattern known as
diffraction in time. The interference fringes are suppressed or their
visibility is diminished by several effects such as averaging over a
distribution of incident velocities, apodization of the aperture function,
atom-atom interactions, imperfect reflection or environmental noise. However,
when the mirror moves with finite velocity along the direction of propagation
of the beam, the visibility of the fringes is enhanced. For mirror velocities
below beam velocity, as used for slowing down the beam, the matter wave splits
into three regions separated by space-time points with classical analogues. For
mirror velocities above beam velocity a visibility enhancement occurs without a
classical counterpart. When the velocity of the beam approaches that of the
mirror the density oscillations rise by a factor 1.8 over the stationary value.
