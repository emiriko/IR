In the present article, which is the first part of a work in three parts, we
build an equation of quantum gravity. This equation is tensorial, is equivalent
to general relativity in vacuum, but differs completely from general relativity
inside matter. This new equation possesses a dimensionless gravitational
coupling constant, and passes all experimental tests that also passes general
relativity. This quantum gravity and general relativity diverge essentially in
the domain of cosmology : we prove that quantum gravity gives the solution to
the whole set of problems left over by the standard cosmological model based on
general relativity. Essentially, we prove that the initial singularity, the big
bang, is smoothed out by quantum gravity, that the flatness problem finds a
precise solution : quantum gravity predicts that Omega should be just a little
greater than 1, which fits perfectly with the observed 1.02. The cosmological
constant problem finds also its solution since we prove that the Lambda term
does not come from any dark energy, but comes from nonperturbative quantum
corrections to classical relativity, and has the exact tiny but strictly
positive value needed. Furthermore, the quantum equation of gravity possesses,
with no further efforts, features of unification. Indeed, our equation governs
at the same time the large scale of the universe, as did general relativity,
but also the structure of particles.
