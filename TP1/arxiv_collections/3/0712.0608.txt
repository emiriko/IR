Steady linear gravity waves of small amplitude travelling on a current of
constant vorticity are found. For negative vorticity we show the appearance of
internal waves and vortices, wherein the particle trajectories are not any more
closed ellipses. For positive vorticity the situation resembles that of Stokes
waves, but for large vorticity the trajectories are affected.
