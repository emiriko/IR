This paper deals with some of aspects of the influence of asymmetry on vocal
folds vibrations. A theoretical model of vocal fold asymmetry is presented. The
influence of asymmetry is quantitatively examined in terms of oscillation
frequency and pressure threshold. The theoretical model is compared to
"in-vitro" experiment on a deformable replica of vocal folds. It is found that
asymmetry strongly influences the oscillation subglottal pressure threshold.
Moreover, the vocal fold with the highest mechanical resonance frequency
imposes the oscillation fundamental frequency. The influence of geometrical
asymmetry instead of purely mechanical asymmetry is shown
