Aging has become the paradigm to describe dynamical behavior of glassy
systems, and in particular spin glasses. Trap models have been introduced as
simple caricatures of effective dynamics of such systems. In this Letter we
show that in a wide class of mean field models and on a wide range of time
scales, aging occurs precisely as predicted by the REM-like trap model of
Bouchaud and Dean. This is the first rigorous result about aging in mean field
models except for the REM and the spherical model.
