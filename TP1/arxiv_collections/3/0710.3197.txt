Ivanov-Anderson (IA) model (and an earlier treatment by Kubo) envisages a
decay of the orientational correlation by random but large amplitude molecular
jumps, as opposed to infinitesimal small jumps assumed in Brownian diffusion.
Recent computer simulation studies on water and supercooled liquids have shown
that large amplitude motions may indeed be more of a rule than exception.
Existing theoretical studies on jump diffusion mostly assume an exponential
(Poissonian) waiting time distribution for jumps, thereby again leading to an
exponential decay. Here we extend the existing formalism of Ivanov and Anderson
to include an algebraic waiting time distribution between two jumps. As a
result, the first and second rank orientational time correlation functions show
the same long time power law, but their short time decay behavior is quite
different. The predicted Cole-Cole plot of dielectric relaxation reproduces
various features of non-Debye behaviour observed experimentally. We also
developed a theory where both unrestricted small jumps and large angular jumps
coexist simultaneously. The small jumps are shown to have a large effect on the
long time decay, particularly in mitigating the effects of algebraic waiting
time distribution, and in giving rise to an exponential-like decay, with a time
constant, surprisingly, less than the time constant that arises from small
amplitude decay alone.
