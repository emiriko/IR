A surface model on compartmentalized spheres is studied by using the Monte
Carlo simulation technique with dynamical triangulations. We found that the
model exhibits a variety of phases: the spherical phase, the tubular phase, the
planar phase, the wormlike planar phase, the wormlike long phase, the wormlike
short phase, and the collapsed phase. It is also shown that almost all phases
are separated from their neighboring phases by first-order transitions.
Mechanical strength of the surface is given only by elastic skeletons, which
are the compartment boundaries, and vertices diffuse freely inside the
compartments. We confirm that the cytoskeletal structure and the lateral
diffusion of vertices are an origin of such a variety of phases.
