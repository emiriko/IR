We compute the spin-independent structure functions of the forward
virtual-photon Compton tensor of the proton at one loop using heavy baryon
chiral perturbation theory and dispersion relations. We study the relation
between both approaches. We use these results to generalize some sum rules to
virtual photon transfer momentum and relate them with sum rules in deep
inelastic scattering. We then compute the leading chiral term of the
polarizability correction to the Lamb shift of the hydrogen and muonic
hydrogen. We obtain -87.05/n^3 Hz and -0.148/n^3 meV for the correction to the
hydrogen and muonic hydrogen Lamb shift respectively.
