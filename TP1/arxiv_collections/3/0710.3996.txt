We investigate how to carry out universal quantum computation
deterministically with free electrons in decoherence-free subspace by using
polarizing beam splitters, charge detectors, and single-spin rotations. Quantum
information in our case is encoded in spin degrees of freedom of the
electron-pairs which construct a decoherence-free subspace. We design building
blocks for two noncommutable single-logic-qubit gates and a logic controlled
phase gate, based on which a universal and scalable quantum information
processing robust to dephasing is available in a deterministic way.
