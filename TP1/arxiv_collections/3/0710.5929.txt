Recent results in studies of bottomonium especially relevant to charmonium
are reviewed. This report covers dipion transition matrix elements, $\eta$
production in $\Upsilon$ transitions, $\Upsilon$ decays to invisible particles,
a search for a non-standard-model pseudoscalar Higgs in $\Upsilon$ radiative
decays, and $\Upsilon$ radiative decays to $\rm{f_2(1270)}$, $\eta$, and
$\eta'$.
