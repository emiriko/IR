We show that the N-photon states produced by interference between laser light
and downconverted light at the input of a two path interferometer can be
characterized by a single tuning parameter that describes a transition from
phase squeezing to nearly maximal path entanglement and back. The quantum
states are visualized on a sphere using the analogy between N-photon
interference and the spin-N/2 algebra.
