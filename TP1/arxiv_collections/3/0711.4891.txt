The notion of duality between the hydrodynamic and kinetic (ghost) variables
of lattice kinetic formulations of the Boltzmann equation is introduced. It is
suggested that this notion can serve as a guideline in the design of matrix
versions of the lattice Boltzmann equation in a physically transparent and
computationally efficient way.
