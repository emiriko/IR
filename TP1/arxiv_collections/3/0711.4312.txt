We present a new phenomenological model of the dipole scattering amplitude to
demonstrate that the RHIC data for hadron production in d-Au collisions for all
available rapidities are compatible with geometric scaling, just like the
small-x inclusive DIS data. A detailed comparison with earlier geometric
scaling violating models of the dipole scattering amplitude in terms of an
anomalous dimension gamma is made. In order to establish whether the geometric
scaling violations expected from small-x evolution equations are present in the
data a much larger range in transverse momentum and rapidity must be probed.
Predictions for hadron production in p-Pb and p-p collisions at LHC are given.
We point out that the fall-off of the transverse momentum distribution at LHC
is a sensitive probe of the variation of gamma in a region where x is much
smaller than at RHIC. In this way, the expectation for the rise of gamma from
small-x evolution can be tested.
