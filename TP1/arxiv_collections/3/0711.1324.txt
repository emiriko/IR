We investigate transport properties of a superconducting junction of many ($N
\ge 2$) one-dimensional quantum wires. We include the effectofelectron-electron
interaction within the one-dimensional quantum wire using a weak interaction
renormalization group procedure. Due to the proximity effect, transport across
the junction occurs via direct tunneling as well as via the crossed Andreev
channel. We find that the fixed point structure of this system is far more rich
than the fixed point structure of a normal metal$-$superconductor junction ($N
= 1$), where we only have two fixed points - the fully insulating fixed point
or the Andreev fixed point. Even a two wire (N=2)system with a superconducting
junction i.e. a normalmetal$-$superconductor$-$normal metal structure, has
non-trivialfixed points with intermediate transmissions and reflections. We
also include electron-electron interaction induced back-scattering in the
quantum wires in our study and hence obtain non-Luttinger liquid behaviour. It
is interesting to note that {\textsl{(a)}} effects due to inclusion of
electron-electron interaction induced back-scattering in the wire, and
{\textsl{(b)}} competition between the charge transport via the electron and
hole channels across the junction, give rise to a non-monotonic behavior of
conductance as a functionof temperature. We also find that transport across the
junction depends on two independent interaction parameters. The first one is
due to the usual correlations coming from Friedel oscillations for spin-full
electrons giving rise to the well-known interaction parameter (${{\alpha =
(g_2-2g_1)/2 \pi \hbar v_F}}$). The second one arises due to the scattering
induced by the proximity of the superconductor and is given by(${{\alpha^\prime
= (g_2 + g_1)/2 \pi \hbar v_F}}$).
