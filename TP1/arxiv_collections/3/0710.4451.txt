This paper reports measurements of processes: e+e- -> gamma KsK+pi-, e+e- ->
gamma K+K-pi0, e+e- -> gamma phi eta, and e+e- -> gamma phi pi0. The initial
state radiated photon allows to cover the hadronic final state in the energy
range from thresholds up to ~4.6 GeV. The overall size of the data sample
analyzed is 232 fb-1, collected by the BaBar detector running at the PEP-II
e+e- storage ring. From the Dalitz plot analysis of the KsK+pi- final state,
moduli and relative phase of the isoscalar and the isovector components of the
e+e- -> K K*(892) cross section are determined. Parameters of phi and rho
recurrences are also measured, using a global fitting procedure which exploits
the interconnection among amplitudes, moduli and phases of the e+e- -> KsK+pi-,
K+K-pi0, phi eta final states. The cross section for the OZI-forbidden process
e+e- -> phi pi0, and the J/psi branching fractions to KK*(892) and K+K-eta are
also measured.
