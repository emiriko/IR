We propose a mechanism for the quenching of the Shubnikov de Haas
oscillations and the quantum Hall effect observed in epitaxial graphene.
Experimental data show that the scattering time of the conduction electron is
magnetic field dependent and of the order of the cyclotron orbit period,
\textit{i.e.} can be much smaller than the zero field scattering time. Our
scenario involves the extraordinary graphene $n=0$ Landau level of the
uncharged layers that produces a high density of states at the Fermi level. We
find that the coupling between this $n=0$ Landau level and the conducting
states of the doped plane leads to a scattering mechanism having the right
magnitude to explain the experimental data.
