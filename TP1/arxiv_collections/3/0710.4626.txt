A detailed simple model is applied to study a metallic cluster. It is assumed
that the ions and delocalized electrons are distributed randomly throughout the
cluster. The delocalized electrons are assumed to be degenerate. A spherical
ball models the shape of a cluster. The energy of the microscopic electrostatic
field around the ions is taken into account and calculated. It is shown in the
framework of the model that the cluster is stable. Equilibrium radius of a ball
and the energy of the equilibrium cluster are calculated. Bulk modulus of a
cluster is calculated also.
