With the advent of high-precision frequency combs that can bridge large
frequency intervals, new possibilities have opened up for the laser
spectroscopy of atomic transitions. Here, we show that laser spectroscopic
techniques can also be used to determine the ground-state g factor of a bound
electron: Our proposal is based on a double-resonance experiment, where the
spin state of a ground-state electron is constantly being read out by laser
excitation to the atomic L shell, while the spin flip transitions are being
induced simultaneously by a resonant microwave field, leading to a detection of
the quantum jumps between the ground-state Zeeman sublevels. The magnetic
moments of electrons in light hydrogen-like ions could thus be measured with
advanced laser technology. Corresponding theoretical predictions are also
presented.
