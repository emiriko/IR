We derive relations among branching fractions in the exclusive decay of
charmonia to light flavour meson pairs assuming factorization between the quark
spin and spatial degrees of freedom. With the further assumption that these
amplitudes can be described by flux-tube models, we assess prospects for
production of hybrid mesons in charmonium decays.
