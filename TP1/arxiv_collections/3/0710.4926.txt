We have performed time-resolved scanning Kerr microscopy (TRSKM) measurements
upon arrays of square ferromagnetic nano-elements of different size and for a
range of bias fields. The experimental results were compared to micromagnetic
simulations of model arrays in order to understand the non-uniform precessional
dynamics within the elements. In the experimental spectra two branches of
excited modes were observed to co-exist above a particular bias field. Below
the so-called crossover field, the higher frequency branch was observed to
vanish. Micromagnetic simulations and Fourier imaging revealed that modes from
the higher frequency branch had large amplitude at the center of the element
where the effective field was parallel to the bias field and the static
magnetization. Modes from the lower frequency branch had large amplitude near
the edges of the element perpendicular to the bias field. The simulations
revealed significant canting of the static magnetization and the effective
field away from the direction of the bias field in the edge regions. For the
smallest element sizes and/or at low bias field values the effective field was
found to become anti-parallel to the static magnetization. The simulations
revealed that the majority of the modes were de-localized with finite amplitude
throughout the element, while the spatial character of a mode was found to be
correlated with the spatial variation of the total effective field and the
static magnetization state. The simulations also revealed that the frequencies
of the edge modes are strongly affected by the spatial distribution of the
static magnetization state both within an element and within its nearest
neighbors.
