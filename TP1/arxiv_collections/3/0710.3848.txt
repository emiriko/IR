This is a colloquium-style introduction to two electronic processes in a
carbon monolayer (graphene), each having an analogue in relativistic quantum
mechanics. Both processes couple electron-like and hole-like states, through
the action of either a superconducting pair potential or an electrostatic
potential. The first process, Andreev reflection, is the electron-to-hole
conversion at the interface with a superconductor. The second process, Klein
tunneling, is the tunneling through a p-n junction. Existing and proposed
experiments on Josephson junctions and bipolar junctions in graphene are
discussed from a unified perspective.
