We present a simple form of the on-shell gauge-invariant 1-loop effective
action of N=8 supergravity which is manifestly N=8 supersymmetric at the linear
level. By generalizing the dimensional arguments in superspace to non-local
invariants, we show that the 1-loop effective action does not contain any
contributions from bubble and triangle diagrams. The absence of bubbles implies
the absence of conformal and axial anomalies. We also show that the 1-loop
effective action of N=8 supergravity features a "dual" conformal symmetry in
the momentum space.
