The volume conjecture and its generalizations say that the colored Jones
polynomial corresponding to the N-dimensional irreducible representation of
sl(2;C) of a (hyperbolic) knot evaluated at exp(c/N) grows exponentially with
respect to N if one fixes a complex number c near 2*Pi*I. On the other hand if
the absolute value of c is small enough, it converges to the inverse of the
Alexander polynomial evaluated at exp(c). In this paper we study cases where it
grows polynomially.
