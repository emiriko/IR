A spin-isospin dependent Three-Dimensional approach based on momentum vectors
for formulation of the three-nucleon bound state is presented in this paper.
The three-nucleon Faddeev equations with two-nucleon interactions are
formulated as a function of vector Jacobi momenta, specifically the magnitudes
of the momenta and the angle between them with the inclusion of the
spin-isospin quantum numbers, without employing a partial wave decomposition.
As an application the spin-isospin dependent Faddeev integral equations are
solved with Bonn-B potential. Our result for the Triton binding energy with the
value of -8.152 MeV is in good agreement with the achievements of the other
partial wave based methods.
