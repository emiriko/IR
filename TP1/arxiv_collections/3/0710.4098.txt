Data taken by the DO experiment at the proton-antiproton collider at Tevatron
has been analyzed to search for signatures consistent with decay of charginos
and neutralinos. The search is performed in final states with three leptons and
missing transverse energy. No excess above the standard model expectation is
observed and limits on the production cross section times branching fraction
are set.
