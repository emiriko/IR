We derive a systematic and recursive approach to local conservation laws and
the Hamiltonian formalism for the Ablowitz-Ladik (AL) hierarchy. Our methods
rely on a recursive approach to the AL hierarchy using Laurent polynomials and
on asymptotic expansions of the Green's function of the AL Lax operator, a
five-diagonal finite difference operator.
