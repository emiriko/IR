One-dimensional quantum cellular automata (QCA) consist in a line of
identical, finite dimensional quantum systems. These evolve in discrete time
steps according to a local, shift-invariant unitary evolution. By local we mean
that no instantaneous long-range communication can occur. In order to define
these over a Hilbert space we must restrict to a base of finite, yet unbounded
configurations. We show that QCA always admit a two-layered block
representation, and hence the inverse QCA is again a QCA. This is a striking
result since the property does not hold for classical one-dimensional cellular
automata as defined over such finite configurations. As an example we discuss a
bijective cellular automata which becomes non-local as a QCA, in a rare case of
reversible computation which does not admit a straightforward quantization. We
argue that a whole class of bijective cellular automata should no longer be
considered to be reversible in a physical sense. Note that the same two-layered
block representation result applies also over infinite configurations, as was
previously shown for one-dimensional systems in the more elaborate formalism of
operators algebras [9]. Here the proof is made simpler and self-contained,
moreover we discuss a counterexample QCA in higher dimensions.
