This article reviews quantitative methods to estimate the basic reproduction
number of pandemic influenza, a key threshold quantity to help determine the
intensity of interventions required to control the disease. Although it is
difficult to assess the transmission potential of a probable future pandemic,
historical epidemiologic data is readily available from previous pandemics, and
as a reference quantity for future pandemic planning, mathematical and
statistical analyses of historical data are crucial. In particular, because
many historical records tend to document only the temporal distribution of
cases or deaths (i.e. epidemic curve), our review focuses on methods to
maximize the utility of time-evolution data and to clarify the detailed
mechanisms of the spread of influenza. First, we highlight structured epidemic
models and their parameter estimation method which can quantify the detailed
disease dynamics including those we cannot observe directly.
Duration-structured epidemic systems are subsequently presented, offering firm
understanding of the definition of the basic and effective reproduction
numbers. When the initial growth phase of an epidemic is investigated, the
distribution of the generation time is key statistical information to
appropriately estimate the transmission potential using the intrinsic growth
rate. Applications of stochastic processes are also highlighted to estimate the
transmission potential using the similar data. Critically important
characteristics of influenza data are subsequently summarized, followed by our
conclusions to suggest potential future methodological improvements.
