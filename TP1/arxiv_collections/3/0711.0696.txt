We discuss the properties of 't Hooft vertices in partially quenched and
rooted versions of QCD in the continuum. These theories have a physical
subspace, equivalent to ordinary QCD, that is contained within a larger space
that includes many unphysical correlation functions. We find that the 't Hooft
vertices in the physical subspace have the expected form, despite the presence
of unphysical 't Hooft vertices appearing in correlation functions that have an
excess of valence quarks (or ghost quarks). We resolve an apparent paradox that
arises when one uses rooted staggered fermions to study one-flavor QCD, by
showing how, in partially quenched theories, it is possible to have spontaneous
symmetry breaking of a non-anomalous symmetry in finite volume. Using these
results, we demonstrate that arguments recently given by Creutz--claiming to
disprove the validity of rooted staggered QCD--are incorrect. In particular,
the unphysical 't Hooft vertices do not present an obstacle to the recovery of
taste symmetry in the continuum limit.
