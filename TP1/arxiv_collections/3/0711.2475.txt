The photon bremsstrahlung rate from a quark jet produced in deep-inelastic
scattering (DIS) off a large nucleus is studied in the collinear limit. The
leading medium-enhanced higher twist corrections which describe the multiple
scattering of the jet in the nucleus are re-summed to all orders of twist. The
propagation of the jet in the absence of further radiative energy loss is shown
to be governed by a transverse momentum diffusion equation. We compute the
final photon spectrum in the limit of soft photons, taking into account the
leading and next-to-leading terms in the photon momentum fraction y. In this
limit, the photon spectrum in a physical gauge is shown to arise from two
interfering sources: one where the initial hard scattering produces an
off-shell quark which immediately radiates the photon and then undergoes
subsequent soft re-scattering; alternatively the quark is produced on-shell and
propagates through the medium until it is driven off-shell by re-scattering and
radiates the photon. Our result has a simple formal structure as a product of
the photon splitting function, the quark transverse momentum distribution
coming from a diffusion equation and a dimensionless factor which encodes the
effect of the interferences encountered by the propagating quark over the
length of the medium. The destructive nature of such interferences in the small
y limit are responsible for the origin of the Landau-Pomeranchuck-Migdal (LPM)
effect. Along the way we also discuss possible implications for quark jets in
hot nuclear matter.
