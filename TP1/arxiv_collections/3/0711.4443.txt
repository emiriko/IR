We study nuclear effects in the $F^A_3(x)$ structure function in the deep
inelastic neutrino reactions on iron by using a relativistic framework to
describe the nucleon spectral functions in the nucleus.
  The results for the ratio $R(x,Q^2)=\frac{F^A_3(x,Q^2)}{AF^N_3(x, Q^2)}$ and
the Gross-Llewellyn Smith(GLS) integral $G(x,Q^2)=\int_x^1 dx F^A_3(x,Q^2)$ in
nuclei are discussed and compared with the recent results available in
literature from theoretical and phenomenological analyses of experimental data.
