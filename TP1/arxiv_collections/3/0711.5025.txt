In a recent Comment [arXiv:0711.4654], Y. Ando raises two valid issues in
relation to our low-temperature heat transport study of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$
across the insulator-to-superconductor boundary: 1) the possible role of twin
boundaries in scattering phonons; 2) the best fitting procedure for extracting
a fermionic (linear) term from the data. In this Reply, we show that both
concerns can be laid to rest by 1) using new data from a tetragonal (twin-free)
sample, and 2) using an analysis that does not involve any fitting.
