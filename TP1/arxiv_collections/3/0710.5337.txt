We describe details of 1/a ~ 2.2Gev, L ~ 3 fm dynamical domain wall fermion
simulations which will allow us to do a more systematic continuum extrapolation
in combination with existing simu- lations. Details of the simulations such as
algorithm choices and machine performance, as well as results of basic
measurements are presented. These configurations are presently being generated
on the QCDOC machine at Edinburgh and the DOE QCDOC machine at Brookhaven as
part of a joint project with LHPC.
