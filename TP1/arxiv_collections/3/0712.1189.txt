ICOOOLPS'2007 was the second edition of the ECOOP-ICOOOLPS workshop. ICOOOLPS
intends to bring researchers and practitioners both from academia and industry
together, with a spirit of openness, to try and identify and begin to address
the numerous and very varied issues of optimization. After a first successful
edition, this second one put a stronger emphasis on exchanges and discussions
amongst the participants, progressing on the bases set last year in Nantes. The
workshop attendance was a success, since the 30-people limit we had set was
reached about 2 weeks before the workshop itself. Some of the discussions (e.g.
annotations) were so successful that they would required even more time than we
were able to dedicate to them. That's one area we plan to further improve for
the next edition.
