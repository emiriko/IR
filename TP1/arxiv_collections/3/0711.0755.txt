The beam spin asymmetries of the reaction ep -> epg in the Bjorken regime
were measured over a wide kinematical domain using the CLAS detector and a new
lead-tungstate calorimeter. Through the interference of the Bethe-Heitler
process with Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering, those asymmetries provide
constraints for the nucleon Generalized Parton Distributions models. The
observed shapes are in agreement with twist-2 dominance predictions.
