The embedded DRAM (eDRAM) is more and more used in System On Chip (SOC). The
integration of the DRAM capacitor process into a logic process is challenging
to get satisfactory yields. The specific process of DRAM capacitor and the low
capacitance value (~30F) of this device induce problems of process monitoring
and failure analysis. We propose a new test structure to measure the
capacitance value of each DRAM cell capacitor in a DRAM array. This concept has
been validated by simulation on a 0.18$\mu$m eDRAM technology.
