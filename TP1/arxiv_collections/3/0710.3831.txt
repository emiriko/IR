Real thermal motion of gas molecules, free electrons, etc., at long time
intervals (much greater than mean free-flight time) possesses, contrary to its
popular mathematical models, essentially non-Gaussian statistics. A simple
proof of this statement is suggested basing on only the determinism and
reversibility of microscopic dynamics and besides incidentally derived virial
expansion of a path probability distribution of molecular Brownian particle.
