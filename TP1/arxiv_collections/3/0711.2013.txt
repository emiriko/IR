A.V.Pushkin's approach based on conformal geometrodynamics (CGD) to
calculation of quantitative relations between physical quantities is presented
and analyzed. In the simplest cases of the stationary solutions to the CGD
equations the approach implies separation of internal and external parts
(relative to a certain boundary) from the solutions and using inverse
transformations transforming the parts into each other. For the
quasi-stationary (metastable) states, the possibility of the nonperturbative
calculation of their lifetimes is shown. The approach is illustrated by several
examples. In particular, it is shown that the Dirac ``large number hypothesis''
is a consequence of the approach. Also, the evaluated radiation lifetime of the
first excited level of 2p hydrogen atom and neutron lifetime are presented.
