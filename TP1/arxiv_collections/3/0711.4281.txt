The emission of e+e- pairs from C+C collisions at an incident energy of 1 GeV
per nucleon has been investigated. The measured production probabilities,
spanning from the pi0-Dalitz to the rho/omega! invariant-mass region, display a
strong excess above the cocktail of standard hadronic sources. The
bombarding-energy dependence of this excess is found to scale like pion
production, rather than like eta production. The data are in good agreement
with results obtained in the former DLS experiment.
