In this paper we present an analog of the Bell's inequalities violation test
for $N$ qubits to be performed in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum
computer. This can be used to simulate or predict results for different Bell's
inequalities tests, with distinct configurations and larger number of qubits.
To demonstrate our scheme, we implemented a simulation of the violation of
Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt (CHSH) inequality using a two qubit NMR system
and compared the results to those of a photon experiment. The experimental
results are well described by Quantum Mechanics theory and a Local Realistic
Hidden Variables model which was specially developed for NMR. That is why we
refer to this experiment as a {\it simulation} of the Bell's inequality
violation. Our result shows explicitly how both theories can be compatible to
each other due the detection loophole. In the last part of this work we discuss
the possibility of testing fundamental features of quantum mechanics using NMR
with highly polarized spins, where a strong discrepancy between quantum
mechanics and hidden variables models can be expected.
