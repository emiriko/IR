We consider the Bose-Einstein condensate trapped in optical lattice, which is
formed from two kinds of deep potentials. The tight-binding approximation was
used. Steady state distribution of the probability amplitudes and the site
population in the one dimensional optical superlattice were found. It was shown
that this solution of the equations which describe the dynamics of the
Bose-Einstein condensate in superlattice is unstable at the sufficiently high
density of the bosons. The expression for increment of the modulational
instability was found on base of the linear stability analysis. Numerical
simulation demonstrates the evolution of the steady state distributions of
bosons into the space array of the solitary peaks before the chaotic regime
generation.
