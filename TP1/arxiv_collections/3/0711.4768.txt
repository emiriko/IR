Many applications use electrostimulation of the human skin to provide tactile
sensation. The effect of electrotactile stimulations were studied on a 6x6
matrix of tactile electrodes placed on the anterior part of the tongue. The
liminary threshold with continuous or discontinuous waveform and patterns with
2 or 4 electrodes was investigated. The result suggest that for energy saving
and to improve the yield, it would probably be better to use discontinuous
stimulation with two electrode patterns.
