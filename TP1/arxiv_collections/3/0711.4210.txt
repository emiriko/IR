We show that a minimal counter example to the Cherlin-Zilber Algebraicity
Conjecture for simple groups of finite Morley rank has Prufer 2-rank at most
two. This article covers the signalizer functor theory and identifies the
groups of Lie rank at least three; leaving the uniqueness case analysis to
previous articles. This result signifies the end of the general methods used to
handle large groups; hereafter each individual group PSL$_2$, PSL$_3$, PSp$_4$,
and G$_2$ will require its own identification theorem.
