The formulation of NRQCD discretized in a reference frame boosted relative to
the B rest frame will enable calculation of B form factors over a larger range
of momentum transfer. We have initiated a program to calculate form factors
describing the rare decay B to K* gamma. We discuss the strategy and challenges
of the project. As a first step in the numerical calculations, we present first
results for bottomonium quantities using the O(Lambda_{QCD}^2/m^2, v_{NR}^4)
moving NRQCD action.
