In the framework of Glauber-Sitenko model we calculate contribution of
Coulomb interaction in cross-section of A(d,p) reaction at high energy and zero
angle. It is demonstrated that such effect significantly increases the
differential cross section only at peak, where the proton momentum $p$ is near
half of the deuteron momentum $p_d$ in lab. frame, $p \sim \frac12 p_d$. The
Coulomb interaction do not change the results in the high momentum region,
where quark effects should be taken into account.
