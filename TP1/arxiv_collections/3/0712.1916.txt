An expert ranking of forestry journals was compared with journal impact
factors and h-indices computed from the ISI Web of Science and internet-based
data. Citations reported by Google Scholar appear to offer the most efficient
way to rank all journals objectively, in a manner consistent with other
indicators. This h-index exhibited a high correlation with the journal impact
factor (r=0.92), but is not confined to journals selected by any particular
commercial provider. A ranking of 180 forestry journals is presented, on the
basis of this index.
