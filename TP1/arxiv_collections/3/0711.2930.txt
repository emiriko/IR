The field-induced multiferroic transition in TbMnO3 has been studied by
neutron scattering. Apart strong hysteresis, the magnetic transition associated
with the flop of electronic polarization exhibits a memory effect: after a
field sweep, TbMnO3 does not exhibit the same phase as that obtained by
zero-field cooling. The strong changes in the magnetic excitations across the
transition perfectly agree with a rotation of the cycloidal spiral plane
indicating that the inverse Dzyaloshinski-Moriya coupling causes the giant
magnetoelectric effect at the field-induced transition. The analysis of the
zone-center magnetic excitations identifies the electromagnon of the
multiferroic high-field phase.
