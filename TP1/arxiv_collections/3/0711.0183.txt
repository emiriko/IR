Conceptual studies and numerical simulations are performed for imaging
devices that transform a near-field pattern into magnified far-zone images and
are based on high-order spatial transformation in cylindrical domains. A lens
translating a near-field pattern from an almost circular input boundary onto a
magnified far-field image at a flat output boundary is considered. The lens is
made of a metamaterial with anisotropic permittivity and permeability both
depending on a single 'scaling' parameter of the transformation. Open designs
of the lens with a truncated body ('3/4-body' and '1/4-body' lenses) are
suggested and analyzed. It is shown that the ideal full-lens and the '3/4-body'
lens produce identical images. Numerical simulations of '1/4-body' designs
indicate that further truncation of the lens could limit its per-formance. A
light concentrator, "focusing" far-zone fields into a nanometer-scale area, is
also considered.
