In this paper, building among others on earlier works by U. Krause and C.
Zahlten (dealing with the case of cyclic groups), we obtain a new upper bound
for the little cross number valid in the general case of arbitrary finite
Abelian groups. Given a finite Abelian group, this upper bound appears to
depend only on the rank and on the number of distinct prime divisors of the
exponent. The main theorem of this paper allows us, among other consequences,
to prove that a classical conjecture concerning the cross and little cross
numbers of finite Abelian groups holds asymptotically in at least two different
directions.
