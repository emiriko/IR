We study the LHC signatures of new gauge bosons in the minimal deconstruction
Higgsless model (MHLM). We analyze the $W'$ signals of $pp\to W' \to WZ$ and
$pp\to W'jj \to WZjj$ processes at the LHC, including the complete signal and
background calculation in the gauge invariant model and have demonstrated the
LHC potential to cover the whole parameter space of the MHLM model.
