We present preliminary results on a search for squarks and gluinos in
proton-antiproton collisions with a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV and based
on 1.1 fb-1 of data collected by the CDF detector in the Tevatron Run II.
Events with multiple jets of hadrons and large missing transverse energy in the
final state are studied within the framework of minimal supergravity and
assuming R-parity conservation. No excess with respect to Standard Model
predictions is observed and new limits on the gluino and squark masses are
extracted.
