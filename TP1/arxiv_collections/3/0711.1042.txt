We propose a practical and efficient solution for the coupling of light from
integrated single-mode waveguides to supercollimating planar photonic crystals
on conventional silicon-on-insulator platforms. The device consists of a rib
waveguide, designed to sustain spatially extended single-modes and matched to a
supercollimating photonic crystal, which has been truncated at its boundary to
improve impedance matching between the two photonic components.
Three-dimensional simulations show transmission efficiencies up to 96 % and
reflections below 0.2 % at wavelengths close to 1.55 microns. This approach
constitutes a significant step toward the integration of supercollimating
structures on photonic chips.
