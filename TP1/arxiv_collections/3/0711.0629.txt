For QCD at non-zero chemical potential $\mu$, the Dirac eigenvalues are
scattered in the complex plane. We define a notion of ordering for individual
eigenvalues in this case and derive the distributions of individual eigenvalues
from random matrix theory (RMT). We distinguish two cases depending on the
parameter $\alpha=\mu^2 F^2 V$, where $V$ is the volume and $F$ is the familiar
low-energy constant of chiral perturbation theory. For small $\alpha$, we use a
Fredholm determinant expansion and observe that already the first few terms
give an excellent approximation. For large $\alpha$, all spectral correlations
are rotationally invariant, and exact results can be derived. We compare the
RMT predictions to lattice data and in both cases find excellent agreement in
the topological sectors $\nu=0,1,2$.
