LHE, JINR have been analyzed for exotic multibaryon metastable and stable
states searches. A number of peculiarities were found in the effective mass
spectra of: 1)$\Lambda \pi^{\pm}$,$\Lambda \pi^+ \pi^-$, $\Lambda p$, $\Lambda
p p$, $\Lambda \pi p$,$\Lambda \Lambda $ and $\Lambda K^0_S$ subsystems. The
observed well known $\Sigma^{*+}$(1385),$\Lambda ^*(1600)$ and
$K^{*\pm}$(892)resonances are good tests for this method. The width of
$\Sigma^{*-}(1385)$ for p+A reaction is two time larger than that presented in
PDG. The $\Lambda \pi^-$ spectrum observed enhancement in mass range of 1345
MeV/$c^2$ which interpreted as a stopped in nucleus $\Xi^-$. The cross section
of stopped $\Xi^-$ production is $\approx$ 8 times larger than obtained by
fritiof model with same experimental conditions.
