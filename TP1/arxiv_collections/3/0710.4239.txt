We study the single production of top quarks in $e^+e^-, ep$ and $pp$
collisions in the context of unparticle physics through the Flavor Violating
(FV) unparticle vertices and compute the total cross sections for single top
production as functions of scale dimension $d_{\U}$. We find that among all,
LHC is the most promising facility to probe the unparticle physics via single
top quark production processes.
