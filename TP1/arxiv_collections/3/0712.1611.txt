Fix a prime p and a density 0 < d <= 1. Among all functions f : F_p -> [0,1],
what can one say about those which assign minimal weight to three-term
arithmetic progressions -- that is, the sum of f(a)f(a+x)f(a+2x) is minimal as
we sum over all a and x -- subject to the density constraint that the expected
value of f equals d? In the present paper we show three things about them: 1)
Such f are nearly indicator functions; 2) They enjoy a certain ``local
minimal'' property; and, 3) They are approximately indicator functions for
certain sumsets A+B.
