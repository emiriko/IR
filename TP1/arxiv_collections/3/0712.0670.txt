Repeated measurements of a quantum particle to check its presence in a region
of space was proposed long ago [G. R. Allcock, Ann. Phys. {\bf 53}, 286 (1969)]
as a natural way to determine the distribution of times of arrival at the
orthogonal subspace, but the method was discarded because of the quantum Zeno
effect: in the limit of very frequent measurements the wave function is
reflected and remains in the original subspace. We show that by normalizing the
small bits of arriving (removed) norm, an ideal time distribution emerges in
correspondence with a classical local-kinetic-energy distribution.
