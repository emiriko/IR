Recently, we have numerically evaluated the current-current correlation
function for the ground states of three-band models for the CuO planes of
high-Tc superconductors at hole doping x=1/8 using systems with 24 sites and
periodic boundary conditions. In this article, the numerical analysis is
explicated in detail and extended to a wider range of parameters. Our results
show no evidence for the time-reversal symmetry violating current patterns
recently proposed by Varma. If such current patterns exist, our results
indicate that the energy associated with the loop currents must be smaller than
5 meV per link even if the on-site chemical potential on the oxygen sites,
which is generally assumed to be of the order of 3.6 eV, is taken to zero, as
advocated by Varma. We also vary the inter-atomic Coulomb repulsion scale and
find only a weak dependence on this parameter. So while our studies do not rule
out the existence of such current patterns, they do rule out that quantum
critical fluctuations of these patterns are responsible for phenomena occurring
at significantly higher energies such as the superconductivity or the anomalous
properties observed in the strange metal phase provided the CuO superconductors
are adequately described by any of the three-band models discussed.
