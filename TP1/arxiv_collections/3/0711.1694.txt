A discrete-time quantum walk on a graph is the repeated application of a
unitary evolution operator to a Hilbert space corresponding to the graph.
Hitting times for discrete quantum walks on graphs give an average time before
the walk reaches an ending condition. We derive an expression for hitting time
using superoperators, and numerically evaluate it for the walk on the hypercube
for various coins and decoherence models. We show that, by contrast to
classical walks, quantum walks can have infinite hitting times for some initial
states. We seek criteria to determine if a given walk on a graph will have
infinite hitting times, and find a sufficient condition for their existence.
The phenomenon of infinite hitting times is in general a consequence of the
symmetry of the graph and its automorphism group. Symmetries of a graph, given
by its automorphism group, can be inherited by the evolution operator. Using
the irreducible representations of the automorphism group, we derive conditions
such that quantum walks defined on this graph must have infinite hitting times
for some initial states. Symmetry can also cause the walk to be confined to a
subspace of the original Hilbert space for certain initial states. We show that
a quantum walk confined to the subspace corresponding to this symmetry group
can be seen as a different quantum walk on a smaller quotient graph and we give
an explicit construction of the quotient graph. We conjecture that the
existence of a small quotient graph with finite hitting times is necessary for
a walk to exhibit a quantum speed-up. Finally, we use symmetry and the theory
of decoherence-free subspaces to determine when the subspace of the quotient
graph is a decoherence-free subspace of the dynamics.
