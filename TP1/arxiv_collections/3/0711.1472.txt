In this paper the relation between 2d topological gauge theories and Bethe
Ansatz equations is reviewed. In addition we present some new results and
clarifications. We hope the relations discussed here are particular examples of
more general relations between quantum topological fields theories in
dimensions $d\leq 4$ and quantum integrable systems.
