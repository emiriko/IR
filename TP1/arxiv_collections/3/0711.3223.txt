The charged-current quasi-elastic scattering of muon neutrino on oxygen
target is computed for neutrino energy between 200 MeV and 2.5 GeV using
different approximations: the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA), the
Relativistic Distorted Wave Impulse Approximation with relativistic optical
potential (RDWIA), and the Relativistic Fermi Gas Model (RFGM). The comparison
with RFGM, which is widely used in data analyses of neutrino experiments, shows
that the RFGM fails completely when applied to exclusive cross section data and
leads to overestimated values of inclusive and total cross sections.
