Measurements of resistivities of dilute iron based alloys show strong
deviations from Matthiessen's rule. These deviations can be explained by a
model in which spin up and spin down electrons conduct in parallel. The results
are consistent with the theory of impurity shielding in these alloys. [This
1967 paper provides the first experimental demonstration of two current
conduction at low temperatures in a ferromagnetic metal. One direct consequence
of this property is the Giant Magnetoresistance discovered in 1988 by the
groups of Albert Fert and of Peter Gr\"unberg].
