Microdisks and microstadium resonators were fabricated on erbium doped
amorphous hydrogenated silicon (a-Si:H<Er>) layers sandwiched in air and native
SiO2 on Si substrates. Annealing condition is optimized to allow large emission
at 1550 nm for samples with erbium concentrations as high as 1.02x10^20
atoms/cm3. Near field scanning optical microscopy shows evidences of the
simultaneous presence of bow-tie and diamond scars. These modes indicate the
high quality of the resonators and the potentiality for achieving amorphous
silicon microcavity lasers.
