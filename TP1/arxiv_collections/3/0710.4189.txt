The structural environment of substitutional Cr3+ ion in a natural pyrope
Mg3Al2Si3O12 has been investigated by Cr K-edge Extended X-ray Absorption Fine
Structure (EXAFS) and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) coupled with
first-principles computations. The Cr-O distance is close to that in
knorringite Mg3Cr2Si3O12, indicating a full relaxation of the first neighbors.
The local C3i symmetry of the octahedral Y site is retained during Cr-Al
substitution. The second and third shells of neighbors (Mg and Si) relax only
partially. Site relaxation is accommodated by strain-induced bond buckling,
with angular tilts of the Si-centered tetrahedra around the Cr-centered
octahedron, and by a radial deformation of the Mg-centered dodecahedra.
