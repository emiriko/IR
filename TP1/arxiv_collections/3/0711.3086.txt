We study the effect of b to s sbar s scalar/pseudoscalar operators in B to K
eta('), phi K^* decays. In the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM),
such scalar/pseudoscalar operators can be induced by the penguin diagrams of
neutral Higgs bosons. These operators can be Fierz-transformed into tensor
operators, and the resultant tensor operators could affect the transverse
polarization amplitudes in B to phi K^* decays. A combined analysis of the
decays B to phi K^* and B to K eta('), including b to s sbar s
scalar/pseudoscalar operators and their Fierz-transformed tensor operators
originated from the MSSM, is performed. Our study is based on the followings:
(1) Assuming that weak annihilations in B to phi K^* is negligible and the
polarization puzzle is resolved by Fierz-transformed tensor operators, it
results in too large coefficients of scalar/pseudoscalar operators, such that
the resulting B to K eta(') branching fractions are much larger than
observations. (2) When we take the weak annihilations in B to phi K^* into
account, the polarization puzzle can be resolved. In this case, new physics
effects are strongly suppressed and no more relevant to the enhancement of the
transverse modes in B to phi K^* decays.
