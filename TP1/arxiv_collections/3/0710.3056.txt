As has been confirmed meanwhile by lattice-QCD calculations (see e.g.
hep-lat/0702023), the confinement spectrum of non-exotic quark-antiquark
systems has its ground state for scalar mesons well above 1 GeV in the
Resonance Spectrum Expansion (RSE). For instance, in the S-wave Kaon-pion RSE
amplitude, a broad resonance was predicted slightly above 1.4 GeV
[hep-ex/0106077], which is confirmed by experiment as the K*0(1430). However, a
complete nonet of light scalar mesons was predicted (Zeit.Phys.C30,615
[http://www-spires.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep?key=1573454]) as well,
when a model strongly related to the RSE and initially developed to describe
the heavy quarkonia resonance spectra (Phys.Rev.D21,772
[http://www-spires.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep?key=363162]) was applied
in the light-quark sector. Thus, it was found that the light scalar-meson nonet
constitutes part of the ordinary meson spectrum, albeit represented by
"extraordinary" [hep-ph/0701038] poles [hep-ex/0106077].
  Similar resonances and bound states appear in the charmed sector
[hep-ph/0305035], and are predicted in the B-meson spectrum [hep-ph/0312078,
hep-ph/0406242].
  A recent work [hep-ph/0703286] confirmed the presence of light scalar-meson
poles in the RSE amplitude for S-wave and P-wave pion-pion and Kaon-pion
contributions to three-body decay processes measured by the BES, E791 and FOCUS
collaborations.
