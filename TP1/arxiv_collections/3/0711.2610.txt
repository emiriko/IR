We study the electronic and transport properties of heterostructures formed
by armchair graphene nanoribbons with intersections of finite length. We
describe the system by a tight-binding model and calculate the density of
states and the conductance within the Green's function formalism based on
real-space renormalization techniques. We show the apparition of interface
states and bound states in the continuum which present a strong dependence of
the heterostructure geometry. We investigate the effects on the conductance of
an external perturbation applied on the edges atoms of the intersection region.
