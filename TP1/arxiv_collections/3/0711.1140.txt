In this paper we study the equivalence relation on the set of acyclic
orientations of a graph Y that arises through source-to-sink conversions. This
source-to-sink conversion encodes, e.g. conjugation of Coxeter elements of a
Coxeter group. We give a direct proof of a recursion for the number of
equivalence classes of this relation for an arbitrary graph Y using edge
deletion and edge contraction of non-bridge edges. We conclude by showing how
this result may also be obtained through an evaluation of the Tutte polynomial
as T(Y,1,0), and we provide bijections to two other classes of acyclic
orientations that are known to be counted in the same way. A transversal of the
set of equivalence classes is given.
