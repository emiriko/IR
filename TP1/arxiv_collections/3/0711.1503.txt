This course aims to introduce the student to random matrix models for
decoherence and fidelity decay. They present a very powerful alternate
approach, that emphasizes the disordered character of many environments and
uncontrollable perturbations/couplings. The inherent integrability of such
models makes analytic studies possible. We limit our considerations to linear
response treatment, as high fidelity and small decoherence are the backbone of
quantum information processes. For fidelity decay, where experimental results
are available, a comparison with experiments shows excellent agreement with
random matrix theory predictions.
