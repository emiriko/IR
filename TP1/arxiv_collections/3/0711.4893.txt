In this talk, we present the recent results on charmonium decays from the BES
experiment at the BEPC collider. The analyses are based on a 14 million psi(2S)
events data sample. We report results on leptonic decays, hadronic decays, and
radiative decays of psi(2S), as well as hadronic decays of chi_cJ states and
rare or forbidden decays of J/psi.
