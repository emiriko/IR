We present a family of methods, analytical and numerical, which can describe
behaviour in (non) equilibrium ensembles, both classical and quantum,
especially in the complex systems, where the standard approaches cannot be
applied. We demonstrate the creation of nontrivial (meta) stable states
(patterns), localized, chaotic, entangled or decoherent, from basic localized
modes in various collective models arising from the quantum hierarchy of
Wigner-von Neumann-Moyal-Lindblad equations, which are the result of
``wignerization'' procedure of classical BBGKY hierarchy. We present the
explicit description of internal quantum dynamics by means of exact
analytical/numerical computations.
