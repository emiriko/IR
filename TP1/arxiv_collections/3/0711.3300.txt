Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technologies are developing rapidly
with increasing study of the design, fabrication and commercialization of
microscale systems and devices. Accurate mechanical properties are important
for successful design and development of MEMS. We have demonstrated here a
novel electroplating spring frame MEMS Structure Specimen integrates pin-pin
align holes, misalignment compensate spring structure frame, load sensor beam
and freestanding thin film. The specimen can be fit into a specially designed
microtensile apparatus which is capable of carrying out a series of tests on
sub-micro scale freestanding thin films.
