Following the use of approximate symmetries for the Schwarzschild spacetime
by A.H. Kara, F.M. Mahomed and A. Qadir (Nonlinear Dynam., to appear), we have
investigated the exact and approximate symmetries of the system of geodesic
equations for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime (RN). For this purpose we are
forced to use second order approximate symmetries. It is shown that in the
second-order approximation, energy must be rescaled for the RN metric. The
implications of this rescaling are discussed.
