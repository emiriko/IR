We present the metal - insulator transition study of a quantum site
percolation model on simple cubic lattice. Transfer matrix method is used to
calculate transport properties - Landauer conductance - for the binary
distribution of energies. We calculate the mobility edge in disorder (ratio of
insulating sites) - energy plane in detail and we find the extremal critical
disorder somewhat closer to the classical percolation threshold, than formerly
reported. We calculate the critical exponent $\nu$ along the mobility edge and
find it constant and equal to the one of 3D Anderson model, confirming common
universality class. Possible exception is the center of the conduction band,
where either the single parameter scaling is not valid anymore, or finite size
effects are immense. One of the reasons for such statement is the difference
between results from arithmetic and geometric averaging of conductance at
special energies. Only the geometric mean yields zero critical disorder in band
center, which was theoretically predicted.
