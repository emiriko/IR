We report on the methods and results of the first dedicated search for
gravitational waves emitted during the inspiral of compact binaries with
spinning component bodies. We analyze 788 hours of data collected during the
third science run (S3) of the LIGO detectors. We searched for binary systems
using a detection template family designed specially to capture the effects of
the spin-induced precession of the orbital plane. We present details of the
techniques developed to enable this search for spin-modulated gravitational
waves, highlighting the differences between this and other recent searches for
binaries with non-spinning components. The template bank we employed was found
to yield high matches with our spin-modulated target waveform for binaries with
masses in the asymmetric range 1.0 Msol < m1 < 3.0 Msol and 12.0 Msol < m2 <
20.0 Msol which is where we would expect the spin of the binary's components to
have significant effect. We find that our search of S3 LIGO data had good
sensitivity to binaries in the Milky Way and to a small fraction of binaries in
M31 and M33 with masses in the range 1.0 Msol < m1, m2 < 20.0 Msol. No
gravitational wave signals were identified during this search. Assuming a
binary population with spinning components and Gaussian distribution of masses
representing a prototypical neutron star - black hole system with m1 ~ 1.35
Msol and m2 ~ 5 Msol, we calculate the 90%-confidence upper limit on the rate
of coalescence of these systems to be 15.9 yr^-1 L_10^-1, where L_10 is 10^10
times the blue light luminosity of the Sun.
