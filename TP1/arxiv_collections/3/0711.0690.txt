In this paper we offer a unified approach to the problem of nonparametric
regression on the unit interval. It is based on a universal, honest and
non-asymptotic confidence region which is defined by a set of linear
inequalities involving the values of the functions at the design points.
Interest will typically centre on certain simplest functions in that region
where simplicity can be defined in terms of shape (number of local extremes,
intervals of convexity/concavity) or smoothness (bounds on derivatives) or a
combination of both. Once some form of regularization has been decided upon the
confidence region can be used to provide honest non-asymptotic confidence
bounds which are less informative but conceptually much simpler.
