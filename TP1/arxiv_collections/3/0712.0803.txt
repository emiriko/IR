We present a measurement of the shape of the Z/gamma* boson transverse
momentum (qT) distribution in ppbar -> Z/gamma* -> ee+X events at a
center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV using 0.98 fb-1 of data collected with the D0
detector at the Fermilab Tevatron collider. The data are found to be consistent
with the resummation prediction at low qT, but above the perturbative QCD
calculation in the region of qT>30 GeV/c. Using events with qT<30 GeV/c, we
extract the value of g2, one of the non-perturbative parameters for the
resummation calculation. Data at large boson rapidity y are compared with the
prediction of resummation and with alternative models that employ a resummed
form factor with modifications in the small Bjorken x region of the proton wave
function.
