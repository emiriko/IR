We consider the Bohr correspondence limit of the Schrodinger wave function
for an atomic elliptic state. We analyse this limit in the context of Nelson's
stochastic mechanics, exposing an underlying deterministic dynamical system in
which trajectories converge to Keplerian motion on an ellipse. This solves the
long standing problem of obtaining Kepler's laws of planetary motion in a
quantum mechanical setting. In this quantum mechanical setting, local mild
instabilities occur in the Kelperian orbit for eccentricities greater than
1/\sqrt{2} which do not occur classically.
