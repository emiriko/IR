The bright soliton solutions of the mixed 2-coupled nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger
(CNLS) equations with linear self and cross coupling terms have been obtained
by identifying a transformation that transforms the corresponding equation to
the integrable mixed 2-CNLS equations. The study on the collision dynamics of
bright solitons shows that there exists periodic energy switching, due to the
coupling terms. This periodic energy switching can be controlled by the new
type of shape changing collisions of bright solitons arising in mixed 2-CNLS
system, characterized by intensity redistribution, amplitude dependent phase
shift and relative separation distance. We also point out that this system
exhibits large periodic intensity switching even with very small linear self
coupling strengths.
