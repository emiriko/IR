This review consists of two parts. The first part establishes certain
astrophysical bounds on the smoothness of classical spacetime. Some of the best
bounds to date are based on the absence of vacuum Cherenkov radiation in
ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays. The second part discusses possible implications
of these bounds for the quantum structure of spacetime. One conjecture is that
the fundamental length scale of quantum spacetime may be different from the
Planck length.
