Motivated by the possibility of creating non-Abelian fields using cold atoms
in optical lattices, we explore the richness and complexity of non-interacting
two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) in a lattice, subjected to such fields.
In the continuum limit, a non-Abelian system characterized by a two-component
"magnetic flux" describes a harmonic oscillator existing in two different
charge states (mimicking a particle-hole pair) where the coupling between the
states is determined by the non-Abelian parameter, namely the difference
between the two components of the "magnetic flux." A key feature of the
non-Abelian system is a splitting of the Landau energy levels, which broaden
into bands, as the spectrum depends explicitly on the transverse momentum.
These Landau bands result in a coarse-grained "moth," a continuum version of
the generalized Hofstadter butterfly. Furthermore, the bands overlap, leading
to effective relativistic effects. Importantly, similar features also
characterize the corresponding two-dimensional lattice problem when at least
one of the components of the magnetic flux is an irrational number. The lattice
system with two competing "magnetic fluxes" penetrating the unit cell provides
a rich environment in which to study localization phenomena. Some unique
aspects of the transport properties of the non-Abelian system are the
possibility of inducing localization by varying the quasimomentum, and the
absence of localization of certain zero-energy states exhibiting a linear
energy-momentum relation. Furthermore, non-Abelian systems provide an
interesting localization scenario where the localization transition is
accompanied by a transition from relativistic to non-relativistic theory.
