We consider the Anomalous Hall Effect (AHE) in thin disordered ferromagnetic
films. Using a microscopic model of electrons in a random potential of
identical impurities including spin-orbit coupling, we develop a general
formulation for strong, finite range impurity scattering. Explicit calculations
are done within a short range but strong impurity scattering to obtain AH
conductivities for both the skew scattering and side jump mechanisms. We also
evaluate quantum corrections due to interactions and weak localization effects.
We show that for arbitrary strength of the impurity scattering, the
electron-electron interaction correction to the AH conductivity vanishes
exactly due to general symmetry reasons. On the other hand, we find that our
explicit evaluation of the weak localization corrections within the strong,
short range impurity scattering model can explain the experimentally observed
logarithmic temperature dependences in disordered ferromagnetic Fe films.
