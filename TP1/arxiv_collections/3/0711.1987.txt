We analyze the Casimir force between two parallel infinite metal cylinders,
with nearby metal plates (sidewalls), using complementary methods for mutual
confirmation. The attractive force between cylinders is shown to have a
nonmonotonic dependence on the separation to the plates. This intrinsically
multi-body phenomenon, which occurs with either one or two sidewalls
(generalizing an earlier result for squares between two sidewalls), does not
follow from any simple two-body force description. We can, however, explain the
nonmonotonicity by considering the screening (enhancement) of the interactions
by the fluctuating charges (currents) on the two cylinders, and their images on
the nearby plate(s). Furthermore, we show that this effect also implies a
nonmonotonic dependence of the cylinder-plate force on the cylinder-cylinder
separation.
