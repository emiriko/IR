The forced rupture of single chemical bonds under external load is addressed.
A general framework is put forward to optimally utilize the experimentally
observed rupture force data for estimating the parameters of a theoretical
model. As an application we explore to what extent a distinction between
several recently proposed models is feasible on the basis of realistic
experimental data sets.
