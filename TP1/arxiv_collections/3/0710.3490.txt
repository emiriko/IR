We continue to explore the consequences of the recently discovered Minkowski
space structure of the Higgs potential in the two-Higgs-doublet model. Here, we
focus on the vacuum properties. The search for extrema of the Higgs potential
is reformulated in terms of 3-quadrics in the 3+1-dimensional Minkowski space.
We prove that 2HDM cannot have more than two local minima in the orbit space
and that a twice-degenerate minimum can arise only via spontaneous violation of
a discrete symmetry of the Higgs potential. Investigating topology of the
3-quadrics, we give concise criteria for existence of non-contractible paths in
the Higgs orbit space. We also study explicit symmetries of the Higgs
potential/lagrangian and their spontaneous violation from a wider perspective
than usual.
