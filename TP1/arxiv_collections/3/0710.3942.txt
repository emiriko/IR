The reactions $\Sigma_b^* \to \Lambda_b \pi$, $\Sigma_b \to \Lambda_b \pi$,
and $\Xi_b^* \to \Xi_b \pi$ are studied in the $^3P_0$ non-relativistic quark
model with all the model parameters fixed in the sector of light quarks. The
theoretical predictions for the decay widths $\Gamma_{\Sigma_b^* \to \Lambda_b
\pi}$ and $\Gamma_{\Sigma_b \to \Lambda_b \pi}$ are consistent with the
experimental data of the CDF Collaboration. Using as an input the recent mass
of $\Xi_b$ and the theoretical predictions mass of $\Xi_b^{*}$, a narrow decay
width about 1 MeV is predicted for the bottom baryon $\Xi_b^*$. The work
suggests that the $^3P_0$ quark dynamics is of independence of environments
where heavy quarks may or may not be a component of baryons.
