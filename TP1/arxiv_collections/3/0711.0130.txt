We analyze the behavior of the longitudinal conductivity $\sigma_{zz}$ in a
field perpendicular to the highly conducting plane of a quasi-2D {\em
multiband} metal in the case of closed system and open systems where $\tau$ is
fixed, $\tau$ oscillates due to intra-band scattering and $\tau$ oscillates due
to inter-band scattering. In all but one case, we find that there are also
mixing frequencies present -- however they exhibit different qualitative
behaviors, as befits their different origins, and in the case of inter-band
scattering in an opensystem, may in fact be absent in the dHvA oscillations of
that system.
