A stochastic theory for the toppling activity in sandpile models is
developed, based on a simple mean-field assumption about the toppling process.
The theory describes the process as an anti-persistent Gaussian walk, where the
diffusion coefficient is proportional to the activity. It is formulated as a
generalization of the It\^{o} stochastic differential equation with an
anti-persistent fractional Gaussian noise source. An essential element of the
theory is re-scaling to obtain a proper thermodynamic limit, and it captures
all temporal features of the toppling process obtained by numerical simulation
of the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld sandpile in this limit.
