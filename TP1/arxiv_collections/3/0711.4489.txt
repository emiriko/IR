A recent progress in a gauge-invariant Lagrangian description of massive and
massless half-integer higher-spin fields in AdS and Minkowski spaces is
presented. The procedure is based on a BFV-BRST operator, encoding the initial
conditions realized by constraints in a Fock space and extracting the
higher-spin fields from unitary irreducible representations of the AdS
(Poincare) group. The construction is applicable to higher-spin tensor fields
with a multi-row Young tableaux.
