The chirally-odd twist-3 parton distribution function e(x) of the nucleon is
studied in the large-Nc limit in the framework of the chiral quark-soliton
model. It is demonstrated that in spite of properties not shared by other
distribution functions, namely the appearance of a delta(x)-singularity and
quadratic divergences in e(x), an equally reliable calculation is possible.
Among the most remarkable results obtained in this work is the fact that the
coefficient of the delta(x)-singularity can be computed exactly in this model,
avoiding involved numerics. Our results complete existing studies in
literature.
