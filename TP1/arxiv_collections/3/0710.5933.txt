The continuum discretized coupled channels (CDCC) method is compared to the
exact solution of the three-body Faddeev equations in momentum space. We
present results for: i) elastic and breakup observables of d-12C at E_d=56 MeV,
ii) elastic scattering of d-58Ni at E_d=80 MeV, and iii) elastic, breakup and
transfer observables for 11Be+p at E_{11Be}/A=38.4 MeV. Our comparative studies
show that, in the first two cases, the CDCC method is a good approximation to
the full three-body Faddeev solution, but for the 11Be exotic nucleus,
depending on the observable or the kinematic regime, it may miss out some of
the dynamic three-body effects that appear through the explicit coupling to the
transfer channel.
