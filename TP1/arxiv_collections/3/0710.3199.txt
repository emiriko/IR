At the quark level there are basically two types of contributions of R-parity
violating SUSY (RPV SUSY) to neutrinoless double beta decay: the short-range
contribution involving only heavy virtual superpartners and the long-range one
with the virtual squark and neutrino. Hadronization of the effective operators,
corresponding to these two types of contributions, may in general involve
virtual pions in addition to the close on-mass-shell nucleons. It is known that
the short-range contribution is dominated by the pion exchange. In the present
paper we show that this is also true for the long-range RPV SUSY contribution
and, therefore, the RPV SUSY contributes to the neutrinoless double beta decay
dominantly via charged pion exchange between the decaying nucleons.
