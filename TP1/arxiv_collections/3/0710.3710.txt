Notwithstanding the visible maturity of the subject of Bose-Einstein
Correlations (BEC), as witnessed nowadays, we would like to bring to ones
attention two points, which apparently did not received attention they deserve:
the problem of the choice of the form of $C_2(Q)$ correlation function when
effects of partial coherence of the hadronizing source are to be included and
the feasibility to model effects of Bose-Einstein statistics, in particular the
BEC, by direct numerical simulations.
