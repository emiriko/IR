ECLAIR is a Prolog-based prototype system aiming to provide a functionally
complete environment for the study, development and evaluation of programming
language analysis and implementation tools. In this paper, we sketch the
overall structure of the system, outlining the main methodologies and
technologies underlying its components. We also discuss the appropriateness of
Prolog as the implementation language for the system: besides highlighting its
strengths, we also point out a few potential weaknesses, hinting at possible
solutions.
