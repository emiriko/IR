The design and performance of a compact heated vapor cell unit for realizing
a dichroic atomic vapor laser lock (DAVLL) for the D2 transitions in atomic
rubidium is described. A 5 cm-long vapor cell is placed in a double-solenoid
arrangement to produce the required magnetic field; the heat from the solenoid
is used to increase the vapor pressure and correspondingly the DAVLL signal. We
have characterized experimentally the dependence of important features of the
DAVLL signal on magnetic field and cell temperature. For the weaker transitions
both the amplitude and gradient of the signal are increased by an order of
magnitude.
