We show that the low-energy electronic structure of arbitrarily stacked
graphene multilayers with nearest-neighbor interlayer tunneling consists of
chiral pseudospin doublets. Although the number of doublets in an $N$-layer
system depends on the stacking sequence, the pseudospin chirality sum is always
$N$. $N$-layer stacks have $N$ distinct Landau levels at E=0 for each spin and
valley, and quantized Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy} = \pm(4 e^2/h)(N/2+n)$
where $n$ is a non-negative integer.
