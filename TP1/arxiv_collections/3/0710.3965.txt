We associate a quasisymmetric function to any Bruhat interval in a general
Coxeter group. This association can be seen to be a morphism of Hopf algebras
to the subalgebra of all peak functions, leading to an extension of the
cd-index of convex polytopes. We show how the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial of the
Bruhat interval can be expressed in terms of this complete cd-index and
otherwise explicit combinatorially defined polynomials. In particular, we
obtain the simplest closed formula for the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials that
holds in complete generality.
