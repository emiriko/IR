An analytical method is presented with allows to estimate the energy
resolution of time-of-flight neutron spectrometers, as well as its partial
contributions, over a dynamical range that extends from the elastic line to the
accessible inelastic regions. Such a method, already successfully applied in
the past to the TOSCA and HET neutron inelastic scattering spectrometers
installed at the ISIS neutron spallation source [A M Gaspar, PhD Thesis,
Universidade Tecnica de Lisboa, 2004], is here applied to the high resolution
time-of-flight spectrometer TOFTOF, mainly dedicated to quasi-elastic neutron
scattering studies and installed at the new neutron reactor FRM II. To make
such calculations easily understandable, the principle of work of the TOFTOF
instrument and of each of its components is explained in detail. A simply
method that can be used to estimate the instrument intensity, i.e. of the
number of neutrons arriving at the sample position per unit time, is also
briefly outlined.
  To the benefit of the TOFTOF users, graphs displaying the dependencies of the
instrument resolution at the elastic line and of the instrument intensity on
the relevant instrument parameters, i.e the wavelength of the incident
neutrons, the choppers speed of rotation and the frame overlap ratio, are
presented, in the form of iso-resolution or iso-intensity lines. The method of
estimation of the frame overlap ratio that is commonly used at time-of-flight
instruments such as TOFTOF is also explained and alternative options concerning
this parameter, depending on the dynamical range of interest, are briefly
addressed.
