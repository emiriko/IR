We analyse the phenomenological viability of heterotic Z(3) orbifolds with
two Wilson lines, which naturally predict three supersymmetric families of
matter and Higgs fields. Given that these models can accommodate realistic
scenarios for the quark sector avoiding potentially dangerous flavour-changing
neutral currents, we now address the leptonic sector, finding that viable
orbifold configurations can in principle be obtained. In particular,it is
possible to accomodate present data on charged lepton masses, while avoiding
conflict with lepton flavour-violating decays. Concerning the generation of
neutrino masses and mixings, we find that Z(3) orbifolds offer several
interesting possibilities.
