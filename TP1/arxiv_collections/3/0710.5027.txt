I summarize the status of three-flavour neutrino oscillations with date of
Oct. 2007, and provide an outlook for the developments to be expected in the
near future. Furthermore, I discuss the status of sterile neutrino oscillation
interpretations of the LSND anomaly in the light of recent MiniBooNE results,
and comment on implications for the future neutrino oscillation program.
