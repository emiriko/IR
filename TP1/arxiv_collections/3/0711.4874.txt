We discuss a self-consistent method to calculate the properties of cold
asymmetric nuclear matter which is dressed with isoscalar scalar pion
condensates. The nucleon-nucleon interaction is mediated by these pion pairs,
omega- and rho- mesons. The parameters of these interactions are evaluated
self-consistently using the saturation properties of nuclear matter like
binding energy, pressure, compressibility and symmetry energy. The computed
equation of state of pure neutron matter (PNM) is used to calculate mass and
radius of a pure neutron star.
