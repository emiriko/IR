This document provides a roadmap for ILC detector test beam needs in the next
3 - 5 years. In this period, detector Letters of Intent are expected by fall
2008, the ILC Engineering Design Report to be submitted in ILC and its
detectors in 2012. ILC detectors are required to have unprecedented precision
to be able to elucidate new physics discoveries at TeV energies from the LHC
and ILC machines, and to fully exploit experimental investifation at the
electrweak unification energy scale. Ahieving this requires significant
investment for detector test beam activities to complete the R&D needed, to
test prototypes and (later) to qualify final detector system desgns, including
integated system tess. This roadmap document describes the need for significant
increases in resources for ILC test beam activities. It should be used by test
beam facility managers and the worldwide ILC leadership to assure that the
necessary resources and facilities are made available to meet the needs in
time.
