The half-life of 10C has been measured to be 19.310(4)s, a result with 0.02%
precision, which is a factor of three improvement over the best previous
result. Since 10C is the lightest superallowed 0+ --> 0+ beta emitter, its ft
value has the greatest weight in setting an upper limit on the possible
presence of scalar currents.
