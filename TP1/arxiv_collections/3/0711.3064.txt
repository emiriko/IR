We predict that optical Bloch oscillations can be observed in layered
structures with left-handed metamaterials and zero average refractive index
where the layer thickness varies linearly across the structure. We demonstrate
a new type of the Bloch oscillations associated with coupled surface waves
excited at the interfaces between the layers with left-handed material and
conventional dielectric.
