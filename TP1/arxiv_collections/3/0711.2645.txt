We study the rapid decrease of peak gain in resonant-phonon THz Quantum
Cascade Lasers with increasing temperature. The effect of various microscopic
scattering processes on the gain profile as a function of temperature is
discussed. We argue that increased broadening, primarily due to increased
impurity scattering, and not diminishing population inversion, is the main
reason for the reduction of peak gain.
