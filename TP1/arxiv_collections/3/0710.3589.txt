We develop a method of an asymptotically exact treatment of threshold
singularities in dynamic response functions of gapless integrable models. The
method utilizes the integrability to recast the original problem in terms of
the low-energy properties of a certain deformed Hamiltonian. The deformed
Hamiltonian is local, hence it can be analysed using the conventional field
theory methods. We apply the technique to spinless fermions on a lattice with
nearest-neighbors repulsion, and evaluate the exponent characterizing the
threshold singularity in the dynamic structure factor.
