This is a report on the joint work with Francois Gieres, Stefan Hohenegger,
Olivier Piguet and Manfred Schweda. We consider a non-commutative U(1) gauge
theory with an extension which was originally proposed by A. A. Slavnov in
order to get rid of UV/IR mixing problems. Here we show, that the improved IR
behaviour of this model is mainly due to the appearence of a linear vector
supersymmetry.
