On the example of two-dimensional (2D) 3He we demonstrate that the main
universal features of its experimental temperature T - density x phase diagram
[see M. Neumann, J. Ny\'{e}ki, J. Saunders, Science 317, 1356 (2007)] look like
those in the heavy-fermion metals. Our comprehensive theoretical analysis of
experimental situation in 2D 3He allows us to propose a simple expression for
effective mass M^*(T,x), describing all diverse experimental facts in 2D 3He in
unified manner and demonstrating that the universal behavior of M^*(T,x)
coincides with that observed in HF metals.
