The Fermi arc is a striking manifestation of the strong-correlation physics
in high-T_c cuprates. In this paper, implications of the metallic transport in
the lightly hole-doped regime of the cuprates, where the Fermi arcs are found,
are examined in conjunction with competing interpretations of the Fermi arcs in
terms of small hole pockets or a large underlying Fermi surface. It is
discussed that the latter picture provides a more natural understanding of the
metallic transport in view of the Mott-limit argument. Furthermore, it is shown
that a suitable modeling of the Fermi arcs in the framework of the Boltzmann
theory allows us to intuitively understand why the transport properties are
apparently determined by a "small" carrier density even when the underlying
Fermi surface, and hence k_F, is large.
