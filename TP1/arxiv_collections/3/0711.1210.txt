We investigate the equivalence of quantum mixed states under local unitary
transformations. For a class of rank-two mixed states, a sufficient and
necessary condition of local equivalence is obtained by giving a complete set
of invariants under local unitary transformations, such that two states in this
class are locally equivalent if and only if all these invariants have equal
values for them.
