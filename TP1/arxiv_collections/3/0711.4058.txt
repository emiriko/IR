We present a model for current-driven motion of a magnetic domain-wall line,
in which the dynamics of the domain wall is equivalent to that of an overdamped
vortex line in an anisotropic pinning potential. This potential has both
extrinsic contributions due to, e.g., sample inhomogeneities, and an intrinsic
contribution due to magnetic anisotropy. We obtain results for the domain-wall
velocity as a function of current for various regimes of pinning. In
particular, we find that the exponent characterizing the creep regime depends
strongly on the presence of a dissipative spin transfer torque. We discuss our
results in the light of recent experiments on current-driven domain-wall creep
in ferromagnetic semiconductors, and suggest further experiments to corroborate
our model.
