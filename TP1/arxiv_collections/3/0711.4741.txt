An overview is presented on the program to study the nucleon structure at the
12 GeV JLab upgrade using the CLAS12 detector. The focus is on deeply virtual
exclusive processes to access the generalized parton distributions,
semni-inclusive processes to study transverse momentum dependent distribution
functions, and inclusive spin structure functions and resonance transition form
factors at high Q^2 and with high precision.
