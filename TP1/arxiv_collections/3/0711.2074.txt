We investigate the evolution of the heavy fermion ground state under
application of a strong external magnetic field. We present a richer version of
the usual hybridization mean field theory that allows for hybridization in both
the singlet and triplet channels and incorporates a self-consistent Weiss
field. We show that for a magnetic field strength B*, a filling-dependent
fraction of the zero-field hybridization gap, the spin up quasiparticle band
becomes fully polarized--an event marked by a sudden jump in the magnetic
susceptibility. The system exhibits a kind of quantum rigidity in which the
susceptibility (and several other physical observables) are insensitive to
further increases in field strength. This behavior ends abruptly with the
collapse of the hybridization order parameter in a first-order transition to
the normal metallic state. We argue that the feature at B* corresponds to the
"metamagnetic transition" in YbRh2Si2. Our results are in good agreement with
recent experimental measurements.
