In this paper, the application of a cycle accurate binary translator for
rapid prototyping of SoCs will be presented. This translator generates code to
run on a rapid prototyping system consisting of a VLIW processor and FPGAs. The
generated code is annotated with information that triggers cycle generation for
the hardware in parallel to the execution of the translated program. The VLIW
processor executes the translated program whereas the FPGAs contain the
hardware for the parallel cycle generation and the bus interface that adapts
the bus of the VLIW processor to the SoC bus of the emulated processor core.
