We investigate a new fault ordering heuristic for test generation in
full-scan circuits. The heuristic is referred to as the accidental detection
index. It associates a value ADI (f) with every circuit fault f. The heuristic
estimates the number of faults that will be detected by a test generated for f.
Fault ordering is done such that a fault with a higher accidental detection
index appears earlier in the ordered fault set and targeted earlier during test
generation. This order is effective for generating compact test sets, and for
obtaining a test set with a steep fault coverage curve. Such a test set has
several applications. We present experimental results to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the heuristic.
