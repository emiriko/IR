It is demonstrated that when the bundle of 2-forms on a four-dimensional
manifold M admits an almost-complex structure any choice of "real + imaginary"
subspace decomposition of the bundle defines a conjugation map, as well as a
Hermitian structure for the bundle. When the almost-complex structure comes
from a linear electromagnetic constitutive law, the real and imaginary parts of
the Hermitian structure are then shown to represent the Hamiltonian for an
anisotropic three-dimensional electromagnetic oscillator at each point of M and
a symplectic structure for each fiber. The complex form of the oscillator
equations is also definable in terms of the geometric structures that were
introduced.
