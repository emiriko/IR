Recent results on di-jet, inclusive jets, production at high p_T in Deep
Inelastic Scattering DIS and photoproduction gamma p regimes using both the H1
and ZEUS detectors at HERA are presented. Also studies of integrated jet shape
and jet radius dependencies in DIS performed by the ZEUS Collaborations are
discussed. All the measurements are found to be well described by calculations
at the next-to-leading order in perturbative QCD. A combined determination of
the value of the strong coupling constant alpha_s(M_Z) from the H1 and ZEUS
Collaborations using inclusive-jet cross-section measurements in neutral
current DIS at high Q^2 is shown.
