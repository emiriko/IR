We study the physics of the ideal relativistic rotating gas at
thermodynamical equilibrium and provide analytical expressions of the momentum
spectra and polarization vector for the case of massive particles with spin 1/2
and 1. We show that the finite angular momentum J entails an anisotropy in
momentum spectra, with particles emitted orthogonally to J having, on average,
a larger momentum than along its direction. Unlike in the non-relativistic
case, the proper polarization vector turns out not to be aligned with the total
angular momentum with a non-trivial momentum dependence.
