We derive an explicit form of a family of four-point Neveu-Schwarz blocks
with $\hat c =1,$ external weights $\Delta_i = 1/8$ and arbitrary intermediate
weight. The derivation is based on a set of identities obeyed in the free
superscalar theory by correlation functions of fields satisfying Ramond
condition with respect to the bosonic (dimension 1) and the fermionic
(dimension 1/2) currents.
