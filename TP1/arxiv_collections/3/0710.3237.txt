Corrections of orders alpha^5 and alpha^6 are calculated in the hyperfine
splittings of 1S and 2S - energy levels in the ion of muonic helium. The
electron vacuum polarization effects, the nuclear structure corrections and
recoil corrections are taken into account. The obtained numerical values of the
hyperfine splittings -1334.56 meV (1S state), -166.62 meV (2S state) can be
considered as a reliable estimate for the comparison with the future
experimental data. The hyperfine splitting interval Delta_{12}=(8 Delta
E^{hfs}(2S)- Delta E^{hfs}(1S)) = 1.64 meV can be used for the check of quantum
electrodynamics.
