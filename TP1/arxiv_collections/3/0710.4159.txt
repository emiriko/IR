In a framework of catastrophe theory we investigate the equilibrium set for
the system of strongly correlated electron gas at the conditions of dHvA effect
and show that the discontinuities accompanied the diamagnetic phase transition
(DPT) is handled by Riemann-Hugoniot catastrophe. We show that applicability of
the standard condition for observation of DPT $a\ge$1 where $a$ is the
differential magnetic susceptibility is valid only in the nearest vicinity of
triple degenerate point corresponding to the center of dHvA period, but for
arbitrary value of magnetic field in every period of dHvA oscillations this
condition is modified in accordance with the bifurcation set of cusp
catastrophe. While at the center of dHvA period the symmetric supercritical
pitchfork bifurcation gives rise to the second order phase transition on
temperature, the deviation of magnetic field from the value corresponding to
the center of dHvA period results in the change of the phase transition order
from the second to the first one both on temperature and magnetic field. In the
framework of developed theory we obtain good agreement with available
experimental data.
