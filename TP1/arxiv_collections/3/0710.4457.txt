We examine the effect of superluminal signal propagation through a
birefringent crystal, where the effect is not due to absorption or reflection,
but to the filtration of a special polarization component. We first examine the
effect by a stationary phase analysis, with results consistent with those of an
earlier analysis of the system. We supplement this analysis by considering the
transit of a gaussian wave and find bounds for the validity of the stationary
phase result. The propagation of the gaussian wave is illustrated by figures.
