End-user informatics applications are Internet data web management automation
solutions. These are mass modeling and mass management collaborative communal
consensus solutions. They are made and maintained by managerial, professional,
technical and specialist end-users. In end-user informatics the end-users are
always right. So it becomes necessary for information technology professionals
to understand information and informatics from the end-user perspective.
End-user informatics starts with the observation that practical prose is a mass
consensus communal modeling technology. This high technology is the mechanistic
modeling medium we all use every day in all of our practical pursuits.
Practical information flows are the lifeblood of modern capitalist communities.
But what exactly is practical information? It's ultimately physical
information, but the physics is highly emergent rather than elementary. So
practical reality is just physical reality in deep disguise. Practical prose is
the medium that we all use to model the everyday and elite mechanics of
practical reality. So this is the medium that end-user informatics must
automate and animate.
