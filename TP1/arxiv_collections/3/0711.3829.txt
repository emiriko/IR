We study the contribution of instantons to the binding and the mass of the
lightest scalar glueball, in gluondynamics. We show that the short-range
correlations introduced by such non-perturbative vacuum fluctuations are
sufficient to give raise to a scalar glueball bound-state, with mass in good
agreement with the results of recent lattice calculations.
