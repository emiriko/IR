First measurement of sub-threshold $\Sigma$(1385) production is presented.
Experimental data are presented for Al+Al reactions at 1.9$A$ GeV measured with
the FOPI detector at SIS/GSI. The $\Sigma$(1385)/$\Lambda$ ratio is found to be
in good agreement with the transport and statistical model predictions. The
results allow for a better understanding of sub-threshold strangeness
production and strangeness exchange reaction which is the dominant process for
$K^-$ production below and close-to threshold.
