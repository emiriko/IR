A quantum Zeno dynamics can be obtained by means of frequent measurements,
frequent unitary kicks or a strong continuous coupling and yields a partition
of the total Hilbert space into quantum Zeno subspaces, among which any
transition is hindered. We focus on the "continuous" version of the quantum
Zeno effect and look at several interesting examples. We first analyze these
examples in practical terms, towards applications, then propose a novel
experiment.
