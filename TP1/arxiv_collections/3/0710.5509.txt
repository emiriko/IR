We introduce a comprehensive scheme to physically quantify both viscous and
elastic rheological nonlinearities simultaneously, using an imposed large
amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) strain. The new framework naturally lends a
physical interpretation to commonly reported Fourier coefficients of the
nonlinear stress response. Additionally, we address the ambiguities inherent in
the standard definitions of viscoelastic moduli when extended into the
nonlinear regime, and define new measures which reveal behavior that is
obscured by conventional techniques.
