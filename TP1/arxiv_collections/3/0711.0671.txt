We investigate the Josephson current J(\phi) through a quantum dot embedded
between two superconductors showing a phase difference \phi. The system is
modeled as a single Anderson impurity coupled to BCS leads, and the functional
and the numerical renormalization group frameworks are employed to treat the
local Coulomb interaction U. We reestablish the picture of a quantum phase
transition occurring if the ratio between the Kondo temperature T_K and the
superconducting energy gap \Delta or, at appropriate T_K/\Delta, the phase
difference \phi or the impurity energy is varied. We present accurate zero- as
well as finite-temperature T data for the current itself, thereby settling a
dispute raised about its magnitude. For small to intermediate U and at T=0 the
truncated functional renormalization group is demonstrated to produce reliable
results without the need to implement demanding numerics. It thus provides a
tool to extract characteristics from experimental current-voltage measurements.
