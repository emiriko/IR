The energy-momentum distribution of spatially homogeneous rotating spacetimes
in the context of teleparallel theory of gravity is investigated. For this
purpose, we use the teleparallel version of Moller prescription. It is found
that the components of energy-momentum density are finite and well-defined but
are different from General Relativity. However, the energy-momentum density
components become the same in both theories under certain assumptions. We also
analyse these quantities for some special solutions of the spatially
homogeneous rotating spacetimes.
