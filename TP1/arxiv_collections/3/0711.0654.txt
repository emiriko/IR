We shortly review point-form quantum field theory, i.e. the canonical
quantization of a relativistic field theory on a Lorentz-invariant surface of
the form $x_\mu x^\mu = \tau^2$. As an example of how point-form quantum field
theory may enter the framework of relativistic quantum mechanics we discuss the
calculation of the electromagnetic form factor of a confined quark-antiquark
pair (e.g. the pion).
