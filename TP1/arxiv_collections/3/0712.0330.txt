The ATDHFB approach has been applied for a study of properties of collective
quadrupole states in several transactinide nuclei: 238U, 240Pu, 242Pu, 246Cm,
248Cm, 250Cf and 252Cf. Calculated energies and B(E2) transition probabilities
are in a reasonable agreement with experimental data. Results concerning
superdeformed collective states in the 240Pu nucleus are also presented.
