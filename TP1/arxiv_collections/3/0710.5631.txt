Multiport generalizations of beam splitters are the key component in
multipath interferometers, which are important in a range of quantum state
engineering and precision measurement schemes. Here we propose a
straightforward method for implementing multiport devices for atoms trapped in
optical ring lattices. These devices are interesting as atoms have certain
properties (such as mass) that photons do not and the ring configuration makes
them useful for applications such as precision gyroscopes. We discuss how they
could be employed in useful measurement schemes and investigate how practical
considerations limit the size of the devices that can be achieved by this
method.
