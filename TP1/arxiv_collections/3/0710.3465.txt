The behavior of homogeneous and disordered systems with a free boundary is
described on the basis of group theory in the two-loop approximation directly
in three-dimensional space. The effect of the free boundary on the regime of
the bulk critical behavior is revealed. It is shown that the boundedness of the
system slightly affects the regime of the bulk critical behavior in the case of
the ordinary transition, whereas this effect is more noticeable in the case of
the special transition. Surface critical phenomena are described for
homogeneous and disordered systems, and the critical exponents are calculated
in the two-loop approximation. It is shown that the effect of impurities is
insignificant in the special phase transition, whereas it is more noticeable in
the ordinary phase transition. The derived critical exponents are compared with
the computer-simulation results.
