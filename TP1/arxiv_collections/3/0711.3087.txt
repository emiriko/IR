The nonlinear Hartree equation describes the macroscopic dynamics of
initially factorized N-boson states, in the limit of large N. In this paper we
provide estimates on the rate of convergence of the microscopic quantum
mechanical evolution towards the limiting Hartree dynamics. More precisely, we
prove bounds on the difference between the one-particle density associated with
the solution of the N-body Schroedinger equation and the orthogonal projection
onto the solution of the Hartree equation.
