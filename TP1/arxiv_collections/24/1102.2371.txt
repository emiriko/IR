Frequency shifts and dissipations of a compound torsional oscillator induced
by solid $^4$He samples containing $^3$He impurity concentrations ($x_3$ = 0.3,
3, 6, 12 and 25 in units of 10$^{-6}$) have been measured at two resonant mode
frequencies ($f_1$ = 493 and $f_2$ = 1164 Hz) at temperatures ($T$) between
0.02 and 1.1 K. The fractional frequency shifts of the $f_1$ mode were much
smaller than those of the $f_2$ mode. The observed frequency shifts continued
to decrease as $T$ was increased above 0.3 K, and the conventional
non-classical rotation inertia fraction was not well defined in all samples
with $x_3 \geq$ 3 ppm. Temperatures where peaks in dissipation of the $f_2$
mode occurred were higher than those of the $f_1$ mode in all samples. The peak
dissipation magnitudes of the $f_1$ mode was greater than those of the $f_2$
mode in all samples. The activation energy and the characteristic time
($\tau_0$) were extracted for each sample from an Arrhenius plot between mode
frequencies and inverse peak temperatures. The average activation energy among
all samples was 430 mK, and $\tau_0$ ranged from 2$\times 10^{-7}$ s to
5$\times 10^{-5}$ s in samples with $x_3$ = 0.3 to 25 ppm. The characteristic
time increased in proportion to $x_3^{2/3}$. Observed temperature dependence of
dissipation were consistent with those expected from a simple Debye relaxation
model \emph{if} the dissipation peak magnitude was separately adjusted for each
mode. Observed frequency shifts were greater than those expected from the
model. The discrepancies between the observed and the model frequency shifts
increased at the higher frequency mode.
