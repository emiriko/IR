Recently, X. Chen et al. proposed a new approach to the gauge invariant
decomposition of the nucleon spin into helicity and orbital parts. The key
ingredient in their construction is the separation of the gauge field into
`physical' and `pure gauge' parts. We suggest a simple separation scheme and
show that the resulting gluon helicity coincides with the first moment of the
conventional polarized gluon distribution measurable in high energy
experiments.
