We use a method recently introduced by Simone and Skoric to study accusation
probabilities for non-binary Tardos fingerprinting codes. We generalize the
pre-computation steps in this approach to include a broad class of collusion
attack strategies. We analytically derive properties of a special attack that
asymptotically maximizes false accusation probabilities. We present numerical
results on sufficient code lengths for this attack, and explain the abrupt
transitions that occur in these results.
