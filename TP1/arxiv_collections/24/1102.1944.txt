Motivated by Kolmogorov's theory of turbulence we present a unified approach
to the regularity problems for the 3D Navier-Stokes and Euler equations. We
introduce a dissipation wavenumber $\Lambda (t)$ that separates low modes where
the Euler dynamics is predominant from the high modes where the viscous forces
take over. Then using an indifferent to the viscosity technique we obtain a new
regularity criterion which is weaker than every Ladyzhenskaya-Prodi-Serrin
condition in the viscous case, and reduces to the Beale-Kato-Majda criterion in
the inviscid case. In the viscous case we also we prove that Leray-Hopf
solutions are regular provided $\Lambda \in L^{5/2}$, which improves our
previous $\Lambda \in L^\infty$ condition. We also show that $\Lambda \in L^1$
for all Leray-Hopf solutions. Finally, we prove that Leray-Hopf solutions are
regular when the time-averaged spatial intermittency is small, i.e., close to
Kolmogorov's regime.
