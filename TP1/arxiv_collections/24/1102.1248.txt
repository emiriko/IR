We construct time quasi-periodic solutions to nonlinear wave equations on the
torus in arbitrary dimensions. All previously known results (in the case of
zero or a multiplicative potential) seem to be limited to the circle. This
generalizes the method developed in the limit-elliptic setting of NLS to the
hyperbolic setting. The additional ingredient is a Diophantine property of
algebraic numbers.
