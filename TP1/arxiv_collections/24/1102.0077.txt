We bring attention to the fact that in order to understand existing data on
neutrino oscillations, and to design future experiments, it is imperative to
appreciate the role of quantum entanglement. Once this is accounted for, the
resulting energy-momentum conserving phenomenology requires a single new
parameter related to disentanglement of a neutrino from its partners. This
parameter may not be CP symmetric. We illustrate the new ideas, with
potentially measurable effects, in the context of a novel experiment recently
proposed by Gavrin, Gorbachev, Veretenkin, and Cleveland. The strongest impact
of our ideas is on the resolution of various anomalies in neutrino oscillations
and on neutrino propagation in astrophysical environments.
