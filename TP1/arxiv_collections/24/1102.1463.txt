Recent experimental progress with Alkaline-Earth atoms has opened the door to
quantum computing schemes in which qubits are encoded in long-lived nuclear
spin states, and the metastable electronic states of these species are used for
manipulation and readout of the qubits. Here we discuss a variant of these
schemes, in which gate operations are performed in nuclear-spin-dependent
optical lattices, formed by near-resonant coupling to the metastable excited
state. This provides an alternative to a previous scheme [A. J. Daley, M. M.
Boyd, J. Ye, and P. Zoller, Phys. Rev. Lett 101, 170504 (2008)], which involved
independent lattices for different electronic states. As in the previous case,
we show how existing ideas for quantum computing with Alkali atoms such as
entanglement via controlled collisions can be freed from important technical
restrictions. We also provide additional details on the use of collisional
losses from metastable states to perform gate operations via a lossy blockade
mechanism.
