The Sznajd model is a sociophysics model that mimics the propagation of
opinions in a closed society, where the interactions favour groups of agreeing
people. It is based in the Ising and Potts ferromagnetic models and although
the original model used only linear chains, it has since been adapted to
general networks. This model has a very rich transient, that has been used to
model several aspects of elections, but its stationary states are always
consensus states. In order to model more complex behaviours we have, in a
recent work, introduced the idea of biases and prejudices to the Sznajd model,
by generalizing the bounded confidence rule that is common to many continuous
opinion models. In that work we have found that the mean-field version of this
model (corresponding to a complete network) allows for stationary states where
non-interacting opinions survive, but never for the coexistence of interacting
opinions. In the present work, we provide networks that allow for the
coexistence of interacting opinions. Moreover, we show that the model does not
become inactive, that is, the opinions keep changing, even in the stationary
regime. We also provide results that give some insights on how this behaviour
approaches the mean-field behaviour, as the networks are changed.
