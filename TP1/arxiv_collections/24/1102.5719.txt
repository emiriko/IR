It is well known that the Camassa-Holm equation possesses numerous remarkable
properties characteristic for KdV type equations. In this paper we show that it
shares one more property with the KdV equation. Namely, Ibragimov has shown
that the KdV and the modified KdV equations are self-adjoint. Starting from the
generalization of the Camassa-Holm equation, we prove that the Camassa-Holm
equation is self-adjoint. This property is important, e.g. for constructing
conservation laws associated with symmetries of the equation in question.
Accordingly, we construct conservation laws for the generalized Camassa-Holm
equation using its symmetries.
