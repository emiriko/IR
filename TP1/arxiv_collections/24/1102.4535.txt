We compute the phase diagram of the HgTe/CdTe quantum wells in the 3
dimensional (3D) parameter space of Dirac mass, Fermi level and disorder
strength. The phase diagram reveals the Quantum spin-Hall, the metallic and the
normal insulating phases. The phase boundary of the Quantum spin-Hall state is
shown to be strongly deformed by the disorder. Taking specific cuts into this
3D phase diagram, we recover the so called topological Anderson insulator (TAI)
phase, but now we can demonstrate explicitly that TAI is not a distinct phase
and instead it is part of the Quantum spin-Hall phase. The calculations are
performed with $S_z$-conserving and $S_z$-nonconserving Hamiltonians.
