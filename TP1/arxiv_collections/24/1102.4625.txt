We report the discovery of a hard-thermal (T ~ 130 MK) and variable X-ray
emission from the Be star HD 157832, a new member of the puzzling class of
gamma-Cas-like Be/X-ray systems. Recent optical spectroscopy reveals the
presence of a large/dense circumstellar disc seen at intermediate/high
inclination. With a B1.5V spectral type, HD 157832 is the coolest gamma-Cas
analog known. In addition, its non detection in the ROSAT all-sky survey shows
that its average soft X-ray luminosity varied by a factor larger than ~ 3 over
a time interval of 14 yr. These two remarkable features, ``low'' effective
temperature and likely high X-ray variability turn HD 157832 into a promising
object for understanding the origin of the unusually high temperature X-ray
emission in these systems.
