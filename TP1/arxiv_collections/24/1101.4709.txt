We investigate shot noise at {\it finite temperatures} induced by the
quasi-particle tunneling between fractional quantum Hall (FQH) edge states. The
resulting Fano factor has the peak structure at a certain bias voltage. Such a
structure indicates that quasi-particles are weakly {\it glued} due to thermal
fluctuation. We show that the effect makes it possible to probe the difference
of statistics between $\nu=1/5,{}2/5$ FQH states where quasi-particles have the
same unit charge.Finally we propose a way to indirectly obtain statistical
angle in hierarchical FQH states.
