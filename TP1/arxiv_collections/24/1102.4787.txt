The semiconductor-insulator phase transition of the single-layer manganite
La0.5Sr1.5MnO4 has been studied by means of high resolution synchrotron x-ray
powder diffraction and resonant x-ray scattering at the Mn K edge. We conclude
that a concomitant structural transition from tetragonal I4/mmm to orthorhombic
Cmcm phases drives this electronic transition. A detailed symmetry-mode
analysis reveals that condensation of three soft modes -Delta_2(B2u), X1+(B2u)
and X1+(A)- acting on the oxygen atoms accounts for the structural
transformation. The Delta_2 mode leads to a pseudo Jahn-Teller distortion (in
the orthorhombic bc-plane only) on one Mn site (Mn1) whereas the two X1+ modes
produce an overall contraction of the other Mn site (Mn2) and expansion of the
Mn1 one. The X1+ modes are responsible for the tetragonal superlattice
(1/2,1/2,0)-type reflections in agreement with a checkerboard ordering of two
different Mn sites. A strong enhancement of the scattered intensity has been
observed for these superlattice reflections close to the Mn K edge, which could
be ascribed to some degree of charge disproportion between the two Mn sites of
about 0.15 electrons. We also found that the local geometrical anisotropy of
the Mn1 atoms and its ordering originated by the condensed Delta_2 mode alone
perfectly explains the resonant scattering of forbidden (1/4,1/4,0)-type
reflections without invoking any orbital ordering.
