We compare two Monte Carlo implementations of resummation schemes for the
description of parton evolution at small values of Bjorken x. One of them is
based on the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) evolution equation and
generates fully differential parton distributions in momentum space making use
of reggeized gluons. The other one is based on the
Catani-Ciafaloni-Fiorani-Marchesini (CCFM) partonic kernel where QCD coherence
effects are introduced. It has been argued that both approaches agree with each
other in the x -> 0 limit. We show that this is not the case for azimuthal
angle dependent quantities since at high energies the BFKL approach is
dominated by its zero conformal spin component while the CCFM gluon Green
function receives contributions from all conformal spins even at very small x.
