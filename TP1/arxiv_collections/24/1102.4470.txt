We analyse the abelian sandpile model on $\mathbbm{Z}^d$ for the starting
configuration of $n$ particles in the origin and $2d-2$ particles otherwise. We
give a new short proof of the theorem of Fey, Levine and Peres \cite{FLP} that
the radius of the toppled cluster of this configuration is $O(n^{1/d})$.
