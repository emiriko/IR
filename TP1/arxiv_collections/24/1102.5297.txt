We investigate the violation of non-contextuality by a class of continuous
variable states, including variations of entangled coherent states (ECS's) and
a two-mode continuous superposition of coherent states. We generalise the
Kochen-Specker (KS) inequality discussed in A. Cabello, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf
101}, 210401 (2008) by using effective bidimensional observables implemented
through physical operations acting on continuous variable states, in a way
similar to an approach to the falsification of Bell-CHSH inequalities put
forward recently. We test for state-independent violation of KS inequalities
under variable degrees of state entanglement and mixedness. We then demonstrate
theoretically the violation of a KS inequality for any two-mode state by using
pseudo-spin observables and a generalized quasi-probability function.
