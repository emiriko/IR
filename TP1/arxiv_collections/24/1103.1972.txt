We introduce the informational power of a quantum measurement as the maximum
amount of classical information that the measurement can extract from any
ensemble of quantum states. We prove the additivity by showing that the
informational power corresponds to the classical capacity of a
quantum-classical channel. We restate the problem of evaluating the
informational power as the maximization of the accessible information of a
suitable ensemble. We provide a numerical algorithm to find an optimal
ensemble, and quantify the informational power.
