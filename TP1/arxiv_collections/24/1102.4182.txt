We investigate thermal rectification in a bulk material with a pyramid shape
to elucidate shape dependence of the thermal rectification, and find that
rectifying coefficient R is 1.35 for this shape, which is smaller than R=1.43
for a rectangular shape. This result is fully duplicated by our numerical
calculation based on Fourier's law. We also apply this calculation to a given
shape, and show a possible way to increase R depending on the shape.
