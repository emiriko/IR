New measurements to test the neutrality of matter by acoustic means are
reported. The apparatus is based on a spherical capacitor filled with gaseous
SF$_6$ excited by an oscillating electric field. The apparatus has been
calibrated measuring the electric polarizability. Assuming charge conservation
in the $\beta$ decay of the neutron, the experiment gives a limit of
$\epsilon_\text{p-e}\lesssim1\cdot10^{-21}$ for the electron-proton charge
difference, the same limit holding for the charge of the neutron. Previous
measurements are critically reviewed and found incorrect: the present result is
the best limit obtained with this technique.
