We present a systematic study of generalized transverse-momentum dependent
parton distributions (GTMDs). By taking specific limits or projections, these
GTMDs yield various transverse-momentum dependent and generalized parton
distributions, thus providing a unified framework to simultaneously model
different observables. We present such simultaneous modeling by considering a
light-cone wave function overlap representation of the GTMDs. We construct the
different quark-quark correlation functions from the 3-quark Fock components
within both the light-front constituent quark model as well as within the
chiral quark-soliton model. We provide a comparison with available data and
make predictions for different observables.
