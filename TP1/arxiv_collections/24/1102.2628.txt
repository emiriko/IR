Based on the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model, an exact arbitrary-amplitude
general solution is presented for oblique propagation of solitary excitations
in two- and three-component quasineutral magnetoplasmas, adopting the standard
pseudopotential approach. It is revealed that the necessary matching criterion
of existence of such oblique nonlinear propagations in two and three-fluid
magnetoplasmas share global features. These features are examined for the cases
of electron-ion and electron-positron-ion magnetoplasmas with diverse equations
of state. This study also reveals that for electron-ion magnetoplasmas with
plasma-frequencies larger than the cyclotron-frequency ($B_0<0.137\sqrt{n_0}$)
a critical-angle of $\beta_{cr}=\arccos{\left[B_0 /(0.137 \sqrt{n_0})\right]}$
exists, at which propagation of solitary excitation is not possible. Coriolis
effect on allowed soliton matching condition in rotating magnetoplasmas is also
considered as an extension to this work. Current investigation can have
important implications for nonlinear wave dynamics in astrophysical as well as
laboratory magnetoplasmas.
