We obtain the phase diagram of strong interactions in the presence of a
magnetic field within the linear sigma model coupled to quarks and to the
Polyakov loop, and show that the chiral and deconfinement lines can split. We
also study the behavior of the chiral condensate in this magnetic environment
and find an approximately linear dependence on the external field, in
accordance with lattice data.
