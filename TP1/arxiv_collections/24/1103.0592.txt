We propose a procedure for transferring the state a microwave qubit via a
transmission line from one resonator to another resonator, with a theoretical
efficiency arbitrarily close to 100%. The emission and capture of the microwave
energy is performed using tunable couplers, whose transmission coefficients
vary in time. Using the superconducting phase qubit technology and tunable
couplers with maximum coupling of 100 MHz, the procedure with theoretical
efficiency $\eta=0.999$ requires a duration of about 400 ns (excluding
propagation time) and an ON/OFF ratio of 45. The procedure may also be used for
a quantum state transfer with optical photons.
