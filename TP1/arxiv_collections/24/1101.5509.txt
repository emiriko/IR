Privacy-preserving techniques for distributed computation have been proposed
recently as a promising framework in collaborative inter-domain network
monitoring. Several different approaches exist to solve such class of problems,
e.g., Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) based
on Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm (SSS). Such techniques are complete from a
computation-theoretic perspective: given a set of private inputs, it is
possible to perform arbitrary computation tasks without revealing any of the
intermediate results. In fact, HE and SSS can operate also on secret inputs
and/or provide secret outputs. However, they are computationally expensive and
do not scale well in the number of players and/or in the rate of computation
tasks. In this paper we advocate the use of "elementary" (as opposite to
"complete") Secure Multiparty Computation (E-SMC) procedures for traffic
monitoring. E-SMC supports only simple computations with private input and
public output, i.e., it can not handle secret input nor secret (intermediate)
output. Such a simplification brings a dramatic reduction in complexity and
enables massive-scale implementation with acceptable delay and overhead.
Notwithstanding its simplicity, we claim that an E-SMC scheme is sufficient to
perform a great variety of computation tasks of practical relevance to
collaborative network monitoring, including, e.g., anonymous publishing and set
operations. This is achieved by combining a E-SMC scheme with data structures
like Bloom Filters and bitmap strings.
