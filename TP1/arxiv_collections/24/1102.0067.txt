A nonlocal coupling mechanism to directly transfer the energy from
large-scale Magnetohydrodynamic(MHD) Alfven waves to small-scale kinetic Alfven
waves is presented. It is shown that the interaction between a MHD Alfven wave
and a reversely propagating kinetic Alfven wave can generate another kinetic
Alfven wave, and this interaction exists in the plasmas where the thermal to
magnetic pressure ratio is larger than the electron to ion mass ratio. The
proposed nonlocal interaction may have a potential application to account for
the observed electron scale kinetic Alfven waves in the solar wind and solar
corona plasmas.
