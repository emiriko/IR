A result of Boros and F\"uredi ($d=2$) and of B\'ar\'any (arbitrary $d$)
asserts that for every $d$ there exists $c_d>0$ such that for every $n$-point
set $P\subset \R^d$, some point of $\R^d$ is covered by at least $c_d{n\choose
d+1}$ of the $d$-simplices spanned by the points of $P$. The largest possible
value of $c_d$ has been the subject of ongoing research. Recently Gromov
improved the existing lower bounds considerably by introducing a new,
topological proof method. We provide an exposition of the combinatorial
component of Gromov's approach, in terms accessible to combinatorialists and
discrete geometers, and we investigate the limits of his method. In particular,
we give tighter bounds on the \emph{cofilling profiles} for the
$(n-1)$-simplex. These bounds yield a minor improvement over Gromov's lower
bounds on $c_d$ for large $d$, but they also show that the room for further
improvement through the {\cofilling} profiles alone is quite small. We also
prove a slightly better lower bound for $c_3$ by an approach using an
additional structure besides the {\cofilling} profiles. We formulate a
combinatorial extremal problem whose solution might perhaps lead to a tight
lower bound for $c_d$.
