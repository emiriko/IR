In this paper we study the semi-global (approximate) state feedback
stabilization of an infinite dimensional quantum stochastic system towards a
target state. A discrete-time Markov chain on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert
space is used to model the dynamics of a quantum optical cavity. We can choose
an (unbounded) strict Lyapunov function that is minimized at each time-step in
order to prove (weak-$\ast$) convergence of probability measures to a final
state that is concentrated on the target state with (a pre-specified)
probability that may be made arbitrarily close to 1. The feedback parameters
and the Lyapunov function are chosen so that the stochastic flow that describes
the Markov process may be shown to be tight (concentrated on a compact set with
probability arbitrarily close to 1). We then use Prohorov's theorem and
properties of the Lyapunov function to prove the desired convergence result.
