We use nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory in combination with a
recently implemented strong-coupling impurity solver to investigate the
relaxation of a Mott insulator after a laser excitation with frequency
comparable to the Hubbard gap. The time evolution of the double occupancy
exhibits a crossover from a strongly damped transient at short times towards an
exponential thermalization at long times. In the limit of strong interactions,
the thermalization time is consistent with the exponentially small decay rate
for artificially created doublons, which was measured in ultracold atomic
gases. When the interaction is comparable to the bandwidth, on the other hand,
the double occupancy thermalizes within a few times the inverse bandwidth along
a rapid thermalization path in which the exponential tail is absent. Similar
behavior can be observed in time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our
results show that a simple quasi-equilibrium description of the electronic
state breaks down for pump-excited Mott insulators characterized by strong
interactions.
