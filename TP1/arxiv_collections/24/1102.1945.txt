In this paper, we report direct patterning of metal nanostructures using an
embossed solid electrochemical stamp. Microforming of solid superionic stamps
using Si templates-analogous to polymer patterning in nano-imprint
lithography-is explored. Silver sulfide (Ag2S)-a superionic conductor with
excellent micro-forming properties-is investigated as a candidate material.
Important parameters of the superionic stamp, including mechanical behavior,
material flow during forming, and feature recovery after embossing are studied.
Excellent feature transferability during embossing as well as etching is
observed. To illustrate the capability of this approach silver nano-antennas
with gaps <10 nm were successfully fabricated. The possibility for large area
patterning with stamp diameters >6 mm is also demonstrated. Embossing based
metal patterning allows fabrication beyond two-dimensional nanofabrication and
several patterning schemes are reported.
