Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have been proved efficient to
deal with Multi-objective Optimization Problems (MOPs). Until now tens of MOEAs
have been proposed. The unified mode would provide a more systematic approach
to build new MOEAs. Here a new model is proposed which includes two sub-models
based on two classes of different schemas of MOEAs. According to the new model,
some representatives algorithms are decomposed and some interesting issues are
discussed.
