A vortex crossing a thin-film superconducting strip from one edge to the
other, perpendicular to the bias current, is the dominant mechanism of
dissipation for films of thickness d on the order of the coherence length XI;
and of width w much narrower than the Pearl length LAMBDA >> w >> XI. At high
bias currents, I* < I < Ic, the heat released by the crossing of a single
vortex suffices to create a belt-like normal-state region across the strip,
resulting in a detectable voltage pulse. Here Ic is the critical current at
which the energy barrier vanishes for a single vortex crossing. The belt forms
along the vortex path and causes a transition of the entire strip into the
normal state. We estimate I* to be roughly Ic/3. Further, we argue that such
"hot" vortex crossings are the origin of dark counts in photon detectors, which
operate in the regime of metastable superconductivity at currents between I*
and Ic. We estimate the rate of vortex crossings and compare it with recent
experimental data for dark counts. For currents below I*, i.e., in the stable
superconducting but resistive regime, we estimate the amplitude and duration of
voltage pulses induced by a single vortex crossing.
