The Casimir force between arbitrary objects in equilibrium is related to
scattering from individual bodies. We extend this approach to heat transfer and
Casimir forces in non-equilibrium cases where each body, and the environment,
is at a different temperature. The formalism tracks the radiation from each
body and its scatterings by the other objects. We discuss the radiation from a
cylinder, emphasizing its polarized nature, and obtain the heat transfer
between a sphere and a plate, demonstrating the validity of proximity transfer
approximation at close separations and arbitrary temperatures.
