We show that a clean multiband superconductor may display one or several
phase transitions with increasing temperature from or to frustrated
configurations of the relative phases of the superconducting order parameters.
These transitions may occur when more than two bands are involved in the
formation of the superconducting phase and when the number of repulsive
interband interactions is odd. These transitions are signalled by slope changes
in the temperature dependence of the superconducting gaps.
