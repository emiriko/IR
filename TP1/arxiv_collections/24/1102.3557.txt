The electroweak chiral Lagrangian for the topcolor assisted technicolor model
proposed by K. Lane, which uses nontrivial patterns of techniquark condensation
and walking, was investigated in this study. We found that the features of the
model are qualitatively similar to those of Lane's previous natural TC2
prototype model, but there is no limit on the upper bound of the Z' mass. We
discuss the phase structure and possible walking behavior of the model. We
obtained the values of all coefficients of the electroweak chiral Lagrangian up
to an order of p4. We show that although the walking effect reduces the S
parameter to half its original value, it maintains an order of 2. Moreover, a
special hyper-charge arrangement is needed to achieve further reductions in its
value.
