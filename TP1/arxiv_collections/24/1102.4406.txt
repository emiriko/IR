We study a multivariate Markov chain on the symmetric group with remarkable
enumerative properties. We conjecture that the stationary distribution of this
Markov chain can be expressed in terms of positive sums of Schubert
polynomials.
  This Markov chain is a multivariate generalization of a Markov chain
introduced by the first author in the study of random affine Weyl group
elements.
