Production of low-$p_T$ (soft) hadronic particles in high energy collisions
constitutes a significant corner of special interests and problems, as the
perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) does not work in this region. We
have probed here into the nature of the light particle production in two
symmetric nuclear collisions at two neighbouring energies with the help of two
non-standard models. The results are found to be in good agreement with data.
Despite this, as the models applied here are not intended to provide deep
insights into the actual physical processes involved in such collisions, the
phenomenological bounds and constraints which cannot be remedied for the
present continue to exist.
