The photon spectrum in B->X_{s,d} \gamma decay, where X_s(d) is any strange
(non-strange) hadronic state, is studied using data samples of $e^+e^-
\rightarrow \Upsilon(4S) \to B B-bar decays collected by the Babar and
  Belle experiments. Here I present the latest measurements of the branching
fraction and spectral mo ments from B -> X_s gamma$ decays by Belle and the
direct CP asymmetry of B->X_{s+d} gamma measured at Babar. The determination of
|V_{td}/V_{ts}|^2$ i also presented.
