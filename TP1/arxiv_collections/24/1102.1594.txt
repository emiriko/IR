The recent progress in the study of Galileons, i.e. equations of second order
with an action invariant under a Galilean transformation is related to work on
`Universal Field Equations' \cite{dbfgov} which are second order equations
arising by an iterative procedure from arbitrary Lagrangians of weight one in
their first derivatives. It is pointed out that the Galileon is simply a
Kaluza-Klein reduction of a Universal Field Equation. An implicit solution to
the equation of motion is presented, and a class of explicit solutions pointed
out. The multi-field extensions of both types of equations are derived from a
first order formalism, which is simply the substantive derivative of fluid
dynamics.
