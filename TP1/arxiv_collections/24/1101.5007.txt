We investigate the clustering of HI-selected galaxies in the ALFALFA survey
and compare results with those obtained for HIPASS. Measurements of the angular
correlation function and the inferred 3D-clustering are compared with results
from direct spatial-correlation measurements. We are able to measure clustering
on smaller angular scales and for galaxies with lower HI masses than was
previously possible. We calculate the expected clustering of dark matter using
the redshift distributions of HIPASS and ALFALFA and show that the ALFALFA
sample is somewhat more anti-biased with respect to dark matter than the HIPASS
sample.
