We show that in preferential attachment models with power-law exponent
$\tau\in(2,3)$ the distance between randomly chosen vertices in the giant
component is asymptotically equal to $(4+o(1))\, \frac{\log\log N}{-\log
(\tau-2)}$, where $N$ denotes the number of nodes. This is twice the value
obtained for several types of configuration models with the same power-law
exponent. The extra factor reveals the different structure of typical shortest
paths in preferential attachment graphs.
