We revisit the mass splittings of SU(3) baryons, taking into account the
second-order effects of isospin and SU(3) flavor symmetry breakings within the
framework of a chiral soliton model. The masses of the baryon decuplet turn out
to be improved, compared to those with the first-order corrections. The mass of
the N^* as a member of the baryon antidecuplet is obtained as M_{n^*}=1687 MeV,
which is in agreement with the recent experimental data. The pion-nucleon sigma
term becomes \Sigma_{\pi N}=(50.5\pm 5.4) MeV.
