Recently, the Fermi-LAT collaboration reported upper limits on the GeV
gamma-ray flux from nearby clusters of galaxies. Motivated by these limits, we
study corresponding constraints on gamma-ray emissions from two specific
decaying dark matter models, one via grand unification scale suppressed
operators and the other via R-parity violating operators. Both can account for
the PAMELA and Fermi-LAT excesses of e^\pm. For GUT decaying dark matter, the
gamma-rays from the M49 and Fornax clusters, with energy in the range of 1 to
10 GeV, lead to the most stringent constraints to date. As a result, this dark
matter is disfavored with conventional model of e^\pm background. In addition,
it is likely that some tension exists between the Fermi-LAT e^\pm excess and
the gamma ray constraints for any decaying dark matter model, provided
conventional model of e^\pm background is adopted. Nevertheless, the GUT
decaying dark matter can still solely account for the PAMELA positron fraction
excess without violating the gamma-ray constraints. For the gravitino dark
matter model with R-parity violation, cluster observations do not give tight
constraints. This is because a different e^\pm background has been adopted
which leads to relatively light dark matter mass around 200 GeV.
