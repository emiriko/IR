The so-called decoupling and scaling solutions of functional equations of
Landau gauge Yang-Mills theory are briefly reviewed. In both types of solutions
the positivity violation seen in the gluon propagator is taken as an indication
of gluon confinement. In the scaling solution the resulting infrared
singularities of the quark-gluon vertex are responsible for the linear
potential between static quarks and are therefore signaling quark confinement.
A corresponding description of the UA(1) anomaly in functional approaches is
only known for the scaling solution. Nevertheless, it seems puzzling at first
sight that quark confinement is related to the dynamical and anomalous breaking
of chiral symmetry in a self-consistent manner: One obtains either all these
phenomena or none. For the scaling solution also fundamental scalar fields are
confined. This provides evidence that within functional approaches static
confinement is an universal property of the gauge sector even though it is
formally represented in the functional equations of the matter sector.
