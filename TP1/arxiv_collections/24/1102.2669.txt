We report first results from an analysis based on a new multi-hadron
correlation technique, exploring jet-medium interactions and di-jet surface
emission bias at RHIC. Pairs of back-to-back high transverse momentum hadrons
are used for triggers to study associated hadron distributions. In contrast
with two- and three-particle correlations with a single trigger with similar
kinematic selections, the associated hadron distribution of both trigger sides
reveals no modification in either relative pseudo-rapidity or relative
azimuthal angle from d+Au to central Au+Au collisions. We determine associated
hadron yields and spectra as well as production rates for such correlated
back-to-back triggers to gain additional insights on medium properties.
