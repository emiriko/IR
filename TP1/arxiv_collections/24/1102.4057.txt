We propose an analytical scattering theory in spectral domain to model the
electromagnetic (EM) fields of a gyrotropic sphere in terms of the
eigen-functions and their associated spectral eigenvalues/coefficients in a
recursive integral form. Applying the continuous boundary conditions of
electromagnetic fields on the surface between the free space and gyrotropic
sphere, the spectral coefficients of transmitted fields inside the gyrotropic
sphere and the scattered fields in the isotropic host medium can be obtained
exactly by expanding spherical vector wave eigenfunctions. Numerical results
are provided for some representative cases, which are compared to the results
from adaptive integral method (AIM). Good agreement demonstrates the validity
of the proposed analytical scattering theory for gyrotropic spheres in spectral
domain using Fourier transform.
