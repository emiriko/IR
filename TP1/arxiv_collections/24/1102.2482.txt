There are deep similarities between non-linear QFT studied in high-energy and
non-equilibrium physics in condensed matter. Ideas such as the Schwinger
mechanism and the Volkov state are deeply related to non-linear transport and
photovoltaic Hall effect in condensed matter. Here, we give a review on these
relations.
