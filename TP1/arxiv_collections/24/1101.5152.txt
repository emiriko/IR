In anticipation of the possible collision between a circumstellar disk and
the secondary star in the highly eccentric binary system Delta Scorpii, high
angular resolution interferometric observations have been acquired aimed at
revising the binary parameters. The Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer
(NPOI) was used to spatially resolve the binary components in 2000 and over a
period between 2005 and 2010. The interferometric observations are used to
obtain the angular separations and orientations of the two stellar components
at all epochs for which data has been obtained, including 2005 and 2006, for
which based on previous studies there was some uncertainty as to if the
signature of binarity can be clearly detected. The results of this study
represent the most complete and accurate coverage of the binary orbit of this
system to date and allow for the revised timing of the upcoming periastron
passage that will occur in 2011 to be obtained.
