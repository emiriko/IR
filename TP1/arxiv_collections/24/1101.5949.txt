We examine pre-supernova Chandra images to find X-ray luminosities of type Ia
supernova progenitors. At present, we have one possible direct detection and
upper limits for the X-ray luminosities of a number of other supernova
progenitors. The method has also yielded a possible detection of a X-ray binary
Wolf-Rayet system as the progenitor of a type Ib supernova.
