Breaking the diffraction limit in microscopy by utilizing quantum properties
of light has been the goal of intense research in the recent years. We propose
a quantum superresolution technique based on non-classical emission statistics
of fluorescent markers, routinely used as contrast labels for bio-imaging. The
technique can be readily implemented using standard fluorescence microscopy
equipment.
