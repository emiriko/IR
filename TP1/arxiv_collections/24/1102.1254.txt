We explore a scenarios where topcolor-like dynamics operates in the presence
of fourth generation matter fields. Using the Minimal Walking Technicolor as a
concrete basis for model building, we construct explicit models and confront
them with phenomenology. We show that if a new QCD generations exist, both the
top-bottom mass splitting as well as the splitting between bottom quark mass
and the masses of the fourth generation quarks can be naturally explained
within topcolor-like dynamics. On the other hand, the much studied Minimal
Walking Technicolor model where only a fourth generation of leptons arise, also
leads to a viable model.
