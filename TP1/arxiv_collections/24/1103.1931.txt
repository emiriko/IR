We have developed a method for extracting the high-frequency noise spectral
density of an rf-SQUID flux qubit from macroscopic resonant tunneling (MRT)
rate measurements. The extracted noise spectral density is consistent with that
of an ohmic environment up to frequencies ~ 4 GHz. We have also derived an
expression for the MRT lineshape expected for a noise spectral density
consisting of such a broadband ohmic component and an additional strongly
peaked low-frequency component. This hybrid model provides an excellent fit to
experimental data across a range of tunneling amplitudes and temperatures.
