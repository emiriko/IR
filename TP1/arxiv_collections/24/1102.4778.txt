The time of occurrence of the two most resent large EQs of New Zealand (Mw =
7.0 on September 3rd, 2010 and Mw = 6.1 on February 21st, 2011) is compared to
the time when the lithospheric oscillation at the focal area reaches its peak
amplitude in terms of the M1 (Moon declination) tidal component. The observed
very good coincidence of the EQs occurrence time with the lithospheric
oscillation peak amplitude time for the M1 tidal component clearly suggests
that both these EQs were triggered by the M1 component of the lithospheric
tidal oscillation. It is speculated that large preseismic electric signals
should be observed before the EQs occurrence if the appropriate hardware were
installed.
