From the optical to the X-ray frequencies, most of the continuum emission
from AM Her systems originates in the post-shock region. Hence, using
multi-spectral data can be useful to restrict the physical and geometrical
properties of that region. In spite of that, distinct codes are used to model
these frequency ranges. CYCLOPS is a code to model the optical cyclotron
emission of polars. In this contribution, we present the first version of
CYCLOPS-X, an improvement of CYCLOPS to fit simultaneously optical and X-ray
data. The new code adds the bremsstrahlung as an emission process as well as
the effects of X-ray absorption by the upper portion of the accretion column.
As a first application of CYCLOPS-X, we present X-ray light curves using two
sets of parameters provided by the optical modeling of CP Tuc. These two cases
have very similar optical emission, but quite distinct light-curves in high
energies. It illustrates the need of simultaneous modeling of the optical and
X-ray emission to a proper description of the magnetic accretion in polars.
