In this work, we report our results on the phase transition of a flexible
homopolymer from a stretched chain to a compact globule. The Wang-landau method
is used to study the thermodynamic properties of a the chain up to 512
monomers. We believe that the peak in the specific heat at low temperature
$T\approx 0.05$ for small chain sizes $N<100$ is a clear evidence of the
existence of metastable helical structures observed in a previous study.
