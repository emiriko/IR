Quantum information entropy is calculated from the nucleon nucleus forward
scattering amplitudes. Using a representative set of nuclei, from $^4$He to
$^{208}$Pb, and energies, $T_{lab} < 1$\,[GeV], we establish a linear
dependence of quantum information entropy as functions of logarithm nuclear
mass $A$ and logarithm projectile energy $T_{lab}$.
