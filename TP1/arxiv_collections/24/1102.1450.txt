Ultra-cold atom experiments offer the unique opportunity to study mixing of
different types of superfluid states. Our interest is in superfluid mixtures
comprising particles with different statistics- Bose and Fermi. Such scenarios
occur naturally, for example, in dense QCD matter. Interestingly, cold atomic
experiments are performed in traps with finite spatial extent, thus critically
destabilizing the occurrence of various homogeneous phases. Critical to this
analysis is the understanding that the trapped system can undergo phase
separation, resulting in a unique situation where phase transition in either
species (bosons or fermions) can overlap with the phase separation between
possible phases. In the present work, we illustrate how this intriguing
interplay manifests in an interacting 2-species atomic mixture - one bosonic
and another fermionic with two spin components - within a realistic trap
configuration. We further show that such interplay of transitions can render
the nature of the ground state to be highly sensitive to the experimental
parameters and the dimensionality of the system.
