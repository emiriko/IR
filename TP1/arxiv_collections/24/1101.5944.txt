Dynamic graphs have emerged as an appropriate model to capture the changing
nature of many modern networks, such as peer-to-peer overlays and mobile ad hoc
networks. Most of the recent research on dynamic networks has only addressed
the undirected dynamic graph model. However, realistic networks such as the
ones identified above are directed. In this paper we present early work in
addressing the properties of directed dynamic graphs. In particular, we explore
the problem of random walk in such graphs. We assume the existence of an
oblivious adversary that makes arbitrary changes in every communication round.
We explore the problem of covering the dynamic graph, that even in the static
case can be exponential, and we establish an upper bound O(d_max n^3 log^2 n)
of the cover time for balanced dynamic graphs.
