We consider a transformed Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process model that can be a good
candidate for modelling real-life processes characterized by a combination of
time-reverting behaviour with heavy distribution tails. We begin with
presenting the results of an exploratory statistical analysis of the log prices
of a major Australian public company, demonstrating several key features
typical of such time series. Motivated by these findings, we suggest a simple
transformed Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process model and analyze its properties showing
that the model is capable of replicating our empirical findings. We also
discuss three different estimators for the drift coefficient in the underlying
(unobservable) Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process which is the key descriptor of
dependence in the process.
