The question if the Bose statistics is broken at the TeV scale is discussed.
The decay of a new heavy spin 1 gauge boson Z' into two photons, Z'-> 2 gamma,
is forbidden by the Bose statistics among other general principles of quantum
field theory (Landau-Yang theorem). We point out that the search for this decay
can be effectively used to probe the Bose symmetry violation at the CERN LHC.
