We estimate the relative branching ratio of $\sigma$ to 2$\pi$ for the decay
of the $\Psi'(2S)$, which we have found to be a mixed charm and hybrid
charmonium meson. The external field method and correlators from a previous
calculation are used to estimate these decays. We find the $\sigma$ to 2$\pi$
branching ratio for $\Psi'(2S)$ to the $J/\Psi(1S)$ decay to be 0.98, in
agreement with an experiment at IHEP-BES.
