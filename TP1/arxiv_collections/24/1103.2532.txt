We propose an inverse method to accelerate without final excitation the
adiabatic transport of a Bose Einstein condensate. The method, applicable to
arbitrary potential traps, is based on a partial extension of the
Lewis-Riesenfeld invariants, and provides transport protocols that satisfy
exactly the no-excitation conditions without constraints or approximations.
This inverse method is complemented by optimizing the trap trajectory with
respect to different physical criteria and by studying the effect of noise.
