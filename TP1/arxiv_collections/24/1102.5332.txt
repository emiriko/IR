We investigate Nordstr\"om's second theory of gravitation, with a focus on
utilizing it as a testbed for developing techniques in numerical relativity.
Numerical simulations of inspiraling compact star binaries are performed for
this theory, and compared to the predictions of semi-analytic calculations
(which are similar to Peters and Mathews' results for GR). The simulations are
based on a co-rotating spherical coordinate system, where both finite
difference and pseudo-spectral methods are used. We also adopt the "Hydro
without Hydro" approximation, and the Weak Radiation Reaction approximation
when the orbital motion is quasi-circular. We evolve a binary with
quasi-circular initial data for hundreds of orbits and find that the resulting
inspiral closely matches the 1/4 power law profile given by the semi-analytical
calculations. We additionally find that an eccentric binary circularizes and
precesses at the expected rates. The methods investigated thus provide a
promising line of attack for the numerical modeling of long binary inspirals in
general relativity.
