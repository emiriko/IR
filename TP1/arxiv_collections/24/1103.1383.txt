We discuss two phenomenological descriptions of low-current transport in
bilayer quantum Hall system with exciton condensates, one based on a
Landauer-Buttiker description of Andreev scattering at contacts to coherent
bilayers and one based on a simplified single-parameter {\em p-ology}
description of the weak to strong interlayer coupling crossover. The Andreev
scattering phenomenology in intended to apply when the condensate is well
developed and is used to predict current-voltage relationships for a variety of
two contact geometries. We also apply this formalism to circumstances in which
the tunnel current exceeds its critical value and the condensate is
time-dependent. The {\em p-ology} approach is used to establish the universal
development of large longitudinal drags, even in homogenous coherent samples,
as the condensate weakens and the Hall drag is reduced.
