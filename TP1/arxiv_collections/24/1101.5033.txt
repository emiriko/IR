Using a new version of the holographic principle, a constant term was
introduced, which conduces to the description of the standard cosmological LCDM
model, and unifies under the same concept the dark matter and dark energy
phenomena. The obtained model improves the results of previously considered
holographic models based on local quantities. The inclusion of constant term is
interpreted as a natural first approximation for the infrared cutoff which is
associated with the vacuum energy, and the additional terms guarantee an
appropriate evolutionary scenario that fits the astrophysical observations. The
model allows to reproduce the standard LCDM model without explicitly
introducing matter content, and using only geometrical quantities. It is also
obtained that the model may describe the dark energy beyond the standard LCDM.
