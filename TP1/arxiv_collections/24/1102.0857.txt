We study the fate of internal gravity waves approaching the centre of a
non-rotating solar-type star, by performing 3D numerical simulations using a
Boussinesq-type model. These waves are excited at the top of the radiation zone
by the tidal forcing of a short-period planet on a circular, coplanar orbit.
This extends previous work done in 2D by Barker & Ogilvie. We first derive a
linear wave solution, which is not exact in 3D; however, the reflection of
ingoing waves from the centre is close to perfect for moderate amplitude waves.
Waves with sufficient amplitude to cause isentropic overturning break, and
deposit their angular momentum near the centre. This forms a critical layer, at
which the angular velocity of the flow matches the orbital angular frequency of
the planet. This efficiently absorbs ingoing waves, and spins up the star from
the inside out, while the planet spirals into the star. We also perform
numerical integrations to determine the linearised adiabatic tidal response
throughout the star, for solar-type stellar models with masses in the range 0.5
< m_star/M_sun < 1.1, throughout their main sequence lifetimes. The aim is to
study the launching region for these waves at the top of the radiation zone in
more detail, and to determine the accuracy of a semi-analytic approximation for
the tidal torque on the star, that was derived under the assumption that all
ingoing wave angular momentum is absorbed in a critical layer. The main
conclusions are that this nonlinear mechanism of tidal dissipation could
provide an explanation for the survival of all short-period extrasolar planets
observed around FGK stars, while it predicts the destruction of more massive
planets. This work provides further support for the model outlined in a
previous paper by Barker & Ogilvie, and makes predictions that will be tested
by ongoing observational studies, such as WASP and Kepler.
