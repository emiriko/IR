Neutron spin-flip scattering observations of a resonance in the
superconducting state is often taken as evidence of an unconventional
superconducting state in which the gap changes sign $\Delta(k+Q)=-\Delta(k)$
for momentum transfers $Q$ which play an important role in the pairing.
Recently questions regarding this identification for the Fe-pnictide
superconductors have been raised and it has been suggested that
$\Delta(k+Q)=\Delta(k)$. Here we propose that inelastic neutron or x-ray
scattering measurements of the spectral weight of a phonon of momentum $Q$ can
distinguish between these two pairing scenarios.
