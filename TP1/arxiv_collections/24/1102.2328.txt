We calculate the magnetic-field dependence (oscillations) of the Nernst
coefficient in bismuth at low temperatures for the case when the magnetic field
is directed along the trigonal axis of the crystal. In the calculations we take
into account the scattering of the electrons and holes in bismuth on impurities
and the dependence of this scattering on the magnetic field. The results of
these calculations are compared with the experimental data recently published.
