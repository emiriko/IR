We construct a simple class of compactified five-dimensional metrics which
admits closed timelike curves (CTCs), and derive the resulting CTCs as analytic
solutions to the geodesic equations of motion. The associated Einstein tensor
satisfies all the null, weak, strong and dominant energy conditions. In
particular, no negative-energy "tachyonic" matter is required. In
extra-dimensional models where gauge charges are bound to our brane, it is the
Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes of gauge-singlets that may travel through the CTCs.
From our brane point of view, many of these KK modes would appear to travel
backward in time. We give a simple model in which time-traveling Higgs singlets
can be produced by the LHC, either from decay of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs
or through mixing with the SM Higgs. The signature of these time-traveling
singlets is a secondary decay vertex pre-appearing before the primary vertex
which produced them. The two vertices are correlated by momentum conservation.
We demonstrate that pre-appearing vertices in the Higgs singlet-doublet mixing
model may well be observable at the LHC.
