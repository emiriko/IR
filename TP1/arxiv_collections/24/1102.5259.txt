Two methods for computing bound states of the Helmholtz equation in a finite
domain are presented. The methods are formulated in terms of the
Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) and Neumann-to-Dirichlet (NtD) surface integral
operators. They are adapted from the DtN and NtD methods for bound states of
the Schrodinger equation in R^3. A variational principle that enables the usage
of the operators is constructed. The variational principle allows the use of
discontinuous (in values or derivatives) trial functions. A numerical example
presenting the usefulness of the DtN and NtD methods is given.
