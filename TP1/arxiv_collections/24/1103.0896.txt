While B0 and B+ mesons are well studied, mainly by the B factories, less is
known about Bs mesons. Specifically large new physics effects may still be
present in the Bs system. This unexplored region is studied by the CDF, D0, and
Belle experiments. In this article their recent measurements on the Bs physics
sector are presented.
