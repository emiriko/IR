We report the first detection of the gravitational lensing of the cosmic
microwave background through a measurement of the four-point correlation
function in the temperature maps made by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. We
verify our detection by calculating the levels of potential contaminants and
performing a number of null tests. The resulting convergence power spectrum at
2-degree angular scales measures the amplitude of matter density fluctuations
on comoving length scales of around 100 Mpc at redshifts around 0.5 to 3. The
measured amplitude of the signal agrees with Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmology
predictions. Since the amplitude of the convergence power spectrum scales as
the square of the amplitude of the density fluctuations, the 4-sigma detection
of the lensing signal measures the amplitude of density fluctuations to 12%.
