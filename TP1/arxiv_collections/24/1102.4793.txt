Resource competition is a fundamental interaction in natural
communities.However little is known about competition in spatial environments
where organisms are able to regulate resource distributions. Here, we analyze
the competition of two consumers for two resources in a one-dimensional habitat
in which the resources are supplied from opposite sides. We show that the
success of an invading species crucially depends on the slope of the resource
gradients shaped by the resident. Our analysis reveals that parameter
combinations which lead to coexistence in a uniform environment may favor
alternative stable states in a spatial system, and vice versa. Furthermore,
differences in growth rate, mortality or dispersal abilities allow a consumer
to coexist stationarily with - or even outcompete - a competitor with lower
resource requirements. Applying our theory to a phytoplankton model, we explain
shifts in the community structure that are induced by environmental changes.
