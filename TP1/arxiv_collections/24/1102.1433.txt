Over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic, there exist
rational functions with only one critical point. We give an elementary
characterization of these functions in terms of their continued fraction
expansions. Then we use this tool to discern some of the basic geometry of the
space of unicritical rational functions, as well as its quotients by the
SL(2)-actions of conjugation and postcomposition. We also give an application
to dynamical systems with restricted ramification defined over non-Archimedean
fields of positive residue characteristic.
