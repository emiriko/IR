In this note we revisit the notion of conformal barycenter of a measure on
$\SS^n$ as defined by Douady and Earle in Acta Math. Vol 157, 1986. The aim is
to extend rational maps from the Riemann sphere $\Cbar\isom\SS^2$ to the
(hyperbolic) three ball $\BB^3$ and thus to $\SS^3$ by reflection. The
construction which was pioneered by Douady and Earle in the case of
homeomorphisms actually gives extensions for more general maps such as entire
transcendental maps on $\C\subset\Cbar$. And it works for maps in any
dimension.
