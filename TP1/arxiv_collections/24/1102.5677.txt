Resonant two-photon ionization in a system consisting of two spatially
well-separated atoms is studied. Due to two-center electron-electron
correlations, the ionization may also proceed through photo-excitation of both
atoms with subsequent interatomic Coulombic decay. We show that this channel
may dominate the photoionization process and qualitatively change its
dependence on the field intensity and the spectra of emitted electrons.
