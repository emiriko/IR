Among iron 122 pnictide superconductors, the EuFe$_2$As$_2$ series draws
particular interest because, in addition to superconductivity or the long-range
spin-density-wave order in the Fe subsystem, the localized Eu$^{2+}$ magnetic
moments order at low temperatures. Here we present a novel scheme of how the
spins align in the Eu compounds when pressure varies the coupling; we explain
magnetization measurements on EuFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ single crystals as
well as other observations of the Eu$^{2+}$ ordering previously reported in
literature. The magnetic moments of the Eu$^{2+}$ ions are slightly canted even
in the parent compound EuFe$_2$As$_2$, yielding a ferromagnetic contribution
along the $c$-direction that becomes stronger with pressure. Reducing the
interlayer distance even further, the antiferromagnetic coupling of the $ab$
planes finally turns ferromagnetic.
