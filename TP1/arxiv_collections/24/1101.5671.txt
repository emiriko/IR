Using a combination of self-consistent and test-particle techniques,
Identikit 1 provided a way to vary the initial geometry of a galactic collision
and instantly visualize the outcome. Identikit 2 uses the same techniques to
define a mapping from the current morphology and kinematics of a tidal
encounter back to the initial conditions. By requiring that various regions
along a tidal feature all originate from a single disc with a unique
orientation, this mapping can be used to derive the initial collision geometry.
In addition, Identikit 2 offers a robust way to measure how well a particular
model reproduces the morphology and kinematics of a pair of interacting
galaxies. A set of eight self-consistent simulations is used to demonstrate the
algorithm's ability to search a ten-dimensional parameter space and find
near-optimal matches; all eight systems are successfully reconstructed.
