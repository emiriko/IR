The physics of doping a Mott insulator is investigated in the presence of a
solid-vacuum interface. Using the embedding approach for dynamical mean field
theory we show that the change in surface spectral evolution in a doped Mott
insulator is driven by a combination of charge transfer effects and enhanced
correlation effects. Approaching a Mott insulating phase from the metallic
side, we show that a dead layer forms at the surface of the solid, where
quasiparticle amplitudes are exponentially suppressed. Surface correlation and
charge transfer effects can be strongly impacted by changes of the hopping
integrals at the surface.
