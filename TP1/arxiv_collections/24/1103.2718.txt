Though the operator product expansion is applicable in the calculation of
current correlation functions in the Euclidean region, when approaching the
Minkowskian domain, violations of quark-hadron duality are expected to occur,
due to the presence of bound-state or resonance poles. In QCD finite-energy sum
rules, contour integrals in the complex energy plane down to the Minkowskian
axis have to be performed, and thus the question arises what the impact of
duality violations may be. The structure and possible relevance of duality
violations is investigated on the basis of two models: the Coulomb system and a
model for light-quark correlators which has already been studied previously. As
might yet be naively expected, duality violations are in some sense "maximal"
for zero-width bound states and they become weaker for broader resonances whose
poles lie further away from the physical axis. Furthermore, to a certain
extent, they can be suppressed by choosing appropriate weight functions in the
finite-energy sum rules. A simplified Ansatz for including effects of duality
violations in phenomenological QCD sum rule analyses is discussed as well.
