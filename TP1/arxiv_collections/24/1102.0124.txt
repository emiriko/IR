Precise control of morphologies of one-dimensional (1D) or 2D nanostructures
during growth has not been easily accessible, usually degrading the device
performance and therefore limiting applications to various advanced nanoscale
electronics and optoelectronics. Graphene could be a platform to serve as a
substrate for both morphology control and direct use of electrodes due to its
ideal monolayer flatness with {\pi} electrons. Here, we report that by using
graphene directly as a substrate, vertically well-aligned ZnO nanowires and
nanowalls were obtained systematically by controlling Au catalyst thickness and
growth time, without invoking significant thermal damage on the graphene layer
during thermal chemical vapor deposition of ZnO at high temperature of about
900 oC. We further demonstrate a piezoelectric nanogenerator that was
fabricated from the vertically aligned nanowire-nanowall ZnO hybrid/graphene
structure generates a new type of direct current.
