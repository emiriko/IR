Using the Parkes radio telescope we have carried out deep observations of
eleven unassociated gamma-ray sources. Periodicity searches of these data have
discovered two millisecond pulsars, PSR J1103-5403 (1FGL J1103.9-5355) and PSR
J2241-5236 (1FGL J2241.9-5236), and a long period pulsar, PSR J1604-44 (1FGL
J1604.7-4443). In addition we searched for but did not detect any radio
pulsations from six gammaray pulsars discovered by the Fermi satellite to a
level of - 0.04 mJy (for pulsars with a 10% duty cycle). Timing of the
millisecond pulsar PSR J1103-5403 has shown that its position is 9' from the
centroid of the gamma-ray source. Since these observations were carried out,
independent evidence has shown that 1FGL J1103.9-5355 is associated with the
flat spectrum radio source PKS 1101-536. It appears certain that the pulsar is
not associated with the gamma-ray source, despite the seemingly low probability
of a chance detection of a radio millisecond pulsar. We consider that PSR
J1604-44 is a chance discovery of a weak, long period pulsar and is unlikely to
be associated with 1FGL J1604.7-4443. PSR J2241-5236 has a spin period of 2.2
ms and orbits a very low mass companion with a 3.5 hour orbital period. The
relatively high flux density and low dispersion measure of PSR J2241-5236 makes
it an excellent candidate for high precision timing experiments. The gamma-rays
of 1FGL J2241.9-5236 have a spectrum that is well modelled by a power law with
exponential cutoff, and phasebinning with the radio ephemeris results in a
multi-peaked gamma-ray pulse profile. Observations with Chandra have identified
a coincident X-ray source within 0.1" of the position of the pulsar obtained by
radio timing
