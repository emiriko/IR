Relying on a mathematical analogy of the pure states of the two-qubit system
of quantum information theory with four-component spinors we introduce the
concept of the intrinsic entanglement of spinors. To explore its physical sense
we study the entanglement capabilities of the spin representation of (pseudo-)
conformal transformations in (3+1)-dimensional Minkowski space-time. We find
that only those tensor product structures can sensibly be introduced in spinor
space for which a given spinor is not entangled.
