Here we show results of first-principles investigations aiming at tuning and
controlling the catalytic activity of gold nanoclusters through the design of
the underlying support. We show that gold clusters adsorbed on a very thin (2
layers) defect-free MgO film which is itself supported on Mo(100), may serve as
model catalysts for the low-barrier oxidation of CO. The origin of the emergent
activity of the nanoclusters is a dimensionality crossover of the adsorbed gold
clusters, from inactive three-dimensional (3D) optimal structures on thick MgO
films, to catalytically active 2D ones for sufficiently thin MgO films (less
then 1nm in thickness) supported on Mo(100).
