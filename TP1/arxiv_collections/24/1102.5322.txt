Available purely software based code attestation protocols have recently been
shown to be cheatable. In this work we propose to upload compressed instruction
code to make the code attestation protocol robust against a so called
compresssion attack. The described secure code attestation protocol makes use
of recently proposed microcontroller architectures for reading out compressed
instruction code. We point out that the proposed concept only makes sense if
the provided cost/benefit ratio for the aforementioned microcontroller is
higher than an alternative hardware based solution requiring a tamperresistant
hardware module.
