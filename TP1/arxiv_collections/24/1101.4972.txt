I discuss a model of lepton flavor symmetry based on the non-Abelian finite
group T(7) and the gauging of B-L, which has a residual Z(3) symmetry in the
charged-lepton Yukawa sector, allowing it to be observable at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) from the decay of the new Z' gauge boson of this model to a pair
of scalar bosons which the unusual highly distinguishable final states
tau(-)tau(-)mu(+)e(+).
