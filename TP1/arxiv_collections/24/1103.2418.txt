The internal structure of the resonant Lambda(1405) state is investigated
based on meson-baryon coupled-channels chiral dynamics, by evaluating density
distributions obtained from the form factors of the Lambda(1405) state. The
form factors are extracted from current-coupled scattering amplitudes in which
the current is coupled to the constituent hadrons inside Lambda(1405). Using
several probe interactions and channel decomposition, we find that the resonant
Lambda(1405) state is dominantly composed of widely spread Kbar around N, with
a small fraction of the escaping pi Sigma component.
