The non-uniform standing spin-wave modes in thin magnetic films and
nanostructures provide important information about surfaces and buried
interfaces. Very often they are lacking in the recorded ferromagnetic resonance
spectra for symmetry reasons. In this work we experimentally demonstrate that
by direct injection of microwave currents into an array of Permalloy
nanostripes using a microscopic microwave coaxial to coplanar adaptor one can
efficiently excite non-uniform standing spin wave modes with odd symmetry. The
proposed method is quick and allows easy spatial mapping of magnetic properties
with the resolution down to 100 microns. We have validated this method using an
example from a periodical array of nanostripes. The results from direct current
injection are compared to that of microstrip-based FMR measurements.
