In this talk I discuss three recent developments in the theoretical
understanding of the phase diagram of the strong interaction. The first topic
deals with the comparison of model calculations of the quark-hadron transition
at vanishing quark chemical potential with state-of-the-art lattice QCD
results. In the second relates to the size of a possible 'quarkyonic phase'.
The third deals with the occurence of inhomogeneous chiral phases.
