The hole-doped antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 two-leg ladder is an important
model system for the high-$T_c$ superconductors based on cuprates. Using the
technique of self-similar continuous unitary transformations we derive
effective Hamiltonians for the charge motion in these ladders. The key
advantage of this technique is that it provides effective models explicitly in
the thermodynamic limit. A real space restriction of the generator of the
transformation allows us to explore the experimentally relevant parameter
space. From the effective Hamiltonians we calculate the dispersions for single
holes. Further calculations will enable the calculation of the interaction of
two holes so that a handle of Cooper pair formation is within reach.
