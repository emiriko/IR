The non-conservation of entanglement, when two or more particles interact,
sets it apart from other dynamical quantities like energy and momentum. It does
not allow the interpretation of the subtle dynamics of entanglement as a flow
of this quantity between the constituents of the system. Here we show that
adding a third party to a two-particle system may lead to a conservation law
that relates the quantities characterizing the bipartite entanglement between
each of the parties and the other two. We provide an experimental demonstration
of this idea using entangled photons, and generalize it to N-partite GHZ
states.
