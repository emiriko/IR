The equations of the conformal field theory of gravitation with the Dirac's
scalar field in Weyl-Cartan spacetime have been received. Exact solutions for
Dirac's scalar field for an early Universe have been derived. Intensive
decrease of physical vacuum energy (dark energy) is obtained with the Dirac's
scalar field as the effective cosmological "constant".
