We show that various aspects of k-automatic sequences -- such as having an
unbordered factor of length n -- are both decidable and effectively enumerable.
As a consequence it follows that many related sequences are either k-automatic
or k-regular. These include many sequences previously studied in the
literature, such as the recurrence function, the appearance function, and the
repetitivity index. We also give some new characterizations of the class of
k-regular sequences. Many results extend to other sequences defined in terms of
Pisot numeration systems.
