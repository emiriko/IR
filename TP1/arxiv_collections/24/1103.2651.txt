Keyword search in relational databases has been widely studied in recent
years because it does not require users neither to master a certain structured
query language nor to know the complex underlying data schemas. Most of
existing methods focus on answering snapshot keyword queries in static
databases. In practice, however, databases are updated frequently, and users
may have long-term interests on specific topics. To deal with such a situation,
it is necessary to build effective and efficient facility in database systems
to support continual keyword queries evaluation.
  In this paper, we propose an efficient method for continual keyword queries
answering over relational databases. The proposed method consists of two core
algorithms. The first one computes a set of potential top-$k$ results by
evaluating the ranges of the future relevance score for every query result and
create a light-weight state for each keyword query. The second one uses these
states to maintain the top-$k$ results of keyword queries when the database is
continually growing. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and
efficiency of the proposed method.
