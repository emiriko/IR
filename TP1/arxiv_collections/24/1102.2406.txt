We study quantum spin systems with a proper combination of geometric
frustration, spin-orbit coupling and ferromagnetism. We argue that such a
system is likely to be in a chiral spin state, a fractional quantum Hall (FQH)
state for bosonic spin degrees of freedom. The energy scale of the bosonic FQH
state is of the same order as the spin-orbit coupling and ferromagnetism ---
overall much higher than the energy scale of FQH states in semiconductors.
