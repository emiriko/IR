We develop a nonstandard concept of atomic clocks where the blackbody
radiation shift (BBRS) and its temperature fluctuations can be dramatically
suppressed (by one to three orders of magnitude) independent of the
environmental temperature. The suppression is based on the fact that in a
system with two accessible clock transitions (with frequencies v1 and v2) which
are exposed to the same thermal environment, there exists a "synthetic"
frequency v_{syn} (v1-e12 v2) largely immune to the BBRS. As an example, it is
shown that in the case of ion 171Yb+ it is possible to create a clock in which
the BBRS can be suppressed to the fractional level of 10^{-18} in a broad
interval near room temperature (300\pm 15 K). We also propose a realization of
our method with the use of an optical frequency comb generator stabilized to
both frequencies v1 and v2. Here the frequency v_{syn} is generated as one of
the components of the comb spectrum and can be used as an atomic standard.
