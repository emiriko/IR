We report studies of several novae which are known or suspected to be
recurrent. We discuss our morpho-kinematical modelling of the evolution of the
optical spectra taken early after outburst for two recent novae. In the case of
the known RN RS Oph, this is also coupled with \it HST imaging. Results support
the hypothesis that remnant shaping occurs very early in a nova outburst and we
also derive the structures (including inclination) and velocity field of the
remnants. Overall, these results emphasise the need for coordinated imaging and
spectrometry, although not always possible, if we are to truly understand
remnant shaping in these systems, together with the wider implications for
studies of shaping mechanisms in Planetary Nebulae.
