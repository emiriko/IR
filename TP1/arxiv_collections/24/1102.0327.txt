We explore the growth of < 10^7 Msun black holes that reside at the centers
of spiral and field dwarf galaxies in a Local Group type of environment. We use
merger trees from a cosmological N-body simulation known as Via Lactea II
(VL-2) as a framework to test two merger-driven semi-analytic recipes for black
hole growth that include dynamical friction, tidal stripping, and gravitational
wave recoil in over 20,000 merger tree realizations. First, we apply a
Fundamental Plane limited (FPL) model to the growth of Sgr A*, which drives the
central black hole to a maximum mass limited by the Black Hole Fundamental
Plane after every merger. Next, we present a new model that allows for
low-level Prolonged Gas Accretion (PGA) during the merger. We find that both
models can generate a Sgr A* mass black hole. We predict a population of
massive black holes in local field dwarf galaxies - if the VL-2 simulation is
representative of the growth of the Local Group, we predict up to 35 massive
black holes (< 10^6 Msun) in Local Group field dwarfs. We also predict that
hundreds of < 10^5 Msun black holes fail to merge, and instead populate the
Milky Way halo, with the most massive of them at roughly the virial radius. In
addition, we find that there may be hundreds of massive black holes ejected
from their hosts into the nearby intergalactic medium due to gravitational wave
recoil. We discuss how the black hole population in the Local Group field
dwarfs may help to constrain the growth mechanism for Sgr A*.
