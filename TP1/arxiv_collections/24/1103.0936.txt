We develop a new algorithm based on the time-dependent variational principle
applied to matrix product states to efficiently simulate the real- and
imaginary time dynamics for infinite one-dimensional quantum lattice systems.
This procedure: (1) is argued to be optimal; (2) does not rely on the Trotter
decomposition and thus has no Trotter error; (3) explicitly preserves all
symmetries and conservation laws; and (4) has low computational complexity. The
algorithm is illustrated using both imaginary time and real-time examples.
