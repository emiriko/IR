We present some nonlinear partial differential equations in 2+1-dimensions
derived from the KdV Equation and its symmetries. We show that all these
equations have the same 3-soliton structures. The only difference in these
solutions are the dispersion relations. We also showed that they pass the
Painlev\'e test.
