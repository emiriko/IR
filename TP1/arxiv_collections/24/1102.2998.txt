Consider the solution of the free time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation with
initial data f. It is shown by Sj\"ogren and Sj\"olin (1989) that there exists
f in the Sobolev space H^s(R^d), s=d/2 such that tangential convergence can not
be widened to convergence regions. In 2010 we obtained the corresponding
results for a generalized version of the Schr\"odinger equation, where
-\Delta_x is replaced by an operator \phi(D), with special conditions on \phi.
In this paper we show that similar results may be obtained for initial data in
Fourier Lebesgue spaces.
