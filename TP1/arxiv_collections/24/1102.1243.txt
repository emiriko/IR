We analyze the single particle excitation spectrum of the ultracold fermion
atom system close to the unitary limit where there has been found experimental
evidence for the Bogoliubov quasiparticles below as well as above the
transition temperature Tc. We consider the short-range correlations originating
from the preformed pairs and try to reproduce the experimental data adapting
phenomenological selfenergy previously used for description of the anti-nodal
spectra of the underdoped cuprate superconductors. We show that it fairly fits
the lineshapes obtained by the momentum resolved RF spectroscopy for {40}^K
atoms.
