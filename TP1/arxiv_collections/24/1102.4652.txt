We consider the optimal quantization of compressive sensing measurements
following the work on generalization of relaxed belief propagation (BP) for
arbitrary measurement channels. Relaxed BP is an iterative reconstruction
scheme inspired by message passing algorithms on bipartite graphs. Its
asymptotic error performance can be accurately predicted and tracked through
the state evolution formalism. We utilize these results to design mean-square
optimal scalar quantizers for relaxed BP signal reconstruction and empirically
demonstrate the superior error performance of the resulting quantizers.
