Using time-domain Terahertz spectroscopy we performed direct studies of the
photoinduced suppression and recovery of the superconducting gap in a
conventional BCS superconductor NbN. Both processes are found to be strongly
temperature and excitation density dependent. The analysis of the data with the
established phenomenological Rothwarf-Taylor model enabled us to determine the
bare quasiparticle recombination rate, the Cooper pair-breaking rate and the
electron-phonon coupling constant, \lambda = 1.1 +/- 0.1, which is in excellent
agreement with theoretical estimates.
