We present results illustrating the construction of 3D topological cluster
states with coherent state logic. Such a construction would be ideally suited
to wave-guide implementations of quantum optical processing. We investigate the
use of a ballistic CSign gate, showing that given large enough initial cat
states, it is possible to build large 3D cluster states. We model X and Z basis
measurements by displaced photon number detections and x-quadrature homodyne
detections, respectively. We investigate whether teleportation can aid cluster
state construction and whether the introduction of located loss errors fits
within the topological cluster state framework.
