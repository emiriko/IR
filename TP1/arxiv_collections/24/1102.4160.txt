Properties of single beauty baryons ($\Sigma_{b},\Lambda_{b}$) are studied
based on the quark-diquark structure. The confinement potential is assumed as
two body colour coulomb plus power potential with exponent $\nu$. We find a
strong correlation between the choice of the heavy quark mass parameter
($m_{b}$), strong coupling constant ($\alpha_{s}$) and the potential exponent
($\nu$) for getting the experimental mass spilt of $m_{\Sigma^{*}_{b}}-
m_{\Sigma_{b}}=21.2\pm2.0 $ MeV. The resultant spectroscopic parameters are
used for computing magnetic moments, the electromagnetic radiative decay,
strong hadronic decay and semileptonic decay widths of $\Sigma_{b},
\Lambda_{b}$ systems. Our predictions on the radiative decay width correspond
to $\Sigma^{*0}_{b}\rightarrow\Lambda_{b}\gamma$ are in agreement with the QCD
sum rule prediction. The present results on the semileptonic decay widths of
$\Lambda_{b}\rightarrow \Lambda_{c}l\nu_{l}$ (2.50-4.73) $ *10^{10} s^{-1}$ are
in agreement with the experimental value of $3.59^{+1.234}_{-0.936} *10^{10}
s^{-1}$ reported by (PDG 2010).
