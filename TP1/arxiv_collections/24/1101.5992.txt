We present searches for pair-production of fourth generation tprime quarks in
their decays to Wq. We analyse 4.6 fb-1 and 4.3 fb-1 of data collected by the
CDF and D0 detectors, respectively, at the Fermilab Tevatron collider at a
centre-of-mass energy of sqrt s = 1.96 TeV. We reconstruct the mass of the
heavy quark and perform a two-dimensional-fit to the observed (HT, Mreco)
distributions to discriminate the new physics signal from standard model
backgrounds. As no significant excess of events is observed, we exclude a
fourth-generation tprime quark with a mass below 335 (296) GeV at 95%CL at CDF
(D0).
