Security becomes an extremely important issue in smart grid. To maintain the
steady operation for smart power grid, massive measurement devices must be
allocated widely among the power grid. Previous studies are focused on false
data injection attack to the smart grid system. In practice, false data
injection attack is not easy to implement, since it is not easy to hack the
power grid data communication system. In this paper, we demonstrate that a
novel time stamp attack is a practical and dangerous attack scheme for smart
grid. Since most of measurement devices are equipped with global positioning
system (GPS) to provide the time information of measurements, it is highly
probable to attack the measurement system by spoofing the GPS. By employing the
real measurement data in North American Power Grid, simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the time stamp attack on smart grid.
