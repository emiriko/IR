The present paper deals with the possibility of creation of the quantum
computer in which the role of q-bits is played by quasi-particles. In such a
computer, the elementary computation block should represent a cluster created
on the basis of the paramagnetic molecules. The latter form heterogeneous spin
states in the cluster owing to the presence of interelectron correlations.
