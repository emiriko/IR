Current conceptions of expert problem solving depict physical/conceptual
reasoning and formal mathematical reasoning as separate steps: a good problem
solver first translates a physical Current conceptions of quantitative
problem-solving expertise in physics incorporate conceptual reasoning in two
ways: for selecting relevant equations (before manipulating them), and for
checking whether a given quantitative solution is reasonable (after
manipulating the equations). We make the case that problem-solving expertise
should include opportunistically blending conceptual and formal mathematical
reasoning even while manipulating equations. We present analysis of interviews
with two students, Alex and Pat. Interviewed students were asked to explain a
particular equation and solve a problem using that equation. Alex used and
described the equation as a computational tool. By contrast, Pat found a
shortcut to solve the problem. His shortcut blended mathematical operations
with conceptual reasoning about physical processes, reflecting a view -
expressed earlier in his explanation of the equation - that equations can
express an overarching conceptual meaning. Using case studies of Alex and Pat,
we argue that this opportunistic blending of conceptual and formal mathematical
reasoning (i) is a part of problem-solving expertise, (ii) can be described in
terms of cognitive elements called symbolic forms (Sherin, 2001), and (iii) is
a feasible instructional target.
