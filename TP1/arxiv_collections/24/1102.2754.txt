Quantum mechanical time operator is introduced following the parametric
formulation of classical mechanics in the extended phase space. Quantum
constraint on the extended quantum system is defined in analogy to the
constraint of the classical extended system, and is interpreted as the
condition defining the space of physical events. It is seen that the peculiar
properties of the time observable, otherwise obtained in the models of time
measurement, are of the classical origin, (i.e.), due to the quantized
classical constraint of the parametric Hamiltonian dynamics.
