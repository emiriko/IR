We review the rigorous work on many Fermions models which lead to the first
constructions of interacting Fermi liquids in two dimensions, and allowed to
prove that there are different scaling regimes in two dimensions, depending on
the shape of the Fermi surface. We also review progress on the three
dimensional case.
  We start with a pedagogical introduction on quantum field theory and
perturbative renormalization. Emphasis is then put on using renormalization
around the Fermi surface in a constructive way, in which all orders of
perturbation theory are summed rigorously.
