The origin of stabilization of complex microstructures along macrotwin
boundaries in martensites is explained by comparing two models based on
Ginzburg-Landau theory. The first model incorporates a geometrically nonlinear
strain tensor to ensure that the Landau energy is invariant under rigid body
rotations, while the second model uses a linearized strain tensor under the
assumption that deformations and rotations are small. We show that the
approximation in the second model does not always hold for martensites and that
the experimental observations along macrotwin boundaries can only be reproduced
by the geometrically nonlinear (exact) theory.
