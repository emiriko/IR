Bell's theorem shows that the reasonable relativistic causal principle known
as "local causality" is not compatible with the predictions of quantum
mechanics. It is not possible maintain a satisfying causal principle of this
type while dropping any of the better-known assumptions of Bell's theorem.
However, another assumption of Bell's theorem is the use of classical logic.
One part of this assumption is the principle of "ontic definiteness", that is,
that it must in principle be possible to assign definite truth values to all
propositions treated in the theory. Once the logical setting is clarified
somewhat, it can be seen that rejecting this principle does not in any way
undermine the type of causal principle used by Bell. Without ontic
definiteness, the deterministic causal condition known as Einstein Locality
succeeds in banning superluminal influence (including signalling) whilst
allowing correlations that violate Bell's inequalities. Objections to altering
logic, and the consequences for operational and realistic viewpoints, are also
addressed.
