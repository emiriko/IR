We propose a model for an anisotropic dark energy star where we assume that
the radial pressure exerted on the system due to the presence of dark energy is
proportional to the isotropic perfect fluid matter density. We discuss various
physical features of our model and show that the model satisfies all the
regularity conditions and stable as well as singularity-free.
