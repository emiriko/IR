Following the analytic approach to thermodynamics developed by Stueckelberg,
we study the evolution equations of a closed thermodynamic system consisting of
point particles in a fluid. We obtain a system of coupled differential
equations describing the mechanical and the thermal evolution of the system.
The coupling between these evolution equations is due to the action of a
viscous friction term. Finally, we apply our coupled evolution equations to
study the thermodynamics of an isolated system consisting of identical point
particles interacting through a harmonic potential.
