This paper is devoted to the study of traveling waves for monotone evolution
systems of bistable type. Under an abstract setting, we establish the existence
of bistable traveling waves for discrete and continuous-time monotone
semiflows. This result is then extended to the cases of periodic habitat and
weak compactness, respectively. We also apply the developed theory to four
classes of evolution systems.
