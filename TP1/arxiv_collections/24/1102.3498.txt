Transition state theory (TST) is generalized for the nonequilibrium system
with power-law distributions. The stochastic dynamics that gives rise to the
power-law distributions for the reaction coordinate and momentum is modeled by
the Langevin equations and corresponding Fokker-Planck equations. It is assumed
that the system far away from equilibrium has not to relax to a thermal
equilibrium state with Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution, but asymptotically
approaches to a nonequilibrium stationary-state with power-law distributions.
Thus, we obtain a generalization of TST rates to nonequilibrium systems with
power-law distributions. Furthermore, we derive the generalized TST rate
constants for one-dimension and n-dimension Hamiltonian systems away from
equilibrium, and receive a generalized Arrhenius rate for the system with
power-law distributions.
