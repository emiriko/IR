We found La2Sb with a layered structure composed of alternate stacking of La
square nets and LaSb layers exhibits bulk superconductivity with a critical
temperature of 5.3 K. This suggests that the presence of the square net with
strong La-La metal bonding is essential for the emergence of superconductivity.
