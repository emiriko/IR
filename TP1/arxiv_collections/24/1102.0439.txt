The monogamy of entanglement is one of the basic quantum mechanical features,
which says that when two partners Alice and Bob are more entangled then either
of them has to be less entangled with the third party. Here we qualitatively
present the converse monogamy of entanglement: given a tripartite pure system
and when Alice and Bob are weakly entangled, then either of them is generally
strongly entangled with the third party. Our result leads to the classification
of tripartite pure states based on bipartite reduced density operators, which
is a novel and effective way to this long-standing problem compared to the
means by stochastic local operations and classical communications. We also
systematically indicate the structure of the classified states and generate
them.
