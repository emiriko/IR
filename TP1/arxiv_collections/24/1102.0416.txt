The heavy spin--3/2 baryon--heavy spin--1/2 baryon vertices with light vector
mesons are studied within the light cone QCD sum rules method. These vertices
are parametrized in terms of three coupling constants. These couplings are
calculated for all possible transitions. It is shown that correlation functions
for these transitions are described by only one invariant function for every
Lorenz structure. The obtained relations between the correlation functions of
the different transitions are structure independent while explicit expressions
of invariant functions depend on the Lorenz structure.
