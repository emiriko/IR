A great efficacy of molecular quantum chemistry applied to basic graphene
problems has been recently demonstrated by the authors when studying the
formation of peculiar composites between carbon nanotubes and graphene as well
as considering tensile deformation and fracture of a graphene sheet in due
course of a mechanochemical reaction. The optimistic results obtained in the
studies make it possible to shift attention from the solid state problems and
consider the graphane formation as multistep hydrogenation of the pristine
molecule. To proceed we have to answer the following questions: 1) which kind
of the hydrogen adsorption, namely, molecular or atomic, is the most probable;
2) what is a characteristic image of the hydrogen atom attachment to the
substrate; 3) which carbon atom (or atoms) is the first target subjected to the
hydrogen attachment and how carbon atoms are selected for the next steps of the
adsorption; 4) is there any connection between the sequential adsorption
pattern and cyclohexane conformers. First results obtained on this way are
presented in the current paper. The calculations were performed within the
framework of unrestricted broken symmetry Hartree-Fock approach by using
semiempirical AM1 technique.
