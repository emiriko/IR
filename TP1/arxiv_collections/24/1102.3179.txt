We study quantum Darwinism, the redundant recording of information about the
preferred states of a decohering system by its environment, for an object
illuminated by a blackbody. We calculate the quantum mutual information between
the object and its photon environment for blackbodies that cover an arbitrary
section of the sky. In particular, we demonstrate that more extended sources
have a reduced ability to create redundant information about the system, in
agreement with previous evidence that initial mixedness of an environment
slows---but does not stop---the production of records. We also show that the
qualitative results are robust for more general initial states of the system.
