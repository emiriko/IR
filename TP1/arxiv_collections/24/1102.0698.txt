We have found several families of vortex soliton solutions in two-dimensional
discrete dissipative systems governed by the cubic-quintic complex
Ginzburg-Landau equation. There are symmetric and asymmetric solutions, and
some of them have simultaneously two different topological charges. Their
regions of existence and stability are determined. Additionally, we have
analyzed the relation- ship between dissipation and stability for a number of
solutions. We have obtained that dissipation favours the stability of the
solutions.
