The removal of Radon induced Lead from liquid scintillator was extensively
studied in preparation for KamLAND's low background phase. This work presents
the results from laboratory experiments performed at the University of Alabama
and their implications for KamLAND and future low background experiments using
carbon based liquid scintillator. It was observed that distillation was the
most effective purification procedure and that one must consider a non-polar
and non-ionic component of Lead in order to reach the levels of radio-purity
required for these new class of ultra-low background experiments.
