Coincident observations with gravitational wave (GW) detectors and other
astronomical instruments are in the focus of the experiments with the network
of LIGO, Virgo and GEO detectors. They will become a necessary part of the
future GW astronomy as the next generation of advanced detectors comes online.
The success of such joint observations directly depends on the source
localization capabilities of the GW detectors. In this paper we present studies
of the sky localization of transient sources with the future advanced detector
networks and describe their fundamental properties. By reconstructing sky
coordinates of ad hoc signals injected into simulated detector noise we study
the accuracy of the source localization and its dependence on the strength of
injected signals, waveforms and network configurations.
