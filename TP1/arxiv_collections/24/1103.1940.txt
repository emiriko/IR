We argue that the $t \bar t$ production asymmetry observed at the tevatron
might be simply explained if the standard $SU(3)_c$ QCD theory is extended to
$SU(N_c)$ which is spontaneously broken at a scale just above the weak scale.
The extended gauge interactions amplify the radiative QCD contribution to the
asymmetry and can potentially explain the observations if $N_c
\stackrel{>}{\sim} 5$. This explanation requires a relatively low $SU(N_c)$
symmetry breaking scale $\stackrel{<}{\sim} 0.5-1$ TeV. We check that such a
low $SU(N_c)$ symmetry breaking scale is consistent with current collider data.
Importantly this scenario predicts an abundance of striking phenomena which
will be probed at the LHC. The $SU(N_c)$ model also illustrates the idea that a
beyond standard model contribution to the $t \bar t$ asymmetry might arise
primarily via radiative corrections rather than at tree-level.
