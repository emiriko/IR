By means of a variational calculation using Matrix Product States with
periodic boundary conditions, we accurately determine the extension of the
spin-supersolid phase predicted to exist in the spin-1 anisotropic Heisenberg
chain. We compute both the structure factor and the superfluid stiffness, and
extract the critical exponents of the supersolid-to-solid phase transition.
