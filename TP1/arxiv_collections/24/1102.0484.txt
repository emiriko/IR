We demonstrate the generation of rubidium-resonant heralded single photons
for quantum memories. Photon pairs are created by cavity-enhanced
down-conversion and narrowed in bandwidth to 7 MHz with a novel atom-based
filter operating by "interaction-free measurement" principles. At least 94% of
the heralded photons are atom-resonant as demonstrated by a direct absorption
measurement with rubidium vapor. A heralded auto-correlation measurement shows
$g_c^{(2)}(0)=0.040 \pm 0.012$, i.e., suppression of multi-photon contributions
by a factor of 25 relative to a coherent state. The generated heralded photons
can readily be used in quantum memories and quantum networks.
