We study an ideal-gas-like model where the particles exchange energy
stochastically, through energy conserving scattering processes, which take
place if and only if at least one of the two particles has energy below a
certain energy threshold (interactions are initiated by such low energy
particles). This model has an intriguing phase transition in the sense that
there is a critical value of the energy threshold, below which the number of
particles in the steady state goes to zero, and above which the average number
of particles in the steady state is non-zero. This phase transition is
associated with standard features like "critical slowing down" and non-trivial
values of some critical exponents characterizing the variation of thermodynamic
quantities near the threshold energy. The features are exhibited not only in
the mean field version but also in the lattice versions.
