We show how to apply a generalization of Local control design to the problem
of saturation of a spin 1/2 particle by magnetic fields in Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance. The generalization of local or Lyapunov control arises from the fact
that the derivative of the Lyapunov function does not depend explicitly on the
control field. The second derivative is used to determine the local control
field. We compare the efficiency of this approach with respect to the
time-optimal solution which has been recently derived using geometric methods.
