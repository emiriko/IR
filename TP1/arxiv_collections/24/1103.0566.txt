The de Branges spaces of entire functions generalise the classical
Paley-Wiener space of square summable bandlimited functions. Specifically, the
square norm is computed on the real line with respect to weights given by the
values of certain entire functions. For the Paley-Wiener space, this can be
chosen to be an exponential function where the phase increases linearly. As our
main result, we establish a natural geometric characterisation, in terms of
densities, for real sampling and interpolating sequences in the case when the
derivative of the phase function merely gives a doubling measure on the real
line. Moreover, a consequence of this doubling condition, is that the spaces we
consider are one component model spaces. A novelty of our work is the
application to de Branges spaces of techniques developed by Marco, Massaneda
and Ortega-Cerd\'a for Fock spaces satisfying a doubling condition analogue to
ours.
