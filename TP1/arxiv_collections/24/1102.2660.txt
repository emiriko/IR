We prove there is only one involution (up to conjugacy) on the n-torus which
acts as $-\mathrm{Id}$ on the first homology group when $n$ is of the form
$4k$, is of the form $4k+1$, or is less than $4$. In all other cases we prove
there are infinitely many such involutions up to conjugacy, but each of them
has exactly $2^n$ fixed points and is conjugate to a smooth involution. The key
technical point is that we completely compute the equivariant structure set for
the corresponding crystallographic group action on $\mathbb{R}^n$ in terms of
the Cappell $\mathrm{UNil}$-groups arising from its infinite dihedral
subgroups. We give a complete analysis of equivariant topological rigidity for
this family of groups.
