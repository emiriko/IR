The new inequality recently found by Trifonov and called the state-extended
inequality is considered in the tomographic-probability representation of
quantum mechanics. The Trifonov uncertainty relations are expressed in terms of
optical tomograms and can be checked in experiments on homodyne detection of
the photon states.
