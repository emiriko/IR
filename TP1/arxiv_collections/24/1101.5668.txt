Log files contain information about User Name, IP Address, Time Stamp, Access
Request, number of Bytes Transferred, Result Status, URL that Referred and User
Agent. The log files are maintained by the web servers. By analysing these log
files gives a neat idea about the user. This paper gives a detailed discussion
about these log files, their formats, their creation, access procedures, their
uses, various algorithms used and the additional parameters that can be used in
the log files which in turn gives way to an effective mining. It also provides
the idea of creating an extended log file and learning the user behaviour.
