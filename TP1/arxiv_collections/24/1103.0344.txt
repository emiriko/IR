We present zero-field {\mu}SR measurements for LiY$_{1-x}$Ho$_{x}$F$_{4}$
samples with x = 0.0017, 0.0085, 0.0406, and 0.0855. We characterize the
dynamics associated with the formation of the (F-{\mu}-F)$^{-1}$ complex by
comparing our data to Monte Carlo simulations to determine the concentration
range over which the spin dynamics are determined primarily by the
Ho$^{3+}$-{\mu} interaction rather than the F-{\mu} interaction. Simulations
show that F-{\mu}-F oscillations should evolve into a Lorentzian Kubo-Toyabe
decay for an increasing static magnetic field distribution {\Gamma} (i.e.,
increasing x), but the data do not show this behavior, consistent with the
recently reported existence of strong magnetic fluctuations in this system at
low temperatures. Anisotropy in the field distribution is shown to cause small
errors of order 10% from behavior predicted for an isotropic distribution.
Finally, numerical calculations show that values of {\Gamma} calculated in the
single ion limit greatly exceed the values extracted from curve fits,
suggesting that strong correlations play an important role in this system.
