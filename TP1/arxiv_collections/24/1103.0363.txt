A bifurcation theory for a system of globally coupled phase oscillators is
developed based on the theory of rigged Hilbert spaces. It is shown that there
exists a finite-dimensional center manifold on a space of generalized
functions. The dynamics on the manifold is derived for any coupling functions.
When the coupling function is $\sin \theta $, a bifurcation diagram conjectured
by Kuramoto is rigorously obtained. When it is not $\sin \theta $, a new type
of bifurcation phenomenon is found due to the discontinuity of the projection
operator to the center subspace.
