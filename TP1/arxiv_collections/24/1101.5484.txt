We theoretically compared quantum noise squeezing differences between silicon
and graphene nanoresonators based on experimental structure parameters. The
conditions to achieve squeezed states of silicon and graphene have been
discussed. According to our theoretical analysis, graphene nanoresonators can
obtain a much smaller squeezing factor than silicon, taking advantage of their
thin thickness. Both the quantum noise and thermal noise (Brownian motion) of
typical monolayer graphene nanoresonator can be reduced by 12.58 dB at T = 5 K
with a pump voltage of 5 V.
