Following the work of Beilinson, Bernstein and Deligne, we study restriction
and induction of t-structures in triangulated categories with respect to
recollements. For derived categories of piecewise hereditary algebras we give a
necessary and sufficient condition for a bounded t-structure to be induced from
a recollement by derived categories of algebras. As a corollary we prove that
for hereditary algebras of finite representation type all bounded t-structures
can be obtained in this way.
