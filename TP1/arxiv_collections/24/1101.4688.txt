The notion of a firmly nonexpansive mapping is central in fixed point theory
because of attractive convergence properties for iterates and the
correspondence with maximal monotone operators due to Minty. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the relationship between properties of firmly
nonexpansive mappings and associated maximal monotone operators. Dual and
self-dual properties are also identified. The results are illustrated through
several examples.
