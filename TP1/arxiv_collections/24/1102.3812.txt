The relative efficiencies of the chemical pathways that can lead to the
destruction of LiH and LiH+ molecules, conjectured to be present in the
primordial gas and to control molecular cooling processes in the gravitational
collapse of the post-recombination era, are revisited by using accurate quantum
calculations for the several reactions involved. The new rates are employed to
survey the behavior of the relative abundance of these molecules at redshifts
of interest for early universe conditions. We find significant differences with
respect to previous calculations, the present ones yielding LIH abundances
higher than LiH+ at all redshifts.
