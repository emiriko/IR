The discovery of close-to-star gas-giant exo-planets lends support to the
idea of Earth's origin as a Jupiter-like gas giant and to the consequences of
its compression, including whole-Earth decompression dynamics that gives rise,
without requiring mantle convection, to the myriad measurements and
observations whose descriptions are attributed to plate tectonics. I show here
that paleolatitude determinations, used extensively in Pangaea-like
reconstructions and in paleoclimate considerations, may be subject to
potentially significant errors if rock-magnetization was acquired at
Earth-radii less than present.
