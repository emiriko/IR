We report on the fabrication and measurements of a superconducting junction
of a single-crystalline Au nanowire, connected to Al electrodes.
Current-Voltage characteristic curve shows clear supercurrent branch below the
superconducting transition temperature of Al and quantized voltage plateaus on
application of microwave radiation, as expected from Josephson relations.
Highly transparent (0.95) contacts very close to an ideal limit of 1 are formed
at the interface between the normal metal (Au) and the superconductor (Al). The
very high transparency is ascribed to the single crystallinity of a Au nanowire
and the formation of an oxide-free contact between Au and Al. The sub-gap
structures of the differential conductance are well explained by coherent
multiple Andreev reflections (MAR), the hallmark of mesoscopic Josephson
junctions. These observations demonstrate that single crystalline Au nanowires
can be employed to develop novel quantum devices utilizing coherent electrical
transport.
