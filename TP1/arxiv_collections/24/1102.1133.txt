We consider the one-loop quantum corrections to the Nielsen-Olesen flux tube
of finite length $L$, by imposing periodic boundary conditions. The
calculations are based on a recent evaluation of these quantum corrections to
the string tension of an infinite vortex. The finite length corrections are
finite from the outset. If the computation is restricted to the zero modes we
obtain the standard L\"uscher term $\pi/3L$ for a closed string. The inclusion
of the other fluctuation modes of Higgs and gauge fields, using the numerically
computed trace of the Euclidian Green's function, leads to corrections that
decrease exponentially with $L$. We present numerical results for these
corrections, discuss their possible relevance, and the limitations of the
approach.
