Low-energy dipole excitations in neon isotopes and N=16 isotones are
calculated with a fully consistent axially-symmetric-deformed quasiparticle
random phase approximation (QRPA) approach based on Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov
(HFB) states. The same Gogny D1S effective force has been used both in HFB and
QRPA calculations. The microscopical structure of these low-lying resonances,
as well as the behavior of proton and neutron transition densities, are
investigated in order to determine the isoscalar or isovector nature of the
excitations. It is found that the N=16 isotones 24O, 26Ne, 28Mg, and 30Si are
characterized by a similar behavior. The occupation of the 2s_1/2 neutron orbit
turns out to be crucial, leading to nontrivial transition densities and to
small but finite collectivity. Some low-lying dipole excitations of 28Ne and
30Ne, characterized by transitions involving the neutron 1d_3/2 state, present
a more collective behavior and isoscalar transition densities. A collective
proton low-lying excitation is identified in the 18Ne nucleus.
