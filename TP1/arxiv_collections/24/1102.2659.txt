We perform a preliminary study of the 1/2+ and 3/2+ ground-state baryons
containing a heavy quark in the framework of the chiral SU(3) quark model. By
using the calculus of variations, masses of Lambda_Q, Sigma_Q, Xi_Q, Omega_Q,
Sigma_Q^*, Xi_Q^* and Omega_Q^*, where Q means c or b quark, are calculated.
With taking reasonable model parameters, the numerical results of established
heavy baryons are generally in agreement with the available experimental data,
except that those of Xi_Q are somewhat heavier. For Omega_b with undetermined
experimental mass and nobserved Xi_b^*, Omega_b^*, reasonable theoretical
predictions are obtained. Interactions inside baryons are also discussed.
