A connected graph $\G$ is said to be {\it distance-balanced} whenever for any
pair of adjacent vertices $u,v$ of $\G$ the number of vertices closer to $u$
than to $v$ is equal to the number of vertices closer to $v$ than to $u$. In
[Bipartite graphs with balanced $(a,b)$-partitions, {\em Ars Combin.} {\bf 51}
(1999), 113-119] Handa asked whether every bipartite distance-balanced graph,
that is not a cycle, is 3-connected. In this paper the Handa question is
answered in the negative. Moreover, we show that a minimal bipartite
distance-balanced graph, that is not a cycle and is not 3-connected, has 18
vertices and is unique. In addition, we give a complete classification of
non-3-connected bipartite distance-balanced graphs for which the minimal
distance between two vertices in a 2-cut is three. All such graphs are regular
and for each $k \geq 3$ there exists an infinite family of such graphs which
are $k$-regular.
  Furthermore, we determine a number of structural properties that a bipartite
distance-balanced graph, which is not 3-connected, must have. As an
application, we give a positive answer to the Handa question for the subfamily
of bipartite strongly distance-balanced graphs.
