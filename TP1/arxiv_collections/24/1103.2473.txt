Motivated by the quasi-1D antiferromagnet CaV$_2$O$_4$, we explore
spin-orbital systems in which the spin modes are gapped but orbitals are near a
macroscopically degenerate classical transition. Within a simplified model we
show that gapless orbital liquid phases possessing power-law correlations may
occur without the strict condition of a continuous orbital symmetry. For the
model proposed for CaV$_2$O$_4$, we find that an orbital phase with coexisting
order parameters emerges from a multicritical point. The effective orbital
model consists of zigzag-coupled transverse field Ising chains. The
corresponding global phase diagram is constructed using field theory methods
and analyzed near the multicritical point with the aid of an exact solution of
a zigzag XXZ model.
