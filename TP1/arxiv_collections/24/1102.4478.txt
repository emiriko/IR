At a 3/2-cusp of a given plane curve $\gamma(t)$, both of the Euclidean
curvature $\kappa_g$ and the affine curvature $\kappa_A$ diverge. In this
paper, we show that each of $\sqrt{|s_g|}\kappa_g$ and $(s_A)^2 \kappa_A$
(called the Euclidean and affine normalized curvature, respectively) at a
3/2-cusp is a smooth function of the variable $t$, where $s_g$ (resp. $s_A$) is
the Euclidean (resp. affine) arclength parameter of the curve corresponding to
the 3/2-cusp $s_g=0$ (resp. $s_A=0$).
  Moreover, we give a characterization of the behaviour of the curvature
functions $\kappa_g$ and $\kappa_A$ at 3/2-cusps. On the other hand, inflection
points are also singular points of curves in affine geometry. We give a similar
characterization of affine curvature functions near generic inflection points.
As an application, new affine invariants of 3/2-cusps and generic inflection
points are given.
