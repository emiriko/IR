We explore a geometric approach to generating local SU(2) and
$SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ invariants for a collection of qubits inspired by lattice
gauge theory. Each local invariant or 'gauge' invariant is associated to a
distinct closed path (or plaquette) joining some or all of the qubits. In
lattice gauge theory, the lattice points are the discrete space-time points,
the transformations between the points of the lattice are defined by parallel
transporters and the gauge invariant observable associated to a particular
closed path is given by the Wilson loop. In our approach the points of the
lattice are qubits, the link-transformations between the qubits are defined by
the correlations between them and the gauge invariant observable, the local
invariants associated to a particular closed path are also given by a Wilson
loop-like construction. The link transformations share many of the properties
of parallel transporters although they are not undone when one retraces one's
steps through the lattice. This feature is used to generate many of the
invariants. We consider a pure three qubit state as a test case and find we can
generate a complete set of algebraically independent local invariants in this
way, however the framework given here is applicable to mixed states composed of
any number of $d$ level quantum systems. We give an operational interpretation
of these invariants in terms of observables.
