We numerically investigate the gravitational collapse of collisionless
particles in spheroidal configurations both in four and five-dimensional (5D)
space-time. We repeat the simulation performed by Shapiro and Teukolsky (1991)
that announced an appearance of a naked singularity, and also find that the
similar results in 5D version. That is, in a collapse of a highly prolate
spindle, the Kretschmann invariant blows up outside the matter and no apparent
horizon forms. We also find that the collapses in 5D proceed rapidly than in
4D, and the critical prolateness for appearance of apparent horizon in 5D is
loosened compared to 4D cases. We also show how collapses differ with spatial
symmetries comparing 5D evolutions in single-axisymmetry, SO(3), and those in
double-axisymmetry, U(1)$\times$U(1).
