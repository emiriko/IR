Liquid-xenon based particle detectors have been dramatically growing in size
during the last years, and are now exceeding the one-ton scale. The required
high xenon purity is usually achieved by continuous recirculation of xenon gas
through a high-temperature getter. This challenges the traditional way of
cooling these large detectors, since in a thermally well insulated detector,
most of the cooling power is spent to compensate losses from recirculation. The
phase change during recondensing requires five times more cooling power than
cooling the gas from ambient temperature to -100C (173 K). Thus, to reduce the
cooling power requirements for large detectors, we propose to use the heat from
the purified incoming gas to evaporate the outgoing xenon gas, by means of a
heat exchanger. Generally, a heat exchanger would appear to be only of very
limited use, since evaporation and liquefaction occur at zero temperature
difference. However, the use of a recirculation pump reduces the pressure of
the extracted liquid, forces it to evaporate, and thus cools it down. We show
that this temperature difference can be used for an efficient heat exchange
process. We investigate the use of a commercial parallel plate heat exchanger
with a small liquid xenon detector. Although we expected to be limited by the
available cooling power to flow rates of about 2 SLPM, rates in excess of 12
SLPM can easily be sustained, limited only by the pump speed and the impedance
of the flow loop. The heat exchanger operates with an efficiency of (96.8 +/-
0.5)%. This opens the possibility for fast xenon gas recirculation in
large-scale experiments, while minimizing thermal losses.
