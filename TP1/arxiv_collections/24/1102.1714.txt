We consider various aspects of the Segre variety S := S_{1,1,1}(2) in
PG(7,2), whose stabilizer group G_S < GL(8, 2) has the structure N {\rtimes}
Sym(3), where N := GL(2,2)\times GL(2,2)\times GL(2,2). In particular we prove
that S determines a distinguished Z_3-subgroup Z < GL(8, 2) such that AZA^{-1}
= Z, for all A in G_S, and in consequence S determines a G_S-invariant spread
of 85 lines in PG(7,2). Furthermore we see that Segre varieties S_{1,1,1}(2) in
PG(7,2) come along in triplets {S,S',S"} which share the same distinguished
Z_3-subgroup Z < GL(8,2). We conclude by determining all fifteen G_S-invariant
polynomial functions on PG(7,2) which have degree < 8, and their relation to
the five G_S-orbits of points in PG(7,2).
