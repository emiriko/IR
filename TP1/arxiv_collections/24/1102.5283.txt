Dirac-Weyl fermions are massless relativistic particles with a well-defined
helicity which arise in the context of high-energy physics. Here we propose a
quantum simulation of these paradigmatic fermions using multicomponent
ultracold atoms in a two-dimensional square optical lattice. We find that
laser-assisted spin-dependent hopping, specifically tuned to the
$(2s+1)$-dimensional representations of the $\mathfrak{su}$(2) Lie algebra,
directly leads to a regime where the emerging massless excitations correspond
to Dirac-Weyl fermions with arbitrary pseudospin $s$. We show that this
platform hosts two different phases: a semimetallic phase that occurs for
half-integer $s$, and a metallic phase that contains a flat zero-energy band at
integer $s$. These phases host a variety of interesting effects, such as a very
rich anomalous quantum Hall effect and a remarkable multirefringent Klein
tunneling. In addition we show that these effects are directly related to the
number of underlying Dirac-Weyl species and zero modes.
