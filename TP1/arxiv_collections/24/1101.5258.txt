We study the Casimir interaction between a dielectric nanosphere and a
metallic plane, using the multiple scattering theory. Exact results are
obtained with the dielectric described by a Sellmeier model and the metal by a
Drude model. Asymptotic forms are discussed for small spheres, large or small
distances. The well-known Casimir-Polder formula is recovered at the limit of
vanishingly small spheres, while an expression better behaved at small
distances is found for any finite value of the radius. The exact results are of
particular interest for the study of quantum states of nanospheres in the
vicinity of surfaces.
