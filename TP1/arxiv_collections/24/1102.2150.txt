The creation of collective many-body quantum states from a two-dimensional
lattice gas of atoms is studied. Our approach relies on the van-der-Waals
interaction that is present between alkali metal atoms when laser excited to
high-lying Rydberg s-states. We focus on a regime in which the laser driving is
strong compared to the interaction between Rydberg atoms. Here energetically
low-lying many-particle states can be calculated approximately from a quadratic
Hamiltonian. The potential usefulness of these states as a resource for the
creation of deterministic single-photon sources is illustrated. The properties
of these photon states are determined from the interplay between the particular
geometry of the lattice and the interatomic spacing.
