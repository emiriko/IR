In this paper a periodic parameter switching scheme is applied to the
Hindmarsh-Rose neuronal system to synthesize certain attractors. Results show
numerically, via computer graphic simulations, that the obtained synthesized
attractor belongs to the class of all admissible attractors for the
Hindmarsh-Rose neuronal system and matches the averaged attractor obtained with
the control parameter replaced with the averaged switched parameter values.
This feature allows us to imagine that living beings are able to maintain vital
behavior while the control parameter switches so that their dynamical behavior
is suitable for the given environment.
