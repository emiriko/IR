We have performed low-temperature specific heat $C$ and thermal conductivity
$\kappa$ measurements on the Ni-pnictide superconductors BaNi$_2$As$_2$
($T_\mathrm{c}$=0.7 K and SrNi$_2$P$_2$ ($T_\mathrm{c}$=1.4 K). The temperature
dependences $C(T)$ and $\kappa(T)$ of the two compounds are similar to the
results of a number of s-wave superconductors. Furthermore, the concave field
responses of the residual $\kappa$ for BaNi$_2$As$_2$ rules out the presence of
nodes on the Fermi surfaces. We postulate that fully gapped superconductivity
could be universal for Ni-pnictide superconductors. Specific heat data on
Ba$_{0.6}$La$_{0.4}$Ni$_2$As$_2$ shows a mild suppression of $T_\mathrm{c}$ and
$H_\mathrm{c2}$ relative to BaNi$_2$As$_2$.
