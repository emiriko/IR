The universal functional of Hohenberg-Kohn is given as a coupling-constant
integral over the density as a functional of the potential. Conditions are
derived under which potential-functional approximations are variational.
Construction via this method and imposition of these conditions are shown to
greatly improve the accuracy of the non-interacting kinetic energy needed for
orbital-free Kohn-Sham calculations.
