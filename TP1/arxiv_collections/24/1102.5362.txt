Capillary electrophoresis has long been been recognized as a powerful
analytic tool. Here it is demonstrated that the same capillary electrophoretic
experiments also reveal dynamic properties of the polymer solutions being used
as the support medium. The dependence of the electrophoretic mobility on the
size of the probe and the properties of the matrix polymers shows a unity of
behavior between electrophoresis and other methods of studying polymer
properties.
