Recent measurements of the D\O\ experiment related to the search for new
phenomena beyond the Standard Model are reviewed. The new measurement of the
like-sign dimuon charge asymmetry reveals a 3.2$\sigma$ deviation from the SM
prediction, while the updated study of the $B_s \to J/\psi \phi$ decay
demonstrates a better agreement with the SM. All experimental results on the
$CP$ violation in mixing are currently consistent with each other. The D\O\
collaboration has much more statistics to analyze, and all these results can be
significantly improved in the future.
