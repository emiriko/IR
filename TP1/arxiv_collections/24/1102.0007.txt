In the standard cosmological model, the merger remnant of the Milky Way and
Andromeda (Milkomeda) will be the only galaxy remaining within our event
horizon once the Universe has aged by another factor of ten, ~10^{11} years
after the Big Bang. After that time, the only extragalactic sources of light in
the observable cosmic volume will be hypervelocity stars being ejected
continuously from Milkomeda. Spectroscopic detection of the velocity-distance
relation or the evolution in the Doppler shifts of these stars will allow a
precise measurement of the vacuum mass density as well as the local matter
distribution. Already in the near future, the next generation of large
telescopes will allow photometric detection of individual stars out to the edge
of the Local Group, and may target the ~10^{5+-1} hypervelocity stars that
originated in it as cosmological tracers.
