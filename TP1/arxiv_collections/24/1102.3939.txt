The main hurdle in the realization of dynamic spectrum access (DSA) systems
from physical layer perspective is the reliable sensing of low power licensed
users. One such scenario shows up in the unlicensed use of TV bands where the
TV Band Devices (TVBDs) are required to sense extremely low power wireless
microphones (WMs). The lack of technical standard among various wireless
manufacturers and the resemblance of certain WM signals to narrow-band
interference signals, such as spurious emissions, further aggravate the
problem. Due to these uncertainties, it is extremely difficult to abstract the
features of WM signals and hence develop robust sensing algorithms. To partly
counter these challenges, we develop a two-stage sub-space algorithm that
detects multiple narrow-band analog frequency-modulated signals generated by
WMs. The performance of the algorithm is verified by using experimentally
captured low power WM signals with received power ranging from -100 to -105
dBm. The problem of differentiating between the WM and other narrow-band
signals is left as a future work.
