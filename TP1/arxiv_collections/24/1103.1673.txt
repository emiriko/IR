This paper gives a brief review on the recent work on fractional Klein-Gordon
fields, in particular on the Casimir effect associated to fractional
Klein-Gordon fields in various geometries and boundary conditions. New results
on Casimir piston due to a fractional Klein-Gordon massive field are given.
