We present optical colors of 72 transneptunian objects (TNOs), and infrared
colors of 80 TNOs obtained with the WFPC2 and NICMOS instruments, respectively,
on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Both optical and infrared colors are
available for 32 objects that overlap between the datasets. This dataset adds
an especially uniform, consistent and large contribution to the overall sample
of colors, particularly in the infrared. The range of our measured colors is
consistent with other colors reported in the literature at both optical and
infrared wavelengths. We find generally good agreement for objects measured by
both us and others; 88.1% have better than 2 sigma agreement. The median Hv
magnitude of our optical sample is 7.2, modestly smaller (~0.5 mag) than for
previous samples. The median absolute magnitude, Hv, in our infrared sample is
6.7. We find no new correlations between color and dynamical properties
(semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination and perihelion). We do find that
colors of Classical objects with i<6{\deg} come from a different distribution
than either the Resonant or excited populations in the visible at the >99.99%
level with a K-S test. The same conclusion is found in the infrared at a
slightly lower significance level, 99.72%. Two Haumea collision fragments with
strong near infrared ice bands are easily identified with broad HST infrared
filters and point to an efficient search strategy for identifying more such
objects. We find evidence for variability in (19255) 1999 VK8, 1999 OE4, 2000
CE105, 1998 KG62 and 1998 WX31.
