We implement a new algorithm for listing all maximal cliques in sparse graphs
due to Eppstein, L\"offler, and Strash (ISAAC 2010) and analyze its performance
on a large corpus of real-world graphs. Our analysis shows that this algorithm
is the first to offer a practical solution to listing all maximal cliques in
large sparse graphs. All other theoretically-fast algorithms for sparse graphs
have been shown to be significantly slower than the algorithm of Tomita et al.
(Theoretical Computer Science, 2006) in practice. However, the algorithm of
Tomita et al. uses an adjacency matrix, which requires too much space for large
sparse graphs. Our new algorithm opens the door for fast analysis of large
sparse graphs whose adjacency matrix will not fit into working memory.
