Inspired by holographic principle, we suggest that the density of dark energy
is proportional to the spatial Ricci scalar curvature (SRDE). Such model is
phenomenologically viable. The best fit values of its parameters at 68%
confidence level are found to be: $\Omega_{\rm m0}=0.259\pm0.016$ and
$\alpha=0.261\pm0.0122$, constrained from the Union+CFA3 sample of 397 SNIa and
the BAO measurement. We find the equation of state of SRDE crosses -1 at
$z\simeq-0.14$. The present values of the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ for
SRDE is found to be $q_{z=0}\sim -0.85$. The phase transition from deceleration
to acceleration of the Universe for SRDE occurs at the redshift $z_{q=0}\sim
0.4$. After studying on the perturbation of each component of the Universe, we
show that the matter power spectra and cosmic microwave background temperature
anisotropy is slightly affected by SRDE, compared with $\Lambda$CDM.
