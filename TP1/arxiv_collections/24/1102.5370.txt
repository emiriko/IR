A system modeling the electrophoretic motion of a charged rigid macromolecule
immersed in a incompressible ionized fluid is considered. The ionic
concentration is governing by the Nernst-Planck equation coupled with the
Poisson equation for the electrostatic potential, Navier-Stokes and Newtonian
equations for the fluid and the macromolecule dynamics, respectively. A local
in time existence result for suitable weak solutions is established, following
the approach of Desjardins and Esteban [Comm. Partial Diff. Eq., 25 (2000),
1399--1414].
