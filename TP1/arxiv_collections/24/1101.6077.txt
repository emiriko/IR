The shape of the beta decay energy distribution is sensitive to the mass of
the electron neutrino. Attempts to measure the endpoint shape of tritium decay
have so far seen no distortion from the zero-mass form. Here we show that a new
type of electron energy spectroscopy could improve future measurements of this
spectrum and therefore of the neutrino mass. We propose to detect the coherent
cyclotron radiation emitted by an energetic electron in a magnetic field. For
mildly relativistic electrons, like those in tritium decay, the relativistic
shift of the cyclotron frequency allows us to extract the electron energy from
the emitted radiation. As the technique inherently involves the measurement of
a frequency in a non-destructive manner, it can, in principle, achieve a high
degree of resolution and accuracy.
