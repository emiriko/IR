We perform density functional theory calculations for the determination of
the structural and electronic properties of epitaxial graphene on
4H-SiC(000$\bar{1}$). Using commensurate supercells that minimize non-physical
stresses we show that, in contrast with Si-face epitaxial films, the first
graphene layer that forms on the C-face of SiC is purely metallic with its
$\pi$-bands partially preserved. Typical free-standing characteristics are
fully recovered with a second graphene layer. We moreover discuss on the
magnetic properties of the interface and the absence of Fermi-level pinning
effects that could allow for a plausible device operation starting from the
off-state.
