Long-range dependence and non-Gaussianity are ubiquitous in many natural
systems like ecosystems, biological systems and climate. However, it is not
always appreciated that both phenomena may occur together in natural systems
and that self-similarity in a system can be a superposition of both phenomena.
These features, which are common in complex systems, impact the attribution of
trends and the occurrence and clustering of extremes. The risk assessment of
systems with these properties will lead to different outcomes (e.g. return
periods) than the more common assumption of independence of extremes. Two
paradigmatic models are discussed which can simultaneously account for
long-range dependence and non-Gaussianity: Autoregressive Fractional Integrated
Moving Average (ARFIMA) and Linear Fractional Stable Motion (LFSM). Statistical
properties of estimators for long-range dependence and self-similarity are
critically assessed. It is found that the most popular estimators can be biased
in the presence of important features of many natural systems like trends and
multiplicative noise. Also the long-range dependence and non-Gaussianity of two
typical natural time series are discussed.
