Rich-club and page-club coefficients and their null models are introduced for
directed graphs. Null models allow for a quantitative discussion of the
rich-club and page-club phenomena. These coefficients are computed for four
directed real-world networks: Arxiv High Energy Physics paper citation network,
Web network (released from Google), Citation network among US Patents, and
Email network from a EU research institution. The results show a high
correlation between rich-club and page-club ordering. For journal paper
citation network, we identify both rich-club and page-club ordering, showing
that {}"elite" papers are cited by other {}"elite" papers. Google web network
shows partial rich-club and page-club ordering up to some point and then a
narrow declining of the corresponding normalized coefficients, indicating the
lack of rich-club ordering and the lack of page-club ordering, i.e. high
in-degree (PageRank) pages purposely avoid sharing links with other high
in-degree (PageRank) pages. For UC patents citation network, we identify
page-club and rich-club ordering providing a conclusion that {}"elite" patents
are cited by other {}"elite" patents. Finally, for e-mail communication network
we show lack of both rich-club and page-club ordering. We construct an example
of synthetic network showing page-club ordering and the lack of rich-club
ordering.
