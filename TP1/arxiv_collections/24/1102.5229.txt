For c in [0,1] let P_n(c) denote the set of n-vertex perfect graphs with
density c and C_n(c) the set of n-vertex graphs without induced C_5 and with
density c. We show that
log|P_n(c)|/binom{n}{2}=log|C_n(c)|/binom{n}{2}=h(c)+o(1) with h(c)=1/2 if
1/4<c<3/4 and h(c)=H(|2c-1|)/2 otherwise, where H is the binary entropy
function.
  Further, we use this result to deduce that almost all graphs in C_n(c) have
homogenous sets of linear size. This answers a question raised by Loebl, Reed,
Scott, Thomason, and Thomass\'e [Almost all H-free graphs have the
Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal property] in the case of forbidden induced C_5.
