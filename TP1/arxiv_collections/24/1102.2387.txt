Popper's original thought experiment probed some fundamental and subtle rules
of quantum mechanics. Two experiments have directly and indirectly tested
Popper's hypothesis, but they seem to give contrasting results. The equations
governing these two experiments and Popper's thought experiment will be derived
from basic quantum principles. The experimental constants will be inputted and
it will show that the two experiments agree with each other and with quantum
theory.
