We numerically study quantum magnetism of ultra-cold alkali and
alkaline-earth fermion systems with large hyperfine spin $F=3/2$, which are
characterized by a generic $Sp(N)$ symmetry with N=4. The methods of exact
diagonalization (ED) and density-matrix-renormalization-group are employed for
the large size one-dimensional (1D) systems, and ED is applied to a
two-dimensional (2D) square lattice on small sizes. We focus on the magnetic
exchange models in the Mott-insulating state at quarter-filling. Both 1D and 2D
systems exhibit rich phase diagrams depending on the ratio between the spin
exchanges $J_0$ and $J_2$ in the bond spin singlet and quintet channels,
respectively. In 1D, the ground states exhibit a long-range-ordered
dimerization with a finite spin gap at $J_0/J_2>1$, and a gapless spin liquid
state at $J_0/J_2 \le 1$, respectively. In the former and latter cases, the
correlation functions exhibit the two-site and four-site periodicities,
respectively. In 2D, various spin correlation functions are calculated up to
the size of $4\times 4$. The Neel-type spin correlation dominates at large
values of $J_0/J_2$, while a $2\times 2$ plaquette correlation is prominent at
small values of this ratio. Between them, a columnar spin-Peierls dimerization
correlation peaks. We infer the competitions among the plaquette ordering, the
dimer ordering, and the Neel ordering in the 2D system.
