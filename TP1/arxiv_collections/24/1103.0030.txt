A new heavy gauge boson, W', decaying to a muon and a neutrino, is searched
for in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass of 7 TeV. The data, collected with the
CMS detector at the LHC, correspond to an integrated luminosity of 36 inverse
picobarns. No significant excess of events above the standard model expectation
is found in the transverse mass distribution of the muon-neutrino system.
Masses below 1.40 TeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level for a sequential
standard-model-like W'. The W' mass lower limit increases to 1.58 TeV when the
present analysis is combined with the CMS result for the electron channel.
