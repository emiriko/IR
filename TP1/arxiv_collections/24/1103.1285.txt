Using DFT calculations, we present a thorough study of the quantum size
effects on the stability of freestanding metal atom wires. Our systems include
Na, Ag, Au, In, Ga and Pb atom wires, i.e. $s$, $sd$, and $sp$ electron
prototypes. We found that the total energy always oscillates with the wire
length, which clearly indicates the existence of preferred lengths. Increasing
the length, the s-system exhibits even-odd oscillations following a $a/x
+b/x^2$ decay law in the stability, which can be attributed to electron band
filling and quantum confinement along the wire. The $sd$-system exhibits a
similar oscillation pattern, even in the presence of $sd$ hybridization. In
$sp$-system, the energy oscillations are beyond the simple even-odd nature,
likely due to unpaired p orbitals and the corresponding nontrival band filling.
Our findings clearly demonstrate that electronic contribution is quite critical
to the stability of freestanding wires, and this stability may be important
even when wires are deposited on substrates or strained. This study sheds light
on the underlying formation mechanism of metal atom wires.
