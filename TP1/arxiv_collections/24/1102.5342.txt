In an external magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the layers, the
quasi two-dimensional frustrated antiferromagnet Cs_2CuCl_4 exhibits a
magnetically ordered "cone state" at low temperatures. In this state the
component of the magnetic moments in field direction is finite, while their
projection onto the plane of the layers forms a spiral. We present both
theoretical and experimental results for the magnetic field dependence of the
elastic constants and the ultrasonic attenuation rate in the cone state. Our
theoretical analysis is based on the usual spin-wave expansion around the
classical ground state of a Heisenberg model on an anisotropic triangular
lattice with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Magnon-phonon interactions are
modeled by expanding the exchange interactions up to second order in powers of
the phonon coordinates. As long as the external magnetic field is not too close
to the critical field where the cone state becomes unstable, we obtain
reasonable agreement between theory and experiment, suggesting that at least in
this regime magnons behave as well-defined quasiparticles. We also show that
the assumption of well-defined magnons implies that at long wavelengths the
ultrasonic attenuation rate in the cone state of Cs_2CuCl_4 is proportional to
the fourth power of the phonon momentum.
