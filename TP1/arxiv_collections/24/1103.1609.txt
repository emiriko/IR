The analytical solution of the task of the interaction of quantized EM-field
with multichain quasionedimensional axially symmetric qubit system by taking
into account both the intrachain and interchain qubit coupling has been
obtained for the first time. The appearance of additional lines in optical
spectra of quasionedimensional systems strongly interacting with EM-field is
predicted. They are result of nonstationary registration conditions, to be
consequence of Rabi wave packet formation and correspond to Fourier
transformation of revival part of Rabi wave packets in temporal dependence of
the integral inversion. It is argued the applicability of
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-model of organic conductors for perfect
quasionedimensional carbon zigzag shaped nanotubes to be consequence of 2D-1D
transition with diameter decrease.
