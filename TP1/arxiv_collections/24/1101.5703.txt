We investigate the quantum Hall effect in graphene. We argue that in graphene
in presence of an external magnetic field there is dynamical generation of mass
by a rearrangement of the Dirac sea. We show that the mechanism breaks the
lattice valley degeneracy only for the $n=0$ Landau levels and leads to the new
observed $\nu = \pm 1$ quantum Hall plateaus. We suggest that our result can be
tested by means of numerical simulations of planar Quantum Electro Dynamics
with dynamical fermions in an external magnetic fields on the lattice.
