We develop methods for accelerating metric similarity search that are
effective on modern hardware. Our algorithms factor into easily parallelizable
components, making them simple to deploy and efficient on multicore CPUs and
GPUs. Despite the simple structure of our algorithms, their search performance
is provably sublinear in the size of the database, with a factor dependent only
on its intrinsic dimensionality. We demonstrate that our methods provide
substantial speedups on a range of datasets and hardware platforms. In
particular, we present results on a 48-core server machine, on graphics
hardware, and on a multicore desktop.
