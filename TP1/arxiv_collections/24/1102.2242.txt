In this paper we present our system design and methodology for making
absolute quantum efficiency (QE) measurements through the vacuum ultraviolet
(VUV) and verify the system with delta-doped silicon CCDs. Delta-doped
detectors provide an excellent platform to validate measurements through the
VUV due to their enhanced UV response. The requirements for measuring QE
through the VUV are more strenuous than measurements in the near UV and
necessitate, among other things, the use of a vacuum monochromator, good dewar
chamber vacuum to prevent on-chip condensation, and more stringent handling
requirements.
