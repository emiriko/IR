Along the recently trodden path of studying certain number theoretic
properties of gauge theories, especially supersymmetric theories whose vacuum
manifolds are non-trivial, we investigate Ihara's Graph Zeta Function for large
classes of quiver theories and periodic tilings by bi-partite graphs. In
particular, we examine issues such as the spectra of the adjacency and whether
the gauge theory satisfies the strong and weak versions of the graph
theoretical analogue of the Riemann Hypothesis.
