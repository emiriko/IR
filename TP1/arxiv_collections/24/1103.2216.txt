We have fabricated and characterized a n-doped InSb Faraday isolator in the
mid-IR range (9.2 $\mu$m). A high isolation ratio of $\approx$30 dB with a
transmission over 80% (polarizer losses not included) is obtained at room
temperature. Further possible improvements are discussed. A similar design can
be used to cover a wide wavelength range (lambda ~ 7.5-30 $\mu$m).
