The paper contains a combinatorial theorem (the sequence of Newton polygons
of a reccurent sequence of polynomials is quasi-linear) and two applications of
it in classical and quantum topology, namely in the behavior of the
$A$-polynomial and a fixed quantum invariant (such as the Jones polynomial)
under filling. Our combinatorial theorem, which complements results of
Calegari-Walker \cite{CW} and the author \cite{Ga4}, occupies the bulk of the
paper and its proof requires the Lech-Mahler-Skolem theorem of $p$-adic
analytic number theory combined with basic principles in polyhedral and
tropical geometry.
