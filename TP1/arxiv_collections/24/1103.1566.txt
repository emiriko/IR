We discuss an experiment underway at Imperial College London to measure the
permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron using a molecular beam
of YbF. We describe the measurement method, which uses a combination of laser
and radiofrequency resonance techniques to detect the spin precession of the
YbF molecule in a strong electric field. We pay particular attention to the
analysis scheme and explore some of the possible systematic effects which might
mimic the EDM signal. Finally, we describe technical improvements which should
increase the sensitivity by more than an order of magnitude over the current
experimental limit.
