We study the influence of Unruh effect on quantum non-zero sum games. In
particular, we investigate the quantum Prisoners' Dilemma both for entangled
and unentangled initial states and show that the acceleration of the
noninertial frames disturbs the symmetry of the game. It is shown that for
maximally entangled initial state, the classical strategy C (cooperation)
becomes the dominant strategy. Our investigation shows that any quantum
strategy does no better for any player against the classical strategies. The
miracle move of Eisert et al (1999 Phys. Rev. Lett. 83 3077) is no more a
superior move. We show that the dilemma like situation is resolved in favor of
one player or the other.
