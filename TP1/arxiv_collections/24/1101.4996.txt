Marginal Fermi-liquid physics near optimal doping in high T_{c} cuprates has
been explained within two competing scenarios such as the spin-fluctuation
theory based on an itinerant picture and the slave-particle approach based on a
localized picture. In this study we propose an alternative scenario for the
anomalous transport within the context of the slave-particle approach. Although
the marginal Fermi-liquid phenomenology was interpreted previously within
deconfinement of the compact gauge theory, referred to as the strange metal
phase, we start from confinement, introducing the Polyakov-loop parameter into
an SU(2) gauge theory formulation of the t-J model. The Polyakov-loop parameter
gives rise to incoherent electrons through the confinement of spinons and
holons, which result from huge imaginary parts of self-energy corrections for
spinons and holons. This confinement scenario serves a novel mechanism for the
marginal Fermi-liquid transport in the respect that the scattering source has
nothing to do with symmetry breaking. Furthermore, the incoherent Fermi-liquid
state evolves into the Fermi liquid phase through crossover instead of an
artificial second-order transition as temperature is lowered, where the
crossover phenomenon does not result from the Anderson-Higgs mechanism but
originate from an energy scale in the holon sector. We fit an experimental data
for the electrical resistivity around the optimal doping and find a reasonable
match between our theory and the experiment.
