We give a Littlewood-Richardson type rule for expanding the product of a
row-strict quasisymmetric Schur function and a symmetric Schur function in
terms of row-strict quasisymmetric Schur functions. This expansion follows from
several new properties of an insertion algorithm defined by Mason and Remmel
(2010) which inserts a positive integer into a row-strict composition tableau.
