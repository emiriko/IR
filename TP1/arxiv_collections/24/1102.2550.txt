In this paper we give two explicit relations among 1-cycles modulo rational
equivalence on a smooth cubic hypersurfaces $X$. Such a relation is given in
terms of a (pair of) curve(s) and its secant lines. As the first application,
we reprove Paranjape's theorem that $\mathrm{CH}_1(X)$ is always generated by
lines and that it is isomorphic to $\Z$ if the dimension of $X$ is at least 5.
Another application is to the intermediate jacobian of a cubic threefold $X$.
To be more precise, we show that the intermediate jacobian of $X$ is naturally
isomorphic to the Prym-Tjurin variety constructed from the curve parameterizing
all lines meeting a given curve on $X$. The incidence correspondences play an
important role in this study. We also give a description of the Abel-Jacobi map
for 1-cycles in this setting.
