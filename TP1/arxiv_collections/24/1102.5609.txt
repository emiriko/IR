We introduce a novel bridge between the familiar gauge field theory
approaches used in many areas of modern physics such as quantum field theory
and the SLOCC protocols familiar in quantum information. Although the
mathematical methods are the same the meaning of the gauge group will be
different. The measure we introduce, `twist', is constructed as a Wilson loop
from a correlation induced holonomy. The measure can be understood as the
global asymmetry of the bipartite correlations in a loop of three or more
qubits; if the holonomy is trivial (the identity matrix), the bipartite
correlations can be globally untwisted using general local qubit operations,
the gauge group of our theory, which turns out to be the group of Lorentz
transformations familiar from special relativity. If it is not possible to
globally untwist the bipartite correlations in a state globally using local
operations, the twistedness is given by a non-trivial element of the Lorentz
group, the correlation induced holonomy. We provide several analytical examples
of twisted and untwisted states for three qubits, the most elementary
non-trivial loop one can imagine.
