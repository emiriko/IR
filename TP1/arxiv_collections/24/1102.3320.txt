We present a theory for the low-temperature properties of a resonantly
interacting Fermi mixture in a trap, that goes beyond the local-density
approximation. The theory corresponds essentially to a Landau-Ginzburg-like
approach that includes self-energy effects to account for the strong
interactions at unitarity. We show diagrammatically how these self-energy
effects arise from fluctuations in the superfluid order parameter. Gradient
terms of the order parameter are included to account for inhomogeneities. This
approach incorporates the state-of-the-art knowledge of the homogeneous mixture
with a population imbalance exactly and gives good agreement with the
experimental density profiles of Shin et al. [Nature 451, 689 (2008)]. This
allows us to calculate the universal surface tension of the interface between
the equal-density superfluid and the partially polarized normal state of the
mixture. We also discuss the possibility of a metastable state to explain the
deformation of the superfluid core that is seen in the experiment of Partridge
et al. [Science 311, 503 (2006)].
