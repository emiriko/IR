We study the power of classical and quantum algorithms equipped with
nonuniform advice, in the form of a coin whose bias encodes useful information.
This question takes on particular importance in the quantum case, due to a
surprising result that we prove: a quantum finite automaton with just two
states can be sensitive to arbitrarily small changes in a coin's bias. This
contrasts with classical probabilistic finite automata, whose sensitivity to
changes in a coin's bias is bounded by a classic 1970 result of Hellman and
Cover. Despite this finding, we are able to bound the power of advice coins for
space-bounded classical and quantum computation. We define the classes
BPPSPACE/coin and BQPSPACE/coin, of languages decidable by classical and
quantum polynomial-space machines with advice coins. Our main theorem is that
both classes coincide with PSPACE/poly. Proving this result turns out to
require substantial machinery. We use an algorithm due to Neff for finding
roots of polynomials in NC; a result from algebraic geometry that lower-bounds
the separation of a polynomial's roots; and a result on fixed-points of
superoperators due to Aaronson and Watrous, originally proved in the context of
quantum computing with closed timelike curves.
