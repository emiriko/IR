During the first 3 years of operation the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector onboard
the AGILE satellite detected several blazars in a high gamma-ray activity: 3C
279, 3C 454.3, PKS 1510-089, S5 0716+714, 3C 273, W Comae, Mrk 421, PKS
0537-441 and 4C +21.35. Thanks to the rapid dissemination of our alerts, we
were able to obtain multiwavelength data from other observatories such as
Spitzer, Swift, RXTE, Suzaku, INTEGRAL, MAGIC, VERITAS, and ARGO as well as
radio-to-optical coverage by means of the GASP Project of the WEBT and the REM
Telescope. This large multifrequency coverage gave us the opportunity to study
the variability correlations between the emission at different frequencies and
to obtain simultaneous spectral energy distributions of these sources from
radio to gamma-ray energy bands, investigating the different mechanisms
responsible for their emission and uncovering in some cases a more complex
behaviour with respect to the standard models. We present a review of the most
interesting AGILE results on these gamma-ray blazars and their multifrequency
data.
