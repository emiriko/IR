We discuss the concept of an all-optical and ionizing matter-wave
interferometer in the time domain. The proposed setup aims at testing the wave
nature of highly massive clusters and molecules, and it will enable new
precision experiments with a broad class of atoms, using the same laser system.
The propagating particles are illuminated by three pulses of a standing
ultraviolet laser beam, which detaches an electron via efficient single
photon-absorption. Optical gratings may have periods as small as 80 nm, leading
to wide diffraction angles for cold atoms and to compact setups even for very
massive clusters. Accounting for the coherent and the incoherent parts of the
particle-light interaction, we show that the combined effect of phase and
amplitude modulation of the matter waves gives rise to a Talbot-Lau-like
interference effect with a characteristic dependence on the pulse delay time.
