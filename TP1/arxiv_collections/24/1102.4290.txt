We use the finite-entanglement scaling of infinite matrix product states
(iMPS) to explore supposedly infinite order transitions. This universal method
may have lower computational costs than finite-size scaling. To this end, we
study possible MPS-based algorithms to find the ground states of the transverse
axial next-nearest-neighbor Ising (ANNNI) model in a spin chain with first and
second neighbor interactions and frustration. The ground state has four
distinct phases with transitions of second order and one of supposedly infinite
order, the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. To explore phase transitions in the
model, we study general quantities such as the correlation length, entanglement
entropy and the second derivative of the energy with respect to the external
field, and test the finite-entanglement scaling. We propose a scaling ansatz
for the correlation length of a non-critical system in order to explore
infinite order transitions. This method provides considerably less
computational costs compared to the finite-size scaling method in [8], and
quantities obtained by applying fixed boundary conditions (such as domain wall
energy in [8]) are omitted. The results show good agreement with previous
studies of finite-size scaling using DMRG.
