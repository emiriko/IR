The focus of the iWIGP workshop is the interrelation between interactions,
games and protocols. How does computer science deal with nondeterministic
interactions where the actions a system takes are not (completely) determined
by the interactions the system is involved in? In computer science,
nondeterministic interactions are usually described by protocols. However,
these interactions can also be viewed as games. As to be expected, games have
become an increasingly important modeling tool wherever nondeterministic
interactions are involved -- from foundations in game semantics and reactive
systems to applications in communication protocols and electronic business
applications. The goal of this workshop has been to bring researchers from
industry and academia together and to explore how a better understanding of the
interrelation between interactions, games and protocols leads to
better-designed and more reliable nondeterministic interacting systems.
  iWIGP 2011 was collocated with ETAPS 2011 in Saarbruecken, Germany. The
programme consisted of three invited talks, by Kim Larsen, Marielle Stoelinga
and Viktor Kuncak, and five refereed papers, selected by a strong programme
committee of international reputation. The refereed papers are contained in
this volume.
