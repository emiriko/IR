Black hole perturbation theory is typically studied on time surfaces that
extend between the bifurcation sphere and spatial infinity. From a physical
point of view, however, it may be favorable to employ time surfaces that extend
between the future event horizon and future null infinity. This framework
resolves problems regarding the representation of quasinormal mode
eigenfunctions and the construction of short-ranged potentials for the
perturbation equations in frequency domain.
