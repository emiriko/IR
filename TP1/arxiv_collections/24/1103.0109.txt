We present the direct measurements of electric-dipole moments for
$5P_{3/2}\to nD_{5/2}$ transitions with $20<n<48$ for Rubidium atoms. The
measurements were performed in an ultracold sample via observation of the
Autler-Townes splitting in a three-level ladder scheme, commonly used for
2-photon excitation of Rydberg states. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first systematic measurement of the electric dipole moments for transitions
from low excited states of rubidium to Rydberg states. Due to its simplicity
and versatility, this method can be easily extended to other transitions and
other atomic species with little constraints. Good agreement of the
experimental results with theory proves the reliability of the measurement
method.
