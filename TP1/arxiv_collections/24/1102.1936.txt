We present field-swept 75As Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements in
the spin-density wave (SDW) state of Ba(Fe1-xNix)2As2 for x=0.0072. The large
single crystals were aligned with the external field H0 perpendicular to the c
axis. The spectra are increasingly broadened as a function of doping, and are
well fit by a model of a commensurate SDW with local impurities.
