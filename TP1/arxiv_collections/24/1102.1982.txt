We introduce a family of two-dimensional lattice models of quasicrystals,
using a range of square hard cores together with a soft interaction based on an
aperiodic tiling set. Along a low temperature isotherm we find, by Monte Carlo
simulation, a first order phase transition between disordered and
quasicrystalline phases.
