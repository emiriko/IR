We consider a dynamical system consisting of subsystems indexed by a lattice.
Each subsystem has one conserved degree of freedom ("energy") the rest being
uniformly hyperbolic. The subsystems are weakly coupled together so that the
sum of the subsystem energies remains conserved. We prove that the subsystem
energies satisfy the diffusion equation in a suitable scaling limit.
