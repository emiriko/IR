Conformal invisibility devices are only supposed to work within the validity
range of geometrical optics. Here we show by numerical simulations and
analytical arguments that for certain quantized frequencies they are nearly
perfect even in a regime that clearly violates geometrical optics. The
quantization condition follows from the analogy between the Helmholtz equation
and the stationary Schrodinger equation.
