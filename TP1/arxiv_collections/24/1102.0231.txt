We report electromagnetically induced transparency using quantized fields in
optomechanical systems. The weak probe field is a narrow band squeezed field.
We present a homodyne detection of EIT in the output quantum field. We find
that the EIT dip exists even though the photon number in the squeezed vacuum is
at the single photon level. The EIT with quantized fields can be seen even at
temperatures of the order of 100 mK paving the way for using optomechanical
systems as memory elements.
