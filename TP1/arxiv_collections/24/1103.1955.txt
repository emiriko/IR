To discuss Kondo effects of a magnetic ion vibrating in the sea of conduction
electrons, a generalized Anderson model is derived. The model includes a new
channel of hybridization associated with phonon emission or absorption. In the
simplest case of the localized electron orbital with the s-wave symmetry,
hybridization with p-waves becomes possible. Interesting interplay among the
conventional s-wave Kondo effect and the p-wave one and the Yu-Anderson type
Kondo effect is found and the ground state phase diagram is determined by using
the numerical renormalization group method. Two different types of stable fixed
points are identified and the two-channel Kondo fixed points are generically
realized on the boundary.
