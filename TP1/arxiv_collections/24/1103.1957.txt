The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) contains the nearest large extragalactic
population of planetary nebulae (PNe). A shallow viewing angle and low
interstellar reddening towards the LMC potentially means a larger, more
complete flux-limited population can be assembled than for any other galaxy.
These advantages appear to be reflected by the small gap between the catalogued
($\sim$700 PNe) and estimated ($1000\pm250$ PNe) population size. With more
detailed multi-wavelength studies the catalogued number of LMC PNe may fall,
potentially widening this gap. We demonstrate here that the gap can be further
bridged with improved optical and near-infrared imaging surveys. We present
three [O III]-selected PNe discovered from ESO WFI observations of the 30
Doradus region and one serendipitous discovery from near-infrared Vista
Magellanic Cloud (VMC) survey observations. The WFI PNe have resolved [O III]
and H$\alpha$ nebulae that verify their PN nature and their [O III] fluxes
place them 6--7 mag ($m_{5007}=20$--21 mag) fainter than the bright-end of the
planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF). Their faintness, small angular
size and surrounding complex emission-line background explains why previous
H$\alpha$ surveys of the region did not select them. We estimate there may be
as many as 50--75 similar PNe awaiting discovery in the central $5\times5$
degrees of the LMC. The VMC survey routinely detects PNe as red resolved
nebulae that may allow some of this expected population to be recovered without
traditional narrow-band imaging surveys. We demonstrate this potential with the
first new VMC-selected PN which has a rare Wolf-Rayet [WC9]--[WC11] central
star.
