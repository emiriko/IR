Strain induced band gap deformations of hydrogenated/fluorinated graphene and
hexagonal BN sheet have been investigated using first principles density
functional calculations. Within harmonic approximation, the deformation is
found to be higher for hydrogenated systems than for the fluorinated systems.
Interestingly, our calculated band gap deformation for hydrogenated/fluorinated
graphene and BN sheets are positive, while those for pristine graphene and BN
sheet are found to be negative. This is due to the strong overlap between
nearest neighbor {\pi} orbitals in the pristine sheets, that is absent in the
passivated systems. We also estimate the intrinsic strength of these materials
under harmonic uniaxial strain, and find that the in-plane stiffness of
fluorinated and hydrogenated graphene are close, but larger in magnitude as
compared to those of fluorinated and hydrogenated BN sheet.
