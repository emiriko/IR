Calculating the distribution of jet masses in high-energy collisions is
challenging because fixed-order perturbation theory breaks down near the peak
region, and because multiple scales complicate the resummation. To avoid using
a jet veto, one can consider inclusive observables, in which every particle is
in a jet. We demonstrate that calculating the mass of the hardest jet in
multijet events can be problematic, and we give an example of an inclusive
observable, asymmetric thrust, which can be resummed to next-to-next-to-leading
logarithmic accuracy. Exclusive observables with out-of-jet regions are more
complicated. Even for e+e- dijet events at energy Q, to calculate the mass m of
jets of size R, one must impose a veto on the energy omega of extra jets to
force dijet kinematics; then there are both log m/Q and log m/omega
singularities. To proceed, we suggest a refactorization of the soft function in
the small R limit. To justify this refactorization, we show that the expansion
of the resummed distribution is in excellent agreement with fixed order. This
motivates considering the expansion around small R as a useful handle on
producing phenomenologically useful resummed jet mass distributions. The strong
evidence we give for refactorization at small R is independent of non-global
logarithms, which are not the subject of this paper.
