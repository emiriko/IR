We study the effect of electron-electron interactions on the charge and spin
structures of a Quantum Hall strip in a triangularly confined potential. We
find that the strip undergoes a spin-unpolarized to spin-polarized transition
as a function of magnetic field perpendicular to the strip. For sharp
confinements the spin-polarization transition is spontaneous and first develops
at the softer side of the triangular potential which shows up as an
"eye-structure" in the electron dispersion. For sufficiently weak confinements
this spin-polarization transition is preceded by a charge reconstruction of a
single spin species, which creates a spin-polarized strip of electrons with a
width of the order of the magnetic length detached from the rest of the system.
Relevance of our findings to the recent momentum resolved tunneling experiments
is also discussed.
