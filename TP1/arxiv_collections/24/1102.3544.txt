The formalism of solid state physics has been applied to provide an
additional tool for the research of cosmological problems. It is demonstrated
how this new approach could be useful in the analysis of the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) data. After a transformation of the anisotropy spectrum of
relict radiation into a special two-fold reciprocal space it was possible to
propose a simple and general description of the interaction of relict photons
with the matter by a "relict radiation factor". This factor enabled us to
process the transformed CMB anisotropy spectrum by a Fourier transform and thus
arrive to a radial electron density distribution function (RDF) in a reciprocal
space. As a consequence it was possible to estimate distances between Objects
of the order ~100 [m] and the density of the ordinary matter ~1E-22 [kg.m-3].
Another analysis based on a direct calculation of the CMB radiation spectrum
after its transformation into a simple reciprocal space and combined with
appropriate structure modeling confirmed the cluster structure. The internal
structure of Objects may be formed by Clusters distant 12 [cm], whereas the
internal structure of a Cluster consisted of particles distant ~0.3 [nm]. This
work points unequivocally to clustering processes and to a cluster-like
structure of the matter and thus contributes to the understanding of the
structure of density fluctuations. Simultaneously it sheds more light on the
structure of the universe in the moment when the universe became transparent
for photons. Clustering may be at the same time a new physical effect which has
not been taken fully into consideration in the past. On the basis of our
quantitative considerations it was possible to estimate the number of particles
(protons, helium nuclei, electrons and other particles) in Objects and Clusters
and the number of Clusters in an Object.
