In this paper, we extend the diversity and multiplexing tradeoff (DMT)
analysis from point-to-point channels to cellular systems to evaluate the
impact of inter-cell interference on the system reliability and efficiency.
Fundamental tradeoff among diversity order, multiplexing gain and inter-cell
interference intensity is characterized to reveal the capability of multiple
antennas in cellular systems. And the detrimental effects of the inter-cell
interference on the system performance of diversity and multiplexing is
presented and analyzed.
