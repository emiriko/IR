The origin of the similary-sized binary asteroid (90) Antiope remains an
unsolved puzzle. To constrain the origin of this unique double system, we
recorded individual spectra of the components using SPIFFI, a near-infrared
integral field spectrograph fed by SINFONI, an adaptive optics module available
on VLT-UT4. Using our previously published orbital model, we requested
telescope time when the separation of the components of (90) Antiope was larger
than 0.087", to minimize the contamination between components, during the
February 2009 opposition. Several multi-spectral data-cubes in J band (SNR=40)
and H+K band (SNR=100) were recorded in three epochs and revealed the two
components of (90) Antiope. After developing a specific photometric extraction
method and running an error analysis by Monte-Carlo simulations, we
successfully extracted reliable spectra of both components from 1.1 to 2.4 um
taken on the night of February 21, 2009. These spectra do not display any
significant absorption features due to mafic mineral, ices, or organics, and
their slopes are in agreement with both components being C- or Cb- type
asteroids. Their constant flux ratio indicates that both components' surface
reflectances are quite similar, with a 1-sigma variation of 7%. By comparison
with 2MASS J, H, K color distribution of observed Themis family members, we
conclude that both bodies were most likely formed at the same time and from the
same material. The similarly-sized system could indeed be the result of the
breakup of a rubble-pile proto-Antiope into two equal-sized bodies, but other
scenarios of formation implying a common origin should also be considered.
