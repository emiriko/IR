We present a parallel algorithm for solving backward stochastic differential
equations (BSDEs in short) which are very useful theoretic tools to deal with
many financial problems ranging from option pricing option to risk management.
Our algorithm based on Gobet and Labart (2010) exploits the link between BSDEs
and non linear partial differential equations (PDEs in short) and hence enables
to solve high dimensional non linear PDEs. In this work, we apply it to the
pricing and hedging of American options in high dimensional local volatility
models, which remains very computationally demanding. We have tested our
algorithm up to dimension 10 on a cluster of 512 CPUs and we obtained linear
speedups which proves the scalability of our implementation
