Scalar perturbation represented by the Klein-Gordon field equation of the
system of black holes in 2+1 dimensional Static charged dilaton gravity
proposed by Chan and Mann is investigated analytically. The radial equation is
analyzed near horizon and at the asymptotic region to show the absence of
superradiance instability.
