A method is described which allows to evaluate efficiently a polynomial in a
(possibly trivial) extension of the finite field of its coefficients. Its
complexity is shown to be lower than that of standard techniques when the
degree of the polynomial is large with respect to the base field. Applications
to the syndrome computation in the decoding of cyclic codes, Reed-Solomon codes
in particular, are highlighted.
