This paper proposes a new distance metric between clusterings that
incorporates information about the spatial distribution of points and clusters.
Our approach builds on the idea of a Hilbert space-based representation of
clusters as a combination of the representations of their constituent points.
We use this representation and the underlying metric to design a
spatially-aware consensus clustering procedure. This consensus procedure is
implemented via a novel reduction to Euclidean clustering, and is both simple
and efficient. All of our results apply to both soft and hard clusterings. We
accompany these algorithms with a detailed experimental evaluation that
demonstrates the efficiency and quality of our techniques.
