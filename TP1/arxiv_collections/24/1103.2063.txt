The first part of the article describes our approach for solution of this
problem by means of Augmented Reality. The merging of the real world model and
digital objects allows streamline the work with the model and speed up the
whole production phase significantly. The main advantage of augmented reality
is the possibility of direct manipulation with the scene using a portable
digital camera. Also adding digital objects into the scene could be done using
identification markers placed on the surface of the model. Therefore it is not
necessary to work with special input devices and lose the contact with the real
world model. Adjustments are done directly on the model. The key problem of
outlined solution is the ability of identification of an object within the
camera picture and its replacement with the digital object. The second part of
the article is focused especially on the identification of exact position and
orientation of the marker within the picture. The identification marker is
generalized into the triple of points which represents a general plane in
space. There is discussed the space identification of these points and the
description of representation of their position and orientation be means of
transformation matrix. This matrix is used for rendering of the graphical
objects (e. g. in OpenGL and Direct3D).
