Fiji National University is encountering many difficulties with its current
administrative systems. These difficulties include accessibility, scalability,
performance, flexibility and integration. We propose a new campus information
system, FNU-CIS to addresses these difficulties. FNU-CIS has the potential to
provide wide range of the services for students and staffs at the university.
In order to assist in the design and implementation of proposed FNU-CIS, we
present an overview, software architecture and prototype implementation of our
proposed system. We discuss the key properties of our system, compare it with
other similar systems available and outline our future plans for research in
FNU-CIS implementation.
