The dynamics of an interface in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate
driven by a spatially uniform time-dependent force is studied. Starting from
the Gross-Pitaevskii Lagrangian, the dispersion relation for linear waves and
instabilities at the interface is derived by means of a variational approach. A
number of diverse dynamical effects for different types of the driving force is
demonstrated, which includes the Rayleigh-Taylor instability for a constant
force, the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability for a pulse force, dynamic
stabilization of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability and onset of the parametric
instability for an oscillating force. Gaussian Markovian and non-Markovian
stochastic forces are also considered. It is found that the Markovian
stochastic force does not produce any average effect on the dynamics of the
interface, while the non-Markovian force leads to exponential perturbation
growth.
