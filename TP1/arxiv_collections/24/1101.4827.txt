The question whether the invariant speed c, Planck constant h/, and
gravitational constant G can be or should be put equal to 1 is analyzed. The
discussion is based on fundamental considerations concerning the notion of
physical quantity. It is found that the issue is not a matter of appropriate
unit selection. Further it is shown that classical space-time geometry and
quantum mechanics can be formulated in such a way that the invariant speed and
the action quantum are truly one and do not have to be set equal to one.
