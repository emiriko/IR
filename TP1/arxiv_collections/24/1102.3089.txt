We generalize the popular ensemble Kalman filter to an ensemble transform
filter where the prior distribution can take the form of a Gaussian mixture or
a Gaussian kernel density estimator. The design of the filter is based on a
continuous formulation of the Bayesian filter analysis step. We call the new
filter algorithm the ensemble Gaussian mixture filter (EGMF). The EGMF is
implemented for three simple test problems (Brownian dynamics in one dimension,
Langevin dynamics in two dimensions, and the three dimensional Lorenz-63
model). It is demonstrated that the EGMF is capable to track systems with
non-Gaussian uni- and multimodal ensemble distributions.
