We report the discovery that the star V474 Car is an extremely active, high
velocity halo RS CVn system. The star was originally identified as a possible
pre-main sequence star in Carina, given its enhanced stellar activity, rapid
rotation (10.3 days), enhanced Li, and absolute magnitude that places it above
the main sequence. However, its extreme radial velocity (264 km s$^{-1}$)
suggested that this system was unlike any previously known pre-MS system. Our
detailed spectroscopic analysis of echelle spectra taken with the CTIO 4-m
finds that V474 Car is both a spectroscopic binary with orbital period similar
to the photometric rotation period, and metal poor ([Fe/H] $\simeq -$0.99). The
star's Galactic orbit is extremely eccentric (e $\simeq$ 0.93) with
perigalacticon of only $\sim$0.3 kpc of the Galactic center - and its
eccentricity and smallness of its perigalacticon are only surpassed by
$\sim$0.05%, of local F/G-type field stars. The observed characteristics are
consistent with V474 Car being a high velocity, metal poor, tidally-locked
chromospherically active binary (CAB), i.e.\ a halo RS CVn binary, and one of
only a few such specimens known.
