We study the BPS equations in ABJM theory furthermore. Besides the known
funnel solutions which are proposed to describe M2-M5 systems we find a new
kind solution. We analyze the properties therein and see that it can describe
M2-KK6 (2D membranes with 6D Kaluza-Klein monopole) systems. Our solutions also
reveal new vacua in the mass deformed ABJM theory. Contrast to the previous
investigation in which the vacua are reducible, ours may be irreducible. We
also discuss a possible interpretation of the new BPS solutions as a M2-2M5
system.
