In this paper, we compute the closed form expressions of elastody- namic
Green functions for three different viscoelastic media with simple type of
anisotropy. We follow Burridge et al. [Proc. Royal Soc. of London. 440(1910):
(1993)] to express unknown Green function in terms of three scalar functions
$\phi_i$, by using the spectral decomposition of the Christoffel tensor
associated with the medium. The problem of computing Green function is, thus
reduced to the resolution of three scalar wave equations satisfied by $\phi_i$,
and subsequent equations with $\phi_i$ as source terms. To describe viscosity
effects, we choose an empirical power law model which becomes well known Voigt
model for quadratic frequency losses.
