Electron transport properties of few-electron open quantum dots within the
spin-restricted Hartree-Fock approximation are studied. The self-consistent
numerical calculations were performed for a whole device, including the
semi-infinite leads, without employing any phenomenological or adjustable
parameters. Inclusion of the non-local Fock potential brings qualitatively new
physics in comparison to the Hartree approach: electron screening decreases,
resonant energy levels become less pinned to the Fermi energy and clearly
correlate with conductance peaks. When coupling between the dot and leads
decreases the number of electrons inside the dot becomes quantized and the
model predicts the Coulomb blockade of electron transport. This is confirmed by
comparison with the master equation approach for an equivalent quantum dot.
