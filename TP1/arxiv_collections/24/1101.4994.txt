Deep Inelastic Neutron Scattering provides a means of directly and accurately
measuring the momentum distribution of protons in water, which is determined
primarily by the protons ground state wavefunction. We find that in water
confined on scales of 20A, this wave function responds to the details of the
confinement, corresponds to a strongly anharmonic local potential, shows
evidence in some cases of coherent delocalization in double wells, and involves
changes in zero point kinetic energy of the protons from -40 to +120 meV
difference from that of bulk water at room temperature. This behavior appears
to be a generic feature of nanoscale confinement. It is exhibited here in 16A
inner diameter carbon nanotubes, two different hydrated proton exchange
membranes(PEMs), Nafion 1120 and Dow 858, and has been seen earlier in xerogel
and 14A diameter carbon nanotubes. The proton conductivity in the PEM samples
correlates with the degree of coherent delocalization of the proton.
