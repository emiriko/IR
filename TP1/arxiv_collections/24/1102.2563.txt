We study the system size effects in the N/Z dependence of balance energy for
the isotopic series. We find drastic effect of symmetry energy on the N/Z
dependence of E$_{bal}$ throughout the mass range. We also find that the N/Z
dependence of E$_{bal}$ for isotopic series of lighter system is slightly more
sensitive to symmetry energy as compared to that of heavier systems. We also
study the mass dependence of E$_{bal}$ for the N/Z range from 1.0-2.0. We find
that the mass dependence of E$_{bal}$ varies with the N/Z ratio.
