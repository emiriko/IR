The Supermodel provides an accurate description of the thermal contribution
by the hot intracluster plasma which is crucial for the analysis of the hard
excess. In this paper the thermal emissivity in the Coma cluster is derived
starting from the intracluster gas temperature and density profiles obtained by
the Supermodel analysis of X-ray observables: the XMM-Newton temperature
profile and the Rosat brightness distribution. The Supermodel analysis of the
BeppoSAX/PDS hard X-ray spectrum confirms our previous results, namely an
excess at the c.l. of ~4.8sigma and a nonthermal flux of 1.30+-0.40x 10^-11 erg
cm^-2 s^-1 in the energy range 20-80 keV. A recent joint XMM-Newton/Suzaku
analysis reports an upper limit of ~6x10^-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the energy range
20-80 keV for the nonthermal flux with an average gas temperature of 8.45+-0.06
keV, and an excess of nonthermal radiation at a confidence level above 4sigma,
without including systematic effects, for an average XMM-Newton temperature of
8.2 keV in the Suzaku/HXD-PIN FOV, in agreement with our earlier PDS analysis.
Here we present a further evidence of the compatibility between the Suzaku and
BeppoSAX spectra, obtained by our Supermodel analysis of the PDS data, when the
smaller size of the HXD-PIN FOV and the two different average temperatures
derived by XMM-Newton and by the joint XMM-Newton/Suzaku analysis are taken
into account. The consistency of the PDS and HXD-PIN spectra reaffirms the
presence of a nonthermal component in the hard X-ray spectrum of the Coma
cluster. The Supermodel analysis of the PDS data reports an excess at c.l.
above 4sigma also for the higher average temperature of 8.45 keV thanks to the
PDS FOV considerably greater than the HXD-PIN FOV.
