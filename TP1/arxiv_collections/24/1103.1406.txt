Three oriented bosonic dipoles are treated using the hyperspherical adiabatic
representation, providing numerical evidence that the Efimov effect persists
near a two-dipole resonance and in a system where angular momentum is not
conserved. Our results further show that the Efimov features in scattering
observables become universal, with a known three-body parameter, i.e. the
resonance energies depend only on the two-body physics, which also has
implications for the universal spectrum of the four-dipole problem. Moreover,
the Efimov states should be long-lived, which is favorable for their creation
and manipulation in ultracold dipolar gases. Finally, deeply-bound two-dipole
states are shown to be relatively stable against collisions with a third
dipole, owing to the emergence of a repulsive interaction originating in the
angular momentum nonconservation for this system.
