The problem of privately releasing data is to provide a version of a dataset
without revealing sensitive information about the individuals who contribute to
the data. The model of differential privacy allows such private release while
providing strong guarantees on the output. A basic mechanism achieves
differential privacy by adding noise to the frequency counts in the contingency
tables (or, a subset of the count data cube) derived from the dataset. However,
when the dataset is sparse in its underlying space, as is the case for most
multi-attribute relations, then the effect of adding noise is to vastly
increase the size of the published data: it implicitly creates a huge number of
dummy data points to mask the true data, making it almost impossible to work
with.
  We present techniques to overcome this roadblock and allow efficient private
release of sparse data, while maintaining the guarantees of differential
privacy. Our approach is to release a compact summary of the noisy data.
Generating the noisy data and then summarizing it would still be very costly,
so we show how to shortcut this step, and instead directly generate the summary
from the input data, without materializing the vast intermediate noisy data. We
instantiate this outline for a variety of sampling and filtering methods, and
show how to use the resulting summary for approximate, private, query
answering. Our experimental study shows that this is an effective, practical
solution, with comparable and occasionally improved utility over the costly
materialization approach.
