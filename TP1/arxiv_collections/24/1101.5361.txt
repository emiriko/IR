We study under which conditions it is possible to assert that a joint
demolition measurement cannot be simulated by Local Operations and Classical
Communication. More concretely, we consider a scenario where two parties, Alice
and Bob, send each an unknown state to a third party, Charlie, who in turn
interacts with the states in some undisclosed way and then announces an
outcome. We show that, under the assumption that Alice and Bob know the
dimensionality of their systems, there exist situations where the statistics of
the outcomes reveals the nature of Charlie's measurement.
