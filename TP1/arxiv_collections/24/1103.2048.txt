We present the results of a Bayesian analysis of a Regge model for K+ Lambda
photoproduction. The model is based on the exchange of K+(494) and K*+(892)
trajectories in the t-channel. For different prior widths, we find decisive
Bayesian evidence (\Delta ln Z ~ 24) for a K+ Lambda photoproduction Regge
model with a positive vector coupling and a negative tensor coupling constant
for the K+(892) trajectory, and a rotating phase factor for both trajectories.
Using the chi^2 minimization method, one could not draw this conclusion from
the same dataset.
