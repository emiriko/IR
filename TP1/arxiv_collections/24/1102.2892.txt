We study quenched disorder in strongly correlated systems via holography,
focusing on the thermodynamic effects of mild electric disorder. Disorder is
introduced through a random potential which is assumed to self-average on
macroscopic scales. Studying the flow of this distribution with energy scale
leads us to develop a holographic functional renormalization scheme. We test
this scheme by computing thermodynamic quantities and confirming that the
Harris criterion for relevance, irrelevance or marginality of quenched disorder
holds.
