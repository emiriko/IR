In this work we explore the effects of human mobility on the dispersion of a
vector borne disease. We combine an already presented stochastic model for
dengue with a simple representation of the daily motion of humans on a
schematic city of 20x20 blocks with 100 inhabitants in each block. The pattern
of motion of the individuals is described in terms of complex networks in which
links connect different blocks and the link length distribution is in
accordance with recent findings on human mobility. It is shown that human
mobility can turn out to be the main driving force of the disease dispersal.
