Homogeneous and isotropic cosmological models with ordinary matter and
gravity predict slower expansion and shorter distances than observed. It is
possible that this failure is due the known breakdown of homogeneity and
isotropy related to structure formation, rather than new fundamental physics.
We review this backreaction conjecture, concentrating on topics on which there
has been progress as well as open issues.
