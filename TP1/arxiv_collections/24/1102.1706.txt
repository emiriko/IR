This chapter is devoted to exact conditions in time-dependent density
functional theory. Many conditions have been derived for the exact ground-state
density functional, and several have played crucial roles in the construction
of popular approximations. We believe that the reliability of the most
fundamental approximation of any density functional theory, the local density
approximation (LDA), is due to the exact conditions that it satisfies. Improved
approximations should satisfy at least those conditions that LDA satisfies,
plus others. (Which others is part of the art of functional approximation). In
the time-dependent case, as we shall see, the adiabatic LDA (ALDA) plays the
same role as LDA in the ground-state case, as it satisfies many exact
conditions. But we do not have a generally applicable improvement beyond ALDA
that includes nonlocality in time. For TDDFT, we have a surfeit of exact
conditions, but that only makes finding those that are useful to impose an even
more demanding task.
