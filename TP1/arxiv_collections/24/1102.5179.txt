It has been shown that the evolution of collectivity in ultra-relativistic
heavy ion collision is manifested in the variation of various HBT radii with
invariant mass ($M$) extracted from the correlation functions of two lepton
pairs. The value of the radial velocity ($v_r$) can be estimated from the ratio
of the $p_T$ distributions of single photons to lepton pairs for various $M$
windows. It has been argued that the variation of radial flow with appropriate
kinematic variables can be used as an indicator of a phase transition from
initially produced partons to hadrons. We also consider the elliptic flow
($v_2^{HF}$) of the matter as probed by the single electron spectra originating
from the semileptonic decays of heavy mesons. The measured values of $v_2^{HF}$
and the nuclear suppression factor ($R_{\mathrm AA}$) at RHIC energy have been
reproduced simultaneously by including both the collisional and radiative
processes within the scope of perturbative quantum chromodynamics. The
$R_{\mathrm AA}$ and $v_2^{HF}$ have been predicted for LHC energy.
