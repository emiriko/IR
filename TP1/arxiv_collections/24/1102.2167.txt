Point contacts between high anisotropy ferromagnetic SmCo5 and normal metal
Cu are used to achieve a strong spin-population inversion in the contact core.
Subjected to microwave irradiation in resonance with the Zeeman splitting in
Cu, the inverted spin-population relaxes through stimulated spin-flip photon
emission, detected as peaks in the point contact resistance. Resonant spin-flip
photon absorption is detected as resistance minima, corresponding to sourcing
the photon field energy into the electrical circuit. These results demonstrate
fundamental mechanisms that are potentially useful for designing metallic
spin-based lasers.
