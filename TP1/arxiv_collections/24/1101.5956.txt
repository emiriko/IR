A major controversy has arisen in QCD as to how to split the total angular
momentum into separate quark and gluon contributions, and as to whether the
gluon angular momentum can itself be split, in a gauge invariant way, into a
spin and orbital part. Several authors have proposed various answers to these
questions and offered a variety of different expressions for the relevant
operators. I argue that none of these is acceptable and suggest that the
canonical expression for the momentum and angular momentum operators is the
correct and physically meaningful one. It is then an inescapable fact that the
gluon angular momentum operator cannot, in general, be split in a gauge
invariant way into a spin and orbital part. However, the projection of the
gluon spin onto its direction of motion i.e. its helicity is gauge invariant
and is measured in deep inelastic scattering on nucleons. The Ji sum rule,
relating the quark angular momentum to generalized parton distributions, though
not based on the canonical operators, is shown to be correct, if interpreted
with due care. I also draw attention to several interesting aspects of QED and
QCD, which, to the best of my knowledge, are not commented upon in the standard
textbooks on Field Theory.
