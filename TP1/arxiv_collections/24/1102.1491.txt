This is the second report of our work on the construction of directed
strongly regular graphs. In our previous work, we constructed a couple of
infinite families of new directed strongly regular graphs on the sets of
antiflags of partial geometries and group divisible designs. In this paper, we
use some collections of antiflags (not the entire set of antiflags) of tactical
configurations to construct another couple of infinite families of directed
strongly regular graphs. Our construction methods are capable of producing
many, if not all, nonisomorphic directed strongly regular graphs with same
parameters.
