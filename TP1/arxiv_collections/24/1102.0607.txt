The idea of the self-breaking of the standard model gauge symmetry is applied
to a gauge theory in a warped space. We systematically examine the gauge
couplings of bulk and brane fermions. The constraint on the masses of bulk
fermions is found under the conditions that the ordinary four-dimensional
massless gluon is not condensed and that color-triplet scalar bound states are
not formed. For bulk fermions with zero modes for the left- and right-handed
components, the mass parameters are required to be at least $c\simg 1/2$ and
$c\siml -1/2$, respectively. Then possible vacuum expectation values arise only
from weak-doublet scalar bound states which trigger electroweak symmetry
breaking.
