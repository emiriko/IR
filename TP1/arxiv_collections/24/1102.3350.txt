Orbit codes are a family of codes employable for communications on a random
linear network coding channel. The paper focuses on the classification of these
codes. We start by classifying the conjugacy classes of cyclic subgroups of the
general linear group. As a result, we are able to focus the study of cyclic
orbit codes to a restricted family of them.
