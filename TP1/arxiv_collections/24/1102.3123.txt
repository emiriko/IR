We performed kinetic simulations of diffusive shock acceleration in Type Ia
supernova remnants (SNRs) expanding into a uniform interstellar medium (ISM).
The preshock gas temperature is the primary parameter that governs the cosmic
ray (CR) acceleration, while magnetic field strength and CR injection rate are
secondary parameters. SNRs in the hot ISM, with an injection fraction smaller
than 10^{-4}, are inefficient accelerators with less than 10 % energy getting
converted to CRs. The shock structure is almost test-particle like and the
ensuing CR spectrum can be steeper than E^{-2}. Although the particles can be
accelerated to the knee energy of 10^{15.5}Z eV with amplified magnetic fields
in the precursor, Alfv'enic drift of scattering centers softens the source
spectrum as steep as E^{-2.1} and reduces the CR acceleration efficiency.
