We prove a geometric version of a classical result on the characterization of
an irreducible cuspidal automorphic representation of
$\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{A}_E)$ being the base change of a stable cuspidal packet
of the quasi-split unitary group associated to the quadratic extension $E/F$,
via the nonvanishing of certain period integrals, called being distinguished.
We show that certain cohomology of an automorphic sheaf of $\mathrm{GL}_{n,X'}$
is nonvanishing if and only if the corresponding local system $E$ on $X'$ is
conjugate self-dual with respect to an \'{e}tale double cover $X'/X$ of curves,
which directly relates to the base change from the associated unitary group. In
particular, the geometric setting makes sense for any base field.
