We describe supersymmetry breaking by the F-term of a heavy right-handed tau
neutrino with a VEV. Due to the the tau neutrino Yukawa coupling, the
neutralino, chargino and scalar mass matrices and the weak currents are
modified. In addition, there are new cubic and quartic scalar and trilinear R
parity violating interactions. For large $\tan \beta$ these effects may be
quite large. The scenario requires low energy supersymmetry breaking with
generic values of $F \sim 10^{10}$~GeV.
