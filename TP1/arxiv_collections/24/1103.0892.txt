The internal dynamics of a double quantum dot system is renormalized due to
coupling respectively with transport electrodes and a dissipative heat bath.
Their essential differences are identified unambiguously in the context of full
counting statistics. The electrode coupling caused level detuning
renormalization gives rise to a fast-to-slow transport mechanism, which is not
resolved at all in the average current, but revealed uniquely by pronounced
super-Poissonian shot noise and skewness. The heat bath coupling introduces an
interdot coupling renormalization, which results in asymmetric Fano factor and
an intriguing change of line shape in the skewness.
