The abundance of multimedia data and information is challenging educators to
effectively search, browse, access, use, and store the data for their classroom
teaching. However, many educators could still be accustomed to teaching or
searching for information using conventional methods, but often the
conventional methods may not function well with multimedia data. Educators need
to efficiently interact and manage a variety of digital media files too. The
purpose of this study is to review current multimedia database applications in
teaching and learning, and further discuss some of the issues or concerns that
educators may have while incorporating multimedia data into their classrooms.
Some strategies and recommendations are also provided in order for educators to
be able to use multimedia data more effectively in their teaching environments.
