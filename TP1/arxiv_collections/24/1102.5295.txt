The actin cytoskeleton of adherent tissue cells often condenses into filament
bundles contracted by myosin motors, so-called stress fibers, which play a
crucial role in the mechanical interaction of cells with their environment.
Stress fibers are usually attached to their environment at the endpoints, but
possibly also along their whole length. We introduce a theoretical model for
such contractile filament bundles which combines passive viscoelasticity with
active contractility. The model equations are solved analytically for two
different types of boundary conditions. A free boundary corresponds to stress
fiber contraction dynamics after laser surgery and results in good agreement
with experimental data. Imposing cyclic varying boundary forces allows us to
calculate the complex modulus of a single stress fiber.
