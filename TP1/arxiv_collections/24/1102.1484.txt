A Bose--Einstein condensate of exciton polaritons coexisting with a Fermi gas
of electrons has been recently proposed as a promising system for realisation
of room-temperature superconductivity [Phys. Rev. Lett., 104, 106402 (2010)].
In order to find the optimum conditions for exciton and exciton-polariton
mediated superconductivity, we study the attractive mechanism between electrons
of a Cooper pair mediated by the exciton and exciton-polariton condensate and
analyze the gap equation that follows. We specifically address microcavities
with embedded n-doped quantum wells as well as coupled quantum wells hosting a
condensate of spatially indirect excitons, put in contact with a
two-dimensional electron gas. We show that engineering of the interaction in
these peculiar Bose-Fermi mixtures is complex and sometimes counterintuitive,
but leaves much freedom for optimization, making promising the realization of
high-temperature superconductivity in multilayer semiconductor structures.
