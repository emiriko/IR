In this paper, a renewable, multi-use, multi-secret sharing scheme for
general access structure based on one-way collision resistant hash function is
presented in which each participant has to carry only one share. By applying
collision-resistant one-way hash function, the proposed scheme is secure
against conspiracy attacks even if the pseudo-secret shares are compromised.
Moreover, high complexity operations like modular multiplication,
exponentiation and inversion are avoided to increase its efficiency. Finally,
in the proposed scheme, both the combiner and the participants can verify the
correctness of the information exchanged among themselves.
