The coefficient of restitution of colliding viscoelastic spheres is
analytically known as a complete series expansion in terms of the impact
velocity where all (infinitely many) coefficients are known. While beeing
analytically exact, this result is not suitable for applications in efficient
event-driven Molecular Dynamics (eMD) or Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Based on
the analytic result, here we derive expressions for the coefficient of
restitution which allow for an application in efficient eMD and MC simulations
of granular Systems.
