We carry out first-principles calculations which demonstrate the importance
of the non-spin-conserving part of the spin-orbit interaction for the intrinsic
anomalous Hall conductivity of ordered FePt alloys. The impact of this
interaction is strongly reduced if Pt is replaced by the lighter isoelectronic
element Pd. An analysis of the interband transitions responsible for the
anomalous velocity reveals that spin-flip transitions occur not only at avoided
band crossings near the Fermi level, but also between well-separated pairs of
bands with similar dispersions. We also predict a strong anisotropy in the
anomalous Hall conductivity of FePt caused entirely by low-frequency spin-flip
transitions.
