Heat conduction through the Frenkel-Kontorova (FK) lattices is numerically
investigated in the presence of a deformable substrate potential. It is found
that the deformation of the substrate potential has a strong influence on heat
conduction. The thermal conductivity as a function of the shape parameter is
nonmonotonic. The deformation can enhance thermal conductivity greatly and
there exists an optimal deformable value at which thermal conductivity takes
its maximum. Remarkably, we also find that the deformation can facilitate the
appearance of the negative differential thermal resistance (NDTR).
