The magnitude distribution of three seismic sequences occurred in Morocco
were investigated by means of the Tsallis-based non-extensive analysis. The
non-extensive parameters were estimated by means of the Levenberg-Marquadt
nonlinear least square fitting method. It was found that the q value could be a
good indicator of the complexity of seismic phenomena. Such findings could
contribute in better understanding the dynamics of seismicity and suggesting a
unifying view of earthquake occurrence.
