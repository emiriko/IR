The Distributed object computing is a paradigm that allows objects to be
distributed across a heterogeneous network, and allows each of the components
to interoperate as a unified whole. A new generation of distributed
applications, such as telemedicine and e-commerce applications, are being
deployed in heterogeneous and ubiquitous computing environments. The objective
of this paper is to explore an applicability of a component based services in
ubiquitous computational environment. While the fundamental structure of
various distributed object components is similar, there are differences that
can profoundly impact an application developer or the administrator of a
distributed simulation exercise and to implement in Ubiquitous Computing
Environment.
