In the microscopic world, multipartite entanglement has been achieved with
various types of nanometer sized two-level systems such as trapped ions, atoms
and photons. On the macroscopic scale ranging from micrometers to millimeters,
recent experiments have demonstrated bipartite and tripartite entanglement for
electronic quantum circuits with superconducting Josephson junctions. It
remains challenging to bridge these largely different length scales by
constructing hybrid quantum systems. Doing this may allow for manipulating the
entanglement of individual microscopic objects separated by macroscopically
large distances in a quantum circuit. Here we report on the experimental
demonstration of induced coherent interaction between two intrinsic two-level
states (TLSs) formed by atomic-scale defects in a solid via a superconducting
phase qubit. The tunable superconducting circuit serves as a shuttle
communicating quantum information between the two microscopic TLSs. We present
a detailed comparison between experiment and theory and find excellent
agreement over a wide range of parameters. We then use the theoretical model to
study the creation and movement of entanglement between the three components of
the quantum system.
