The QED trace anomaly is calculated at one-loop level based on the loop
regularization method which is realized in 4-dimensional spacetime and
preserves gauge symmetry and Poincare symmetry in spite of the introduction of
two mass scales, namely the ultraviolet (UV) cut-off $M_c$ and infrared (IR)
cut-off $\mu_s$. It is shown that the dilation Ward identity which relates the
three-point diagrams with the vacuum polarization diagrams gets the standard
form of trace anomaly through quantum corrections in taking the consistent
limit $M_c\to \infty$ and $\mu_s = 0$ which recovers the original integrals.
This explicitly demonstrates that the loop regularization method is indeed a
self-consistent regularization scheme which is applicable to the calculations
not only for the chiral anomaly but also for the trace anomaly, at least at
one-loop level. It is also seen that the consistency conditions which relates
the tensor-type and scalar-type irreducible loop integrals (ILIs) are crucial
for obtaining a consistent result. As a comparison, we also present the
one-loop calculations by using the usual Pauli-Villars regularization and the
dimensional regularization.
