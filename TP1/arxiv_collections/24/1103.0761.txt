In the G0 experiment, performed at Jefferson Lab, the parity-violating
elastic scattering of electrons from protons and quasi-elastic scattering from
deuterons is measured in order to determine the neutral weak currents of the
nucleon. Asymmetries as small as 1 part per million in the scattering of a
polarized electron beam are determined using a dedicated apparatus. It consists
of specialized beam-monitoring and control systems, a cryogenic hydrogen (or
deuterium) target, and a superconducting, toroidal magnetic spectrometer
equipped with plastic scintillation and aerogel Cerenkov detectors, as well as
fast readout electronics for the measurement of individual events. The overall
design and performance of this experimental system is discussed.
