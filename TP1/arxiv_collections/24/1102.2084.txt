Two-particle angular correlation for charged particles emitted in Au+Au
collisions at the center-of-mass of 200 MeV measured at RHIC energies revealed
novel structures commonly referred to as a near-side ridge. The ridge
phenomenon in relativistic A+A collisions is rooted probably in the initial
conditions of the thermal evolution of the system. In this study we analyze the
evolution of the bumping transverse structure of the energy density
distribution caused by fluctuations of the initial density distributions that
could lead to the ridge structures. We suppose that at very initial stage of
collisions the typical one-event structure of the initial energy density
profile can be presented as the set of longitudinal tubes, which are
boost-invariant in some space-rapidity region and are rather thin. These tubes
have very high energy density comparing to smooth background density
distribution. The transverse velocity and energy density profiles at different
times of the evolution till the chemical freeze-out (at the temperature T=165
MeV) willbe reached by the system are calculated for sundry initial scenarios.
