Nuclear chirality has been intensively studdied for the last several years in
the context of experimental as well as theoretical approach. Characteristic
gamma selection rules have been predicted for the strong chiral symmetry
breaking limit that has been observed in Cs isotopes. The presented analysis
shows that the gamma selection rules cannot be attributed only to chiral
symmetry breaking. The selection rules relate to structural composition of the
chiral rotational bands, i.e. to odd particle configuration and the deformation
of the core.
