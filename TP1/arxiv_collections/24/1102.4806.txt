In this paper, we propose a scheme to generate tunable multi-color attosecond
coherent X-ray radiation for future light source applications. This scheme uses
an energy chirped electron beam, a laser modulators, a laser chirper and two
bunch compressors to generate a multi-spike prebunched kilo-Ampere current
electron beam from a few tens Ampere electron beam out of a linac. Such an
electron beam transports through a series of undulator radiators and bunch
compressors to generate multi-color coherent X-ray radiation. As an
illustration, we present an example to generate two attosecond pulses with
$2.2$ nm and $3$ nm coherent X-ray radiation wavelength and more than $200$ MW
peak power using a $30$ Ampere $200$ nm laser seeded electron beam.
