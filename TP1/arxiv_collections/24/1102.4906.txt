We study the inert triplet models, in which the standard model (SM) is
extended to have a new SU(2)L triplet scalar (Y=0 or 2) with an Z2 symmetry. We
show that the neutral component of the triplet can be a good dark matter
candidate. In particular, for the hypercharge Y=0 triplet model, the WMAP data
favors the region where the dark matter mass is around 5.5 TeV, which is also
consistent with the direct detection experiments. In contrast, for the Y=2
model, although dark matter with its mass around 2.8 TeV is allowed by WMAP, it
is excluded by the direct detection experiments because the spin-independent
cross section is enhanced by the Z mediated tree-level scattering process.
