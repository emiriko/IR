In this paper, we formulate an evolutionary multiple access channel game with
continuous-variable actions and coupled rate constraints. We characterize Nash
equilibria of the game and show that the pure Nash equilibria are Pareto
optimal and also resilient to deviations by coalitions of any size, i.e., they
are strong equilibria. We use the concepts of price of anarchy and strong price
of anarchy to study the performance of the system. The paper also addresses how
to select one specifc equilibrium solution using the concepts of normalized
equilibrium and evolutionary stable strategies. We examine the long-run
behavior of these strategies under several classes of evolutionary game
dynamics such as Brown-von Neumann-Nash dynamics, and replicator dynamics.
