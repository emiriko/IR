In this paper, the problem of the minimal description of the structure of a
vector function f(x) over an $N$-dimensional interval is studied. Methods
adaptively subdividing the original interval in smaller subintervals and
evaluating f(x) at only one point within each subinterval are considered. Two
partition strategies traditionally used for solving this problem are analyzed.
A new partition strategy based on an efficient technique developed for diagonal
algorithms is proposed and studied.
