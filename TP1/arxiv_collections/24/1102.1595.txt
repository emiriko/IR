We use the cubic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation coupled to a dissipative
linear equation as a model of lasers with an external frequency-selective
feedback. It is known that the feedback can stabilize the one-dimensional (1D)
self-localized mode. We aim to extend the analysis to 2D stripe-shaped and
vortex solitons. The radius of the vortices increases linearly with their
topological charge, $m$, therefore the flat-stripe soliton may be interpreted
as the vortex with $m=\infty$, while vortex solitons can be realized as stripes
bent into rings. The results for the vortex solitons are applicable to a broad
class of physical systems. There is a qualitative agreement between our results
and those recently reported for models with saturable nonlinearity.
