Arm locking is a technique that has been proposed for reducing laser
frequency fluctuations in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), a
gravitational-wave observatory sensitive in the milliHertz frequency band. Arm
locking takes advantage of the geometric stability of the triangular
constellation of three spacecraft that comprise LISA to provide a frequency
reference with a stability in the LISA measurement band that exceeds that
available from a standard reference such as an optical cavity or molecular
absorption line. We have implemented a time-domain simulation of arm locking
including the expected limiting noise sources (shot noise, clock noise,
spacecraft jitter noise, and residual laser frequency noise). The effect of
imperfect a priori knowledge of the LISA heterodyne frequencies and the
associated 'pulling' of an arm locked laser is included. We find that our
implementation meets requirements both on the noise and dynamic range of the
laser frequency.
