The nature of electrostatic interactions involving polyanions modulate the
properties of both synthetic and biological macromolecules. Although intensely
studied for decades the interplay of many length scales has prevented a
complete resolution of some of the basic questions such as how the
electrostatic persistence length ($l_e$) varies with ionic strength ($I$). In
this review we describe certain characteristics of polyelectrolytes (PAs) and
polyampholytes (PAs), which are polymers whose monomers have a random
distribution of opposite charges. After reviewing the current theoretical
understanding of the dependence of $l_e$ on $I$ we present experimental data
that conform to two distinct behavior. For RNA and DNA it is found that that
$l_e \sim I^{-1}$ whereas for some proteins and other polyelectrolytes $l_e
\sim i^{-1/2}$. A scaling type theory, which delineates charge correlation and
pure polyelectrolyte effects for the shape of PAs that is valid over a wide
range of salt concentration is described. We also use theory and simulations to
argue that the distinct stages in the kinetics of collapse of PAs (with a net
charge that is small enough to induce globule formation) and PEs (relevant for
RNA folding) are similar. In both cases the major initial conformation change
involves formation of metastable pearl-necklace structures. In the coarsening
process large clusters (pearls) grow at the expense of smaller ones by a
process that is reminiscent of Lifshitz-Slyozov mechanism. Finally, recent
theories and single molecule experiments on stretching of single stranded DNA
and PEs further sheds insights into the complex behavior of charged
macromolecules. The survey, which is limited to very few topics, shows the
importance of polyelectrolyte effects in a wide range of disciplines.
