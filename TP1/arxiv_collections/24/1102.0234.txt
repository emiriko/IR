We present results from models of galactic winds driven by energy injected by
nuclear starbursts. The total energy of the starburst is provided by young
central stellar clusters and parts of the galactic interstellar medium are
pushed out as part of the galactic wind (in some cases the galactic wind
contains an important part of the metals produced in the new generation of
stars). We have performed adiabatic and radiative 3D N-Body/Smooth Particle
Hydrodynamics simulations of galactic winds using the GADGET-2 code. The
numerical models cover a wide range of starburst (from $\sim10^2$ to $\sim10^7$
M$_\odot$) and galactic gas masses (from $\sim6\times10^6$ to $\sim10^{11}$
M$_\odot$). The concentrated central starburst regions are an efficient engine
for producing of the mass and metal loss in galaxies, and also for driving the
metal redistribution in the galaxies.
