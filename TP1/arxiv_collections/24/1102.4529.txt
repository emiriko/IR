We present a procedure which allows us to recover classical and nonclassical
logical structures as \emph{concrete logics} associated with physical theories
expressed by means of classical languages. This procedure consists in choosing,
for a given theory $\mathcal T$ and classical language $\mathcal L$ expressing
$\mathcal T$, an observative sublanguage $L$ of $\mathcal L$ with a notion of
truth as correspondence, introducing in $L$ a derived and theory-dependent
notion of \emph{C-truth} (\emph{true with certainty}), defining a
\emph{physical preorder} induced by C-truth, and finally selecting a set of
sentences that are \emph{verifiable} (or \emph{testable}) according to
$\mathcal T$, on which a \emph{weak complementation} is induced by $\mathcal
T$. The triple consisting of the set of verifiable sentences, physical order
and weak complementation is then the desired concrete logic. By applying our
procedure we recover a classical logic as the concrete logic associated with
classical mechanics and standard quantum logic as the concrete logic associated
with quantum mechanics. We also show that our alternative view of standard
quantum logic, which can be constructed in a purely formal way, can be provided
with a physical meaning by adopting a recent interpretation of quantum
mechanics that reinterprets quantum probabilities as conditional on detection
rather than absolute. Our results then show that some nonstandard logics can be
obtained as mathematical structures formalizing the properties of different
notions of verifiability in different physical theories. More generally, they
strongly support the idea that many nonclassical logics can coexist without
conflicting with classical logic (\emph{global pluralism}), for they formalize
metalinguistic notions that do not coincide with the notion of truth (described
by Tarski's truth theory).
