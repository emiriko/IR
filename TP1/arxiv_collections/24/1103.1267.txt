We study the double-charged vector-bilepton pair production and
double-charged scalar-bilepton pair production {\it via} $p + p \longrightarrow
Y^{++} + Y^{--} + X$ and $p + p \longrightarrow S_1^{++} + S_1^{--} + X$, where
$Y$ and
  $S_1$ are vector and scalar bileptons respectively, in the framework of the
minimal version of the 3-3-1 model. We compute the photon, $Z$, and $Z^\prime$
s-channel contributions for the elementary process of bilepton scalar pair
production, and to keep the correct unitarity behavior for the elementary $q
\bar q$ interaction, we include the exotic quark t-channel contribution in the
vector-bilepton pair production calculation. We explore a mass range for
$Z^\prime$ and we fix the exotic quark mass within the experimental bounds. In
this model, the vector-bilepton mass is directly related to $M_{Z^\prime}$ and
we consider scalar mass values around the vector-bilepton mass.
  We show that the total cross section for vector-bilepton production is 3
orders of magnitude larger than for scalar pair production for $\sqrt s= 7$ TeV
and 14 TeV and we obtain the number of events for the proposed LHC luminosities
as a function of the bilepton mass. In addition we present some invariant mass
and transverse momentum distributions. When comparing these distributions we
observe quite different behavior providing the determination of the bilepton
nature. We conclude that one can disentangle the production rates and that the
LHC can be capable of detecting these predicted particles as a signal for new
physics.
