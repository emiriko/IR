Various-thickness Ag islands were prepared on Si(111)-7$\times$7 using the
one-step deposition at a high substrate temperature. An electronic state
centered at -0.40$\sim$-0.15eV versus E$_{Fermi}$, detectable on the surface of
the Ag islands thinner than 9 layers, was created by the electronic
hybridization between Ag and Si at the Ag-Si interface. Scanning tunneling
microscopy/spectroscopy and density functional theory revealed that the
thickness of Ag islands determined the strength of the hybridization, leading
to a modulation to the energy and intensity of the state on the surface.
