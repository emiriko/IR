We present 41 trigonometric parallaxes of 37 stellar systems, most of which
have proper motions greater than 1\farcs0 yr$^{-1}$. These are the first
trigonometric parallaxes for 24 systems. Overall, there are 15 red dwarf
systems and 22 red subdwarf systems in the sample. Five of the systems are
multiples with directly detected companions, and we have discovered
perturbations caused by unseen companions in two additional cases, the dwarf
LHS 501 and the subdwarf LHS 440. The latter system may eventually provide
important dynamical mass points on the subdwarf mass-luminosity relation. Two
additional stars of note are LHS 272, the third closest M-type subdwarf at a
distance of only 13.6 pc, and LHS 2734AB, a high velocity subdwarf binary with
$V_{tan}>$ 700 km/sec, which likely exceeds the escape velocity of the Milky
Way. We also report the first long term variability study of cool subdwarfs
indicating that cool subdwarfs are less photometrically variable than their
main sequence counterparts.
