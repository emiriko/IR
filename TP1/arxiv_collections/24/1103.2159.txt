The bubble wall velocity in an electroweak first order phase transition is a
key quantity both for electroweak baryogenesis and for the production of a
stochastic background of gravitational waves that may be probed in the future
through gravitational wave experiments like LISA or BBO. We show that, contrary
to the conclusion drawn from previous studies, it is actually possible to
generate a potentially large gravitational wave signal while satisfying the
requirements for viable electroweak baryogenesis, once the effects of the
hydrodynamics of bubble growth are taken into account. Then, the observation of
a large gravitational wave background from the electroweak phase transition
would not necessarily rule out electroweak baryogenesis as the mechanism having
generated the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe.
