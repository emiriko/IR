Effects of interlayer coupling and spatial anisotropy on spin-wave excitation
spectra of a three-dimensional spatially anisotropic, frustrated spin-$\half$
Heisenberg antiferromagnet (HAFM) is investigated for the two ordered phases
using second-order spin-wave expansion. We show that the second-order
corrections to the spin-wave energies are significant and find that the energy
spectra of the three-dimensional HAFM shares similar qualitative features with
the energy spectra of the two-dimensional HAFM on a square lattice. We also
discuss the features that can provide experimental measures for the strength of
the interlayer coupling, spatial anisotropy parameter, and magnetic
frustration.
