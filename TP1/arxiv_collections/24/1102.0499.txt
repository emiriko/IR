G and K giants are a class of radial velocity (RV) variables. One reason for
this variability are planetary companions which are indicated in time series of
stellar spectra. Since 2004 these spectra in the visual range were obtained
with the high resolution coud\'e \'echelle spectrograph mounted on the 2m
telescope of the Th\"uringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg (TLS) for a northern
sample of 62 very bright K giants. In the South around 300 G and K giants were
observed with HARPS mounted on the 3.6m telescope on La Silla. The TLS sample
contains at least 11 stars (18 %) which show low-amplitude, long-period RV
variations most likely due to planets. This percentage of planet frequency is
confirmed by preliminary results of the HARPS study. Moreover the TLS survey
seems to indicate that giant planets do not favour metal-rich stars, are more
massive, and have longer periods than those found around solar-type host stars.
