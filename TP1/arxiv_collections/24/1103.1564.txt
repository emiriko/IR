We numerically study the metastable states of the 2d Potts model. Both of
equilibrium and relaxation properties are investigated focusing on the finite
size effect. The former is investigated by finding the free energy extremal
point by the Wang-Landau sampling and the latter is done by observing the
Metropolis dynamics after sudden heating. It is explicitly shown that with
increasing system size the equilibrium spinodal temperature approaches the
bistable temperature in a power-law and the size-dependence of the nucleation
dynamics agrees with it. In addition, we perform finite size scaling of the
free energy landscape at the bistable point.
