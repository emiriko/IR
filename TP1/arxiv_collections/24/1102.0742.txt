The ALICE experiment consists of a central barrel in the pseudorapidity range
-0.9 < $\eta$ < 0.9 and of additional detectors covering about 3 units of
pseudorapidity on either side of the central barrel. Such a geometry allows the
tagging of single and double gap events. The status of the analysis of such
diffractive events in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV is
presented.
