This paper suggests a new approach to questions of rationality of threefolds
based on category theory. Following M. Ballard, D. Favero, L. Katzarkov
(ArXiv:1012.0864) and D. Favero, L. Katzarkov (Noether--Lefschetz Spectra and
Algebraic cycles, in preparation) we enhance constructions from A. Kuznetsov
(arXiv:0904.4330) by introducing Noether--Lefschetz spectra --- an interplay
between Orlov spectra (C. Oliva, Algebraic cycles and Hodge theory on
generalized Reye congruences, Compos. Math. 92, No. 1 (1994) 1--22) and
Hochschild homology. The main goal of this paper is to suggest a series of
interesting examples where above techniques might apply. We start by
constructing a sextic double solid $X$ with 35 nodes and torsion in
$H^3(X,\mathbb Z)$. This is a novelty --- after the classical example of Artin
and Mumford (1972), this is the second example of a Fano threefold with a
torsion in the 3-rd integer homology group. In particular $X$ is non-rational.
We consider other examples as well --- $V_{10}$ with 10 singular points and
double covering of quadric ramified in octic with 20 nodal singular points.
  After analyzing the geometry of their Landau--Ginzburg models we suggest a
general non-rationality picture based on Homological Mirror Symmetry and
category theory.
