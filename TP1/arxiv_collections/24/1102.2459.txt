Using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we discover an
anomalously large bi-axial strain-induced octahedral rotation axis
reorientation in orthorhombic perovskites with tendency towards rhombohedral
symmetry. The transition between crystallographically equivalent (isosymmetric)
structures with different octahedral rotation magnitudes originates from strong
strain--octahedral rotation coupling available to perovskites and the energetic
hierarchy among competing octahedral tilt patterns. By elucidating these
criteria, we suggest many functional perovskites would exhibit the transition
in thin film form, thus offering a new landscape in which to tailor highly
anisotropic electronic responses.
