We present the design, implementation and characterization of a dual-species
magneto-optical trap (MOT) for fermionic 6Li and 40K atoms with large atom
numbers. The MOT simultaneously contains 5.2x10^9 6Li-atoms and 8.0x10^9
40K-atoms, which are continuously loaded by a Zeeman slower for 6Li and a
2D-MOT for 40K. The atom sources induce capture rates of 1.2x10^9 6Li-atoms/s
and 1.4x10^9 40K-atoms/s. Trap losses due to light-induced interspecies
collisions of ~65% were observed and could be minimized to ~10% by using low
magnetic field gradients and low light powers in the repumping light of both
atomic species. The described system represents the starting point for the
production of a large-atom number quantum degenerate Fermi-Fermi mixture.
