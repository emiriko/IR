We use uniqueness of a VOA (vertex operator algebra) extension of
$(V_{EE_8}^+)^3$ to a Moonshine type VOA to give a new existence proof of a
finite simple group of Monster type. The proof is relatively direct. Our
methods depend on VOA representation theory and are free of many special
calculations which traditionally occur in theory of the Monster.
