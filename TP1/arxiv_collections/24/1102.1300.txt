We present recent developments of global galactic-scale numerical models of
the Cosmic Ray (CR) driven dynamo, which was originally proposed by Parker
(1992). We conduct a series of direct CR+MHD numerical simulations of the
dynamics of the interstellar medium (ISM), composed of gas, magnetic fields and
CR components. We take into account CRs accelerated in randomly distributed
supernova (SN) remnants, and assume that SNe deposit small-scale, randomly
oriented, dipolar magnetic fields into the ISM. The amplification timescale of
the large-scale magnetic field resulting from the CR-driven dynamo is
comparable to the galactic rotation period. The process efficiently converts
small-scale magnetic fields of SN-remnants into galactic-scale magnetic fields.
The resulting magnetic field structure resembles the X-shaped magnetic fields
observed in edge-on galaxies.
