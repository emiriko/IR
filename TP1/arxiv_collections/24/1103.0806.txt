I would like to consider the Beginning of space-time in this paper. First of
all, we do consideration historical thought. A lot of philosophers have
considered the relation between this real phenomenal world and the basic world
in which the phenomenal world is grounded. We will glimpse thought historical
details about such respect. Afterwards, we interpret the representation of
space-time on Quantum theory and Relativistic theory. In this case, we will
take recent results of time operator theory into consideration.
