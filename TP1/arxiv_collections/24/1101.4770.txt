We have measured field and temperature dependent magnetization of YbInNi4 to
elucidate the nature of the magnetic transition at 3 K. For small fields we
find magnetic order as previously reported. In contrast to former reports,
however, our high resolution magnetization measurements down to 500 mK indicate
dominating antiferromagnetic exchange interactions. We discuss the presence of
geometrical frustration.
