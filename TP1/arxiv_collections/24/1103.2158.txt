We present here preliminary results of an analysis of the iron abundance in
the ionized gas of three planetary nebulae and one H II region of the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC). These results are compared with the ones we obtain for
a sample of Galactic and extragalactic nebulae. We find that the amounts of
iron depletion into dust grains in LMC nebulae are similar to those found in
Galactic nebulae. Objects with lower metallicities show lower depletions, but a
larger sample of objects is needed to explore the reasons behind this trend.
