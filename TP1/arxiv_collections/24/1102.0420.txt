Heavy ion collisions at RHIC and at the LHC can create the quark-gluon
plasma, a state of matter at very high temperatures. Among a plethora of
particles that are produced in these collisions, also light is emitted
throughout the evolution of the plasma.
  In this talk, the properties of this light are discussed and related to
recent efforts towards shorter and more energetic photon pulses in laser
physics. In particular, the time evolution of high-energy photons is studied.
These photons originate from Compton scattering of gluons and quark-antiquark
annihilation in the plasma. Due to the internal dynamics of the plasma, double
pulses at the yoctosecond time scale can be generated under certain conditions.
Such double pulses may be utilized for novel pump-probe experiments at nuclear
time scales.
