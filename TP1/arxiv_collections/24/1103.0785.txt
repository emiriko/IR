Using the highest-resolution X-ray observation of the Trumpler 15 star
cluster taken by the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we estimate the total size of
its stellar population by comparing the X-ray luminosity function of the
detected sources to a calibrator cluster, and identify for the first time a
significant fraction (~14%) of its individual members. The highest-resolution
near-IR observation of Trumpler 15 (taken by the HAWK-I instrument on the VLT)
was found to detect most of our X-ray selected sample of cluster members, with
a K-excess disk frequency of 3.8+-0.7%. The near-IR data, X-ray luminosity
function, and published spectral types of the brightest members support a
cluster age estimate (5-10 Myr) that is older than those for the nearby
Trumpler 14 and Trumpler 16 clusters, and suggest that high-mass members may
have already exploded as supernovae. The morphology of the inner ~0.7 pc core
of the cluster is found to be spherical. However, the outer regions (beyond 2
pc) are elongated, forming an `envelope' of stars that, in projection, appears
to connect Trumpler 15 to Trumpler 14; this morphology supports the view that
these clusters are physically associated. Clear evidence of mass segregation is
seen. This study appears in a Special Issue of the ApJS devoted to the Chandra
Carina Complex Project (CCCP), a 1.42 square degree Chandra X-ray survey of the
Great Nebula in Carina.
