The dot-depth hierarchy is a classification of star-free languages. It is
related to the quantifier alternation hierarchy of first-order logic over
finite words. We consider fragments of languages with dot-depth 1/2 and
dot-depth 1 obtained by prohibiting the specification of prefixes or suffixes.
As it turns out, these language classes are in one-to-one correspondence with
fragments of existential first-order logic without min- or max-predicate. For
all fragments, we obtain effective algebraic characterizations. Moreover, we
give new combinatorial proofs for the decidability of the membership problem
for dot-depth 1/2 and dot-depth 1.
