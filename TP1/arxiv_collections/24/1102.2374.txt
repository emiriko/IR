In this note we propose a new set of coordinates to study the hyperbolic or
non-elliptic cubic nonlinear Schrodinger equation in two dimensions. Based on
these coordinates, we study the existence of bounded and continuous
hyperbolically radial standing waves, as well as hyperbolically radial
self-similar solutions. Many of the arguments can easily be adapted to more
general nonlinearities.
