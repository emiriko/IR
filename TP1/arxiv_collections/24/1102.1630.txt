We theoretically and numerically studied ordering of "colloidal ionic
clusters" on periodic substrate potentials as those generated by optical
trapping. Each cluster consists of three charged spherical colloids: two
negatively and one positively charged. The substrate is a square or rectangular
array of traps, each confining one such cluster. By varying the lattice
constant from large to small, the observed clusters are first rod-like and form
ferro- and antiferro-like phases, then they bend into a banana-like shape and
finally condense into a percolated structure. Remarkably, in a broad parameter
range between single-cluster and percolated structures, we have found stable
supercomplexes composed of six colloids forming grape-like or rocket-like
structures. We investigated the possibility of macroscopic pattern switching by
applying external electrical fields.
