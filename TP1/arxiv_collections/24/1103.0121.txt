It is demonstrated that the third-order interference, as obtained from
explicit solutions of Maxwell's equations for realistic models of three-slit
devices, including an idealized version of the three-slit device used in a
recent three-slit experiment with light (U. Sinha et al., Science 329, 418
(2010)), is generally nonzero. The hypothesis that the third-order interference
should be zero is shown to be fatally flawed because it requires dropping the
one-to-one correspondence between the symbols in the mathematical theory and
the different experimental configurations.
