The advent of laser cooling techniques revolutionized the study of many
atomic-scale systems. This has fueled progress towards quantum computers by
preparing trapped ions in their motional ground state, and generating new
states of matter by achieving Bose-Einstein condensation of atomic vapors.
Analogous cooling techniques provide a general and flexible method for
preparing macroscopic objects in their motional ground state, bringing the
powerful technology of micromechanics into the quantum regime. Cavity opto- or
electro-mechanical systems achieve sideband cooling through the strong
interaction between light and motion. However, entering the quantum regime,
less than a single quantum of motion, has been elusive because sideband cooling
has not sufficiently overwhelmed the coupling of mechanical systems to their
hot environments. Here, we demonstrate sideband cooling of the motion of a
micromechanical oscillator to the quantum ground state. Entering the quantum
regime requires a large electromechanical interaction, which is achieved by
embedding a micromechanical membrane into a superconducting microwave resonant
circuit. In order to verify the cooling of the membrane motion into the quantum
regime, we perform a near quantum-limited measurement of the microwave field,
resolving this motion a factor of 5.1 from the Heisenberg limit. Furthermore,
our device exhibits strong-coupling allowing coherent exchange of microwave
photons and mechanical phonons. Simultaneously achieving strong coupling,
ground state preparation and efficient measurement sets the stage for rapid
advances in the control and detection of non-classical states of motion,
possibly even testing quantum theory itself in the unexplored region of larger
size and mass.
