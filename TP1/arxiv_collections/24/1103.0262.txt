We consider two graph invariants inspired by quantum walks- one in continuous
time and one in discrete time. We will associate a matrix algebra called a
cellular algebra with every graph. We show that, if the cellular algebras of
two graphs have a similar structure, then they are not distinguished by either
of the proposed invariants.
