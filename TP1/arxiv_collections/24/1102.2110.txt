A particle called \eta' meson is found to reduce its mass in less than 10^-22
second in high energy heavy ion collisions at RHIC. Apparently this is the
fastest mass reduction ever observed. This indicates the restoration of a lost
symmetry of strong interactions in a hot and dense, hadronic matter.
