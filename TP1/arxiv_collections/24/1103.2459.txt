Let Y be a divisor on a smooth algebraic variety X. We investigate the
geometry of the Jacobian scheme of Y, homological invariants derived from
logarithmic differential forms along Y, and their relationship with the
property that Y is a free divisor.
  We consider arrangements of hyperplanes as a source of examples and
counterexamples. In particular, we make a complete calculation of the local
cohomology of logarithmic forms of generic hyperplane arrangements.
