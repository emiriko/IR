We study the dynamics of carriers in graphene subjected to an inhomogeneous
magnetic field. For a magnetic field with an hyperbolic profile the
corresponding Dirac equation can be analyzed within the formalism of
supersymmetric quantum mechanics, and leads to an exactly solvable model. We
study in detail the bound spectra. For a narrow barrier the spectra is
characterized by a few bands, except for the zero energy level that remains
degenerated. As, the width of the barrier increases we can track the bands
evolution into the degenerated Landau levels. In the scattering regime a simple
analytical formula is obtained for the transmission coefficient, this result
allow us to identify the resonant conditions at which the barrier becomes
transparent.
