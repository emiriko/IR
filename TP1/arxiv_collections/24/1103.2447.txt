Domain decomposition methods are widely used to solve sparse linear systems
from scientific problems, but they are not suited to solve sparse linear
systems extracted from integrated circuits. The reason is that the sparse
linear system of integrated circuits may be non-diagonal-dominant, and domain
decomposition method might be unconvergent for these non-diagonal-dominant
matrices. In this paper, we propose a mini-step strategy to do the circuit
transient analysis. Different from the traditional large-step approach, this
strategy is able to generate diagonal-dominant sparse linear systems. As a
result, preconditioned domain decomposition methods can be used to simulate the
large integrated circuits on the supercomputers and clouds.
