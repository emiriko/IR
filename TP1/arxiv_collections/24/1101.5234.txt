We investigate transverse magnetic heat transport on the surface of a
topological insulator on which a ferromagnet is attached. We present general
expressions of the Nernst coefficient and the thermal Hall conductivity, which
are reduced to simple forms at low temperatures. It is shown that the Nernst
coefficient and the thermal Hall conductivity show non-monotonous dependence on
temperature. At low temperature, they have linear dependence on temperature.
From the behavior of the Nernst coefficient at low temperature, one can
estimate the magnitude of the gap induced by time-reversal symmetry breaking.
Moreover, we find that the Nernst coefficient can be used to map the Berry
phase structure. These results open up possibility to control thermal Hall
currents magnetically.
