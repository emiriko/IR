We explore the Higgs and sparticle spectroscopy of supersymmetric SU(4)_c x
SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R models in which the three MSSM gauge couplings and third
family (t-b-tau) Yukawa couplings are all unified at M_GUT. This class of
models can be obtained via compactification of a higher dimensional theory.
Allowing for opposite sign gaugino masses and varying m_t within 1 sigma of its
current central value yields a variety of gauge-Yukawa unification as well as
WMAP compatible neutralino dark matter solutions. They include mixed
bino-Higgsino dark matter, stau and gluino coannihilation scenarios, and the
A-resonance solution.
