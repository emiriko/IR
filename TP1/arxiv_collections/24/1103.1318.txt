These proceedings discuss some of the highlights of recent research in
perturbative QCD as it relates to the LHC. Topics covered include the new
generation of Monte Carlo event generators, the revolution that is occurring in
NLO calculations, progress towards NNLO predictions and developments in the
definition and use of jets.
