We report the full complex dielectric function of high-purity
$\textrm{Ba}_{0.68}\textrm{K}_{0.32}\textrm{Fe}_2\textrm{As}_2$ single crystals
with $T_{\mathrm{c}}=38.5\ \textrm{K}$ determined by wide-band spectroscopic
ellipsometry at temperatures $10\leq T\leq300\ \textrm{K}$. We discuss the
microscopic origin of superconductivity-induced infrared optical anomalies in
the framework of a multiband Eliashberg theory with two distinct
superconducting gap energies $2\Delta_{\mathrm{A}}\approx6\
k_{\mathrm{B}}T_{\mathrm{c}}$ and $2\Delta_{\mathrm{B}}\approx2.2\
k_{\mathrm{B}}T_{\mathrm{c}}$. The observed unusual suppression of the optical
conductivity in the superconducting state at energies up to $14\
k_{\mathrm{B}}T_{\mathrm{c}}$ can be ascribed to spin-fluctuation--assisted
processes in the clean limit of the strong-coupling regime.
