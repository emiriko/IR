\lhcb is one of the four major experiments at the Large Hadron Collider
(\lhc) at CERN. It is custom built to look for CP violation and New Physics in
rare decays of heavy flavour hadrons, like the B and D systems. Rare decays
that occur via loop diagrams provide a way to probe New Physics at energy
scales much higher than can be probed by direct production in experiments. In
this article, the \lhcb prospects for such measurements with exclusive decays
of the type $B \to \Xs \gamma$ and $B \to X_{s} l^{+} l^{-}$ are presented.
