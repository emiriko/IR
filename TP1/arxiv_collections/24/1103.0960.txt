The next-nearest neighbor interaction (NNN) is included in a tight-binding
calculation of the electronic spectrum and conductivity of doped graphene. As a
result, we observe a wide variation of the conductivity behavior, since the
Fermi energy and the resonance peak are not shifted by the same amount. Such
effect can have a profound effect in the idea of explaining the minimal
conductivity of graphene as a consequence of impurities or defects. Finally, we
also estimate the mean free path and relaxation time due to resonant impurity
scattering.
