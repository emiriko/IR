In this article we consider a variant of Rabinowitz Floer homology in order
to define a homological count of discriminant points for paths of
contactomorphisms. The growth rate of this count can be seen as an analogue of
Givental's nonlinear Maslov index. As an application we prove a Bott-Samelson
type obstruction theorem for positive loops of contactomorphisms.
