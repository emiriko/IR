We analyze the behavior of the four-terminal resistance, relative to the
two-terminal resistance of an interacting quantum wire with an impurity, taking
into account the invasiveness of the voltage probes. We consider a
one-dimensional Luttinger model of spinless fermions for the wire. We treat the
coupling to the voltage probes perturbatively, within the framework of
non-equilibrium Green function techniques. Our investigation unveils the
combined effect of impurities, electron-electron interactions and invasiveness
of the probes on the possible occurrence of negative resistance.
