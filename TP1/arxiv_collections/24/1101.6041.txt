An alternative definition for the non local impact ionization coefficient is
given and its relationship to the ionization pathlength probability
distribution function (PDF) is determined. A model for the ionization
pathlength PDF is proposed and the resultant non local ionization coefficient
is derived. An expression for the avalanche multiplication is derived. Results
are calculated using non local ionization coefficients for two electric field
values using fits to ionization pathlength PDFs calculated using Monte Carlo
techniques. These results show two features: the well known dead space effect
and at the higher field value a resonance effect. The resonance effect gives
rise to level sections in the multiplication curve for multiplications of 2, 4,
8 and 16 if the ionization coefficient ratio is small.
