Memristive system models have previously been proposed to describe ionic
memory resistors. However, these models neglect the mass of ions and repulsive
forces between ions and are not well formulated in terms of semiconductor and
ionic physics. This article proposes an alternative dynamic systems model in
which the system state is derived from a second order differential equation in
the form of a driven damped harmonic oscillator. Application is made to
Schottky and tunneling barriers.
