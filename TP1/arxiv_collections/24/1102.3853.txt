The Sturmian expansion of the generalized Dirac-Coulomb Green function [R.
Szmytkowski, J. Phys. B 30 (1997) 825; erratum 30 (1997) 2747] is exploited to
derive closed-form expressions for electric ($\sigma_{\mathrm{E}}$) and
magnetic ($\sigma_{\mathrm{M}}$) dipole shielding constants for the ground
state of the relativistic hydrogen-like atom with a point-like and spinless
nucleus of charge $Ze$. It is found that $\sigma_{\mathrm{E}}=Z^{-1}$ (as it
should be) and
$$\sigma_{\mathrm{M}}=-(2Z\alpha^{2}/27)(4\gamma_{1}^{3}+6\gamma_{1}^{2}-7\gamma_{1}-12)
/[\gamma_{1}(\gamma_{1}+1)(2\gamma_{1}-1)],$$ where
$\gamma_{1}=\sqrt{1-(Z\alpha)^{2}}$ ($\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant).
This expression for $\sigma_{\mathrm{M}}$ agrees with earlier findings of
several other authors, obtained with the use of other analytical techniques,
and is elementary compared to an alternative one presented recently by Cheng
\emph{et al.} [J. Chem. Phys. 130 (2009) 144102], which involves an infinite
series of ratios of the Euler's gamma functions.
