We carry out a numerical simulation depicting the effects of a Coronal Mass
Ejection (CME) event on a close-in giant planet in an extrasolar system. We
drive the CME in a similar manner as in simulations of space weather events on
Earth. The simulation includes the planetary orbital motion, which leads to the
forming of a comet-like planetary magnetotail which is oriented almost
perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the CME. The combination of
this feature and the fact that the CME does not expand much by the time it
reaches the planet leads to a unique CME-magnetosphere interaction, where the
CME itself is highly affected by the presence of the planetary magnetosphere.
We find that the planet is well-shielded from CME penetration, even for a
relatively weak internal magnetic field. The planetary angular momentum loss
associated with such an event is negligible compared to the total planetary
angular momentum. We also find that the energy which is deposited in the
magnetosphere is much higher than in the case of the Earth, and our simulation
suggests there is a large-scale change in the orientation of the
magnetosphere-ionosphere current system during the CME event.
