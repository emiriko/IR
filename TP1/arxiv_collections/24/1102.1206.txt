In this study we investigate the effects of turbulent convection on formation
of large-scale inhomogeneous magnetic structures by means of Large-Eddy
Simulation (LES) for convection in solar-type stars. The main idea of this
study is the implementation of a new subgrid-scale model for the effective
Lorentz force in a three-dimensional nonlinear radiative magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD) code developed for simulating the upper solar convection zone and lower
atmosphere. To this end we derived the energy budget equations, which include
the effects of the subgrid-scale turbulence on the Lorentz-force, and
implemented the new subgrid-scale turbulence model (TELF-Model) in a
three-dimensional nonlinear MHD LES code. Using imposed initial vertical and
horizontal uniform magnetic fields in LES with the TELF-Model, we have shown
that the magnetic flux tubes formation is started when the initial mean
magnetic field is larger than a threshold value (about 100 G). This is in
agreement with the theoretical studies by Rogachevskii and Kleeorin (2007). We
have determined the vertical profiles of the velocity and magnetic
fluctuations, total MHD energy and anisotropy of turbulent magneto-convection,
kinetic and current and cross helicities.
