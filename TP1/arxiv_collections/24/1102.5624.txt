We present exact expressions for the sum of states of noninteracting
classical and quantum particles occupying a finite number of modes with
arbitrary spacings. Exploiting a probabilistic analogy, we derive an analytic
fourth-order approximation to the density of states, which captures its
variance and kurtosis, and is superior to the previous, commonly used methods
for all three particle statistics. Our approach employs a simple exact method
of calculating the moments of the microcanonical density of states for quantum
particles, which requires less computational effort than the commonly used
saddle-point approximation. We test our methods numerically and discuss their
applicability to various physical systems.
