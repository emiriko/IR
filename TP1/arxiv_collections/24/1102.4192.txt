We report the discovery of two millisecond pulsars in a search for radio
pulsations at the positions of \emph{Fermi Large Area Telescope} sources with
no previously known counterparts, using the Nan\c{c}ay radio telescope. The two
millisecond pulsars, PSRs J2017+0603 and J2302+4442, have rotational periods of
2.896 and 5.192 ms and are both in binary systems with low-eccentricity orbits
and orbital periods of 2.2 and 125.9 days respectively, suggesting long
recycling processes. Gamma-ray pulsations were subsequently detected for both
objects, indicating that they power the associated \emph{Fermi} sources in
which they were found. The gamma-ray light curves and spectral properties are
similar to those of previously-detected gamma-ray millisecond pulsars. Detailed
modeling of the observed radio and gamma-ray light curves shows that the
gamma-ray emission seems to originate at high altitudes in their
magnetospheres. Additionally, X-ray observations revealed the presence of an
X-ray source at the position of PSR J2302+4442, consistent with thermal
emission from a neutron star. These discoveries along with the numerous
detections of radio-loud millisecond pulsars in gamma rays suggest that many
\emph{Fermi} sources with no known counterpart could be unknown millisecond
pulsars.
