We study the impact of stochastic perturbations to deterministic dynamical
systems using the formalism of the Ruelle response theory and explore how
stochastic noise can be used to explore the properties of the underlying
deterministic dynamics of a system. We find the expression for the change in
the expectation value of a general observable when a white noise forcing is
introduced in the system, both in the case of additive and multiplicative
noise. We also show that the difference between the expectation value of the
power spectrum of an observable in the stochastically perturbed case and of the
same observable in the unperturbed case is equal to the variance of the noise
times the square of the modulus of the susceptibility describing the
frequency-dependent response of the system to perturbations with the same
spatial patterns as the considered stochastic forcing. Using Kramers-Kronig
theory, it is then possible to derive the susceptibility and thus deduce the
Green function of the system for any desired observable. We then extend our
results to rather general patterns of random forcing, from the case of several
white noise forcings, to noise terms with memory, up to the case of a
space-time random field. Explicit formulas are provided for each relevant case.
As a general result, we find, using an argument of positive-definiteness, that
the power spectrum of the stochastically perturbed system is larger at all
frequencies than the power spectrum of the unperturbed system. We provide a
example of application of our results by considering the Lorenz 96 model. These
results clarify the property of stochastic stability of SRB measures in Axiom A
flows, provide tools for analysing stochastic parameterisations and related
closure ansatz to be implemented in modelling studies, and introduce new ways
to study the response of a system to external perturbations.
