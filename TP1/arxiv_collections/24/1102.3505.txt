We report the results of electrical and magnetic properties on two new
compounds, K0.8Fe1.7S2 and K0.8Fe1.7SeS, both having similar structures to
newly discovered superconducting K0.8Fe1.7Se2. K0.8Fe1.7S2 exhibits a
semiconductor-like electrical property and undergoes an anti-ferromagnetic
transition at about 260 K. Upon replacing half of S with Se, K0.8Fe1.7SSe
becomes a superconductor at 25 K, implying the superconductivity evolves from a
Mott AFM state in Fe-Se based superconductors.
