We present a new Chandra observation of supernova remnant (SNR) G350.1-0.3.
The high resolution X-ray data reveal previously unresolved filamentary
structures and allow us to perform detailed spectroscopy in the diffuse regions
of this SNR. Spectral analysis demonstrates that the region of brightest
emission is dominated by hot, metal-rich ejecta while the ambient material
along the perimeter of the ejecta region and throughout the remnant's western
half is mostly low-temperature, shocked interstellar/circumstellar medium
(ISM/CSM) with solar-type composition. The data reveal that the emission
extends far to the west of the ejecta region and imply a lower limit of 6.6 pc
on the diameter of the source (at a distance of 4.5 kpc). We show that
G350.1-0.3 is likely in the free expansion (ejecta-dominated) stage and
calculate an age of 600-1200 years. The derived relationship between the shock
velocity and the electron/proton temperature ratio is found to be entirely
consistent with that of other SNRs. We perform spectral fits on the X-ray
source XMMU J172054.5-372652, a candidate central compact object (CCO), and
find that its spectral properties fall within the typical range of other CCOs.
We also present archival 24 um data of G350.1-0.3 taken with the Spitzer Space
Telescope during the MIPSGAL galactic survey and find that the infrared and
X-ray morphologies are well-correlated. These results help to explain this
remnant's peculiar asymmetries and shed new light on its dynamics and
evolution.
