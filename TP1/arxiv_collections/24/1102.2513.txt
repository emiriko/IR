We investigate the possibility that the modified Yang-Mills theories can
produce an accelerated cosmic expansion. We take into account some specific
non-trivial solution of the modified Yang-Mills equation obtained by the author
earlier, which allows us to build several modifications of accelerated cosmic
expansion.
