This letter reports a measurement of the top quark mass, M_{top}, in data
from p-pbar collisions at sqrt{s} = 1.96 TeV corresponding to 2.7 fb^{-1} of
integrated luminosity at the Fermilab Tevatron using the CDF II detector.
Events with the lepton+jets topology are selected. An unbinned likelihood is
constructed based on the dependence of the lepton transverse momentum, P_T, on
M_{top}. A maximum likelihood fit to the data yields a measured mass M_{top} =
(176.9 +/- 8.0 stat +/- 2.7 syst) GeV/c^2. In this measurement, the
contribution by the jet energy scale uncertainty to the systematic error is
negligible. The result provides an important consistency test for other M_{top}
measurements where explicit use of the jet energy is made for deriving the top
quark mass.
