We analyze here different types of fractional differential equations, under
the assumption that their fractional order $\nu \in (0,1] $ is random\ with
probability density $n(\nu).$ We start by considering the fractional extension
of the recursive equation governing the homogeneous Poisson process
$N(t),t>0.$\ We prove that, for a particular (discrete) choice of $n(\nu)$, it
leads to a process with random time, defined as $N(%
\widetilde{\mathcal{T}}_{\nu_{1,}\nu_{2}}(t)),t>0.$ The distribution of the
random time argument $\widetilde{\mathcal{T}}_{\nu_{1,}\nu_{2}}(t)$ can be
expressed, for any fixed $t$, in terms of convolutions of stable-laws. The new
process $N(\widetilde{\mathcal{T}}_{\nu_{1,}\nu_{2}})$ is itself a renewal and
can be shown to be a Cox process. Moreover we prove that the survival
probability of $N(\widetilde{\mathcal{T}}_{\nu_{1,}\nu_{2}})$, as well as its
probability generating function, are solution to the so-called fractional
relaxation equation of distributed order (see \cite{Vib}%).
  In view of the previous results it is natural to consider diffusion-type
fractional equations of distributed order. We present here an approach to their
solutions in terms of composition of the Brownian motion $B(t),t>0$ with the
random time $\widetilde{\mathcal{T}}_{\nu_{1,}\nu_{2}}$. We thus provide an
alternative to the constructions presented in Mainardi and Pagnini
\cite{mapagn} and in Chechkin et al. \cite{che1}, at least in the double-order
case.
