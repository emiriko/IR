The existence of the limiting pair correlation for angles between reciprocal
geodesics on the modular surface is established. An explicit formula is
provided, which captures geometric information about the length of reciprocal
geodesics, as well as arithmetic information about the associated reciprocal
classes of binary quadratic forms. One striking feature is the absence of a gap
beyond zero in the limiting distribution, contrasting with the analog Euclidean
situation.
