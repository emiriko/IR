Using the formalism of flag algebras, we prove that every triangle-free graph
$G$ with $n$ vertices contains at most $(n/5)^5$ cycles of length five.
Moreover, the equality is attained only when $n$ is divisible by five and $G$
is the balanced blow-up of the pentagon. We also compute the maximal number of
pentagons and characterize extremal graphs in the non-divisible case provided
$n$ is sufficiently large. This settles a conjecture made by Erd\H{o}s in 1984.
