We report the results of Keck L'-band non-redundant aperture masking of HR
8799, a system with four confirmed planetary mass companions at projected
orbital separations of 14 to 68 AU. We use these observations to place
constraints on the presence of planets and brown dwarfs at projected orbital
separations inside of 10 AU---separations out of reach to more conventional
direct imaging methods. No companions were detected at better than 99%
confidence between orbital separations of 0.8 to 10 AU. Assuming an age of 30
Myr and adopting the Baraffe models, we place upper limits to planetary mass
companions of 80, 60, and 11 Jupiter Masses at projected orbital separations of
0.8, 1, and 3-10 AU respectively. Our constraints on massive companions to HR
8799 will help clarify ongoing studies of the orbital stability of this
multi-planet system, and may illuminate future work dedicated to understanding
the dust-free hole interior to ~6 AU.
