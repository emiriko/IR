Hadronic event shapes have been measured in proton-proton collisions at
sqrt(s)=7 TeV, with a data sample collected with the CMS detector at the LHC.
The sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 inverse picobarns.
Event-shape distributions, corrected for detector response, are compared with
five models of QCD multijet production.
