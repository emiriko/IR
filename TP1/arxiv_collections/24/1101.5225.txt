We study ballistic interfacial thermal transport across atomic junctions.
Exact expressions for phonon transmission coefficients are derived for thermal
transport in one-junction and two-junction chains, and verified by numerical
calculation based on a nonequilibrium Green's function method. For a
single-junction case, we find that the phonon transmission coefficient
typically decreases monotonically with increasing freqency. However, in the
range between equal frequency spectrum and equal acoustic impedance, it
increases first then decreases, which explains why the Kapitza resistance
calculated from the acoustic mismatch model is far larger than the experimental
values at low temperatures. The junction thermal conductance reaches a maximum
when the interfacial coupling equals the harmonic average of the spring
constants of the two semi-infinite chains. For three-dimensional junctions, in
the weak coupling limit, we find that the conductance is proportional to the
square of the interfacial coupling, while for intermediate coupling strength
the conductance is approximately proportional to the interfacial coupling
strength. For two-junction chains, the transmission coefficient oscillates with
the frequency due to interference effects. The oscillations between the two
envelop lines can be understood analytically, thus providing guidelines in
designing phonon frequency filters.
