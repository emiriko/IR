The heterogeneous condensation of a Lennard-Jones vapor onto a nanoscale seed
particle is studied using molecular dynamics simulations. Measuring the
nucleation rate and the height of the free energy barrier using the mean first
passage time method shows that the presence of a weakly interacting seed has
little effect on the work of forming very small cluster embryos but accelerates
the rate by lowering the barrier for larger clusters. We suggest that this
results from a competition between the energetic and entropic features of
cluster formation in the bulk and at the heterogeneity. As the interaction is
increased, the free energy of formation is reduced for all cluster sizes. We
also develop a simple phenomenological model of film formation on a small seed
that captures the general features of the nucleation process for small
heterogeneities. A comparison of our simulation results with the model shows
that heterogeneous classical nucleation theory provides a good estimate of the
critical size of the film but significantly over-estimates the size of the
barrier.
