We show how the transition between synchronized and desynchronized states of
a spinor polariton condensate can be used to drive a transition between
stationary vortex lattices and half-vortex lattices. This provides a way to
control polariton spin textures by a combination of pump spot profile and
applied magnetic fields. To do this, we extend the model of non-equilibrium
spinor condensates to include relaxation, and study how this affects the
desynchronization transition. We discuss how the pattern formation can be
explained by behavior of the homogeneous system.
