Quantum discord quantifies quantum correlations beyond entanglement and
assumes nonzero values, which are notoriously hard to compute, for almost all
quantum states. Here we provide computable tight bounds for the quantum discord
for qubit-qudit states. In the case of two qubits our lower and upper bounds
coincide for a 7-parameter family of filtered $X$-states, whose quantum
discords can therefore be evaluated analytically. An application to the
accessible information of the binary qubit channel is also presented. For the
qubit-qudit state output by the circuit of deterministic computation with one
qubit, nontrivial lower and upper bounds that respect the zero-discord
conditions are obtained for its quantum discord.
