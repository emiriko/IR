We describe a generic framework for representing and reasoning with annotated
Semantic Web data, a task becoming more important with the recent increased
amount of inconsistent and non-reliable meta-data on the web. We formalise the
annotated language, the corresponding deductive system and address the query
answering problem. Previous contributions on specific RDF annotation domains
are encompassed by our unified reasoning formalism as we show by instantiating
it on (i) temporal, (ii) fuzzy, and (iii) provenance annotations. Moreover, we
provide a generic method for combining multiple annotation domains allowing to
represent, e.g. temporally-annotated fuzzy RDF. Furthermore, we address the
development of a query language -- AnQL -- that is inspired by SPARQL,
including several features of SPARQL 1.1 (subqueries, aggregates, assignment,
solution modifiers) along with the formal definitions of their semantics.
