Brown dwarf companions to white dwarfs are rare, but recent infra-red surveys
are slowly reveal- ing examples. We present new observations of the post-common
envelope binary WD0137-349, which reveals the effects of irradiation on the ~
0.05M* secondary, and new observations of GD 1400 which show that it too is a
close, post-comon envelope system. We also present the lat- est results in a
near-infrared photometric search for unresolved ultracool companions and to
white dwarfs with UKIDSS. Twenty five DA white dwarfs were identified as having
photometric excesses indicative of a low mass companion, with 8-10 of these
having a predicted mass in the range asso- ciated with brown dwarfs. The
results of this survey show that the unresolved (< 2") brown dwarf companion
fraction to DA white dwarfs is 0.3 \leq fWD+BD \leq 1.3%.
