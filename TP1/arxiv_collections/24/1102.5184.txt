Starting from a phase-field description of the isothermal solidification of a
dilute binary alloy, we establish a model where capillary waves of the
solidification front interact with the diffusive concentration field of the
solute. The model does not rely on the sharp-interface assumption, and includes
non-equilibrium effects, relevant in the rapid-growth regime. In many
applications it can be evaluated analytically, culminating in the appearance of
an instability which, interfering with the Mullins-Sekerka instability, is
similar to that, found by Cahn in grain-boundary motion.
