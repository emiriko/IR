A precise measurement of the heavy-flavor production cross-sections in pp
collisions is an essential baseline for the heavy-ion program. In addition it
is a crucial test of pQCD models in the new energy regime at LHC. ALICE
measures the muons from the decay of charmonium resonances and from the
semileptonic decay of heavy-flavored hadrons in its forward (-4.0 $<$ $\eta$
$<$ -2.5) Muon Spectrometer. We discuss the status of the detector and present
results of data taken in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=7 TeV.
