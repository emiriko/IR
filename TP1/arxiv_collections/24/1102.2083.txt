A new approach to the geometrization of the electron theory is proposed. The
particle wave function is represented by a geometric entity, i.e., Clifford
number, with the translation rules possessing the structure of Dirac equation
for any manifold. A solution of this equation is obtained in terms of geometric
treatment. Interference of electrons whose wave functions are represented by
geometric entities is considered. New experiments concerning the geometric
nature of electrons are proposed.
