We construct extensions of the Standard Model with two Higgs doublets, where
there are flavour changing neutral currents both in the quark and leptonic
sectors, with their strength fixed by the fermion mixing matrices $V_{CKM}$ and
$V_{PMNS}$. These models are an extension to the leptonic sector of the class
of models previously considered by Branco, Grimus and Lavoura, for the quark
sector. We consider both the cases of Dirac and Majorana neutrinos and identify
the minimal discrete symmetry required in order to implement the models in a
natural way.
