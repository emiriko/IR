We develop the theory of CKP hierarchy introduced in the papers of Kyoto
school [Date E., Jimbo M., Kashiwara M., Miwa T., J. Phys. Soc. Japan 50
(1981), 3806-3812] (see also [Kac V.G., van de Leur J.W., Adv. Ser. Math.
Phys., Vol. 7, World Sci. Publ., Teaneck, NJ, 1989, 369-406]). We present
appropriate bosonization formulae. We show that in the context of the CKP
theory certain orthogonal polynomials appear. These polynomials are polynomial
both in even and odd (in Grassmannian sense) variables.
