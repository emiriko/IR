Explicit matrix product ansatz is presented, in first two orders in the
(weak) coupling parameter, for the non-equilibrium steady state of the
homogeneous, nearest neighbor Heisenberg XXZ spin-1/2 chain driven by Lindblad
operators which act only at the edges of the chain. The first order of the
density operator becomes in thermodynamic limit an exact pseudo-local
conservation law and yields -- via Mazur inequality -- a rigorous lower bound
on the high temperature spin Drude weight. Such Mazur bound is a non-vanishing
fractal function of the anisotropy parameter Delta for |Delta|<1.
