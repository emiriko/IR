We show that for any countable group, any free probability measure preserving
action of the group weakly contains all Bernoulli actions of the group. It
follows that for a finitely generated groups, the cost is maximal on Bernoulli
actions and that all free factors of i.i.d.-s the group have the same cost.
  We also show that if a probability measure preserving action f is ergodic,
but not strongly ergodic, then f is weakly equivalent to f\timesI where I
denotes the trivial action on the unit interval. This leads to a relative
version of the Glasner-Weiss dichotomy.
