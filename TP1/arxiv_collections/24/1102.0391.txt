Series of metastable Me1-xZnxO solid solutions (Me = Ni2+, Co2+, Fe2+, Mn2+)
with the rocksalt (rs) crystal structure have been synthesized from the binary
oxides by quenching from 7.7 GPa and 1450-1650 K. Phase composition of the
samples, as well as structural properties and stoichiometry of synthesized
solid solutions have been studied by X-ray powder diffraction, both
conventional and with synchrotron radiation. The widest (0.3 \leq x \leq 0.8)
composition range of the existence of individual rock-salt solid solution has
been established for the NiO-ZnO system. The bulk rs-Co1-xZnxO, rs-Fe1-xZnxO
and rs-Mn1-xZnxO solid solutions may be quenched down to ambient conditions
only with twice lower ZnO content, i.e. x \leq 0.5, 0.5 and 0.4, respectively;
while formation of rock-salt solid solutions in the CdO-ZnO system has not been
observed in the whole concentration range.
