The search and study of heavy Higgs bosons is an important part of the
anticipated physics program of a high energy e+e- linear collider. This paper
reviews the expected sensitivity of e+e- collisions from 0.5 up to 3 TeV in the
study of the physics of charged Higgs bosons in supersymmetric scenarios.
