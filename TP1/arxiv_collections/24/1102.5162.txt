In supersymmetric quantum mechanics the emergence of a singularity may lead
to the breakdown of isospectrality between partner potentials. One of the
regularization recipes is based on a topologically nontrivial, multisheeted
complex deformations of the line of coordinate $x$ giving the so called quantum
toboggan models (QTM). The consistent theoretical background of this recipe is
briefly reviewed. Then, certain supersymmetric QTM pairs are shown exceptional
and reducible to doublets of non-singular ordinary differential equations
a.k.a. Sturm-Schr\"odinger equations containing a weighted energy $E\to EW(x)$
and living in single complex plane.
