We use a dense redshift survey in the foreground of the Subaru GTO2deg^2 weak
lensing field (centered at $\alpha_{2000}$ = 16$^h04^m44^s$;$\delta_{2000}$
=43^\circ11^{\prime}24^{\prime\prime}$) to assess the completeness and comment
on the purity of massive halo identification in the weak lensing map. The
redshift survey (published here) includes 4541 galaxies; 4405 are new redshifts
measured with the Hectospec on the MMT. Among the weak lensing peaks with a
signal-to-noise greater that 4.25, 2/3 correspond to individual massive
systems; this result is essentially identical to the Geller et al. (2010) test
of the Deep Lens Survey field F2. The Subaru map, based on images in
substantially better seeing than the DLS, enables detection of less massive
halos at fixed redshift as expected. We demonstrate that the procedure adopted
by Miyazaki et al. (2007) for removing some contaminated peaks from the weak
lensing map improves agreement between the lensing map and the redshift survey
in the identification of candidate massive systems.
