The Kepler mission is providing photometric data of exquisite quality for the
asteroseismic study of different classes of pulsating stars. These analyses
place particular demands on the pre-processing of the data, over a range of
timescales from minutes to months. Here, we describe processing procedures
developed by the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium (KASC) to prepare
light curves that are optimized for the asteroseismic study of solar-like
oscillating stars in which outliers, jumps and drifts are corrected.
