Although a complete picture of the full evolution of complex quantum systems
would certainly be the most desirable goal, for particular Quantum Information
Processing schemes such an analysis is not necessary. When quantum correlations
between only specific elements of a many-body system are required for the
performance of a protocol, a more distinguished and specialised investigation
is helpful. Here, we provide a striking example with the achievement of perfect
state transfer in a spin chain without state initialisation, whose realisation
has been shown to be possible in virtue of the correlations set between the
first and last spin of the transmission-chain.
