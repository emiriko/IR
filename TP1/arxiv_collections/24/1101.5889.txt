We demonstrate significant modification of the electron-phonon energy loss
rate in a many-valley semiconductor system due to lattice mismatch induced
strain. We show that the thermal conductance from the electron system to the
phonon bath in strained n + Si, at phonon temperatures between 200 mK and 450
mK, is more than an order of magnitude lower than that for a similar unstrained
sample.
