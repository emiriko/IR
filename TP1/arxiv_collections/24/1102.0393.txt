On purpose to establish the differences in probabilities of spontaneous
radiative emission of an atom in a free space and in a nonuniform space with a
nanospheroid the field strength E and the density of states rho_E of the mode
n_10 of a free space and of the TM_0 nanocylinder mode are defined. A
nanocylinder is an approximate model of a nanospheroid. The probability of a
spontaneous transition is proportional to E^2*rho_E in the both cases. It is
found that the emission probability to the nanospheroid mode is hundreds times
and more higher than the spontaneous emission probability in the free space.
