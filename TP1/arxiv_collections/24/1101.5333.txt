We discuss the concepts of Weyl and Riemann frames in the context of metric
theories of gravity and state the fact that they are completely equivalent as
far as geodesic motion is concerned. We apply this result to conformally flat
spacetimes and show that a new picture arises when a Riemannian spacetime is
taken by means of geometrical gauge transformations into a Minkowskian flat
spacetime. We find out that in the Weyl frame gravity is described by a scalar
field. We give some examples of how conformally flat spacetime configurations
look when viewed from the standpoint of a Weyl frame. We show that in the
non-relativistic and weak field regime the Weyl scalar field may be identified
with the Newtonian gravitational potential. We suggest an equation for the
scalar field by varying the Einstein-Hilbert action restricted to the class of
conformally-flat spacetimes. We revisit Einstein and Fokker's interpretation of
Nordstr\"om scalar gravity theory and draw an analogy between this approach and
the Weyl gauge formalism. We briefly take a look at two-dimensional gravity as
viewed in the Weyl frame and address the question of quantizing a conformally
flat spacetime by going to the Weyl frame.
