The glass transition temperature ($T_g$) of polymer thin films has been a
subject of controversy in the last two decades. (Pseudo)thermodynamic
determinations of $T_g$ generally suggest a significant depression, whereas the
molecular mobility is found to be unchanged. The present study clarifies this
apparent controversy by assuming that the $T_g$ in thin films is determined not
only by the molecular mobility but also by the thickness of the film. This
hypothesis is supported by the analysis of literature results on polystyrene
thin films showing that the $T_g$ dependence on the cooling rate obtained on
samples with different thicknesses can be rescaled onto a master curve. The
thickness dependence of $T_g$ is quantitatively captured by an equilibration
mechanism based on free volume holes diffusion. This dependence emerges from
the ability of thinner films to maintain equilibrium, due to the shorter
distance free volume holes have to diffuse to the polymer interface, the
molecular motion determining the diffusion coefficient being thickness
independent.
