The process of pair creation by a photon in a constant and homogeneous
electromagnetic field of an arbitrary configuration is investigating. At high
energy the correction to the standard quasiclassical approximation (SQA) has
been calculated. In the region of intermediate photon energies where SQA is
inapplicable the new approximation, developed recently by authors, is used. The
influence of weak electric field on the process in a magnetic field is
considered. In particular, in the presence of electric field the root
divergence in the probability of pair creation on the Landau energy levels is
vanished. For smaller photon energies the low energy approximation is used. The
found probability describes the absorption of soft photon by particles created
by field. At low photon energy the electric field action dominates and the
influence of magnetic field on the process is connected with the interaction of
it and the magnetic moment of creating particles.
