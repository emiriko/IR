The aim of this study is to find an optimal mechanical design of the hadronic
calorimeter for SiD detector which takes into account engineering as well as
physics requirements. The study focuses on the crack effects between two
modules for various barrel mechanical design on calorimeter response. The
impact of different size of the supporting stringers and dead areas in an
active calorimeter layer along the module boundary has been studied for single
pions and muons. The emphasis has been put on the comparison of the projective
and non-projective barrel geometry for SiD hadronic calorimeter.
