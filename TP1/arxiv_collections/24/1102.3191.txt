We explore the relationship between limit linear series and fibers of Abel
maps in the case of curves with two smooth components glued at a single node.
To an r-dimensional limit linear series satisfying a certain exactness property
(weaker than the refinedness property of Eisenbud and Harris) we associate a
closed subscheme of the appropriate fiber of the Abel map. We then describe
this closed subscheme explicitly, computing its Hilbert polynomial and showing
that it is Cohen-Macaulay of pure dimension r. We show that this construction
is also compatible with one-parameter smoothings.
