In this paper we study the equivalence of nondeterministic automata pairing
the concept of a bisimulation with the recently introduced concept of a uniform
relation. In this symbiosis, uniform relations serve as equivalence relations
which relate states of two possibly different nondeterministic automata, and
bisimulations ensure compatibility with the transitions, initial and terminal
states of these automata. We define six types of bisimulations, but due to the
duality we discuss three of them: forward, backward-forward, and weak forward
bisimulations. For each od these three types of bisimulations we provide a
procedure which decides whether there is a bisimulation of this type between
two automata, and when it exists, the same procedure computes the greatest one.
We also show that there is a uniform forward bisimulation between two automata
if and only if the factor automata with respect to the greatest forward
bisimulation equivalences on these automata are isomorphic. We prove a similar
theorem for weak forward bisimulations, using the concept of a weak forward
isomorphism instead of an isomorphism. We also give examples that explain the
relationships between the considered types of bisimulations.
