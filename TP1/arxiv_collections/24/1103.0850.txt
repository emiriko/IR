In two-dimensional lattices the electronic levels are unevenly spaced, and
the density of states (DOS) displays a logarithmic divergence known as the Van
Hove singularity (VHS). This is the case in particular for the layered cuprate
superconductors. The scanning tunneling microscope (STM) probes the DOS, and is
therefore the ideal tool to observe the VHS. No STM study of cuprate
superconductors has reported such an observation so far giving rise to a debate
about the possibility of observing directly the normal state DOS in the
tunneling spectra. In this study, we show for the first time that the VHS is
unambiguously observed in STM measurements performed on the cuprate Bi-2201.
Beside closing the debate, our analysis proves the presence of the pseudogap in
the overdoped side of the phase diagram of Bi-2201 and discredits the scenario
of the pseudogap phase crossing the superconducting dome.
