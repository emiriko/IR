This work is an ab initio study of the 2p3 4So_3/2, and 2Do_{3/2,5/2} states
of C- and 2p2 3P_{0,1,2}, 1D_2, and 1S_0 states of neutral carbon. We use the
multi-configuration Hartree-Fock approach, focusing on the accuracy of the wave
function itself. We obtain all C- detachment thresholds, including correlation
effects to about 0.5%. Isotope shifts and hyperfine structures are calculated.
The achieved accuracy of the latter is of the order of 0.1 MHz.
Intra-configuration transition probabilities are also estimated.
