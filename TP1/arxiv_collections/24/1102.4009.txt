Models of spontaneous breaking of electroweak symmetry by a strong
interaction do not have fine tuning/hierarchy problem. They are conceptually
elegant and use the only mechanism of spontaneous breaking of a gauge symmetry
that is known to occur in nature. The simplest model, minimal technicolor with
extended technicolor interactions, is appealing because one can calculate by
scaling up from QCD. But it is ruled out on many counts: inappropriately low
quark and lepton masses (or excessive FCNC), bad electroweak data fits, light
scalar and vector states, etc. However, nature may not choose the minimal model
and then we are stuck: except possibly through lattice simulations, we are
unable to compute and test the models. In the LHC era it therefore makes sense
to abandon specific models (of strong EW breaking) and concentrate on generic
features that may indicate discovery. The Technicolor Straw Man is not a model
but a parametrized search strategy inspired by a remarkable generic feature of
walking technicolor, that technivector mesons are light, narrow and decay
readily into electroweak vector mesons and photons. While walking technicolor
is popular among practitioners, alternatives exist and the Straw Man may not
lead to their discovery.
