We introduce a simple framework to estimate the composite Higgs boson
coupling to two-photon in Technicolor extensions of the standard model. The
same framework allows us to predict the composite Higgs to two-gluon process.
We compare the decay rates with the standard model ones and show that the
corrections are typically of order one. We suggest, therefore, that the
two-photon decay process can be efficiently used to disentangle a light
composite Higgs from the standard model one. We also show that the Tevatron
results for the gluon-gluon fusion production of the Higgs either exclude the
techniquarks to carry color charges to the 95% confidence level, if the
composite Higgs is light, or that the latter must be heavier than around 200
GeV.
