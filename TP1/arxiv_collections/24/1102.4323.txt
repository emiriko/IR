This paper presents an estimate of the land area affected in the event of sea
level rise of 0.6 m, 1 m and 2 m for Mexican sates with coasts along Gulf of
Mexico. Likewise, the number of residents in vulnerable areas that would occur
in the scenario of sea level rise of 1 m is estimated. To do so, terrain
elevation data of NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission is used, along with a
proprietary algorithm that allows the reconstruction of the affected area. In
order to estimate the land area digital image processing is used. These results
are geo-referenced for comparison with human settlements in the regions of
interest. Results show that the total affected area corresponds to 1.26% of
Mexico national territorial extension and 3.18% of the Mexico total population.
174 settlements with 1000 inhabitants or more are expected to be affected. The
Mexican state with the largest area affected is Tabasco with more than 21% of
its territory, while the most vulnerable population will be Veracruz, with more
than 1 million people at risk if the scenario 1m increase would appear today.
Meanwhile, 81.1% Quintana Roo population will be at zones with high flood risk.
Vulnerable settlements are listed and the maps corresponding to different
Mexican states are shown.
