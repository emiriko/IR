JHK_S photometry is presented for a 35 arcmin square field centred on the
Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. With the aid of published kinematic data
definite galaxy members are identified and the width in J-K of the
colour-magnitude diagram is shown to be consistent with an old population of
stars with a large range in metal abundance. We identify two Asymptotic Giant
Branch variables, both carbon Miras, with periods of 189 and 554 days,
respectively, and discuss their ages, metallicities and mass loss as well as
their positions in the Mira period-luminosity diagram. There is evidence for a
general period-age relation for Local Group Miras. The mass-loss rate for the
554-day variable, MAG29, appears to be consistent with that found for Miras of
comparable period in other Local Group galaxies.
