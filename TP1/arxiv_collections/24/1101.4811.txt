We have measured the Hall effect on recently synthesized single crystals of
quasi-one-dimensional organic conductor TTF-TCNQ, a well known charge transfer
complex that has two kinds of conductive stacks: the donor (TTF) and the
acceptor (TCNQ) chains. The measurements were performed in the temperature
interval 30 K < T < 300 K and for several different magnetic field and current
directions through the crystal. By applying the equivalent isotropic sample
(EIS) approach, we have demonstrated the importance of the choice of optimal
geometry for accurate Hall effect measurements. Our results show, contrary to
past belief, that the Hall coefficient does not depend on the geometry of
measurements and that the Hall coefficient value is around zero in high
temperature region (T > 150 K), implying that there is no dominance of either
TTF or TCNQ chain. At lower temperatures, our measurements clearly prove that
all three phase transitions of TTF-TCNQ could be identified from Hall effect
measurements.
