Linear Programming (LP) decoding is emerging as an attractive alternative to
decode Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes. However, the earliest LP decoders
proposed for binary and nonbinary LDPC codes are not suitable for use at
moderate and large code lengths. To overcome this problem, Vontobel et al.
developed an iterative Low-Complexity LP (LCLP) decoding algorithm for binary
LDPC codes. The variable and check node calculations of binary LCLP decoding
algorithm are related to those of binary Belief Propagation (BP). The present
authors generalized this work to derive an iterative LCLP decoding algorithm
for nonbinary linear codes. Contrary to binary LCLP, the variable and check
node calculations of this algorithm are in general different from that of
nonbinary BP. The overall complexity of nonbinary LCLP decoding is linear in
block length; however the complexity of its check node calculations is
exponential in the check node degree. In this paper, we propose a modified BCJR
algorithm for efficient check node processing in the nonbinary LCLP decoding
algorithm. The proposed algorithm has complexity linear in the check node
degree. We also introduce an alternative state metric to improve the run time
of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results are presented for $(504, 252)$
and $(1008, 504)$ nonbinary LDPC codes over $\mathbb{Z}_4$.
