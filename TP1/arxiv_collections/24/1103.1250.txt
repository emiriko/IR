In this work, we have calculated some properties of the spin polarized
strange quark matter (SQM) in a strong magnetic field at zero temperature using
the MIT bag model. We have shown that the equation of state of spin polarized
SQM is stiffer than that of the unpolarized case. We have also computed the
structure properties of the spin polarized strange quark star (SQS) and have
found that the presence of magnetic field leads to a more stable SQS compared
to the unpolarized SQS.
