Metal-poor stars hold the key to our understanding of the origin of the
elements and the chemical evolution of the Universe. This chapter describes the
process of discovery of these rare stars, the manner in which their surface
abundances (produced in supernovae and other evolved stars) are determined from
the analysis of their spectra, and the interpretation of their abundance
patterns to elucidate questions of origin and evolution. More generally,
studies of these stars contribute to other fundamental areas that include
nuclear astrophysics, conditions at the earliest times, the nature of the first
stars, and the formation and evolution of galaxies -- including our own Milky
Way. We illustrate this with results from studies of lithium formed during the
Big Bang; of stars dated to within ~1 Gyr of that event; of the most metal-poor
stars, with abundance signatures very different from all other stars; and of
the build-up of the elements over the first several Gyr. The combination of
abundance and kinematic signatures constrains how the Milky Way formed, while
recent discoveries of extremely metal-poor stars in the Milky Way's dwarf
galaxy satellites constrain the hierarchical build-up of its stellar halo from
small dark-matter dominated systems. [abridged]
