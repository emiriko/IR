Data warehouses are the core of decision support sys- tems, which nowadays
are used by all kind of enter- prises in the entire world. Although many
studies have been conducted on the need of decision support systems (DSSs) for
small businesses, most of them adopt ex- isting solutions and approaches, which
are appropriate for large-scaled enterprises, but are inadequate for small and
middle-sized enterprises. Small enterprises require cheap, lightweight
architec- tures and tools (hardware and software) providing on- line data
analysis. In order to ensure these features, we review web-based business
intelligence approaches. For real-time analysis, the traditional OLAP
architecture is cumbersome and storage-costly; therefore, we also re- view
in-memory processing. Consequently, this paper discusses the existing approa-
ches and tools working in main memory and/or with web interfaces (including
freeware tools), relevant for small and middle-sized enterprises in decision
making.
