We study a unification model for dark energy, dark matter, and inflation with
a single scalar field with non canonical kinetic term. In this model the
kinetic term of the Lagrangian accounts for the dark matter and dark energy,
and at early epochs a quadratic potential accounts for slow roll inflation. The
present work is an extension to the work by Bose and Majumdar [1] with a more
general kinetic term that was proposed by Chimento in [2]. We demonstrate that
the model is viable at the background and linear perturbation levels.
