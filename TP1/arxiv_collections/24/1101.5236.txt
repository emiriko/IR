We investigate magnetotransport in a ferromagnetic/normal/ferromagnetic
graphene junction where a gate electrode is attached to the normal segment. It
is shown that the charge conductance can be maximal at an antiparallel
configuration of the magnetizations. Moreover, we demonstrate that both the
magnitude and the sign of the spin-transfer torque can be controlled by means
of the gate voltage in the normal segment. In this way, the present system
constitutes a spin-transfer torque transistor. These anomalous phenomena are
attributed to the combined effect of the exchange field and the Dirac
dispersion of graphene. Our prediction opens up the possibility of moving
domain walls parallel or antiparallel to the current in a controllable fashion
by means of a local gate voltage.
