The leading order interaction between a Goldstone boson and a matter field is
universally dominated by the Weinberg-Tomozawa term. Based on this observation,
we predict a rich spectrum of bound states of a kaon and a heavy meson. We
argue that if the lifetime of an excited heavy meson is significantly longer
than the range of forces, then the finite width of that state can be neglected
in a first approximation. Then, the D_{s0}^*(2317), D_{s1}(2460), D_{sJ}(2860)
and D_{sJ}(3040) are generated as DK, D^*K, D_1(2420)K and D^*(2600)K bound
states, respectively. In addition to the remarkable agreement with the measured
masses, the decay patterns of the D_{sJ}(2860) and D_{sJ}(3040) can also be
understood. Two more D_{sJ} states, and kaonic bound states with the bottom
mesons as well as the doubly charmed baryon are also predicted.
