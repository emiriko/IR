In this article, we study unitary rational solutions of the associative
Yang-Baxter equation with three spectral parameters. We explain how such
solutions arise from the geometry of vector bundles on a cuspidal cubic curve.
Moreover, we investigate how these solutions are related to the quantum and
classical Yang-Baxter equations.
