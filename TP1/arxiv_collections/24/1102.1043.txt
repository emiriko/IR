We analyze two-center interference effects in the yields of ionization of a
dissociating hydrogen molecular ion by an ultrashort VUV laser pulse. To this
end, we performed numerical simulations of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger
equation for a H$_2^+$ model ion interacting with two time-delayed laser
pulses. The scenario considered corresponds to a pump-probe scheme, in which
the first (pump) pulse excites the molecular ion to the first excited
dissociative state and the second (probe) pulse ionizes the electron as the ion
dissociates. The results of our numerical simulations for the ionization yield
as a function of the time delay between the two pulses exhibit characteristic
oscillations due to interferences between the partial electron waves emerging
from the two protons in the dissociating hydrogen molecular ion. We show that
the photon energy of the pump pulse should be in resonance with the $\sigma_g -
\sigma_u$ transition and the pump pulse duration should not exceed 5 fs in
order to generate a well confined nuclear wavepacket. The spreading of the
nuclear wavepacket during the dissociation is found to cause a decrease of the
amplitudes of the oscillations as the time delay increases. We develop an
analytical model to fit the oscillations and show how dynamic information about
the nuclear wavepacket, namely velocity, mean internuclear distance and
spreading, can be retrieved from the oscillations. The predictions of the
analytical model are tested well against the results of our numerical
simulations.
