Batch codes, introduced by Ishai, Kushilevitz, Ostrovsky and Sahai in [1],
are methods for solving the following data storage problem: n data items are to
be stored in m servers in such a way that any k of the n items can be retrieved
by reading at most t items from each server, and that the total number of items
stored in m servers is N . A Combinatorial batch code (CBC) is a batch code
where each data item is stored without change, i.e., each stored data item is a
copy of one of the n data items. One of the basic yet challenging problems is
to find optimal CBCs, i.e., CBCs for which total storage (N) is minimal for
given values of n, m, k, and t. In [2], Paterson, Stinson and Wei exclusively
studied CBCs and gave constructions of some optimal CBCs. In this article, we
give a lower bound on the total storage (N) for CBCs. We give explicit
construction of optimal CBCs for a range of values of n. For a different range
of values of n, we give explicit construction of optimal and almost optimal
CBCs. Our results partly settle an open problem of [2].
