RHIC experiments have recently measured the azimuthal correlation function of
forward di-hadrons. The data show a disappearance of the away-side peak in
central d+Au collisions, compared to p+p collisions, as was predicted by
saturation physics. Indeed, we argue that this effect, absent at mid-rapidity,
is a consequence of the small-x evolution into the saturation regime of the
Gold nucleus wave function. We show that the data are well described in the
Color Glass Condensate framework.
