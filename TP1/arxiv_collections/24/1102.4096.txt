We report some improvements to the gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE)
algorithm for optimal control of quantum systems. These include more accurate
gradients, convergence acceleration using the BFGS quasi-Newton algorithm as
well as faster control derivative calculation algorithms. In all test systems,
the wall clock time and the convergence rates show a considerable improvement
over the approximate gradient ascent.
