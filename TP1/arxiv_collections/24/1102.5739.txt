Random 1/2-disk routing in wireless ad-hoc networks is a localized geometric
routing scheme in which each node chooses the next relay randomly among the
nodes within its transmission range and in the general direction of the
destination. We introduce a notion of convergence for geometric routing schemes
that not only considers the feasibility of packet delivery through possibly
multi-hop relaying, but also requires the packet delivery to occur in a finite
number of hops. We derive sufficient conditions that ensure the asymptotic
\emph{convergence} of the random 1/2-disk routing scheme based on this
convergence notion, and by modeling the packet distance evolution to the
destination as a Markov process, we derive bounds on the expected number of
hops that each packet traverses to reach its destination.
