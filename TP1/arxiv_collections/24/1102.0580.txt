We give constructions of n^k x n^k x n tensors of rank at least 2n^k -
O(n^(k-1)). As a corollary we obtain an [n]^r shaped tensor with rank at least
2n^(r/2) - O(n^(r/2)-1) when r is odd. The tensors are constructed from a
simple recursive pattern, and the lower bounds are proven using a partitioning
theorem developed by Brockett and Dobkin. These two bounds are improvements
over the previous best-known explicit tensors that had ranks n^k and n^(r/2)
respectively
