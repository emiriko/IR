This paper presents feasible experimental schemes to realize controlled
teleportation protocols via photonic Faraday rotations in low-Q cavities. The
schemes deal with controlled teleportation of superposition states and
two-particle entanglement of atomic states. The information is encoded in
three-level atoms in a lambda configuration trapped inside coupled cavities by
optical fibers. Also, we estimate the success probability and the current
feasibility of the schemes.
