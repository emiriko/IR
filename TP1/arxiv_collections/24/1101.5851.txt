We provide an improvement over Meshulam's bound on cap sets in $F_3^N$. We
show that there exist universal $\epsilon>0$ and $C>0$ so that any cap set in
$F_3^N$ has size at most $C {3^N \over N^{1+\epsilon}}$. We do this by
obtaining quite strong information about the additive combinatorial properties
of the large spectrum.
