A prototype of digital frequency multiplexing electronics allowing the real
time monitoring of kinetic inductance detector (KIDs) arrays for mm-wave
astronomy has been developed. It requires only 2 coaxial cables for
instrumenting a large array. For that, an excitation comb of frequencies is
generated and fed through the detector. The direct frequency synthesis and the
data acquisition relies heavily on a large FPGA using parallelized and
pipelined processing. The prototype can instrument 128 resonators (pixels) over
a bandwidth of 125 MHz. This paper describes the technical solution chosen, the
algorithm used and the results obtained.
