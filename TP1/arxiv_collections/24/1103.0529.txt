Given a nondegenerate ternary form $f=f(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ of degree 4 over an
algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, we use the geometry of K3
surfaces to construct a certain positive-dimensional family of irreducible
representations of the generalized Clifford algebra associated to $f.$ From
this we obtain the existence of linear Pfaffian representations of the quartic
surface $X_f=\{w^4=f(x_1,x_2,x_3)\},$ as well as information on the
Brill-Noether theory of a general smooth curve in the linear system
$|\mathcal{O}_{X_f}(3)|.$
