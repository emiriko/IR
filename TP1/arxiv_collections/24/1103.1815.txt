The performance of the magnets plays an important role in the functioning of
an accelerator. Most of the magnets are designed at the accelerator laboratory
and built by industry. The link between the laboratory and the manufacturer is
the contract containing the Technical Specifications of the magnets. For an
overview of the contents of the Technical Specifications, the specifications
for the magnets of ALBA (bending, quadrupole, and sextupole) are described in
this paper. The basic rules of magnet design are reviewed in Appendix A.
