In the present calculation of the inner solution of gravity field equation
with spherical symmetry, in order to avoid the singularity appearing in the
center of sphere, we actually let the integral constant to be zero. It is
proved in this paper that the constant can not be zero. The metric of inner
gravity field of hollow sphere is calculated at first. Then let the inner
radius of hollow sphere become zero, we obtain the metric of inner gravity
field of solid sphere. Based on the definition of energy momentum tensor of
general relativity, the gravity masses of hollow and solid spheres in curved
space are calculated strictly. The results indicate that no matter what the
masses and densities of hollow sphere and solid sphere are, space-time
singularities would appear in the centers of spheres. Meanwhile, no matter what
the mass and density are, the intensity of pressure at the center point of
solid sphere can not be infinite. That is to say, the material can not collapse
towards the center of so-called black hole. In stead, it may be that there
exist the spherical surfaces of infinite pressure inside the hollow and solid
spheres, and material would collapse toward the surfaces so that the common
spheres are unsteady. At the center of solid sphere and on its neighboring
region, pressure intensities would become negative values. There may be a
region for hollow sphere in which pressure intensities would become negative
values too. The results only indicate that the singularity black holes
predicated by general relativity are caused by the descriptive method of curved
space-time and can not exist in nature actually. If black holes exist really in
the universe, they can only be the Newtonian black holes, not the Einstein's
black holes.
