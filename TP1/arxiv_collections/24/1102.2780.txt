Reliable detection of single electron tunneling in quantum dots (QD) is
paramount to use this category of device for quantum information processing.
Here, we report charge sensing in a degenerately phosphorus-doped silicon QD by
means of a capacitively coupled single-electron tunneling device made of the
same material. Besides accurate counting of tunneling events in the QD, we
demonstrate that this architecture can be operated to reveal asymmetries in the
transport characteristic of the QD. Indeed, the observation of gate voltage
shifts in the detector's response as the QD bias is changed is an indication of
variable tunneling rates.
