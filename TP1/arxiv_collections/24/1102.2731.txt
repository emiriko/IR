Distinguishability takes a crucial rule in studying observability of hybrid
system such as switched system. Recently, for two linear systems, Lou and Si
gave a condition not only necessary but also sufficient to the
distinguishability of linear systems. However, the condition is not easy enough
to verify. This paper will give a new equivalent condition which is relatively
easy to verify.
