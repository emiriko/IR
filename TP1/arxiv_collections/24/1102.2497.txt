The probability representation of quantum and classical statistical mechanics
is discussed. Symplectic tomography, center-of-mass tomography, and spin
tomography are studied. The connection of tomographic probabilities with
dynamic symmetries like symplectic group is considered. Entropic uncertainty
relations and inequalities for spin tomograms are reviewed.
