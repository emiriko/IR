Investigate the spatial and spectral evolution of hard X-ray (HXR) emission
from flare accelerated electron beams subject to collisional transport and
wave-particle interactions in the solar atmosphere. We numerically follow the
propagation of a power-law of accelerated electrons in 1D space and time with
the response of the background plasma in the form of Langmuir waves using the
quasilinear approximation.}{We find that the addition of wave-particle
interactions to collisional transport for a transient initially injected
electron beam flattens the spectrum of the footpoint source. The coronal source
is unchanged and so the difference in the spectral indices between the coronal
and footpoint sources is \Delta \gamma > 2, which is larger than expected from
purely collisional transport. A steady-state beam shows little difference
between the two cases, as has been previously found, as a transiently injected
electron beam is required to produce significant wave growth, especially at
higher velocities. With this transiently injected beam the wave-particle
interactions dominate in the corona whereas the collisional losses dominate in
the chromosphere. The shape of the spectrum is different with increasing
electron beam density in the wave-particle interaction case whereas with purely
collisional transport only the normalisation is changed. We also find that the
starting height of the source electron beam above the photosphere affects the
spectral index of the footpoint when Langmuir wave growth is included. This may
account for the differing spectral indices found between double footpoints if
asymmetrical injection has occurred in the flaring loop.
