A study of high pressure solid Te was carried out at room temperature using
Raman spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The
analysis of the P-dependence of the experi- mental phonon spectrum reveals the
occurrence of phase transitions at 4 GPa and 8 GPa confirming the high-pressure
scenario recently proposed. The effects of the incommensurate lattice
modulation on the vibrational properties of Te is discussed. DFT calculations
agree with present and previous experimental data and show the metallization
process at 4 GPa being due to the development of charge-bridges between atoms
belonging to adjacent chains. A first-principles study of the stability of the
4 GPa phase is reported and discussed also in the light of the insurgence of
lattice modulation.
