We study the robustness of the spectrum emitted by an acoustic black hole by
considering series of stationary flows that become either subsonic or
supersonic, i.e. when the horizon disappears. We work with the superluminal
Bogoliubov dispersion of Bose--Einstein condensates. We find that the spectrum
remains remarkably Planckian until the horizon disappears. When the flow is
everywhere supersonic, new pair creation channels open. This will be the
subject of a forthcoming work.
