We present a supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model in which only one
electroweak doublet acquires a vacuum expectation value and gives mass to
Standard Model fermions. As well as the novel accommodation of a Standard Model
Higgs within a supersymmetric framework, this leads to a very predictive model,
with some advantages over the MSSM. In particular, problems with proton decay,
flavour changing neutral currents and large CP violation are ameliorated,
primarily due to the presence of an anomaly-free R-symmetry. Since
supersymmetry must be broken at a low scale, gravity-mediated effects which
break the R-symmetry are naturally small. The R-symmetry requires the presence
of adjoint chiral superfields, to give Dirac masses to the gauginos; these
adjoints are the only non-MSSM fields in the visible sector. The LSP is a very
light neutralino, which is mostly bino. Such a light neutralino is not in
conflict with experiment, and is a striking prediction of the minimal model.
Additional scenarios to raise the mass of this neutralino to the weak scale are
also outlined. Prospects for discovery at the LHC are briefly discussed, along
with viable scenarios for achieving gauge-coupling unification.
