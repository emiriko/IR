We present the complete automation of the computation of one-loop QCD
corrections, including UV renormalization, to an arbitrary scattering process
in the Standard Model. This is achieved by embedding the OPP integrand
reduction technique, as implemented in CutTools, into the MadGraph framework.
By interfacing the tool so constructed, which we dub MadLoop, with MadFKS, the
fully automatic computation of any infrared-safe observable at the
next-to-leading order in QCD is attained. We demonstrate the flexibility and
the reach of our method by calculating the production rates for a variety of
processes at the 7 TeV LHC.
