We calculate the spin susceptibility in the s_{+-} and s_{++} superconducting
states of the iron pnictides using the effective five orbital model and
considering the quasiparticle damping. For the experimentally evaluated
magnitude of the quasiparticle damping and the superconducting gap, the results
at the wave vector ~ (pi,0) show that the s_{+-} state is more consistent with
the neutron scattering experiments, while for larger quasiparticle damping and
the superconducting gap, the s_{++} state can be more consistent. To
distinguish between two cases that reproduce the experiments at the wave vector
~ (pi,0), we propose to investigate experimentally the wave vector ~ (pi,pi).
