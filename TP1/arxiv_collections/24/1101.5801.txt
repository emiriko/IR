We present the results of two color VR observation of the Algol-type binary
system WZ Crv (12h44m15.19s, -21d25m35.4s) which were obtained using the
remotely controlled telescope TOA-150 of Tzec Maun Observatory. We determined
the moments of individual minima, the orbital period and its derivative, the
initial epoch, color indices V-R and temperature estimates of the components.
Also we noticed that the phase curve is asymmetric: the second maximum is
higher than the first one. It indicates that there is a spot in the photosphere
of one of the stars in this system.
