In recent studies of methanol masers, a substantial fraction of the objects
show maser components aligned in large-scale elliptical configurations. These
can be readily interpreted as rings centred on a high mass star in formation,
seen in projection. Remarkably, most of these rings do not show signs of
rotation, but rather the radial motions dominate. This must mean that their
dynamics are governed by other than gravitational forces. In particular, we
have studied the methanol masers around Cep A in detail, where it can be argued
that the methanol masers show signs of infall. In this paper we discuss the
dynamics of the Cep A methanol maser and sources from the Torun blind survey to
argue that at least in a fraction of sources methanol masers could be
associated with the shock interface between the large scale accretion,
regulated by the magnetic field, and a 1000-AU scale circumstellar disk. We
discuss the validity of such a model for the overall population of methanol
maser sources.
