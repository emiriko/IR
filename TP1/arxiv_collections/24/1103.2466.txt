The orthosymplectic extension of the Interacting Vector Boson Model (IVBM) is
used for the simultaneous description of the spectra of different families of
neighboring heavy nuclei. The structure of even-even nuclei is used as a core
on which the collective excitations of the neighboring odd-mass and odd-odd
nuclei are built on. Hence, the spectra of the odd-mass and odd-odd nuclei
arise as a result of the consequent and self-consistent coupling of the fermion
degrees of freedom of the odd particles, specified by the fermion sector
$SO^{F}(2\Omega)\subset OSp(2\Omega/12,R)$, to the boson core which states
belong to an $Sp^{B}(12,R)$ irreducible representation.
  The theoretical predictions for different low-lying collective bands with
positive and negative parity for two sets of neighboring nuclei with distinct
collective properties are compared with experiment and IBM/IBFM/IBFFM
predictions. The obtained results reveal the applicability of the used
dynamical symmetry of the model.
