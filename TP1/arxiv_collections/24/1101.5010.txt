Radio emission in the direction of galaxy clusters is due to the individual
emission of AGNs, and to the diffuse non-thermal emission of the intracluster
medium (ICM). The population of AGNs in clusters is correlated to the overall
halo properties, and likely impacts their evolutions. In order to better
understand this connection (which will also leads to constraints on the
non-thermal ICMemission for lower mass systems), we are conducting a
statistical analysis of the radio emission in the direction of a large number
of X-ray clusters. By means of their stacked radio emission, we are
investigating the radio luminosities in clusters of galaxies with respect to
their mass, with the goal to better understand their link to and their imprint
on the intra-cluster gas physics.
