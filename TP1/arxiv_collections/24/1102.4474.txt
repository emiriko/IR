We extend the two-dimensional two-layer outer gap model to a
three-dimensional geometry and use it to study the high-energy emission of the
Vela pulsar. In this model, the outer gap is divided into two parts, i.e. the
main acceleration region on the top of last-open field lines and the screening
region around the upper boundary of the gap. In the main acceleration region,
the charge density is much lower than the Goldreich-Julian charge density and
the charged particles are accelerated by the electric field along the magnetic
field to emit multi-GeV photons. In the screening region, the charge density is
larger than the Goldreich-Julian value to close the gap and particles in this
region are responsible for multi-100MeV photon emission. We apply this three
dimensional two-layer model to the Vela pulsar and compare the model light
curves, the phase-averaged spectrum and the phase-resolved spectra with the
recent Fermi observations, which also reveals the existence of the third peak
between two main peaks. The phase position of the third peak moves with the
photon energy, which cannot be explained by the geometry of magnetic field
structure and the caustic effects of the photon propagation. We suggest that
the existence of the third peak and its energy dependent movement results from
the azimuthal structure of the outer gap.
