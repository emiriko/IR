In this paper we study various approaches for exploiting symmetries in
polynomial optimization problems within the framework of semi definite
programming relaxations. Our special focus is on constrained problems
especially when the symmetric group is acting on the variables. In particular,
we investigate the concept of block decomposition within the framework of
constrained polynomial optimization problems, show how the degree principle for
the symmetric group can be computationally exploited and also propose some
methods to efficiently compute in the geometric quotient.
