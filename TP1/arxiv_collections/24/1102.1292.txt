This paper proposes the problem of modeling video sequences of dynamic swarms
(DS). We define DS as a large layout of stochastically repetitive spatial
configurations of dynamic objects (swarm elements) whose motions exhibit local
spatiotemporal interdependency and stationarity, i.e., the motions are similar
in any small spatiotemporal neighborhood. Examples of DS abound in nature,
e.g., herds of animals and flocks of birds. To capture the local spatiotemporal
properties of the DS, we present a probabilistic model that learns both the
spatial layout of swarm elements and their joint dynamics that are modeled as
linear transformations. To this end, a spatiotemporal neighborhood is
associated with each swarm element, in which local stationarity is enforced
both spatially and temporally. We assume that the prior on the swarm dynamics
is distributed according to an MRF in both space and time. Embedding this model
in a MAP framework, we iterate between learning the spatial layout of the swarm
and its dynamics. We learn the swarm transformations using ICM, which iterates
between estimating these transformations and updating their distribution in the
spatiotemporal neighborhoods. We demonstrate the validity of our method by
conducting experiments on real video sequences. Real sequences of birds, geese,
robot swarms, and pedestrians evaluate the applicability of our model to real
world data.
