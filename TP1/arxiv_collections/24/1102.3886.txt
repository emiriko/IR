This is a general work on gravitational lensing. We present new expressions
for the optical scalars and the deflection angle in terms of the
energy-momentum tensor components of matter distributions. Our work generalizes
standard references in the literature where normally stringent assumptions are
made on the sources. The new expressions are manifestly gauge invariant, since
they are presented in terms of curvature components. We also present a method
of approximation for solving the lens equations, that can be applied to any
order.
