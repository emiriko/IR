We present the results of searches for dipolar-type anisotropies in different
energy ranges above $2.5\times 10^{17}$ eV with the surface detector array of
the Pierre Auger Observatory, reporting on both the phase and the amplitude
measurements of the first harmonic modulation in the right-ascension
distribution. Upper limits on the amplitudes are obtained, which provide the
most stringent bounds at present, being below 2% at 99% $C.L.$ for EeV
energies. We also compare our results to those of previous experiments as well
as with some theoretical expectations.
