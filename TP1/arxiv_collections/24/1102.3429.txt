The appearance of spin-1 resonances associated to the electroweak symmetry
breaking (EWSB) sector is expected in many extensions of the Standard Model. We
analyze the CERN Large Hadron Collider potential to probe the spin of possible
new charged and neutral vector resonances through the purely leptonic processes
pp --> Z^\prime --> l^+ l^{\prime -} Emiss_T, and pp --> W^\prime --> l^{\prime
\pm} l^+ l^- Emiss_T, with l, l^\prime = e or \mu. We perform a model
independent analysis and demonstrate that the spin of the new states can be
determined with 99% CL in a large fraction of the parameter space where these
resonances can be observed with 100 fb^{-1}. We show that the best sensitivity
to the spin is obtained by directly studying correlations between the final
state leptons, without the need of reconstructing the events in their
center-of-mass frames.
