We report large transport critical current densities observed in Ag-added
(Ba,K)Fe2As2 superconducting wires prepared by an ex-situ powder-in-tube (PIT)
process. The wire has a simple composite structure sheathed only by Ag. A
precursor bulk material prepared by a melting process was ground into powder
and put into a Ag tube. The composite was then cold worked into a wire and heat
treated at 850$^\circ$C for sintering. Transport critical current densities,
Jc, at 4.2 K are 1.0\times104 A/cm2 (Ic = 60.7 A) in self field and
1.1\times103 A/cm2 (Ic = 6.6 A) in 10 T. These are the highest values reported
so far for the Fe-based superconducting wires.
