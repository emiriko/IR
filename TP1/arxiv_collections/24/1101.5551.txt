This paper is a continuation of the paper [arXiv:0911.4725], investigating a
natural radial deformation of the Fourier transform in the setting of Clifford
analysis. At the same time, it gives extensions of many results obtained in
[arXiv:0907.3749]. We establish the analogues of Bochner's formula and the
Heisenberg uncertainty relation in the framework of the (holomorphic) Hermite
semigroup, and also give a detailed analytic treatment of the series expansion
of the associated integral transform.
