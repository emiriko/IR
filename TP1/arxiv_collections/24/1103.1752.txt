A self-consistent, mean-field model of charge-carrier injection and unipolar
transport in an organic semiconductor diode is developed utilizing the
effective transport energy concept and taking into account a realistic
density-of-states distribution as well as the presence of trap states in an
organic material. The consequences resulting from the model are discussed
exemplarily on the basis of an indium tin oxide/organic semiconductor/metallic
conductor structure. A comparison of the theory to experimental data of a
unipolar indium tin oxide/poly-3-hexyl-thiophene/Al device is presented.
