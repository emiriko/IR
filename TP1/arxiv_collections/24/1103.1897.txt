Electron emission from the negative electron affinity (NEA) surface of
hydrogen terminated, boron doped diamond in the [100] orientation is
investigated using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). ARPES
measurements using 16 eV synchrotron and 6 eV laser light are compared and
found to show a catastrophic failure of the sudden approximation. While the
high energy photoemission is found to yield little information regarding the
NEA, low energy laser ARPES reveals for the first time that the NEA results
from a novel Franck-Condon mechanism coupling electrons in the conduction band
to the vacuum. The result opens the door to development of a new class of NEA
electron emitters based on this effect.
