We present a stability analysis of an interacting two-species Bose-Einstein
condensate driven by a quantized field in the semi-classical limit. Transitions
from Rabi to Josephson dynamics are identified depending on both the
inter-atomic interaction to field-condensate coupling ratio and the ratio
between the total excitation number and the condensate size. The quantized
field is found to produce asymmetric dynamics for symmetric initial conditions
for both Rabi and Josephson oscillations.
