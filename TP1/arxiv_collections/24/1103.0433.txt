In this work we investigate the inverse of the celebrated
Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture. Using two inversion methods we compute a
one-dimensional potential whose lowest N eigenvalues obey random matrix
statistics. Our numerical results indicate that in the asymptotic limit,
N->infinity, the solution is nowhere differentiable and most probably nowhere
continuous. Thus such a counterexample does not exist.
