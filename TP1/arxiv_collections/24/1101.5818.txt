We use our theory of periodized discrete elasticity to characterize defects
in graphene as the cores of dislocations or groups of dislocations. Earlier
numerical implementations of the theory predicted some of the simpler defect
groupings observed in subsequent Transmission Electron Microscope experiments.
Here we derive the more complicated defect groupings of three or four defect
pairs from our theory, show that they correspond to the cores of two pairs of
dislocation dipoles and ascertain their stability.
