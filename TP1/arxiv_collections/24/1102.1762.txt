The existence of a rotational band with the $\alpha$+$^{12}$C($0_2^+$)
cluster structure, in which three $\alpha$ particles in $^{12}$C($0_2^+$) are
locally condensed, is demonstrated near the four-$\alpha$ threshold of $^{16}$O
in agreement with experiment. This is achieved by studying structure and
scattering for the $\alpha$+$^{12}$C($0_2^+$) system in a unified way. A
drastic reduction (quenching) of the moment of the inertia of the $0^+$ state
at 15.1 MeV just above the four-$\alpha$ threshold in $^{16}$O suggests that it
could be a candidate for the superfluid state in $\alpha$-particle
condensation.
