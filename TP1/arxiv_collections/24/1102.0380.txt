A discrete analogue of the dynamical (Kapitza) trapping effect, known for
classical and quantum particles in rapidly oscillating potentials, is proposed
for light waves in modulated graded-index waveguide lattices. As in the
non-modulated waveguide lattice a graded-index potential can confine light at
either normal or Bragg angle incidence, periodic modulation of the potential in
the longitudinal direction enables to trap optical beams at both normal and
Bragg incidence angles.
