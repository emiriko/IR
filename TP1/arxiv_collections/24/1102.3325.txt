The goal of video games is to challenge and entertain the players. Successful
video games deliver experience that impact players on a level of arousal.
Therefore undertaking a user experience (UX) study is crucial to ensure that a
game achieves both critical and financial success. However, traditional
usability methods (observation, subjective reporting, questionnaire, and
interview) have a number of limitations on game user research. In this study we
capture player's physiological measures during a gameplay session, to indicate
micro-events that have caused changes in their body signals. At the
post-gameplay interviews we ask participants to comment and describe their
feelings on the selected events. The aim of this study is not to over-interpret
physiological measures, but on using blips in measures to help identify key
points in a game, which we then use to investigate further with the
participant. This approach provides a method that can identify not only the
negative user experience and usability issues but also the events which have a
positive impact on player's experience.
