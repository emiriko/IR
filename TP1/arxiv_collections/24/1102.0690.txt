This paper derives a novel sum-rate outer bound for the general memoryless
interference channel with three users. The derivation is a generalization of
the techniques developed by Kramer and by Etkin et al for the Gaussian two-user
channel. For the three-user Gaussian channel the proposed sum-rate outer bound
outperforms known bounds for certain channel parameters.
