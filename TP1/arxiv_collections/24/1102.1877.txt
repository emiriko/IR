We present recent results on bulk observables and electromagnetic probes
obtained using a hybrid approach based on the Ultrarelativistic Quantum
Molecular Dynamics transport model with an intermediate hydrodynamic stage for
the description of heavy-ion collisions at AGS, SPS and RHIC energies. After
briefly reviewing the main results for particle multiplicities, elliptic flow,
transverse momentum and rapidity spectra, we focus on photon and dilepton
emission from hot and dense hadronic matter.
