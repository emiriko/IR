We study heat transport for solids in the presence of arbitrary
time-dependent force. Using nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) approach we
present an exact analytical expression of current for the linear system. We
found that the heat current can be expressed in terms of the displacement of
the atoms in the center and the self energy of the baths. We carry out the
calculation for the oscillatory driven force and study the steady state
properties for one-dimensional linear chain and two-dimensional square lattice.
We found that the heat current is related to the density of states of the
system and is independent of the bath temperature in ballistic transport. The
baths absorb energy only when their intrinsic frquency resonates with the
applied frequency We also generalize the problem for multiple heat baths with
different temperatures. We also discuss the effect due to nonlinear
interactions in the center.
