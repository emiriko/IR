Dipole models based on various saturation scenarios provide reasonable fits
to small-x DIS inclusive, diffractive and exclusive data from HERA. Proton
un-integrated gluon distributions extracted from such fits are employed in a
$k_\bot$-factorization framework to calculate inclusive gluon distributions at
various energies. The n-particle multiplicity distribution predicted in the
Glasma flux tube approach shows good agreement with data over a wide range of
energies. Hadron inclusive transverse momentum distributions expressed in terms
of the saturation scale demonstrate universal behavior over a wider kinematic
range systematically with increasing center of mass energies.
