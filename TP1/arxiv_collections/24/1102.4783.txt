We use piecewise polynomials to define tropical cocycles generalising the
well-known notion of tropical Cartier divisors to higher codimensions. Groups
of cocycles are tropical analogues of Chow cohomology groups. We also introduce
an intersection product of cocycles with tropical cycles - the counterpart of
the classical cap product - and prove that this gives rise to a Poincar\'e
duality in some cases.
