This paper outlines some new observational and data processing techniques for
enhancing the dynamic range of low frequency images obtained with the Giant
Metrewave Radio Telescope. We illustrate new software tools developed to
facilitate visibility editing and calibration as well as other preprocessing
required to enhance the dynamic range of images from a planned survey.
