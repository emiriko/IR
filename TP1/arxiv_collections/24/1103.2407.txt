Three low-valence layered nickelates with general formula
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ ($\delta$=0.0, 0.5, 1) are studied by ab initio
techniques. Both the insulating and metallic limits are analyzed, together with
the compound at the Mott transition ($\delta$= 0.5; Ni$^{2+}$), that shows
insulating behavior, with all Ni atoms in a S=1 high-spin state. The compound
in the $\delta$= 1 limit (La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$), with mean formal valence
Ni$^{1.5+}$ and hence nominally metallic, nevertheless shows a correlated {\it
molecular} insulating state, produced by the quantum confinement of the NiO$_2$
bilayers and the presence of mainly d$_{z^2}$ bands (bonding-antibonding split)
around the gap. The metallic compound shows a larger bandwidth of the e$_g$
states that can sustain the experimentally observed paramagnetic metallic
properties. The evolution of the in-plane antiferromagnetic coupling with the
oxygen content is discussed, and also the similarities of this series of
compounds with the layered superconducting cuprates.
