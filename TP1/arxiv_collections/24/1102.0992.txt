We recall the physical features of the parton distributions in the quantum
statistical approach of the nucleon, which allows to describe simultaneously,
unpolarized and polarized Deep Inelastic Scattering data. Some predictions from
a next-to-leading order QCD analysis are compared to recent experimental
results and we stress the importance of some tests in the high-$x$ region, to
confirm the validity of this approach.
