We present a novel automated methodology to detect and classify periodic
variable stars in a large database of photometric time series. The methods are
based on multivariate Bayesian statistics and use a multi-stage approach. We
applied our method to the ground-based data of the TrES Lyr1 field, which is
also observed by the Kepler satellite, covering ~26000 stars. We found many
eclipsing binaries as well as classical non-radial pulsators, such as slowly
pulsating B stars, Gamma Doradus, Beta Cephei and Delta Scuti stars. Also a few
classical radial pulsators were found.
