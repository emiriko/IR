We present an implementation of the calculation of the production of W^+W^+
plus two jets at hadron colliders, at next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD, in
the POWHEG framework, which is a method that allows the interfacing of NLO
calculations to shower Monte Carlo programs. This is the first 2 -> 4 process
to be described to NLO accuracy within a shower Monte Carlo framework. The
implementation was built within the POWHEGBOX package. We discuss a few
technical improvements that were needed in the POWHEGBOX to deal with the
computer intensive nature of the NLO calculation, and argue that further
improvements are possible, so that the method can match the complexity that is
reached today in NLO calculations. We have interfaced our POWHEG implementation
with PYTHIA and HERWIG, and present some phenomenological results, discussing
similarities and differences between the pure NLO and the POWHEG+PYTHIA
calculation both for inclusive and more exclusive distributions. We have made
the relevant code available at the POWHEGBOX web site.
