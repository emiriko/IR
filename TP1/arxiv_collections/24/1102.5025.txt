The beta Cephei stars and slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars are massive main
sequence variables. The strength of their pulsational driving strongly depends
on the opacity of iron-group elements. As many of those stars naturally occur
in young open clusters, whose metallicities can be determined in several
fundamental ways, it is logical to study the incidence of pulsation in several
young open clusters. To provide the foundation for such an investigation,
Str\"omgren-Crawford uvbybeta photometry of open cluster target stars was
carried out to determine effective temperatures, luminosities, and therefore
cluster memberships. In the course of three observing runs, uvbybeta photometry
for 168 target stars was acquired and transformed into the standard system by
measurements of 117 standard stars. The list of target stars also included some
known cluster and field beta Cephei stars, as well as beta Cephei and SPB
candidates that are targets of the asteroseismic part of the Kepler satellite
mission. The uvbybeta photometric results are presented. The data are shown to
be on the standard system, and the properties of the target stars are
discussed: 140 of these are indeed OB stars, a total of 101 targets lie within
the beta Cephei and/or SPB star instability strips, and each investigated
cluster contains such potential pulsators. These measurements will be taken
advantage of in a number of subsequent publications.
