We consider the application of interferometry to measuring the sizes and
shapes of small bodies in the solar system that cannot be spatially resolved by
today's single-dish telescopes. Assuming ellipsoidal shapes, our results
indicate that interferometers can measure the size of an object to better than
15% uncertainty if the limb-darkening is unknown. Assuming a Minnaert
scattering model, one can theoretically derive the limb-darkening parameters
from simultaneous measurements of visibilities at several different projected
baseline lengths to improve the size and shape determination to an accuracy of
a few percent. With a 3-D shape model for the dwarf planet Haumea, we
demonstrate that when photometric light curve, visibility light curve, and
visibility phase center displacement are combined, the rotational period and
sense of rotation can all be derived, and the rotational pole can be estimated.
Because of its elongated shape and the dark red spot, the rotation of Haumea
causes its optical photocenter to move in a loop on the sky, extending of ~80
\muas without the dark red spot, and ~200 \muas with it. Such movements are
easily detectable by space-based astrometric interferometer designed e.g. for
planet detection. As an example, we consider the possible contributions to the
study of small bodies in the solar system by the Space Interferometry Mission.
We show that such a mission could make substantial contributions in
characterizing the fundamental physical properties of the brightest Kuiper Belt
Objects and Centaurs as well as a large number of main belt asteroids. We
compile a list of Kuiper Belt Objects and Centaurs that are potentially
scientifically interesting and observable by such missions.
