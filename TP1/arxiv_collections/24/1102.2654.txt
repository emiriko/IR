This paper investigates the use of graph rewriting systems as a modelling
tool, and advocates the embedding of such systems in an interactive
environment. One important application domain is the modelling of biochemical
systems, where states are represented by port graphs and the dynamics is driven
by rules and strategies. A graph rewriting tool's capability to interactively
explore the features of the rewriting system provides useful insights into
possible behaviours of the model and its properties. We describe PORGY, a
visual and interactive tool we have developed to model complex systems using
port graphs and port graph rewrite rules guided by strategies, and to navigate
in the derivation history. We demonstrate via examples some functionalities
provided by PORGY.
