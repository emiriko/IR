In this paper we study optimal control problems for nonholonomic systems
defined on Lie algebroids by using quasi-velocities. We consider both
kinematic, i.e. systems whose cost functional depends only on position and
velocities, and dynamic optimal control problems, i.e. systems whose cost
functional depends also on accelerations. The formulation of the problem
directly at the level of Lie algebroids turns out to be the correct framework
to explain in detail similar results appeared recently (Maruskin and Bloch,
2007). We also provide several examples to illustrate our construction.
