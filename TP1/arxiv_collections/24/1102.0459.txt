A search is made for massive long-lived highly ionising particles with the
ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, using 3.1 pb-1 of pp collision
data taken at sqrt(s)=7 TeV. The signature of energy loss in the ATLAS inner
detector and electromagnetic calorimeter is used. No such particles are found
and limits on the production cross section for electric charges 6e <= |q| <=
17e and masses 200 GeV <= m <= 1000 GeV are set in the range 1-12 pb for
different hypotheses on the production mechanism.
