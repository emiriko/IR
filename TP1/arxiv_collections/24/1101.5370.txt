A previous calculation of Newton's gravitational coupling constant G is
generalized. This generalization makes it possible to have "atoms of
two-dimensional space" with an integer dimension d_{atom} of the internal
space, where the case d_{atom}=1 is excluded. Given the quantum of area l^2,
the final formula for G is inversely proportional to the logarithm of the
integer d_{atom}. The generalization used may be interpreted as a modification
of the energy equipartition law of the microscopic degrees of freedom
responsible for gravity, suggesting some form of long-range interaction between
these degrees of freedom themselves.
