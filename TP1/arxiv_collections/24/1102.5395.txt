Cyclic cosmology, in which the universe will experience alternating periods
of gravitational collapse and expansion, provides an interesting understanding
of the early universe and is described as "The Phoenix Universe". In usual
expectation, the cyclic universe should be homogeneous, however, with studying
the cosmological perturbations, we find that the amplification of curvature
perturbations on the large scale may rip the homogeneous universe into a
fissiparous multiverse after one or several cycles. Thus, we suggest that the
cyclic universe not only rebirths in the "fire" and will never ended, like the
Phoenix, but also proliferates eternally.
