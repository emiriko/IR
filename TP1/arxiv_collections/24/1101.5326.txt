We propose a new dark matter candidate, {\it light decoupled techni-dilaton},
which arises from the almost scale-invariant/conformal (walking) technicolor.
We investigate its characteristic nature and discuss several cosmological and
astrophysical constraints. It turns out that techni-dilatons are extremely
weakly interacting and produced dominantly by the non-thermal mechanism to be
the main component of dark matter with mass range between around 0.01 eV and
500 eV for typical walking technicolor scenarios.
