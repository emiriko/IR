Relaxation energies for photoemission, when an occupied electronic state is
excited, and for inverse photoemission, when an empty state is filled, are
calculated within the density functional theory with application to
Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$. The associated relaxation energies are obtained by
computing differences in total energies between the ground state and an excited
state in which one hole or electron is added into the system. The relaxation
energies of f-electrons are found to be of the order of several eV's,
indicating that f-bands will appear substantially away from the Fermi energy
($E_F$) in their spectroscopic images, even if these bands lie near $E_F$. Our
analysis explains why it would be difficult to observe f electrons at the $E_F$
even in the absence of strong electronic correlations.
