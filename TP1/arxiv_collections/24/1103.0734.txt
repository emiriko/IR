We present the results of a global neutrino oscillation data analysis within
the three-flavour framework. We include latest results from the MINOS
long-baseline experiment (including electron neutrino appearance as well as
anti-neutrino data), updating all relevant solar (SK II+III), atmospheric (SK
I+II+III) and reactor (KamLAND) data. Furthermore, we include a recent
re-calculation of the anti-neutrino fluxes emitted from nuclear reactors. These
results have important consequences for the analysis of reactor experiments and
in particular for the status of the mixing angle $\theta_{13}$. In our
recommended default analysis we find from the global fit that the hint for
non-zero $\theta_{13}$ remains weak, at 1.8$\sigma$ for both neutrino mass
hierarchy schemes. However, we discuss in detail the dependence of these
results on assumptions concerning the reactor neutrino analysis.
