One of the Birds of a Feather (BoF) discussion sessions at ADASS XX
considered whether a new journal is needed to serve the astronomical computing
community. In this paper we discuss the nature and requirements of that
community, outline the analysis that led us to propose this as a topic for a
BoF, and review the discussion from the BoF session itself. We also present the
results from a survey designed to assess the suitability of astronomical
computing papers of different kinds for publication in a range of existing
astronomical and scientific computing journals. The discussion in the BoF
session was somewhat inconclusive, and it seems likely that this topic will be
debated again at a future ADASS or in a similar forum.
