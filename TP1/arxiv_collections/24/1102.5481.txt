Global symmetries play an important role in classifying the spectrum of a
gauge theory. In the context of the AdS/CFT duality, global baryon-like
symmetries are specially interesting. In the gravity side, they correspond to
vector fields in AdS arising from KK reduction of the SUGRA p-form potentials.
We concentrate on the AdS_4/CFT_3 case, which presents very interesting
characteristic features. Following arXiv:1004.2045, we review aspects of such
symmetries, clarifying along the way some arguments in that reference. As a
byproduct, and in a slightly unrelated context, we also study Z-minimization,
focusing in the HVZ theory.
