Helical superconductors form a two dimensional, time-reversal invariant
topological phase characterized by a Kramers pair of Majorana edge modes
(helical Majorana modes). Existing detection schemes to identify this phase
rely either on spin transport properties, which are quite difficult to measure,
or on local charge transport, which allows only a partial identification. Here
we show that the presence of helical Majorana modes can be unambiguously
revealed by measuring the nonlocal charge conductance. Focusing on a
superconducting ring, we suggest two experiments that provide unique and robust
signatures to detect the helical superconductor phase.
