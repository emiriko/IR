We report the most sensitive direct search for pair production of
fourth-generation bottom-like chiral quarks ($b'$) each decaying promptly to
$tW$. We search for an excess of events with an electron or muon, at least five
jets (one indentified as due to a $b$ or $c$ quark) and an imbalance of
transverse momentum using data from $p\bar{p}$ collisions collected by the CDF
II detector at Fermilab with an integrated luminosity of 4.8 fb$^{-1}$. We
observe events consistent with background expectation and calculate upper
limits on the $b'$ pair production cross section ($\sigma_{b\bar{b'}}\lesssim
30$ fb for $m_{b'}>$375 GeV/$c^2$) and exclude $m_{b'}<372$ \gevcc at 95%
confidence level.
