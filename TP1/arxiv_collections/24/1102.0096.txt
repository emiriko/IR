We show that the $\gamma$-vector of the order complex of any polytope is the
f-vector of a balanced simplicial complex. This is done by proving this
statement for a subclass of Stanley's S-shellable spheres which includes all
polytopes. The proof shows that certain parts of the cd-index, when
specializing $c=1$ and considering the resulted polynomial in $d$, are the
f-polynomials of simplicial complexes that can be colored with "few" colors. We
conjecture that the cd-index of a regular CW-sphere is itself the flag f-vector
of a colored simplicial complex in a certain sense.
