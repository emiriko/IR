As massive stars evolve, their winds change. This causes a series of
hydrodynamical interactions in the surrounding medium. Whenever a fast wind
follows a slow wind phase, the fast wind sweeps up the slow wind in a shell,
which can be observed as a circumstellar nebula.
  One of the most striking examples of such an interaction is when a massive
star changes from a red supergiant into a Wolf-Rayet star. Nebulae resulting
from such a transition have been observed around many Wolf-Rayet stars and show
detailed, complicated structures owing to local instabilities in the swept-up
shells.
  Shells also form in the case of massive binary stars, where the winds of two
stars collide with one another. Along the collision front gas piles up, forming
a shell that rotates along with the orbital motion of the binary stars. In this
case the shell follows the surface along which the ram pressure of the two
colliding winds is in balance.
  Using the MPI-AMRVAC hydrodynamics code we have made multi-dimensional
simulations of these interactions in order to model the formation and evolution
of these circumstellar nebulae and explore whether full 3D simulations are
necessary to obtain accurate models of such nebulae.
