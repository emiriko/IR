Ground-state phase diagram of the mixed spin-$1/2$ and spin-$1$ Ising chain
with axial and rhombic zero-field splitting parameters is exactly calculated
within the framework of the transfer-matrix method. It is shown that the
rhombic zero-field splitting parameter prefers the magnetically ordered phase
instead of the disordered phase.
