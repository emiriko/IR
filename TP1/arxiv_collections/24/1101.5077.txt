Susceptibility of the transverse field Ising model on the square lattice is
calculated numerically in the paramagnetic phase in a wide range of
temperatures and transverse fields. An expression with one constant $\pi$, that
determines both the critical exponent $\gamma$ and the critical transverse
field, compellingly represents the data asymptotically near the quantum
critical point, except for a narrow classical region close to the phase
transition line, and shows two crossovers as temperature varies.
