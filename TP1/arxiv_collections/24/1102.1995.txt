We study almost Hermitian 4-manifolds with holonomy algebra, for the
canonical Hermitian connection, of dimension at most one. We show how
Riemannian 4-manifolds admitting five orthonormal symplectic forms fit therein
and classify them. In this set-up we also fully describe almost Kaehler
4-manifolds.
