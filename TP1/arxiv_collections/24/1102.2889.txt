It is well-known that leptogenesis in low energy scale is difficult in the
conventional Type-I seesaw mechanism with hierarchical right-handed neutrino
masses. We show that in a class of two Higgs doublet model, where one Higgs
doublet generates masses of quarks and charged leptons whereas the other Higgs
doublet with a tiny vacuum expectation value generates neutrino Dirac masses,
large Yukawa couplings lead to a large enough CP asymmetry of the right-handed
neutrino decay. Thermal leptogenesis suitably works at low energy scale as
keeping no enhancement of lepton number violating wash out effects. We will
also point out that thermal leptogenesis works well without confronting
gravitino problem in a supersymmetric neutrinophilic Higgs doublet model with
gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking. Neutralino dark matter and baryon
asymmetry generation by thermal leptogenesis are easily compatible in our
setup.
