The need for large-scale electronic structure calculations arises recently in
the field of material physics and efficient and accurate algebraic methods for
large simultaneous linear equations become greatly important. We investigate
the generalized shifted conjugate orthogonal conjugate gradient method, the
generalized Lanczos method and the generalized Arnoldi method. They are the
solver methods of large simultaneous linear equations of one-electron
Schr\"odinger equation and maps the whole Hilbert space to a small subspace
called the Krylov subspace. These methods are applied to systems of fcc Au with
the NRL tight-binding Hamiltonian (Phys. Rev. B {\bf 63}, 195101 (2001)). We
compare results by these methods and the exact calculation and show them
equally accurate. The system size dependence of the CPU time is also discussed.
The generalized Lanczos method and the generalized Arnoldi method are the most
suitable for the large-scale molecular dynamics simulations from the view point
of CPU time and memory size.
