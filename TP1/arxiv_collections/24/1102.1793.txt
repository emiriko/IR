The present paper aims at finding optimal parameters for trapping of Cs$_2$
molecules in optical lattices, with the perspective of creating a quantum
degenerate gas of ground-state molecules. We have calculated dynamic
polarizabilities of Cs$_2$ molecules subject to an oscillating electric field,
using accurate potential curves and electronic transition dipole moments. We
show that for some particular wavelengths of the optical lattice, called "magic
wavelengths", the polarizability of the ground-state molecules is equal to the
one of a Feshbach molecule. As the creation of the sample of ground-state
molecules relies on an adiabatic population transfer from weakly-bound
molecules created on a Feshbach resonance, such a coincidence ensures that both
the initial and final states are favorably trapped by the lattice light,
allowing optimized transfer in agreement with the experimental observation.
