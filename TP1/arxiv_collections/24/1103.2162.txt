We prove a new lower bound on the indirect Coulomb energy in quantum
mechanics in terms of the single particle density of the system. The new
universal lower bound is an alternative to the classical Lieb--Oxford bound
(with a smaller constant, 1.45 < 1.68) but involving an additive kinetic energy
term of the single particle density.
