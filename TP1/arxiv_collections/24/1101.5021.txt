In [F. Caselli, Involutory reflection groups and their models, J. Algebra 24
(2010), 370--393] there is constructed a uniform Gelfand model for all
non-exceptional irreducible complex reflection groups which are involutory.
Such model can be naturally decomposed into the direct sum of submodules
indexed by $S_n$-conjugacy classes, and we present here a general result that
relates the irreducible decomposition of these submodules with the projective
Robinson-Schensted correspondence. This description also reflects in a very
explicit way the existence of split representations for these groups.
