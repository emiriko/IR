We present near-infrared spectral measurements of Themis family asteroid
(379) Huenna (D~98 km) and its 6 km satellite using SpeX on the NASA IRTF. The
companion was farther than 1.5" from the primary at the time of observations
and was approximately 5 magnitudes dimmer. We describe a method for separating
and extracting the signal of a companion asteroid when the signal is not
entirely resolved from the primary. The spectrum of (379) Huenna has a broad,
shallow feature near 1 {\mu}m and a low slope, characteristic of C-type
asteroids. The secondary's spectrum is consistent with the taxonomic
classification of C-complex or X-complex. The quality of the data was not
sufficient to identify any subtle feature in the secondary's spectrum.
