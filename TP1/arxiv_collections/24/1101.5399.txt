We examine the properties of a previously discovered population of globular
clusters in the heart of the rich galaxy cluster Abell 1185 that might be
intergalactic in nature. Deep images obtained with the Advanced Camera for
Surveys (ACS) aboard Hubble Space Telescope (HST) confirm the presence of ~
1300 globular clusters brighter than I_{F814W} = 27.3 mag in a field devoid of
any large galaxies. The luminosities and colors of these objects are found to
be similar to those of metal-poor globular clusters observed in many galaxies
to date. Although a significant fraction of the detected globular clusters
undoubtedly reside in the outer halos of galaxies adjacent to this field,
detailed modeling of their distribution suggests that the majority of these
objects are likely to be intergalactic, in the sense that they are not
gravitationally bound to any individual galaxy. We conclude that the true
nature and origin of the globular cluster population in the core of A1185 --
galactic residents or intergalactic wanderers -- remains uncertain, and suggest
how future observation could resolve this ambiguity.
