We are developing a 3D radiation hydrodynamics code to simulate the
interaction of convection and pulsation in classical variable stars. One key
goal is the ability to carry these simulations to full amplitude in order to
compare them with observed light and velocity curves. Previous 2D calculations
were prevented from doing this because of drift in the radial coordinate
system, due to the algorithm defining radial movement of the coordinate system
during the pulsation cycle. We remove this difficulty by defining our
coordinate system flow algorithm to require that the mass in a spherical shell
remain constant throughout the pulsation cycle. We perform adiabatic test
calculations to show that large amplitude solutions repeat over more than 150
pulsation periods. We also verify that the computational method conserves the
peak kinetic energy per period, as must be true for adiabatic pulsation models.
