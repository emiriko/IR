We analyse behavior of stellar winds of evolved stars and the outcome of SN
Ia explosions in the AGN driven relativistic bubble. We find that the expansion
of wind shells is efficiently decelerated by the relativistic pressure; their
bulk motion however is preserved so they cross the bubble together with the
parent star. The wind material occupies a small fraction of bubble volume and
does not affect substantially the expansion of SN remnants. The estimated
maximal radius of a SN remnant in the bubble is 30-40 pc, if the envelope keeps
its integrity and remains spherical. A fragmentation of SN shell due to
Rayleigh-Taylor instability can alleviate the propagation of the SN material so
the ejecta fragments are able to cross the relativistic bubble. Outside the
bubble wind shells and supernova fragments are decelerated in the intracluster
medium at close range off the bubble boundary. The deposited SNe Ia material
can enrich the intracluster gas with metals in a thin layer at the boundary of
the relativistic bubble. This process may lead to a rim of enhanced line
emission. In the opposite limit, when the fragmentation of supernova remnant is
moderate or absent, the SN Ia matter is advected by the relativistic plasma and
may leave the central region of the bright cluster galaxy together with
buoyantly moving bubbles.
