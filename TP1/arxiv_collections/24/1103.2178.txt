Any physical quantum device for quantum information processing is subject to
errors in implementation. In order to be reliable and efficient, quantum
computers will need error correcting or error avoiding methods. Fault-tolerance
achieved through quantum error correction will be an integral part of quantum
computers. Of the many methods that have been discovered to implement it, a
highly successful approach has been to use transversal gates and specific
initial states. A critical element for its implementation is the availability
of high-fidelity initial states such as |0> and the Magic State. Here we report
an experiment, performed in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum
processor, showing sufficient quantum control to improve the fidelity of
imperfect initial magic states by distilling five of them into one with higher
fidelity.
