We study dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking with a fourth generation
within the $Z_n$ orbifolded $AdS_5\otimes S^5$ framework. A realistic $Z_7$
example is discussed. The initial theory reduces dynamically, due to the
induced condensates, to a four-family trinification near a TeV-scale conformal
fixed point where the gauge hierarchy problem does not exist. We predict new
gauge bosons and bifundamental fermions and scalars accessible by the LHC.
