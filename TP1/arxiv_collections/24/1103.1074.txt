Two effects, jet broadening and gluon bremsstrahlung induced by the
propagation of a highly energetic quark in dense QCD matter, are reconsidered
from effective theory point of view. We modify the standard Soft Collinear
Effective Theory (SCET) Lagrangian to include Glauber modes, which are needed
to implement the interactions between the medium and the collinear fields. We
derive the Feynman rules for this Lagrangian and show that it is invariant
under soft and collinear gauge transformations. We find that the newly
constructed theory SCET$_{\rm G}$ recovers exactly the general result for the
transverse momentum broadening of jets. In the limit where the radiated gluons
are significantly less energetic than the parent quark, we obtain a jet
energy-loss kernel identical to the one discussed in the reaction operator
approach to parton propagation in matter. In the framework of SCET$_{\rm G}$ we
present results for the fully-differential bremsstrahlung spectrum for both the
incoherent and the Landau-Pomeranchunk-Migdal suppressed regimes beyond the
soft-gluon approximation. Gauge invariance of the physics results is
demonstrated explicitly by performing the calculations in both the light-cone
and covariant $R_{\xi}$ gauges. We also show how the process-dependent
medium-induced radiative corrections factorize from the jet production cross
section on the example of the quark jets considered here.
