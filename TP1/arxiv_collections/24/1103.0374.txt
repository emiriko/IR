We present a generalized Kaluza-Klein monopole system. We solve this quantum
superintegrable systems on a Euclidean Taub Nut manifold using the separation
of variables of the corresponding Schroedinger equation in spherical and
parabolic coordinates. We present the integrals of motion of this system, the
quadratic algebra generated by these integrals, the realization in term of a
deformed oscillator algebra using the Daskaloyannis construction and the energy
spectrum. The structure constants and the Casimir operator are functions not
only of the Hamiltonian but also of other two integrals commuting with all
generators of the quadratic algebra and forming an Abelian subalgebra. We
present an other algebraic derivation of the energy spectrum of this system
using the factorization method and ladder operators.
