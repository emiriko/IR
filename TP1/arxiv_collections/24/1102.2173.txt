The use of a low profile, light weight and easy to fabricate transpolarising
surface placed on one side of a trihedral corner reflector (TCR) as
polarimetric calibrator is presented in this letter. The transpolarising-TCR
(TTCR) presents a high backscattered cross-polar response contrary to standard
TCRs. The performance of this device has been tested at X-band using the UPC
GB-SAR.
