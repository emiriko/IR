In this thesis a set of methods identifying minijet from final state
particles in the relativistic heavy ion collision events is established and the
parameter dependence has been investigated in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt s=
200$GeV using a multiphase transport model (AMPT). It is found that the number
of minijets reduces with the increasing of collision parameter and raises with
the increasing of c.m energy. Furthermore, we analyze the rapidity and momentum
distribution inside minijets identified using this method.
