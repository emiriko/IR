I describe the history of the calculations of NLO and NNLO QCD corrections to
weak decays of mesons and particle-antiparticle mixing in the period 1988-2010.
Also existing calculations of electroweak and QED corrections to these
processes are included in this presentation. These efforts bear some analogies
to the climbing of Himalayas and various expeditions by several teams of
strongly motivated "climbers", acting mainly in Germany, Italy, Poland and
Switzerland, allowed to move this field from the LO through the NLO to the NNLO
level. The material is meant to be a guide to the rich literature on NLO and
NNLO corrections in question and includes several anecdots related to the
climbs that I was involved in. While, by no means this presentation should be
regarded as a review of the size of NLO and NNLO corrections to weak decays, I
hope that some of the comments made in the course of the presentation could
turn out to be not only amusing but also instructive.
