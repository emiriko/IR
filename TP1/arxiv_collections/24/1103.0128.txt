We present test results and characterization of a data transmission system
based on a last generation FPGA and a commercial QSFP+ (Quad Small Form
Pluggable +) module. QSFP+ standard defines a hot-pluggable transceiver
available in copper or optical cable assemblies for an aggregated bandwidth of
up to 40 Gbps. We implemented a complete testbench based on a commercial
development card mounting an Altera Stratix IV FPGA with 24 serial transceivers
at 8.5 Gbps, together with a custom mezzanine hosting three QSFP+ modules. We
present test results and signal integrity measurements up to an aggregated
bandwidth of 12 Gbps.
