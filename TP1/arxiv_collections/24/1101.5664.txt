Graphene has attracted a lot of research interests due to its exotic
properties and a wide spectrum of potential applications. Chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) from gaseous hydrocarbon sources has shown great promises for
large-scale graphene growth. However, high growth temperature, typically
1000{\deg}C, is required for such growth. Here we demonstrate a revised CVD
route to grow graphene on Cu foils at low temperature, adopting solid and
liquid hydrocarbon feedstocks. For solid PMMA and polystyrene precursors,
centimeter-scale monolayer graphene films are synthesized at a growth
temperature down to 400{\deg}C. When benzene is used as the hydrocarbon source,
monolayer graphene flakes with excellent quality are achieved at a growth
temperature as low as 300{\deg}C. The successful low-temperature growth can be
qualitatively understood from the first principles calculations. Our work might
pave a way to undemanding route for economical and convenient graphene growth.
