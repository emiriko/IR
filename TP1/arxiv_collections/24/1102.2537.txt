It is shown that a superposition of static and rapidly oscillating electric
{\it monopole} (source) fields is capable of trapping particles with a
permanent electric dipole moment. Thus, the new trapping mechanism differs
fundamentally from saddle-point traps that use static and oscillating
higher-multipole fields. An analytical stability analysis together with
detailed molecular dynamics trajectory calculations prove that the trap is
stable. Thin rods of barium titanate (BaTiO$_3$) provide an illustrative
example for the working principle of the new trap. The effects of gravity are
considered. The existence of a bifurcation regime is predicted. A particular
strength of the new trap is that it also works for zero orbital angular
momentum with respect to the field-generating electrodes.
