Properties of the recently proposed gauge-invariant gluon spin $S_g$ are
studied and compared to the usually defined "gluon polarization" $\Delta g$. By
explicit 1-loop calculations in a quark state, it is found that $S_g= \frac
59\Delta g$. Furthermore, $\frac 45$ of $S_g$ can actually be identified as a
"static-field" contribution and shown to cancel exactly an analogous static
term in the gluon orbital angular momentum $L_g$, leaving $S_g+L_g$ unaltered.
These observations suggest that if properly identified, the gluon contribution
to the nucleon spin may be drastically smaller than in the conventional wisdom.
