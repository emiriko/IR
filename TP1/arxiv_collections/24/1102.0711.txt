Statistical theory of the dielectric susceptibility of polar liquid crystals
is proposed. The molecules are not uniaxial but similar to cones. It is assumed
that the permanent dipole moment of a molecule is parallel to the axis of the
rotational symmetry. The ordering of the phase is described by means of the
mean field theory based on the Maier-Saupe approach. The theory was used to
calculate the temperature dependence of the order parameters and the
susceptibilities. Predictions of the model for different sets of parameters are
investigated.
