We will construct surfaces of revolution with finite total curvature whose
Gauss curvatures are not bounded. Such a surface of revolution is employed as a
reference surface of comparison theorems in radial curvature geometry.
Moreover, we will prove that a complete non-compact Riemannian manifold M is
homeomorphic to the interior of a compact manifold with boundary, if the
manifold M is not less curved than a non-compact model surface of revolution,
and if the total curvature of the model surface is finite and less than $2\pi$.
Hence, in the first result mentioned above, we may treat a much wider class of
metrics than that of a complete non-compact Riemannian manifold whose sectional
curvature is bounded from below by a constant.
