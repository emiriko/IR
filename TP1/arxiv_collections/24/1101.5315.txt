I review some recent results which demonstrate how various geometries, such
as Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstroem, can emerge from Yang-Mills type
matrix models with branes. Furthermore, explicit embeddings of these branes as
well as appropriate Poisson structures and star-products which determine the
non-commutativity of space-time are provided. These structures are motivated by
higher order terms in the effective matrix model action which semi-classically
lead to an Einstein-Hilbert type action.
