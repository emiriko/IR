We report here a measurement of form factors of $K^{\pm}_{\mu 3}$ decay by
the NA48/2 experiment at CERN. Using a sample of 3.4$\times10^6$ events we
provide preliminary form factor values according to various parametrizations.
The slope of the scalar form factor is in agreement with other measurements and
theory predictions.
