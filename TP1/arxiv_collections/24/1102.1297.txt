In this work we studied Ag surfactant induced growth of Cu/Co multilayers.
The Cu/Co multilayers were deposited using Ag surfactant by ion beam sputtering
technique. It was found that Ag surfactant balances the asymmetry between the
surface free energy of Cu and Co. As a result, the Co-on-Cu and Cu-on-Co
interfaces become sharp and symmetric and thereby improve the thermal stability
of the multilayer. On the basis of obtained results, a mechanism leading to
symmetric and stable interfaces in Cu/Co multilayers is discussed.
