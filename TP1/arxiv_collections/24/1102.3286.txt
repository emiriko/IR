We performed electron energy-loss spectroscopy studies in order to get a
deeper insight into the electronic properties of potassium intercalated picene,
a recently discovered superconductor. A comparison of the loss function of the
undoped and doped compound shows the appearance of a new peak in the optical
gap, which we attribute to the charge carrier plasmon. We find a dramatic
increase for the value of the background dielectric constant
$\epsilon_{\infty}$ upon doping. Our core level excitation data clearly signal
filling of the conduction bands with electrons upon potassium addition.
