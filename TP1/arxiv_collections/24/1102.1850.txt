We develop a theory for the eigenvalue density of arbitrary non-Hermitian
Euclidean matrices. Closed equations for the resolvent and the eigenvector
correlator are derived. The theory is applied to the random Green's matrix
relevant to wave propagation in an ensemble of point-like scattering centers.
This opens a new perspective in the study of wave diffusion, Anderson
localization, and random lasing.
