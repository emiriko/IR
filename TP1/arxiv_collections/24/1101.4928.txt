We present spectropolarimetry of 19 confirmed and 4 possible bright, southern
broad absorption line (BAL) quasars from the European Southern Observatory
(ESO) Very Large Telescope (VLT). A wide range of redshifts is covered in the
sample (from 0.9 to 3.4), and both low- and hi-ionization quasars are
represented, as well as radio-loud and radio-quiet BALQSOs. We continue to
confirm previously established spectropolarimetric properties of BALQSOs,
including the generally rising continuum polarization with shorter wavelengths
and comparatively large fraction with high broad-band polarization (6 of 19
with polarizations >2%). Emission lines are polarized less than or similar to
the continuum, except in a few unusual cases, and absorption troughs tend to
have higher polarizations. A search for correlations between polarization
properties has been done, identifying 2 significant or marginally significant
correlations. These are an increase in continuum polarization with decreasing
optical luminosity (increasing absolute B magnitude) and decreasing \ion{C}{4}
emission-line polarization with increased continuum polarization.
