We revisit a neutrino-driven r-process mechanism in the He shell of a
core-collapse supernova, finding that it could succeed in early stars of
metallicity < solar/1000, at relatively low temperatures and neutron densities,
producing A ~ 130 and 195 abundance peaks over ~ 10-20 s. The mechanism is
sensitive to the neutrino emission model and to neutrino oscillations. We
discuss the implications of an r-process that could alter interpretations of
abundance data from metal-poor stars, and point out the need for further
calculations that include effects of the supernova shock.
