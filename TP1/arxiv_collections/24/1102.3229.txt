We present N-body simulations for generic non-Gaussian initial conditions
with the aim of exploring and modelling the scale-dependent halo bias. This
effect is evident at very large scales requiring large simulation boxes. In
addition, the previously available prescription to implement generic
non-Gaussian initial conditions has been improved to keep under control
higher-order terms which were spoiling the power spectrum on large scales. We
pay particular attention to the differences between physical,
inflation-motivated primordial bispectra and their factorizable templates, and
to the operational definition of the non-Gaussian halo bias (which has both a
scale-dependent and an approximately scale-independent contributions). We find
that analytic predictions for both the non-Gaussian halo mass function and halo
bias work well once a calibration factor (which was introduced before) is
calibrated on simulations. The halo bias remains therefore an extremely
promising tool to probe primordial non-Gaussianity and thus to give insights
into the physical mechanism that generated the primordial perturbations. The
simulation outputs and tables of the analytic predictions will be made publicly
available via the non-Gaussian comparison project web site
