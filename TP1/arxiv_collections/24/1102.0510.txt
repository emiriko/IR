We have searched for evidence for dust and gas disks at a sample of hot DA
white dwarfs 20 000K < Teff < 50 000K, without success. Although their
atmospheres are polluted with heavy elements, we cannot yet convincingly and
conclusively show that any of these objects is accreting metals from
surrounding material derived from disrupted minor planets in an old solar
system.
