The recently discovered Z(4430) mesonic resonance is believed to be a strong
tetraquark candidate. The photoproduction in the channel $\gamma p\rightarrow
Z^{+}(4430)n\rightarrow \psi ' \pi^{+} n$ has been proposed as the most
effective way to confirm the Z(4430) presence and to measure its quantum
numbers. In this work we present a model for high energy and forward angle
Z(4430) photoproduction in a effective Lagrangian approach. This model is based
on the use of Regge trajectories exchange, thus a Regge propagator replaces the
usual Feynman propagator. The differential and total cross sections and the
asymmetries have been calculated for the $J^{P}$ quantum numbers $1^{-}$,
$1^{+}$, $0^{-}$ and $2^{-}$ in the hypotheses that Z(4430) has isospin I=1.
