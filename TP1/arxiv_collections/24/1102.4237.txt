Symbolic sequences generated by coupled map lattices (CMLs) can be used to
model the chaotic-like structure of genomic sequences. In this study it is
shown that diffusively coupled Chebyshev maps of order 4 (corresponding to a
shift of 4 symbols) very closely reproduce the multifractal spectrum $D_q$ of
human genomic sequences for coupling constant $\alpha =0.35\pm 0.01$ if $q>0$.
The presence of rare configurations causes deviations for $q<0$, which
disappear if the rare event statistics of the CML is modified. Such rare
configurations are known to play specific functional roles in genomic sequences
serving as promoters or regulatory elements.
