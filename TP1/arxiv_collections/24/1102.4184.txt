An abelian cover is a finite morphism $X\to Y$ of varieties which is the
quotient map for a generically faithful action of a finite abelian group $G$.
Abelian covers with $Y$ smooth and $X$ normal were studied in
\cite{Pardini_AbelianCovers}.
  Here we study the non-normal case, assuming that $X$ and $Y$ are $S_2$
varieties that have at worst normal crossings outside a subset of codimension
$\ge 2$. Special attention is paid to the case of $\Z_2^r$-covers of surfaces,
which is used in arxiv:0901.4431 to construct explicitly compactifications of
some components of the moduli space of surfaces of general type.
