We introduce a model for self-organized dynamics which, we argue, addresses
several drawbacks of the celebrated Cucker-Smale (C-S) model. The proposed
model does not only take into account the distance between agents, but instead,
the influence between agents is scaled in term of their relative distance.
Consequently, our model does not involve any explicit dependence on the number
of agents; only their geometry in phase space is taken into account. The use of
relative distances destroys the symmetry property of the original C-S model,
which was the key for the various recent studies of C-S flocking behavior. To
this end, we introduce here a new framework to analyze the phenomenon of
flocking for a rather general class of dynamical systems, which covers systems
with non-symmetric influence matrices. In particular, we analyze the flocking
behavior of the proposed model as well as other strongly asymmetric models with
"leaders".
  The methodology presented in this paper, based on the notion of active sets,
carries over from the particle to kinetic and hydrodynamic descriptions. In
particular, we discuss the hydrodynamic formulation of our proposed model, and
prove its unconditional flocking for slowly decaying influence functions.
