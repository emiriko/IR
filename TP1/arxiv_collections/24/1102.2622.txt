Exoplanets whose orbit is misaligned with the spin of their host star could
have originated from high-speed gas blobs, which are observed in multitudes in
nearby supernova remnants and planetary nebulae. These blobs grow in mass and
slow down in the interstellar medium (ISM) by mass accretion and cool by
radiation. If their mass exceeds the Jeans mass, they collapse into hot giant
gas planets. Most of the 'missing baryons' in galaxies could have been swept
into such free-floating objects, which could perturb stellar planetary systems,
kick bound planets into misaligned orbits or be captured themselves into
misaligned orbits. The uncollapsed ones can then collapse or be tidally
disrupted into a tilted gas disk where formation of misaligned planets can take
place. Giant gas planets free floating in the Galactic ISM may be detected by
their microlensing effects or by deep photometry if they are hot. The
uncollapsed gas blobs may produce the observed radio scintillations of comact
extragalactic radio sources such as quasars and gamma ray bursts.
