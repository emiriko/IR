In an excitable Delaunay triangulation every node takes three states
(resting, excited and refractory) and updates its state in discrete time
depending on a ratio of excited neighbours. All nodes update their states in
parallel. By varying excitability of nodes we produce a range of phenomena,
including reflection of excitation wave from edge of triangulation, backfire of
excitation, branching clusters of excitation and localized excitation domains.
Our findings contribute to studies of propagating perturbations and waves in
non-crystalline substrates.
