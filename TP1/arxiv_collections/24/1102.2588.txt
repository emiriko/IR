The equations of motion in one partial integrable case of D.N.Goryachev in
the rigid body dynamics are separated by the real change of variables. We
obtain the Abel--Jacobi equations with the polynomial of degree 6 under the
radical. The natural phase variables (components of the momentum and the
momentum force) are expressed via separated variables explicitly in elementary
algebraic functions. Basing on these expressions the phase topology of the
system is described.
