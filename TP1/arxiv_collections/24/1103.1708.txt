We study the electronic transport in a molecular junction in which each site
is coupled to a local phonon bath using the non-equilibrium Green's function
method. We observe the length period of the oscillatory conductance in
odd-numbered chains depends strongly on the applied bias, and the oscillatory
behavior is smeared out for the bias voltage near the phonon energy. In
addition, a crossover from tunneling to thermally activated hopping transport
as the length of the molecule increases is found for the phonon-free case. In
the presence of electron-phonon interaction, hopping transport is dominant and
a transition from the thermally suppressed to assisted conduction is observed.
