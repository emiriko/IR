In this paper we consider a group sequentially monitored trial on a survival
endpoint, monitored using a weighted log-rank (WLR) statistic with
deterministic weight function. We introduce a summary statistic in the form of
a weighted average logged relative risk and show that if there is no sign
change in the instantaneous logged relative risk, there always exists a
bijection between the WLR statistic and the weighted average logged relative
risk. We show that this bijection can be consistently estimated at each
analysis under a suitable shape assumption, for which we have listed two
possibilities. We indicate how to derive a design-adjusted p-value and
confidence interval and suggest how to apply the bias-correction method.
Finally, we document several decisions made in the design of the NLST interim
analysis plan and in reporting its results on the primary endpoint.
