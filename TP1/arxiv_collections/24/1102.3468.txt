Interfaces have long been known to be the key to many mechanical and electric
properties. To nickel base superalloys which have perfect creep and fatigue
properties and have been widely used as materials of turbine blades, interfaces
determine the strengthening capacities in high temperature. By means of high
resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and 3D atom probe
(3DAP) tomography, Srinivasan et al. proposed a new point that in nickel base
superalloys there exist two different interfacial widths across the
{\gamma}/{\gamma}' interface, one corresponding to an order-disorder
transition, and the other to the composition transition. We argue about this
conclusion in this comment.
