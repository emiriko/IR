Connectivity is one of the most fundamental properties of wireless multi-hop
networks. A network is said to be connected if there is a path between any pair
of nodes. A convenient way to study the connectivity of a random network is by
investigating the condition under which the network has no isolated node. The
condition under which the network has no isolated node provides a necessary
condition for a connected network. Further the condition for a network to have
no isolated node and the condition for the network to be connected can often be
shown to asymptotically converge to be the same as the number of nodes
approaches infinity, given a suitably defined random network and connection
model. Currently analytical results on the distribution of the number of
isolated nodes only exist for the unit disk model. This study advances research
in the area by providing the asymptotic distribution of the number of isolated
nodes in random networks with nodes Poissonly distributed on a unit square
under a generic random connection model. On that basis we derive a necessary
condition for the above network to be asymptotically almost surely connected.
These results, together with results in a companion paper on the sufficient
condition for a network to be connected, expand recent results obtained for
connectivity of random geometric graphs assuming a unit disk model to results
assuming a more generic and more practical random connection model.
