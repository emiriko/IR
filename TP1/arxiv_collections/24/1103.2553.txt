The effects of cluster diffusion on the submonolayer island density and
island-size distribution are studied for the case of irreversible growth of
compact islands on a 2D substrate. In our model, we assume instantaneous
coalescence of circular islands, while the cluster mobility is assumed to
exhibit power-law decay as a function of island-size with exponent mu. Results
are presented for mu = 1/2, 1, and 3/2 corresponding to cluster diffusion via
Brownian motion, correlated evaporation-condensation, and edge-diffusion
respectively, as well as for higher values including mu = 2,3, and 6. We also
compare our results with those obtained in the limit of no cluster mobility
corresponding to mu = infinity. In agreement with theoretical predictions of
power-law behavior of the island-size distribution (ISD) for mu < 1, for mu =
1/2 we find Ns({\theta}) ~ s^{-\tau} (where Ns({\theta}) is the number of
islands of size s at coverage {\theta}) up to a cross-over island-size S_c.
However, the value of {\tau} obtained in our simulations is higher than the
mean-field (MF) prediction {\tau} = (3 - mu)/2. Similarly, the value of the
exponent {\zeta} corresponding to the dependence of S_c on the average
island-size S (e.g. S_c ~ S^{\zeta}) is also significantly higher than the MF
prediction {\zeta} = 2/(mu+1). A generalized scaling form for the ISD is also
proposed for mu < 1, and using this form excellent scaling is found for mu =
1/2. However, for finite mu >= 1 neither the generalized scaling form nor the
standard scaling form Ns({\theta}) = {\theta} /S^2 f(s/S) lead to scaling of
the entire ISD for finite values of the ratio R of the monomer diffusion rate
to deposition flux. Instead, the scaled ISD becomes more sharply peaked with
increasing R and coverage. This is in contrast to models of epitaxial growth
with limited cluster mobility for which good scaling occurs over a wide range
of coverages.
