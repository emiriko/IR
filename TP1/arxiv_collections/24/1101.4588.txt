We study an intermediate inflationary stage in a Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory.
In this scenario we analyze the quantum fluctuations corresponding to adiabatic
and isocurvature modes. Our model is compared to that described by using the
intermediate model in Einstein general relativity theory. We assess the status
of this model in light of the seven-year WMAP data.
