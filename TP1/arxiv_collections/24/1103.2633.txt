We describe the first measurement on Andreev scattering of thermal
excitations from a vortex configuration with known density, spatial extent, and
orientations in 3He-B superfluid. The heat flow from a blackbody radiator in
equilibrium rotation at constant angular velocity is measured with two quartz
tuning fork oscillators. One oscillator creates a controllable density of
excitations at 0.2Tc base temperature and the other records the thermal
response. The results are compared to numerical calculations of ballistic
propagation of thermal quasiparticles through a cluster of rectilinear
vortices.
