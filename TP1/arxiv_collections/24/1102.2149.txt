For the first time, the diffusion phase diagram in highly confined colloidal
systems, predicted by Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW), is experimentally
obtained. Temporal and spatial fractional exponents, $\alpha$ and $\mu$,
introduced within the framework of CTRW, are simultaneously measured by Pulse
Field Gradient Nuclear Magnetic Resonance technique in samples of micro-beads
dispersed in water. We find that $\alpha$ depends on the disorder degree of the
system. Conversely, $\mu$ depends on both bead sizes and magnetic
susceptibility differences within samples. Our findings fully match the CTRW
predictions.
