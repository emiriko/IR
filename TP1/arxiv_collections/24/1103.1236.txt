We propose to test the theory of continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) in
an all-optical time-domain Talbot-Lau interferometer for clusters with masses
exceeding 1000000 amu. By assessing the relevant environmental decoherence
mechanisms, as well as the growing size of the particles relative to the
grating fringes, we argue that it will be feasible to test the quantum
superposition principle in a mass range excluded by recent estimates of the CSL
effect.
