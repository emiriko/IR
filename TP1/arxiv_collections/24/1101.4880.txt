By modulating transmission function of a weak probe field via a strong
control standing wave, an electromagnetically induced grating can be created in
the probe channel. Such a nonmaterial grating may lead to self-imaging of
ultra-cold atoms or molecules in the Fresnel near-field regime. This work may
offer a nondestructive and lensless way to image ultra-cold atoms or molecules.
