It is shown that the density of the ratio of two random variables with the
same variance and joint Gaussian density satisfies a non stationary diffusion
equation. Implications of this result for kernel density estimation of the
condensed density of the generalized eigenvalues of a random matrix pencil
useful for the numerical inversion of the Laplace transform is discussed.
