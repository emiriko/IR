Consider the following unequal error protection scenario. One special
message, dubbed the "red alert" message, is required to have an extremely small
probability of missed detection. The remainder of the messages must keep their
average probability of error and probability of false alarm below a certain
threshold. The goal then is to design a codebook that maximizes the error
exponent of the red alert message while ensuring that the average probability
of error and probability of false alarm go to zero as the blocklength goes to
infinity. This red alert exponent has previously been characterized for
discrete memoryless channels. This paper completely characterizes the optimal
red alert exponent for additive white Gaussian noise channels with block power
constraints.
