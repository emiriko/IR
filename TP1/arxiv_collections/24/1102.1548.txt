The recently-discovered accreting X-ray pulsar IGR J17480--2446 spins at a
frequency of ~11 Hz. We show that Type I X-ray bursts from this source display
oscillations at the same frequency as the stellar spin. IGR J17480--2446 is the
first secure case of a slowly rotating neutron star which shows Type I burst
oscillations, all other sources featuring such oscillations spin at hundreds of
Hertz. This means that we can test burst oscillation models in a completely
different regime. We explore the origin of Type I burst oscillations in IGR
J17480--2446 and conclude that they are not caused by global modes in the
neutron star ocean. We also show that the Coriolis force is not able to confine
an oscillation-producing hot-spot on the stellar surface. The most likely
scenario is that the burst oscillations are produced by a hot-spot confined by
hydromagnetic stresses.
