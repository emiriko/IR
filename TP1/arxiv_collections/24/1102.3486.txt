We investigate the $S=1/2$ quantum spin antiferromagnets on the triangular
and Kagome lattices in magnetic field, using the numerical exact
diagonalization. Particularly we focus on an anomalous magnetization behavior
of each system at 1/3 of the saturation magnetization. The critical exponent
analyses suggest that it is a conventional magnetization plateau on the
triangular lattice, while an unconventional phenomenon, called the
magnetization ramp, on the Kagome lattice.
