We exhibit the construction of a deterministic automaton that, given k > 0,
recognizes the (regular) language of k-differentiable words. Our approach
follows a scheme of Crochemore et al. based on minimal forbidden words. We
extend this construction to the case of C\infinity-words, i.e., words
differentiable arbitrary many times. We thus obtain an infinite automaton for
representing the set of C\infinity-words. We derive a classification of
C\infinity-words induced by the structure of the automaton. Then, we introduce
a new framework for dealing with \infinity-words, based on a three letter
alphabet. This allows us to define a compacted version of the automaton, that
we use to prove that every C\infinity-word admits a repetition in C\infinity
whose length is polynomially bounded.
