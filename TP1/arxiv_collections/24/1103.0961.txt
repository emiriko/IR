Low frequency noise in current biased La$_{0.82}$Ca$_{0.18}$MnO$_{3}$ single
crystals has been investigated in a wide temperature range from 79 K to 290 K.
Despite pronounced changes in magnetic properties and dissipation mechanisms of
the sample with changing temperature, the noise spectra were found to be always
of the 1/f type and their intensity (except the lowest temperature studied)
scaled as a square of the bias. At liquid nitrogen temperatures and under bias
exceeding some threshold value, the behavior of the noise deviates from the
quasi-equilibrium modulation noise and starts to depend in a non monotonic way
on bias. It has been verified that the observed noise obeys Dutta and Horn
model of 1/f noise in solids. The appearance of nonequilibrium 1/f noise and
its dependence on bias have been associated with changes in the distribution of
activation energies in the underlying energy landscape. These changes have been
correlated with bias induced changes in the intrinsic tunneling mechanism
dominating dissipation in La$_{0.82}$Ca$_{0.18}$MnO$_{3}$ at low temperatures.
