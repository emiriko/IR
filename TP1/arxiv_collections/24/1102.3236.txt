Motivated by the Erdos multiplication table problem we study the following
question: Given numbers N_1,...,N_{k+1}, how many distinct products of the form
n_1...n_{k+1} with n_i<N_i for all i are there? Call A_{k+1}(N_1,...,N_{k+1})
the quantity in question. Ford established the order of magnitude of
A_2(N_1,N_2) and the author of A_{k+1}(N,...,N) for all k>1. In the present
paper we generalize these results by establishing the order of magnitude of
A_{k+1}(N_1,...,N_{k+1}) for arbitrary choices of N_1,...,N_{k+1} when k is
2,3,4 or 5. Moreover, we obtain a partial answer to our question when k>5.
Lastly, we develop a heuristic argument which explains why the limitation of
our method is k=5 in general and we suggest ways of improving the results of
this paper.
