Charged particles and photons have been measured in central Pb+Pb collisions
at 158 A GeV in a common ($\eta$ - $\phi$)-phase space region in the WA98
experiment at the CERN SPS. The measured distributions have been analyzed
%using the sliding window method in order to quantify the frequency with which
phase space regions of varying sizes have either small or large neutral pion
fraction. The measured results are compared with VENUS model simulated events
and with mixed events. Events with both large and small charged-neutral
fluctuations are observed to occur more frequently than expected statistically,
as deduced from mixed events, or as predicted by model simulations, with the
difference becoming more prominent with decreasing size of the $\Delta\eta$ -
$\Delta\phi$ region.
