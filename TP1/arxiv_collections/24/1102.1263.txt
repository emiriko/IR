We present a comparison of low-resolution spectra of 60 stars covering the
whole M-dwarf sequence. Using the most recent PHOENIX BT-Settl stellar model
atmospheres (see paper by F. Allard, in this book) we do a first quantitative
compari- son to our observed spectra in the wavelength range 550-950 nm. We
perform a first confrontation between models and observations and we assign an
effective tempera- tures to the observed M-dwarfs. Teff-spectral type relations
are then compared with the published ones. This comparison also aims at
improving the models' opacities.
