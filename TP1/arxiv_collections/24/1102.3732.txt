In this paper we outline how a simple compiler can be completely specified
using higher order rewriting in all stages: parsing, analysis/optimization, and
code emission, specifically using the crsx.sf.net system for a small
declarative language called "X" inspired by XQuery (for which we are building a
production quality compiler in the same way).
