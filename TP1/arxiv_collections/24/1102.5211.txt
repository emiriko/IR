We present an analysis of high resolution spectral observations of the
symbiotic star StHa 190. A 30 days period has been derived from radial
velocities of the G-type absorption lines and the HeII 4686A emission line. The
main aim of this work was to look for explanation of the very wide absorption
lines of the yellow giant. The very low mass function obtained from the
absorption lines radial velocities suggests that the observed changes probably
do not corespond to the orbital motion of this star.
