An oversight of several previous results from local density approximation
(LDA) calculations appear to have led to an incomplete, and hence misleading,
characterization of the capability of density functional theory (DFT) to
describe correctly the electronic properties of wurtzite GaN (w-GaN) and InN
(w-InN) [Phys. Rev. B 82, 115102 (2010)]. These comments are aimed at
presenting a different picture of the above capability for DFT calculations
that solve self-consistently the system of equations of DFT. They also
underscore, in light of the experimentally established Burstein-Moss effect,
the need to specify the carrier density when citing a band gap for w-InN.
