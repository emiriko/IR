We are carrying out a detailed 2D spectroscopic study of the central 210 pc X
130 pc of the blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxy NGC5253. This contribution
presents the ionization conditions and chemical abundance patterns for the
different kinematic components of the ionized gas detected in our previous
work. All the kinematic components present an excess in nitrogen abundance. In
particular, the broad velocity component has larger excess than the narrow one
by a factor of ~1.4+-0.4 which is consistent with a scenario for the Giant HII
Region where the broad component of the emission lines traces the material
expelled by the two central Super Star Clusters while the narrow one is
associated to previously existing ionized gas.
