We report the observation of Kondo physics in a spin- 3/2 hole quantum dot.
The dot is formed close to pinch-off in a hole quantum wire defined in an
undoped AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure. We clearly observe two distinctive
hallmarks of quantum dot Kondo physics. First, the Zeeman spin-splitting of the
zero-bias peak in the differential conductance is independent of gate voltage.
Second, this splitting is twice as large as the splitting for the lowest
one-dimensional subband. We show that the Zeeman splitting of the zero-bias
peak is highly-anisotropic, and attribute this to the strong spin-orbit
interaction for holes in GaAs.
