Starting from Cs2CuCl4 and Cs2CuBr4 our project focuses on the growth of the
Cs2CuCl4-xBrx mixed crystals from aqueous solution and the investigation of the
occurring structural variations. The well known orthorhombic structure (space
group Pnma) of the end members of this system is interrupted within the
intermediate composition range Cs2CuCl3Br1 - Cs2CuCl2Br2, if the growth takes
place at room temperature. Within this range a new tetragonal phase is found
(space group I4/mmm). However, in case the growth temperature will be increased
to 50 {\deg}C, the existence of the orthorhombic structure can be extended over
the whole Cs2CuCl4-xBrx mixed system. A detailed analysis of the composition
dependence of the lattice parameters is used to draw conclusions on the
incorporation of Cl- and Br-ions at different sites which is important for the
magnetic interactions between the Cu-ions.
