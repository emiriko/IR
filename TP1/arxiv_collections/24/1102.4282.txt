The spectra of strange hadrons are measured in proton-proton collisions,
recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC, at centre-of-mass energies of
0.9 and 7 TeV. The K^0_s, Lambda, and Xi^- particles and their antiparticles
are reconstructed from their decay topologies and the production rates are
measured as functions of rapidity and transverse momentum. The results are
compared to other experiments and to predictions of the PYTHIA Monte Carlo
program. The transverse momentum distributions are found to differ
substantially from the PYTHIA results and the production rates exceed the
predictions by up to a factor of three.
