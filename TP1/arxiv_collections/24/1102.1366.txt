The ambipolar carrier diffusion in bulk GaAs is studied by using an ultrafast
pump-probe technique with a high spatial resolution. Carriers with a point-like
spatial profile are excited by a tightly focused pump laser pulse. The
spatiotemporal dynamics of the carriers are monitored by a time-delayed and
spatially scanned probe pulse. Ambipolar diffusion coefficients are deduced
from linear fits to the expansion of the area of the profiles, and are found to
decrease from about 170~$\mathrm{cm}^2 \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at 10 K to about
20~$\mathrm{cm}^2 \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at room temperature. Our results are
consistent with those deduced from the previously measured mobilities.
