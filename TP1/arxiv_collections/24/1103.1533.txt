From the analysis of Supernova Ia data alongwith Observational Hubble Data
(OHD) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data, we attempt to find out the
nature of a scalar potential that may be responsible for the Dark Energy of the
universe. We demonstrate that in order to explain the varying dark energy
equation of state ($\omega_X(z)$) as obtained in a model independent way from
the analyses of observational data, we need to invoke a quintom scalar field
having a "quintessence" part for $\omega_X(z) > -1$ and a "phantom" part for
$\omega_X(z) < -1$. We consider a Gaussian type potential for these scalar
fields and compare the dark energy equation of state derived from such
potential with the one computed from the data analysis.
