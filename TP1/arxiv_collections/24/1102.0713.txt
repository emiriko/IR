We derive a selection of energy estimates for a generalisation of a critical
equation on the unit disc in $\mathbb{R}^2$ introduced by Rivi\`ere.
Applications include sharp regularity results and compactness theorems which
generalise a large amount of previous geometric PDE theory, including some of
the theory of harmonic and almost-harmonic maps from surfaces.
