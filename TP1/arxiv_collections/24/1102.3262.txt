We study Anderson localization and propagation of partially-spatially
incoherent wavepackets in linear disordered potentials, motivated by the
insight that interference phenomena resulting from multiple scattering are
affected by the coherence of the waves. We find that localization is delayed by
incoherence: the more incoherent the waves are, the longer they diffusively
spread while propagating in the medium. However, if all the eigenmodes of the
system are exponentially localized (as in one- and two-dimensional disordered
systems), any partially-incoherent wavepacket eventually exhibits localization
with exponentially-decaying tails, after sufficiently long propagation
distances. Interestingly, we find that the asymptotic behavior of the
incoherent beam is similar to that of a single instantaneous coherent
realization of the beam.
