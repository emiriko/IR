In this paper we develop a 2-valued reduction of many-valued logics, into
2-valued multi-modal logics. Such an approach is based on the contextualization
of many-valued logics with the introduction of higher-order Herbrand
interpretation types, where we explicitly introduce the coexistence of a set of
algebraic truth values of original many-valued logic, transformed as parameters
(or possible worlds), and the set of classic two logic values. This approach is
close to the approach used in annotated logics, but offers the possibility of
using the standard semantics based on Herbrand interpretations. Moreover, it
uses the properties of the higher-order Herbrand types, as their fundamental
nature is based on autoreferential Kripke semantics where the possible worlds
are algebraic truth-values of original many-valued logic. This autoreferential
Kripke semantics, which has the possibility of flattening higher-order Herbrand
interpretations into ordinary 2-valued Herbrand interpretations, gives us a
clearer insight into the relationship between many-valued and 2-valued
multi-modal logics. This methodology is applied to the class of many-valued
Logic Programs, where reduction is done in a structural way, based on the logic
structure (logic connectives) of original many-valued logics. Following this,
we generalize the reduction to general structural many-valued logics, in an
abstract way, based on Suszko's informal non-constructive idea. In all cases,
by using developed 2-valued reductions we obtain a kind of non truth-valued
modal meta-logics, where two-valued formulae are modal sentences obtained by
application of particular modal operators to original many-valued formulae.
