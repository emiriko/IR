In the presented review we discuss the problem of extraction the parameters
of nuclear matter and charge distribution in stable and unstable isotopes. A
substantial amount of information on the nuclear radii and other distribution
parameters in light exotic nuclei has been obtained from experiments on
intermediate-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. The analyses of these
experiments is usually performed with the help of the Glauber Theory. We review
the main assumptions the Glauber Theory and show how this theoretical approach
is used to calculate reaction and interaction cross sections. We also show how
radii of nuclear matter can be obtained from the analysis of the experimental
data on reaction cross sections. In the provided analysis reaction cross
sections were calculated in optical and rigid approximations of the Glauber
Theory as well as using explicit expressions. Numerical calculations of
Glauber's explicit expressions for reaction cross sections were done using
Monte Carlo technique. Recent results of the precise measurements of charge
radii of light exotic nuclei which were done using the laser-spectroscopy
technique as well as the method of the investigation of the nuclear matter
distributions in proton elastic scattering experiments in inverse kinematics
are also discussed.
