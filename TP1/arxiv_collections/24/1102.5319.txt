We investigate the prospects for determining the accelerating history of the
Universe from upcoming measurements of the expansion rate $H(z)$. In our
analyses, we use Monte Carlo simulations based on $w$CDM models to generate
samples with different characteristics and calculate the evolution of the
deceleration parameter $q(z)$. We show that a cosmographic (and, therefore,
model-independent) evidence for cosmic acceleration ($q(z<z_t) < 0$, where
$z_t$ is the transition redshift) will only be possible with an accuracy in
$H(z)$ data greater than the expected in current planned surveys. A brief
discussion about the prospects for reconstructing the dark energy equation of
state from the parameters $H(z)$ and $q(z)$ is also included.
