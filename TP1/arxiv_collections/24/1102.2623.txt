In the last few years, there has been a great interest in detecting
overlapping communities in complex networks, which is understood as dense
groups of nodes featuring a low outbound density. To date, most methods used to
compute such communities stem from the field of disjoint community detection by
either extending the concept of modularity to an overlapping context or by
attempting to decompose the whole set of nodes into several possibly
overlapping subsets. In this report we take an orthogonal approach by
introducing a metric, the cohesion, rooted in sociological considerations. The
cohesion quantifies the community-ness of one given set of nodes, based on the
notions of triangles - triplets of connected nodes - and weak ties, instead of
the classical view using only edge density. A set of nodes has a high cohesion
if it features a high density of triangles and intersects few triangles with
the rest of the network. As such, we introduce a numerical characterization of
communities: sets of nodes featuring a high cohesion. We then present a new
approach to the problem of overlapping communities by introducing the concept
of ego-munities, which are subjective communities centered around a given node,
specifically inside its neighborhood. We build upon the cohesion to construct a
heuristic algorithm which outputs a node's ego-munities by attempting to
maximize their cohesion. We illustrate the pertinence of our method with a
detailed description of one person's ego-munities among Facebook friends. We
finally conclude by describing promising applications of ego-munities such as
information inference and interest recommendations, and present a possible
extension to cohesion in the case of weighted networks.
