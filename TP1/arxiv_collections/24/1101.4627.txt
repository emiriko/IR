Radio mini-halos are diffuse, steep-spectrum synchrotron sources associated
with relaxed clusters of galaxies. Observations of some mini-halo sources
indicate a correlation between the radio emission and the X-ray signature of
gas sloshing, "cold fronts." Some authors have suggested turbulence associated
with the sloshing motions reaccelerate relativistic electrons, resulting in
emission associated with the fronts. We present MHD simulations of core gas
sloshing in a galaxy cluster, where we measure the turbulence created by these
motions and employ passive tracer particles to act as relativistic electrons
that may be accelerated by such turbulence. Our preliminary results support
such a link between sloshing motions and particle reacceleration.
