We present experimental results for the thermal resistivity {\rho} of
superfluid He^4 along several isobars between saturated vapor pressure and the
melting pressure. The measurements are for the temperature range 1 -
T_c(q)/T_{\lambda} < t < 2{\times}10^{-5} and the heat-flux range 3 < q < 70
{\mu}W/cm^2. Here t {\equiv} 1-T/T_{\lambda}, T_{\lambda} is the transition
temperature in the limit of zero q, and T_c is the transition temperature at
finite q. The data suggest that the resistivity has an incipient singularity at
T_{\lambda} which can be described by the power law {\rho} =
(t/t0)^{-(m{\nu}+{\alpha})} where t0 = (q/q0)^x. However, the singularity is
supplanted by the transition to a more highly dissipative phase at T_c(q) <
T_{\lambda}. The results suggest a mild dependence of m{\nu} + {\alpha} on P,
but can be described quite well by m{\nu} + {\alpha} = 2.76, x = 0.89, and q_0
= q_{0,0} - q_{0,1}P with q_{0,0} = 401 W/cm^2 and q_{0,1} = -5.0 W
/{cm^2-bar}. The results imply that the Gorter-Mellink mutual friction exponent
m has a value close to 3.46 and is distinctly larger than the classical value m
= 3. We suggest that the reason for this may be found in the nature of the
counterflow close to T_{\lambda}, which is expected to involve turbulent
normalfluid flow.
