The momentum- and frequency-dependent T-matrix operator for the scattering of
electromagnetic waves by a dielectric/conducting and para- or diamagnetic
sphere is derived as a Mie-type series, and presented in a compact form
emphasizing various symmetry properties, notably the unitarity identity. This
result extends to magnetic properties one previously obtained for purely
dielectric contrasts by other authors. Several situations useful to
spatially-dispersive effective-medium approximations to one-body order are
examined. Partial summation of the Mie series is achieved in the case of
elastic scattering.
