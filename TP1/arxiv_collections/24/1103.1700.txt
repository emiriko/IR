Discriminating hadronic molecular and multi-quark states is a long standing
problem in hadronic physics. We propose here to utilize relativistic heavy ion
collisions to resolve this problem, as exotic hadron yields are expected to be
strongly affected by their structures. Using the coalescence model, we find
that the exotic hadron yield relative to the statistical model result is
typically an order of magnitude smaller for a compact multi-quark state, and
larger by a factor of two or more for a loosely bound hadronic molecule. We
further find that some of the newly proposed heavy exotic states could be
produced and realistically measured at RHIC and LHC.
