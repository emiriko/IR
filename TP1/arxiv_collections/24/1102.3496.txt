Ordering properties of XY-like spin-glass magnets with an easy-plane magnetic
anisotropy are studied based on a symmetry consideration and the results of
recent numerical simulations on the pure Heisenberg and XY spin-glass models.
The effects of an easy-plane-type uniaxial anisotropy, a random magnetic
anisotropy and an applied magnetic field are investigated. In the XY regime in
zero field, the "spin-chirality decoupling" persists even under the random
magnetic anisotropy, escaping the "spin-chirality recoupling" phenomenon which
inevitably occurs in the Heisenberg regime. Contrast between the scalar chiral
order and the vector chiral order is emphasized. Implications to experiments
are discussed.
