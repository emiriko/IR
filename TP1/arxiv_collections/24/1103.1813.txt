We present the discovery of two transiting exoplanets. HAT-P-28b orbits a
V=13.03 G3 dwarf star with a period P = 3.2572 d and has a mass of 0.63 +- 0.04
MJ and a radius of 1.21 + 0.11 -0.08 RJ yielding a mean density of 0.44 +- 0.09
g cm-3. HAT-P-29b orbits a V=11.90 F8 dwarf star with a period P = 5.7232 d and
has a mass of 0.78 +0.08 -0.04 MJ and a radius of 1.11 +0.14 -0.08 RJ yielding
a mean density of 0.71 +- 0.18 g cm-3. We discuss the properties of these
planets in the context of other known transiting planets.
