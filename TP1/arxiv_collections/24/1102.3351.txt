We have studied a GaAs-AlAs planar microcavity with a resonance near 1300 nm
in the telecom range by ultrafast pump-probe reflectivity. By the judicious
choice of pump frequency, we observe a ultimate fast and reversible decrease of
the resonance frequency by more than half a linewidth due to the instantaneous
electronic Kerr effect. The switch-on and switch-off? of the cavity is only
limited by the cavity storage time of ?tcav = 0.3ps and not by intrinsic
material parameters. Our results pave the way to supra-THz switching rates for
on-chip data modulation and real-time cavity quantum electrodynamics.
