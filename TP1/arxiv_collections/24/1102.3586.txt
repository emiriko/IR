We construct a map between the quantum field theory of free Weyl or Majorana
fermions and the probability distribution of a classical statistical ensemble
for Ising spins or discrete bits. More precisely, a Grassmann functional
integral based on a real Grassmann algebra specifies the time evolution of the
real wave function $q_\tau(t)$ for the Ising states $\tau$. The time dependent
probability distribution of a generalized Ising model obtains as
$p_\tau(t)=q^2_\tau(t)$. The functional integral employs a lattice
regularization for single Weyl or Majorana spinors. We further introduce the
complex structure characteristic for quantum mechanics. Probability
distributions of the Ising model which correspond to one or many propagating
fermions are discussed explicitly. Expectation values of observables can be
computed equivalently in the classical statistical Ising model or in the
quantum field theory for fermions.
