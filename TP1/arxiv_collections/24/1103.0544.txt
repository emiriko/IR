We examine the force between two charged surfaces immersed in aqueous
mixtures having a coexistence curve. For a homogeneous water-poor phase, as the
distance between the surfaces is decreased, a water-rich phase condenses at a
distance $D_t$ in the range 1-100nm. At this distance the osmotic pressure can
become negative leading to a long-range attraction between the surfaces. The
osmotic pressure vanishes at a distance $D_e<D_t$, representing a very deep
metastable or globally stable energetic state. We give analytical and numerical
results for $D_t$ and $D_e$ on the Poisson-Boltzmann level.
