The percolation of strings gives a good description of the RHIC experimental
data on the elliptic flow, v2 and predicted a rise on the integrated v2 of the
order of 25% at LHC such as it has been experimentally obtained. We show that
the dependence of v2 on pT for RHIC and LHC energies is approximately the same
as it has been observed, for all the centralities. We show the results for
different particles and the dependence of v2 on the centralities and rapidity.
Our results are compatible with an small value of the ratio eta/s in the whole
energy range such as it was expected in the percolation framework.
