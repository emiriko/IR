This paper studies and proposes a technique of function point counting for
items classified as non-measurable. The main objective is to expand the
conventional technique of counting to ensure that this comprises consistently
the tasks involved in building portals and sites in general. In addition, it
also applies to measure the cost of continued activities related to these web
applications. The extended technique is potentially useful to measure several
products associated with information systems, including periodicals publishable
in intranets.
