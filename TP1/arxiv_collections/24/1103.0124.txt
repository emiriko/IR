We measured the static and dynamic (complex) shear viscosity of a single
layer complex plasma by applying, respectively, a stationary and a periodically
modulated shear stress induced by the light pressure of manipulating laser
beams. Under static conditions the shear viscosity reproduced the numerically
predicted shear rate dependence, the so called shear-thinning effect. Under
oscillating shear both the magnitude and the ratio of the dissipative and
elastic contributions to the complex viscosity show strong frequency
dependence. Accompanying molecular dynamics simulations explain and support the
experimental observations.
