In an attempt to get some information on the multiplicative structure of the
Green ring we study algebraic modules for simple groups, and associated groups
such as quasisimple and almost-simple groups. We prove that, for almost all
groups of Lie type in defining characteristic, the natural module is
non-algebraic. For alternating and symmetric groups, we prove that the simple
modules in $p$-blocks with defect groups of order $p^2$ are algebraic, for
$p\leq 5$. Finally, we analyze nine sporadic groups, finding that all simple
modules are algebraic for various primes and sporadic groups
