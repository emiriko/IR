Heating of figure-8 ions by odd-parity rotating magnetic fields ($RMF_o$)
applied to an elongated field-reversed configuration (FRC) is investigated. The
largest energy gain occurs at resonances ($s \equiv \omega_R/ \omega$) of the
$RMF_o$ frequency, $\omega_R$, with the figure-8 orbital frequency, $\omega$,
and is proportional to $s^2$ for $s-even$ resonances and to $s$ for $s-odd$
resonances. The threshold for the transition from regular to stochastic orbits
explains both the onset and saturation of heating. The FRC magnetic geometry
lowers the threshold for heating below that in the tokamak by an order of
magnitude.
