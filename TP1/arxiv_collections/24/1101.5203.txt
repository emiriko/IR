We examine the implications of the recent CDF measurement of the top-quark
forward-backward asymmetry, focusing on a scenario with a new color octet
vector boson at 1-3 TeV. We study several models, as well as a general
effective field theory, and determine the parameter space which provides the
best simultaneous fit to the CDF asymmetry, the Tevatron top pair production
cross section, and the exclusion regions from LHC dijet resonance and contact
interaction searches. Flavor constraints on these models are more subtle and
less severe than the literature indicates. We find a large region of allowed
parameter space at high axigluon mass and a smaller region at low mass; we
match the latter to an SU(3)xSU(3)/SU(3) coset model with a heavy vector-like
fermion. Our scenario produces discoverable effects at the LHC with only 1-2
inverse femtobarns of luminosity at 7-8 TeV. Lastly, we point out that a
Tevatron measurement of the b-quark forward-backward asymmetry would be very
helpful in characterizing the physics underlying the top-quark asymmetry.
