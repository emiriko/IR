So far fluid mechanical Nambu brackets have mainly been given on an intuitive
basis. Alternatively an algorithmic construction of such a bracket for the
two-dimensional vorticity equation is presented here. Starting from the
Lie--Poisson form and its algebraic properties it is shown how the Nambu
representation can be explicitly constructed as the continuum limit from the
structure preserving Zeitlin discretization.
