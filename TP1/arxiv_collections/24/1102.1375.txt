We present the discovery of WASP-39b, a highly inflated transiting
Saturn-mass planet orbiting a late G-type dwarf star with a period of $4.055259
\pm 0.000008$\,d, Transit Epoch T$_{0}=2455342.9688\pm0.0002$\,(HJD), of
duration $0.1168 \pm 0.0008$\,d. A combined analysis of the WASP photometry,
high-precision follow-up transit photometry, and radial velocities yield a
planetary mass of $\mpl=0.28\pm0.03\,\mj$ and a radius of
$\rpl=1.27\pm0.04\,\rj$, resulting in a mean density of $0.14 \pm 0.02\,\rhoj$.
The stellar parameters are mass $\mstar = 0.93 \pm 0.03\,\msun$, radius $\rstar
= 0.895\pm 0.23\,\rsun$, and age $9^{+3}_{-4}$\,Gyr. Only WASP-17b and WASP-31b
have lower densities than WASP-39b, although they are slightly more massive and
highly irradiated planets. From our spectral analysis, the metallicity of
WASP-39 is measured to be \feh\,$= -0.12\pm0.1$\,dex, and we find the planet to
have an equilibrium temperature of $1116^{+33}_{-32}$\,K\,. Both values
strengthen the observed empirical correlation between these parameters and the
planetary radius for the known transiting Saturn-mass planets.
