We survey some recent developments in the theory of orthogonal polynomials
defined by differential equations. The key finding is that there exist
orthogonal polynomials defined by 2nd order differential equations that fall
outside the classical families of Jacobi, Laguerre, and Hermite polynomials.
Unlike the classical families, these new examples, called exceptional
orthogonal polynomials, feature non-standard polynomial flags; the lowest
degree polynomial has degree $m>0$. In this paper we review the classification
of codimension $m=1$ exceptional polynomials, and give a novel, compact proof
of the fundamental classification theorem for codimension 1 polynomial flags.
As well, we describe the mechanism or rational factorizations of 2nd order
operators as the analogue of the Darboux transformation in this context. We
finish with the example of higher codimension generalization of Jacobi
polynomials and perform the complete analysis of parameter values for which
these families have non-singular weights.
