Consider a random smooth Gaussian field $G(x):F\to\mathbb{R}$, where $F$ is a
compact in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We derive a formula for average area of a surface
generated by the equation $G(x)=0$ and give some applications. As an auxiliary
result we obtain an integral expression for area of a surface induced by zeros
of a \emph{non-random} smooth field.
