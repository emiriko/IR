We establish a security proof of frequency-time coding quantum key
distribution (FT-QKD) protocol by showing its connection to the squeezed state
quantum key distribution protocol, which has been proven to be unconditionally
secure. We also extend the prepare-and-measure FT-QKD protocol to an
entanglement based FT-QKD protocol which is more appealing in practice.
Furthermore, we propose a correlated frequency measurement scheme of entangled
photon pair by using time resolving single photon detector. Simulation results
show that the FT-QKD protocol can be implemented with today's technology.
