We consider the blow-up of solutions for a semilinear reaction diffusion
equation with exponential reaction term. It is know that certain solutions that
can be continued beyond the blow-up time possess a nonconstant selfsimilar
blow-up profile. Our aim is to find the final time blow-up profile for such
solutions. The proof is based on general ideas using semigroup estimates. The
same approach works also for the power nonlinearity.
