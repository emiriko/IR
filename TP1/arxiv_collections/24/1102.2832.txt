Standard order-disorder phase transition in the Ising model is described in
terms of rates of processes of spin flips. This formulation allows to extend
numerous results on phase transition for sciences other than physics of
magnetism. We apply it to the problem of norm breaking. Two strategies: to
cooperate or to defect, form an analogy to two spin orientations. An example is
a crowd at an exit, where to defect means to push others, and to cooperate is
to move slowly together.
