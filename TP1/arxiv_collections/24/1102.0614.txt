We show that, in the continuum limit, the dynamics of Hamiltonian systems
defined on a lattice with long-range couplings is well described by the Vlasov
equation. This equation can be linearized around the homogeneous state and a
dispersion relation, that depends explicitly on the Fourier modes of the
lattice, can be derived. This allows one to compute the stability thresholds of
the homogeneous state, which turn out to depend on the mode number. When this
state is unstable, the growth rates are also function of the mode number.
Explicit calculations are performed for the $\alpha$-HMF model with $0 \leq
\alpha <1$, for which the zero mean-field mode is always found to dominate the
exponential growth. The theoretical predictions are successfully compared with
numerical simulations performed on a finite lattice.
