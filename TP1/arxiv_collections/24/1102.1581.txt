Ambiguities in the functional-integral solution of the stochastic
differential equation (SDE) arising due to the definition on the functional
Jacobi determinant and the white-in-time limit in the noise are analyzed and
two forms of the de Dominicis-Janssen dynamic action proposed corresponding to
the Ito and Stratonovich interpretations of the SDE.
