We predict the existence of surface dark solitons at the interface between a
self-defocusing nonlocal nonlinear medium and a linear medium. The fundamental
and higher-order surface dark solitons can exist when the linear refractive
index of the self-defocusing media is much larger than that of the linear
media. The fundamental solitons are stable and the stabilities of higher-order
solitons depend on both nonlocality degree and propagation constant.
