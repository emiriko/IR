To see whether heavy baryon and anti-baryon can form a bound state, the heavy
baryonium, we study the interaction potential between them in terms of heavy
baryon perturbation theory. The obtained potential is applied to calculate the
heavy baryonium masses by solving Schr\"{o}dinger equation. We find it is true
that the heavy baryonium may exist in a reasonable choice of input parameters.
The uncertainties remaining in the potential and their influences on the heavy
baryonium mass spectrum are discussed.
