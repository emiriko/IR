A new release of the Monte Carlo program Herwig++ (version 2.5) is now
available. This version comes with a number of improvements including: new
next-to-leading order matrix elements, including weak boson pair production; a
colour reconnection model; diffractive processes; additional models of physics
beyond the Standard Model and new leading-order matrix elements for
hadron--hadron and lepton--lepton collisions as well as photon-initiated
processes.
