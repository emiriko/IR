In the present notes we introduce and study the twisted gamma-filtration on
K_0(G), where G is a split simple linear algebraic group over a field of
characteristic prime to the order of the center of G. We apply this filtration
to construct torsion elements in the gamma-ring of an inner form of the variety
of Borel subgroups of G.
