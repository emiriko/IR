The paper analyses the SEHR spectra of symmetrical molecules on the base of
the dipole-quadrupole SEHRS theory. Existence of the bands, caused by
vibrations transforming after the unit irreducible representations of
corresponding symmetry groups is demonstrated. As it follows from the
theoretical group analysis, these bands are forbidden in phenazine, pyrazine
and in usual HRS in molecules belonging to a large number of groups (Cnh, D and
higher symmetry groups for example). Their appearance strongly confirms the
dipole-quadrupole SEHRS theory, which is able to explain other features of the
SEHR spectra of these molecules also. Investigation of the SEHR spectra of
pyridine and crystal violet demonstrates that they can be explained by this
theory too. All these results point out the existence of the strong quadrupole
light-molecule interaction, which is the reason of surface-enhanced optical
processes.
