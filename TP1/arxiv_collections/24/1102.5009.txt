Following a general introduction to open questions beyond the Standard Model,
the prospects for addressing them in the new era opened up by the LHC are
reviewed. Sample highlights are given of ways in which the LHC is already
probing beyond previous experiments, including the searches for supersymmetry,
quark and gluon substructure and microscopic black holes.
