Analytical solutions for (1+1)D surface fundamental solitons in thermal
nonlinear media are obtained. The stationary position and the critical power of
surface solitons are obtained using this analytical solutions. The analytical
solutions are verified by numerical simulations. The solutions for surface
breathers and their breathing period, and solutions for surface dipole and
tripole solitons are also given.
