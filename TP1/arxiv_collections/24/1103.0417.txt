In this paper we investigate the model of opinion dynamics with
anticonformity on a complete graph. We show that below some threshold value of
anticonformal behavior spontaneous reorientations occur between two stable
states. Dealing with a complete graph allows us also for analytical treatment.
We show that opinion dynamics can be understood as a movement of a public
opinion in a symmetric bistable effective potential. We focus also on the
spontaneous transitions between stable states and show that a typical waiting
time can be observed.
