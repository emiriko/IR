We study the dynamics of public media attention by monitoring the content of
online blogs. Social and media events can be traced by the propagation of word
frequencies of related keywords. Media events are classified as exogenous -
where blogging activity is triggered by an external news item - or endogenous
where word frequencies build up within a blogging community without external
influences. We show that word occurrences show statistical similarities to
earthquakes. The size distribution of media events follows a Gutenberg-Richter
law, the dynamics of media attention before and after the media event follows
Omori's law. We present further empirical evidence that for media events of
endogenous origin the overall public reception of the event is correlated with
the behavior of word frequencies at the beginning of the event, and is to a
certain degree predictable. These results may imply that the process of opinion
formation in a human society might be related to effects known from excitable
media.
