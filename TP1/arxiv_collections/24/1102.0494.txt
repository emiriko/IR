We describe high order accurate and stable fully-discrete finite difference
schemes for the initial-boundary value problem associated with the magnetic
induction equations. These equations model the evolution of a magnetic field
due to a given velocity field. The finite difference schemes are based on
Summation by Parts (SBP) operators for spatial derivatives and a Simultaneous
Approximation Term (SAT) technique for imposing boundary conditions. We present
various numerical experiments that demonstrate both the stability as well as
high order of accuracy of the schemes
