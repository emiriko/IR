We examine a contact between a superconductor whose order parameter changes
sign across the Brillioun zone, and an ordinary, uniform-sign superconductor.
Within a Ginzburg-Landau type model, we find that if the the barrier between
the two superconductors is not too high, the frustration of the Josephson
coupling between different portions of the Fermi surface across the contact can
lead to surprising consequences. These include time-reversal symmetry breaking
at the interface and unusual energy-phase relations with multiple local minima.
We propose this mechanism as a possible explanation for the half-integer flux
quantum transitions in composite niobium--iron pnictide superconducting loops,
which were discovered in a recent experiment [Chen et al., Nature Phys.
