In the single degenerate scenario for Type Ia supernova (SNeIa), a white
dwarf (WD) must gain a significant amount of matter from a companion star.
Because the accreted mass carries angular momentum, the WD is likely to achieve
fast spin periods, which can increase the critical mass, $M_{crit}$, needed for
explosion. When $M_{crit}$ is higher than the maximum mass achieved by the WD,
the WD must spin down before it can explode. This introduces a delay between
the time at which the WD has completed its epoch of mass gain and the time of
the explosion. Matter ejected from the binary during mass transfer therefore
has a chance to become diffuse, and the explosion occurs in a medium with a
density similar to that of typical regions of the interstellar medium. Also,
either by the end of the WD's mass increase or else by the time of explosion,
the donor may exhaust its stellar envelope and become a WD. This alters,
generally diminishing, explosion signatures related to the donor star.
Nevertheless, the spin-up/spin-down model is highly predictive. Prior to
explosion, progenitors can be super-$M_{Ch}$ WDs in either wide binaries with
WD companions, or else in cataclysmic variables. These systems can be
discovered and studied through wide-field surveys. Post explosion, the
spin-up/spin-down model predicts a population of fast-moving WDs, low-mass
stars, and even brown dwarfs. In addition, the spin-up/spin-down model provides
a paradigm which may be able to explain both the similarities and the diversity
observed among SNeIa.
