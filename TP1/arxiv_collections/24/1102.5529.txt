Besides the complexity in time or in number of messages, a common approach
for analyzing distributed algorithms is to look at the assumptions they make on
the underlying network. We investigate this question from the perspective of
network dynamics. In particular, we ask how a given property on the evolution
of the network can be rigorously proven as necessary or sufficient for a given
algorithm. The main contribution of this paper is to propose the combination of
two existing tools in this direction: local computations by means of graph
relabelings, and evolving graphs. Such a combination makes it possible to
express fine-grained properties on the network dynamics, then examine what
impact those properties have on the execution at a precise, intertwined, level.
We illustrate the use of this framework through the analysis of three simple
algorithms, then discuss general implications of this work, which include (i)
the possibility to compare distributed algorithms on the basis of their
topological requirements, (ii) a formal hierarchy of dynamic networks based on
these requirements, and (iii) the potential for mechanization induced by our
framework, which we believe opens a door towards automated analysis and
decision support in dynamic networks.
