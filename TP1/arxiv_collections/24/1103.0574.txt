We present a comprehensive analysis of high resolution neutron scattering
data involving Neutron Spin Echo spectroscopy and Spherical Polarimetry which
confirm the first order nature of the helical transition and reveal the
existence of a new spin liquid skyrmion phase. Similar to the blue phases of
liquid crystals this phase appears in a very narrow temperature range between
the low temperature helical and the high temperature paramagnetic phases.
