We explore the possibility of passive error correction in the toric code
model. We first show that even coherent dynamics, stemming from spin
interactions or the coupling to an external magnetic field, lead to logical
errors. We then argue that Anderson localization of the defects, arising from
unavoidable fluctuations of the coupling constants, provides a remedy. This
protection is demonstrated using general analytical arguments that are
complemented with numerical results which demonstrate that self-correcting
memory can in principle be achieved in the limit of a nonzero density of
identical defects.
