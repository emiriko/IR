In this work a class of interior solution for Einstein field equations
corresponding to a spherically symmetric anisotropic fluid sphere has been
obtained under the assumption that the cosmological constant is spatially
variable. The solution obtained has the characteristics that the pressure and
the cosmological parameter vanish at the centre and at the boundary with a
maximum value somewhere inside the body. It has been argued that a variable $
\Lambda $ is as much important physically in Astrophysics as in Cosmology.
