Context. Helically forced magneto-hydrodynamic shearing-sheet turbulence can
support different large-scale dynamo modes, although the {\alpha} - {\Omega}
mode is generally expected to dominate because it is the fastest growing. In an
{\alpha} - {\Omega} dynamo, most of the field amplification is produced by the
shear. As differential rotation is an ubiquitous source of shear in
astrophysics, such dynamos are believed to be the source of most astrophysical
large-scale magnetic fields. Aims. We study the stability of oscillatory
migratory {\alpha} - {\Omega} type dynamos in turbulence simulations. Methods.
We use shearing-sheet simulations of hydromagnetic turbulence that is helically
forced at a wavenumber that is about three times larger than the lowest
wavenumber in the domain so that both {\alpha} - {\Omega} and {\alpha}2 dynamo
action is possible. Results. After initial dominance and saturation, the
{\alpha} - {\Omega} mode is found to be destroyed by an orthogonal {\alpha}2
mode sustained by the helical turbulence alone. We show that there are at least
two processes through which this transition can occur. Conclusions. The
fratricide of {\alpha} - {\Omega} dynamos by its {\alpha}2 sibling is discussed
in the context of grand minima of solar and stellar activity. However, the
genesis of {\alpha} - {\Omega} dynamos from an {\alpha}2 dynamo has not yet
been found.
