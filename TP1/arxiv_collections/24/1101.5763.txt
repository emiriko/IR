Semantic web is the next generation web, which concerns the meaning of web
documents It has the immense power to pull out the most relevant information
from the web pages, which is also meaningful to any user, using software
agents. In today's world, agent communication is not possible if concerned
ontology is changed a little. We have pointed out this very problem and
developed an Ontology Purification System to help agent communication. In our
system you can send queries and view the search results. If it can't meet the
criteria then it finds out the mismatched elements. Modification is done within
a second and you can see the difference. That's why we emphasis on the word
dynamic. When Administrator is updating the system, at the same time that
updation is visible to the user.
