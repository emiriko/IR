Entanglement criteria for general (pure or mixed) states of systems
consisting of two identical fermions are introduced. These criteria are based
on appropriate inequalities involving the entropy of the global density matrix
describing the total system, on the one hand, and the entropy of the one
particle reduced density matrix, on the other one. A majorization-related
relation between these two density matrices is obtained, leading to a family of
entanglement criteria based on R\'enyi's entropic measure. These criteria are
applied to various illustrative examples of parametrized families of mixed
states. The dependence of the entanglement detection efficiency on R\'enyi's
entropic parameter is investigated. The extension of these criteria to systems
of $N$ identical fermions is also considered.
