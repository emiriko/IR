The capacity region of the 3-user Gaussian Interference Channel (GIC) with
mixed strong-very strong interference was established in \cite{ChS}. The mixed
strong-very strong interference conditions considered in \cite{ChS} correspond
to the case where, at each receiver, one of the interfering signals is strong
and the other is very strong. In this paper, we derive the capacity region of
$K$-user $(K\geq 3)$ Discrete Memoryless Interference Channels (DMICs) with a
mixed strong-very strong interference. This corresponds to the case where, at
each receiver one of the interfering signals is strong and the other $(K-2)$
interfering signals are very strong. This includes, as a special case, the
3-user DMIC with mixed strong-very strong interference. The proof is
specialized to the 3-user GIC case and hence an alternative simpler derivation
for the capacity region of the 3-user GIC with mixed strong-very strong
interference is provided.
