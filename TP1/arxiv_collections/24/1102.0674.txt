Recommendation systems represent an important tool for news distribution on
the Internet. In this work we modify a recently proposed social recommendation
model in order to deal with no explicit ratings of users on news. The model
consists of a network of users which continually adapts in order to achieve an
efficient news traffic. To optimize network's topology we propose different
stochastic algorithms that are scalable with respect to the network's size.
Agent-based simulations reveal the features and the performance of these
algorithms. To overcome the resultant drawbacks of each method we introduce two
improved algorithms and show that they can optimize network's topology almost
as fast and effectively as other not-scalable methods that make use of much
more information.
