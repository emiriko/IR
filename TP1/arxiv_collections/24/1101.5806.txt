Continuous photometric observations of five young stars obtained by the MOST
satellite in 2009 and 2010 in the Taurus and Lupus star formation regions are
presented. Using light curve modelling under the assumption of internal
invariability of spots, we obtained small values of the solar-type
differential-rotation parameter (k=0.0005-0.009) for three spotted weak-line T
Tau stars, V410 Tau, V987 Tau and Lupus 3-14; for another spotted WTTS, Lupus
3-48, the data are consistent with a rigidly rotating surface (k=0). Three
flares of similar rise (4 min 30 sec) and decay (1 h 45 min) times were
detected in the light curve of Lupus 3-14. The brightness of the classical T
Tau star RY Tau continuously decreased over 3 weeks of its observations with a
variable modulation not showing any obvious periodic signal.
