We study real trigonal curves and elliptic surfaces of type $\I$ (over a base
of an arbitrary genus) and their fiberwise equivariant deformations. The
principal tool is a real version of Grothendieck's \emph{dessins d'enfants}. We
give a description of maximally inflected trigonal curves of type $\I$ in terms
of the combinatorics of sufficiently simple graphs and, in the case of the
rational base, obtain a complete classification of such curves. As a
consequence, these results lead to conclusions concerning real Jacobian
elliptic surfaces of type $\I$ with all singular fibers real.
