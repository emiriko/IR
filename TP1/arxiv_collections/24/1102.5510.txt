Using the compatibility of the anomalous Chern-Simons couplings on
D$_p$-branes with the linear T-duality and with the antisymmetric B-field gauge
transformations, some couplings have been recently found for $C^{(p-3)}$ at
order $O(\alpha'^2)$. We examine these couplings with the S-matrix element of
one RR and two antisymmetric B-field vertex operators. We find that the
S-matrix element reproduces these couplings as well as some other couplings.
Each of them is invariant under the linear T-duality and the B-field gauge
transformations.
