It is generally believed that in a superconducor Cooper pairs are broken at
above-critical current region, corresponding to the lost of superconductivity.
We suggest that, under some circumstance, Cooper pairs could still exist above
critical current, and that dissipation of the system is caused by the
scattering of these pairs. The existence of Cooper pairs in this region can be
revealed by investigating the temperature dependence of the electrical
resistance.
