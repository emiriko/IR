Let $r_Q(n)$ be the representation number of a nonnegative integer $n$ by the
quaternary quadratic form $Q=x_1^2+2x_2^2+x_3^2+x_4^2+x_1x_3+x_1x_4+x_2x_4$. We
first prove the identity $r_Q(p^2n)=r_Q(p^2)r_Q(n)/r_Q(1)$ for any prime $p$
different from 13 and any positive integer $n$ prime to $p$, which was
conjectured in [Eum et al, A modularity criterion for Klein forms, with an
application to modular forms of level 13, J. Math. Anal. Appl. 375 (2011),
28--41]. And, we explicitly determine a concise formula for the number
$r_Q(n^2)$ as well for any integer $n$.
