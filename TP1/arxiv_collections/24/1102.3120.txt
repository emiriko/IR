In this paper, we study a communication system consisting of three end-nodes,
e.g. a single transceiver base station (BS), one transmitting and one receiving
user equipments (UEs), and a common two-way relay node (RN) wherein the
full-duplex BS transmits to the receiving UE in downlink direction and receives
from the transmitting UE in uplink direction with the help of the intermediate
full-duplex RN. We call this system model as interference two-way relay channel
(ITWRC) with three end-nodes. Information theoretic bounds corresponding this
system model are derived and analyzed so as to better understand the potentials
of exploiting RN in future communication systems. Specifically, achievable rate
regions corresponding to decode-and-forward (DF) relaying with and without rate
splitting, and partial-DF and compress-and-forward (pDF+CF) relaying strategies
are derived.
