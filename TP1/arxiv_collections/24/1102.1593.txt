The physical properties of a periodic distribution of absorbent resonators is
used in this work to design a tunable wideband bandstop acoustic filter.
Analytical and numerical simulations as well as experimental validations show
that the control of the resonances and the absorption of the scatterers along
with their periodic arrangement in air introduces high technological
possibilities to control noise. Sound manipulation is perhaps the most obvious
application of the structures presented in this work. We apply this methodology
to develop a device as an alternative to the conventional acoustic barriers
with several properties from the acoustical point of view but also with
additional aesthetic and constructive characteristics.
