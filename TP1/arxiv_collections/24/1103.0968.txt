We present theoretical and experimental results on spatial quantum
correlations induced by multiple scattering of nonclassical light. A continuous
mode quantum theory is derived that enables determining the spatial quantum
correlation function from the fluctuations of the total transmittance and
reflectance. Utilizing frequency-resolved quantum noise measurements, we
observe that the strength of the spatial quantum correlation function can be
controlled by changing the quantum state of an incident bright squeezed-light
source. Our results are found to be in excellent agreement with the developed
theory and form a basis for future research on, e.g., quantum interference of
multiple quantum states in a multiple scattering medium.
