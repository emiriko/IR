An updated heavy quark-antiquark potential is constructed by matching the
short-distance perturbative part to long-distance lattice QCD results at an
intermediate r scale. The static potential and the order 1/m potential are both
analyzed in this way. Effects if order 1/m in charmonium and bottomonium
spectra are discussed in comparison. Charm and bottom quark masses are deduced
from the spectra and related to the quark masses of other schemes.
