We say (W, \{\phi_1,..., \phi_t\}) is a polarizable dynamical system of
several morphisms if \phi_i are endomorphisms on a projective variety $W$ such
that \bigotimes \phi_i^*L is linearly equivalent to L^q} for some ample line
bundle L on W and for some q>t. If q is a rational number, then we have the
equidistribution of small points of given dynamical system because of Yuan's
work. As its application, we can build a polarizable dynamical system of an
automorphism and its inverse on $K3$ surface and show its periodic points are
equidistributed.
