We review the physics of one-dimensional interacting bosonic systems.
Beginning with results from exactly solvable models and computational
approaches, we introduce the concept of bosonic Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquids
relevant for one-dimension, and compare it with Bose-Einstein condensates
existing in dimensions higher than one. We discuss the effects of various
perturbations on the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid state as well as extensions to
multicomponent and out of equilibrium situations. Finally, we review the
experimental systems that can be described in terms of models of interacting
bosons in one dimension.
