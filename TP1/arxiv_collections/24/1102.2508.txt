In the standard "monoenergetic" approach to numerical calculation of
stellarator neoclassical transport, to expedite computation, ad-hoc changes are
made to the kinetic equation so speed enters only as a parameter. Here we
examine the validity of this approach by considering the effective particle
trajectories in a model magnetic field. We find monoenergetic codes
systematically under-predict the true trapped particle fraction, with the error
in the trapped ion fraction being of order unity when the electric field is
large, suggesting some results of these codes may be unreliable in this regime.
This inaccuracy is independent of any errors introduced by approximation of the
collision operator.
