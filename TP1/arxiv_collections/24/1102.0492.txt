In a recent paper by Hooper and Goodenough, data from the Fermi Gamma Ray
Telescope was analyzed and an excess of gamma rays was claimed to be found in
the emission spectrum from the Galactic Center Region. Hooper and Goodenough
suggest that the claimed excess can be well explained by 7-10 GeV annihilating
dark matter with a power law density profile if the dark matter annihilates
predominantly to tau pairs. In this paper we present such a dark matter model
by extending the MSSM to include four Higgs doublets and one scalar singlet. A
Z2 symmetry is imposed that enforces a Yukawa structure so that the up quarks,
down quarks, and leptons each receive mass from a distinct doublet. This leads
to an enhanced coupling of scalars to leptons and allows the model to naturally
achieve the required phenomenology in order to explain the gamma ray excess.
Our model yields the correct dark matter thermal relic density and avoids
collider bounds from measurements of the Z width as well as direct production
at LEP.
