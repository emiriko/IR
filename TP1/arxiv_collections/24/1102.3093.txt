In automata theory, the quantum computation has been widely examined for
finite state machines, known as quantum finite automata (QFAs), and less
attention has been given to the QFAs augmented with counters or stacks.
Moreover, to our knowledge, there is no result related to QFAs having more than
one input head. In this paper, we focus on such generalizations of QFAs whose
input head(s) operate(s) in one-way or realtime mode and present many
superiority of them to their classical counterparts. Furthermore, we propose
some open problems and conjectures in order to investigate the power of
quantumness better. We also give some new results on classical computation.
