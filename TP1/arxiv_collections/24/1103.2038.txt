For spherical Tits buildings of the classical types there are well-known
explicit descriptions as flag complexes. Similarly for affine buildings of the
classical types there are explicit constructions in terms of lattices. In this
article we generalize the flag complex description to twin cities, a
generalization of twin buildings adapted to analytic completions of Kac-Moody
groups as they appear for example in Kac-Moody geometry. We construct linear
representations of twin cities as flag complexes of certain subspaces in
Hilbert spaces.
