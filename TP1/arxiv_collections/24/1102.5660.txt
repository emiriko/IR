Misoriented bilayer graphene with commensurate angles shows unique
magneto-optical properties. The optical absorption spectra of such a system
strongly depend on the angle of rotation. For a general commensurate twist
angle the absorption spectra has a simple single-peak structure. However, our
studies indicate that there are special angles at which the absorption spectra
of the rotated bilayer exhibit well developed multi-peak structures. These
angles correspond to even symmetry of the rotated graphene with respect to the
sublattice exchange. Magneto-spectroscopy can therefore be a potentially useful
scheme to determine the twist angles.
