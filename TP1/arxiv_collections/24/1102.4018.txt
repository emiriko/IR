The Hepp method is the coherent state approach to the mean field dynamics for
bosons or to the semiclassical propagation. A key point is the asymptotic
evolution of Wick observables under the evolution given by a time-dependent
quadratic Hamiltonian. This article provides a complete expansion with respect
to the small parameter \epsilon > 0 which makes sense within the
infinite-dimensional setting and fits with finite-dimensional formulae.
