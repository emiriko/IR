The topic of diversity is an interesting subject, both as a purely
mathematical concept and also for its applications to important real-life
situations. Unfortunately, although the meaning of diversity seems intuitively
clear, no precise mathematical definition exists. In this paper, we adopt an
axiomatic approach to the problem, and attempt to produce a satisfactory
measure.
