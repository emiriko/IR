The intrinsic viscosity of a dilute dispersion of rigid rods is studied using
a recently developed direct numerical simulation (DNS) method for particle
dispersions. A reentrant transition from shear-thinning to the 2nd Newtonian
regime is successfully reproduced in the present DNS results around a Peclet
number ${\rm Pe}=150$, which is in good agreement with our theoretical
prediction of ${\rm Pe}=143$, at which the dynamical crossover from Brownian to
non-Brownian behavior takes place in the rotational motion of the rotating rod.
The viscosity undershoot is observed in our simulations before reaching the 2nd
Newtonian regime. The physical mechanisms behind these behaviors are analyzed
in detail.
