Superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) spin valve effect theories based on the S/F
proximity phenomenon assume that the superconducting transition temperature Tc
of F1/F2/S or F1/S/F2 trilayers for parallel magnetizations of the F1- and
F2-layers (TcP) are smaller than for the antiparallel orientations (TcAP).
Here, we report for CoOx/Fe1/Cu/Fe2/In multilayered systems with varying
Fe2-layer thickness the sign-changing oscillating behavior of the spin valve
effect \Delta Tc=TcAP-TcP. Our measurements revealed the full direct spin valve
effect with TcAP>TcP for Fe2-layer thickness dFe2<1 nm and the full inverse
(TcAP<TcAP) spin valve effect for dFe2>=1 nm. Interference of Cooper pair wave
functions reflected from both surfaces of the Fe2-layer appear as the most
probable reason for the observed behavior of \Delta Tc.
