The first successful macroscopic theory for the motion of superfluid helium
was that of Lev Landau (1941) in which the fluid is modelled phenomenologically
as an interpenetrating mixture of a superfluid and a normal fluid. It has later
been shown that Landau's two-fluid model can be rigorously derived from a
one-fluid model within the classical fields approximation. Assuming a
separation of scales exists between the slowly varying, large-scale, background
(condensate) field, and the short rapidly evolving excitations, a full
description of the kinetics between the condensate and the thermal cloud can be
obtained. The kinetics describes three-wave and four-wave interactions that
resemble the C_{12} and C_{22} terms, respectively, in the collision integral
of the ZNG theory. The scale separation assumption precludes analysis of the
healing layer and thus does not include the dynamics of quantised vortices.
Whilst the analysis required the use of small parameters arising from the scale
separation assumption and the assumption of a weakly depleted condensate, we
expect the results to hold true over a wider range of parameters. This belief
is motivated by the validity of Landau's two-fluid model which can be derived
from a one-fluid model using nothing more than Galilean invariance principles.
Indeed, we argue that similar arguments can be used to recover a two-fluid
model directly from a classical field simply by invoking a local gauge
transformation. This derivation does not require any small parameters to be
introduced suggesting that the results that lead to the kinetic equations may
turn out to be more general.
