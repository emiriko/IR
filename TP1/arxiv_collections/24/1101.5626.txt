We describe the theory and first experimental work on our concept for
searching on earth for the presence of dark content of the vacuum (DCV) using
atom interferometry. Specifically, we have in mind any DCV that has not yet
been detected on a laboratory scale, but might manifest itself as dark energy
on the cosmological scale. The experimental method uses two atom
interferometers to cancel the effect of earth's gravity and diverse noise
sources. It depends upon two assumptions: first, that the DCV possesses some
space inhomogeneity in density, and second that it exerts a sufficiently strong
non-gravitational force on matter. The motion of the apparatus through the DCV
should then lead to an irregular variation in the detected matter-wave phase
shift. We discuss the nature of this signal and note the problem of
distinguishing it from instrumental noise. We also discuss the relation of our
experiment to what might be learned by studying the noise in gravitational wave
detectors such as LIGO.The paper concludes with a projection that a future
search of this nature might be carried out using an atom interferometer in an
orbiting satellite. The apparatus is now being constructed.
