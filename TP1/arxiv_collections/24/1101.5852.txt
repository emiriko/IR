We propose a universal analytical method to study the dynamics of a
multi-anticrossing system subject to driving by one single large-amplitude
triangle pulse, within its time scales smaller than the dephasing time. Our
approach can explain the main features of the Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg
interference patterns recently observed in a tripartite system [Nature
Communications 1:51 (2010)]. In particular, we focus on the effects of the size
of anticrossings on interference and compare the calculated interference
patterns with numerical simulations. In addition, Fourier transform of the
patterns can extract information on the energy level spectrum.
