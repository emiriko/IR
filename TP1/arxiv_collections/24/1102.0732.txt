For optimal processing and design of entangled polymeric materials it is
important to establish a rigorous link between the detailed molecular
composition of the polymer and the viscoelastic properties of the macroscopic
melt. We review current and past computer simulation techniques and critically
assess their ability to provide such a link between chemistry and rheology. We
distinguish between two classes of coarse-graining levels, which we term
coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) and coarse-grained stochastic dynamics
(CGSD). In CGMD the coarse-grained beads are still relatively hard, thus
automatically preventing bond crossing. This also implies an upper limit on the
number of atoms that can be lumped together and therefore on the longest chain
lengths that can be studied. To reach a higher degree of coarse-graining, in
CGSD many more atoms are lumped together, leading to relatively soft beads. In
that case friction and stochastic forces dominate the interactions, and actions
must be undertaken to prevent bond crossing. We also review alternative methods
that make use of the tube model of polymer dynamics, by obtaining the
entanglement characteristics through a primitive path analysis and by
simulation of a primitive chain network. We finally review super-coarse-grained
methods in which an entire polymer is represented by a single particle, and
comment on ways to include memory effects and transient forces.
