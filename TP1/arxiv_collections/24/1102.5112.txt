This paper considers a binary channel with deletions and insertions, where
each input bit is transformed in one of the following ways: it is deleted with
probability d, or an extra bit is added after it with probability i, or it is
transmitted unmodified with probability 1-d-i. A computable lower bound on the
capacity of this channel is derived. The transformation of the input sequence
by the channel may be viewed in terms of runs as follows: some runs of the
input sequence get shorter/longer, some runs get deleted, and some new runs are
added. It is difficult for the decoder to synchronize the channel output
sequence to the transmitted codeword mainly due to deleted runs and new
inserted runs.
  The main idea is a mutual information decomposition in terms of the rate
achieved by a sub-optimal decoder that determines the positions of the deleted
and inserted runs in addition to decoding the transmitted codeword. The mutual
information between the channel input and output sequences is expressed as the
sum of the rate achieved by this decoder and the rate loss due to its
sub-optimality. Obtaining computable lower bounds on each of these quantities
yields a lower bound on the capacity. The bounds proposed in this paper provide
the first characterization of achievable rates for channels with general
insertions, and for channels with both deletions and insertions. For the
special case of the deletion channel, the proposed bound improves on the
previous best lower bound for deletion probabilities up to 0.3.
