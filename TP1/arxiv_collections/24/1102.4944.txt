In this work we use the in-situ accumulated stress monitoring technique to
evaluate the evolution of the stress during the strain balancing of InAs/GaAs
quantum dots and quantum posts. The comparison of these results with
simulations and other strain balanced criteria commonly used indicate that it
is necessary to consider the kinematics of the process, not only the nominal
values for the deposited materials. We find that the substrate temperature
plays a major role on the compensation process and it is necessary to take it
into account in order to achieve the optimum compensation conditions. The
application of the technique to quantum posts has allowed us to fabricate
nanostructures of exceptional length (120 nm). In situ accumulated measurements
show that, even in shorter nanostrcutures, relaxation processes can be
inhibited with the resulting increase in the material quality.
