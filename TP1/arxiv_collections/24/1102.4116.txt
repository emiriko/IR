We study the extrinsic spin Hall effect induced by Ir impurities in Cu by
injecting a pure spin current into a CuIr wire from a lateral spin valve
structure. While no spin Hall effect is observed without Ir impurity, the spin
Hall resistivity of CuIr increases linearly with the impurity concentration.
The spin Hall angle of CuIr, $(2.1 \pm 0.6)$% throughout the concentration
range between 1% and 12%, is practically independent of temperature. These
results represent a clear example of predominant skew scattering extrinsic
contribution to the spin Hall effect in a nonmagnetic alloy.
