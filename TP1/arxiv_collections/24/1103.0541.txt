Ultra-cold atoms in specifically designed optical lattices can be used to
mimic the many-particle Hamiltonian describing electrons and positrons in an
external electric field. This facilitates the experimental simulation of (so
far unobserved) fundamental quantum phenomena such as the Schwinger effect,
i.e., spontaneous electron-positron pair creation out of the vacuum by a strong
electric field.
