Zaghloul [Phys. Plasmas 17, 062701 (2010); arXiv:1010.1161v1] reconsiders the
occupation probability formalism in plasma thermodynamics and claims
inconsistencies in previous models. I show that the origin of this incorrect
claim is an omission of the configurational factor from the partition function.
This arXiv version is supplemented with two appendices, where I add remarks and
comments on two more recent publications of the same author on the same
subject: on his response to this Comment [Phys. Plasmas 17, 124705 (2010)] and
on his criticism towards the Hummer and Mihalas's (1988) formalism [Phys.
Plasmas 17, 122903 (2010); arXiv:1010.1102v1].
