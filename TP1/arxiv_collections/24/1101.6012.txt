In this work we show that the latest LHC data on multiplicity moments
$C_2-C_5$ are well described by a two-step model in the form of a convolution
of the Poisson distribution with energy-dependent source function. For the
source function we take $\Gamma$ Negative Binomial Distribution. No unexpected
behavior of Negative Binomial Distribution parameter $k$ is found. We give also
predictions for the higher energies of 10 and 14 TeV.
