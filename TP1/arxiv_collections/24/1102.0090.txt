During the last years, the ALPHA collaboration has been developing and
implementing a method based on Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) to compute
B-mesons observables through lattice simulations. Thanks to a non-perturbative
matching to QCD, the theory is renormalizable at any order of the heavy quark
mass expansion. In order to extract precisely the relevant matrix elements and
masses, we use all-to-all propagators and solve an generalized eigenvalue
problem (GEVP). We have shown in the quenched approximation that quantities
like the b-quark mass mb, the heavy-light decay constant(s) or the B-meson
spectrum can be computed precisely beyond the static approximation (including
the first corrections in 1/\mb). More recently, we have started to include the
sea quark effects, by working with Nf=2 light flavors of dynamical fermions[1].
The computation of the matching parameters is almost finished, but concerning
the extraction of the hadronic quantities for which we use some CLS
ensembles[2], only one lattice spacing has been analyzed so far. In this
proceeding we report on the status of this project and present some preliminary
results.
