Exchange bias (EB) is usually observed in systems with interface between
different magnetic phases after field cooling. Here we report an unusual
phenomenon in which a large EB can be observed in Ni-Mn-In bulk alloys after
zero-field cooling from an unmagnetized state. We propose this is related to
the newly formed interface between different magnetic phases during the initial
magnetization process. The magnetic unidirectional anisotropy, which is the
origin of EB effect, can be created isothermally below the blocking
temperature.
