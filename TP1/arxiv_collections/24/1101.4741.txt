Analytical solutions of Maxwell equations around black hole immersed in
external uniform magnetic field in the background of the Kehagias-Sfetsos (KS)
asymptotically flat black hole solution of Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity have
been found. Influence of magnetic field on effective potential of the radial
motion of charged test particle around black hole immersed in external magnetic
field in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity has been investigated by using
Hamilton-Jacobi method. Exact analytical solution for dependence of the minimal
radius of the circular orbits $r_{\rm mc}$ from KS parameter $\omega$ for
motion of test particle around spherical symmetric black hole in
Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity has been derived. The critical values of the
particle's angular momentum for captured particles by black hole in
Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity have been obtained numerically. The comparison of
the obtained numerical results with the astrophysical observational data on
radii of the innermost stable circular orbits gives us the estimation of the
parameter as $\omega \simeq 3.6 \cdot 10^{-24} {\rm cm}^{-2}$.
