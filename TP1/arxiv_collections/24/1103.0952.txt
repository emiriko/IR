On the basis of frequentist analyses of experimental constraints from
electroweak precision data, (g-2)_mu, B-physics and cosmological data, we
predict the masses of Higgs bosons and SUSY particles of the CMSSM, NUHM1,
VCMSSM and mSUGRA. In the CMSSM, NUHM1 and VCMSSM we find preferences for
sparticle masses that are relatively light, leading to good prospects for the
LHC and the ILC. Including first data from SUSY searches at the LHC leads to an
increase of the preferred sparticle mass scales, but improves the consistency
of the model predictions for M_h with the LEP exclusion bounds.
