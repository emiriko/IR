We consider moments of the non-diagonal vector, axial-vector, scalar and
pseudo-scalar current correlators involving two different massive quark
flavours up to three-loop accuracy. Expansions around the limits where one mass
is zero and the equal-mass case are computed. These results are used to
construct approximations valid for arbitrary mass values.
