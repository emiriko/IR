Pulsar timing experiments aimed at the detection of gravitational radiation
have been performed for decades now. With the forthcoming construction of large
arrays capable of tracking multiple millisecond pulsars, it is very likely we
will be able to make the first detection of gravitational radiation in the
nano-Hertz band, and test Einstein's theory of relativity by measuring the
polarization components of the detected signals. Since a gravitational wave
predicted by the most general relativistic metric theory of gravity accounts
for {\it six} polarization modes (the usual two Einstein's tensor polarizations
as well as two vector and two scalar wave components), we have estimated the
single-antenna sensitivities to these six polarizations. We find pulsar timing
experiments to be significantly more sensitive, over their entire observational
frequency band ($\approx 10^{-9} - 10^{-6}$ Hz), to scalar-longitudinal and
vector waves than to scalar-transverse and tensor waves. At $10^{-7}$ Hz and
with pulsars at a distance of $1$ kpc, for instance, we estimate an average
sensitivity to scalar-longitudinal waves that is more than two orders of
magnitude better than the sensitivity to tensor waves. Our results imply that a
direct detection of gravitational radiation by pulsar timing will result into a
test of the theory of general relativity that is more stringent than that based
on monitoring the decay of the orbital period of a binary system.
