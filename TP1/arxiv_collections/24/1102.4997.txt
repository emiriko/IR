We calculate the photoluminescence spectrum and lifetime of a biexciton in a
semiconductor using Fermi's golden rule. Our biexciton wavefunction is obtained
using a Quantum Monte Carlo calculation. We consider a recombination process
where one of the excitons within the biexciton annihilates. For hole masses
greater than or equal to the electron mass, we find that the surviving exciton
is most likely to populate the ground state. We also investigate how the
confinement of excitons in a quantum dot would modify the lifetime in the limit
of a large quantum dot where confinement principally affects the centre of mass
wavefunction. The lifetimes we obtain are in reasonable agreement with
experimental values. Our calculation can be used as a benchmark for comparison
with approximate methods.
