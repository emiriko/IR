The dynamics of a vibronic system in a lossy two-mode cavity is studied, with
the first mode being resonant to the electronic transition and the second one
being nearly resonant due to Raman transitions. We derive analytical solutions
for the dynamics of this system. For a properly chosen detuning of the second
mode from the exact Raman resonance, we obtain conditions that are closely
related to the phenomenon of Rabi resonance as it is well known in laser
physics. Such resonances can be observed in the spontaneous emission spectra,
where the spectrum of the second mode in the case of weak Raman coupling is
enhanced substantially.
