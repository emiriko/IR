We investigate the role discrete clumps embedded in an astrophysical jet play
on the jet's morphology and line emission characteristics. By varying clumps'
size, density, position, and velocity, we cover a range of parameter space
motivated by observations of objects such as the Herbig Haro object HH~34. We
here extend the results presented in Yirak et al. 2009, including how analysis
of individual observations may lead to spurious sinusoidal variation whose
parameters vary widely over time, owing chiefly to interacts between clumps.
The goodness of the fits, while poor in all simulations, are best when
clump-clump collisions are minimal. Our results indicate that a large velocity
dispersion leads to a clump-clump collision-dominated flow which disrupts the
jet beam. Finally, we present synthetic emission images of H-$\alpha$ and [SII]
and note an excess of [SII] emission along the jet length as compared to
observations. This suggests that observed beams undergo earlier processing, if
they are present at all.
