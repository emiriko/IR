We have investigated numerically the field-driven propagation of
perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnetic layers. It was then compared to the
historical one-dimensional domain wall (DW) propagation model widely used in
spintronics studies of magnetic nanostructures. In the particular regime of
layer thickness (h) of the order of the exchange length, anomalous velocity
peaks appear in the precessional regime, their shape and position shifting with
h. This has also been observed experimentally. Analyses of the simulations show
a distinct correlation between the curvature of the DW and the twist of the
magnetization vector within it, and the velocity peak. Associating a
phenomenological description of this twist with a four-coordinate DW
propagation model, we reproduce very well these kinks and show that they result
from the torque exerted by the stray field created by the domains on the
twisted magnetization. The position of the peaks is well predicted from the
DW's first flexural mode frequency, and depends strongly on the layer
thickness. Comparison of the proposed model to DW propagation data obtained on
dilute semiconductor ferromagnets GaMnAs and GaMnAsP sheds light on the origin
of the measured peaks.
