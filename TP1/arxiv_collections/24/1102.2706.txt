This paper addresses the problem of blind separation of convolutive mixtures
of BPSK and circular linearly modulated signals with unknown (and possibly
different) baud rates and carrier frequencies. In previous works, we
established that the Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA) is able to extract a
source from a convolutive mixture of circular linearly modulated signals. We
extend the analysis of the extraction capabilities of the CMA when the mixing
also contains BPSK signals. We prove that if the various source signals do not
share any non zero cyclic frequency nor any non conjugate cyclic frequencies,
the local minima of the constant modulus cost function are separating filters.
Unfortunately, the minimization of the Godard cost function generally fails
when considering BPSK signals that have the same rates and the same carrier
frequencies. This failure is due to the existence of non-separating local
minima of the Godard cost function. In order to achieve the separation, we
propose a simple modification of the Godard cost function which only requires
knowledge of the BPSK sources frequency offsets at the receiver side. We
provide various simulations of realistic digital communications scenarios that
support our theoretical statements.
