We discuss $p$-variation regularity of real-valued functions defined on
$[0,T]^2$, based on rectangular increments. When $p>1$, there are two slightly
different notions of $p$-variation; both of which are useful in the context of
Gaussian rough paths. Unfortunately, these concepts were blurred in previous
works; the purpose of this note is to show that the aforementioned notions of
$p$-variations are "$\epsilon$-close". In particular, all arguments relevant
for Gaussian rough paths go through with minor notational changes.
