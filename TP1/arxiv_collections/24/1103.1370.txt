We present broad band analysis of the Be/X-ray transient 1A 1118-61 by Suzaku
at the peak of its 3rd observed outburst in January 2009 and 2 weeks later when
the source flux had decayed by an order of magnitude. The continuum was modeled
with a \texttt{cutoffpl} model as well as a compTT model, with both cases
requiring an additional black body component at lower energies. We confirm the
detection of a cyclotron line at ~5 keV and discuss the possibility of a first
harmonic at ~110 keV. Pulse profile comparisons show a change in the profile
structure at lower energies, an indication for possible changes in the
accretion geometry. Phase resolved spectroscopy in the outburst data show a
change in the continuum throughout the pulse period. The decrease in the CRSF
centroid energy also indicates that the viewing angle on the accretion column
is changing throughout the pulse period.
