The tolerancing step has a great importance in the design process. It
characterises the relationship between the different sectors of the product
life cycle: Design, Manufacturing and Control. We can distinguish several
methods to assist the tolerancing process in the design. Based on arithmetic
and statistical method, this paper presents a new approach of analysis and
verification of tolerances. The chosen approach is based on the Worst Case
Method as an arithmetic method and Monte Carlo method as a statistical method.
In this paper, we compare these methods and we present our main approach, which
is validated using an example of 1 D tolerancing.
