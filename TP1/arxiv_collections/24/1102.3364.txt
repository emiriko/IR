We study experimentally the interaction between two solitary waves that
approach one to another in a linear chain of spheres interacting via the Hertz
potential. When these counter propagating waves collide, they cross each other
and a phase shift respect to the noninteracting waves is introduced, as a
result of the nonlinear interaction potential. This observation is well
reproduced by our numerical simulations and it is shown to be independent of
viscoelastic dissipation at the beads contact. In addition, when the collision
of equal amplitude and synchronized counter propagating waves takes place, we
observe that two secondary solitary waves emerge from the interacting region.
The amplitude of secondary solitary waves is proportional to the amplitude of
incident waves. However, secondary solitary waves are stronger when the
collision occurs at the middle contact in chains with even number of beads.
Although numerical simulations correctly predict the existence of these waves,
experiments show that their respective amplitude are significantly larger than
predicted. We attribute this discrepancy to the rolling friction at the beads
contacts during solitary wave propagation.
