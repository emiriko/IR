The whole BeppoSAX archive was screened for observations of Neutron Star (NS)
Low-Mass X-ray Binaries, in order to characterise the X-ray properties of this
class of sources when observed in a Low Hard State (LHS). A total of 12 sources
in the sample exhibited LHS spectra; half of the objects showed a "canonical"
LHS spectrum, in which two separate populations of soft blackbody-distributed
photons emerge. One, or possibly both the populations, is Comptonized by a hot
(kT_e > 20 keV) electron plasma cloud. For the remaining 6 sources just a
single population is sufficient to account for both the directly observed
blackbody and the Comptonized radiation.
  The luminosities of the NS with canonical two-population spectra are found to
be systematically higher than the ones of the sources showing the atypical,
single photon population spectra. This suggests the possibility of two separate
subclasses of LHS spectra. The transition from a subclass to the other is
likely related to the accretion rate, which drives the presence of a hotter
X-ray photon population in the close vicinity of the NS, or possibly a stronger
thermal gradient in the inner, X-ray active, accretion disk.
