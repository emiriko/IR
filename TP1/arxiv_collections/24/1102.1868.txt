Annihilation process of proton and antiproton to guark antiquark pair
accompanied by emission of two additional gluon jets with intermediate state of
vector meson is considered.Strong azimuthal correlation is revealed of two
gluonic jets,effectively created in the same plane.Some applications to cosmic
ray events and to LHC experiments are discussed.
