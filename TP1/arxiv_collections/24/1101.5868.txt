The distributed system $\mathcal{S}_D$ described by the Dirac equation is
investigated simply as a dynamic system, i.e. without usage of quantum
principles. The Dirac equation is described in terms of hydrodynamic variables:
4-flux $j^{i}$, pseudo-vector of the spin $S^{i}$, an action $\hbar \phi $ and
a pseudo-scalar $\kappa $. In the quasi-uniform approximation, when all
transversal derivatives (orthogonal to the flux vector $j^i$) are small, the
system $\mathcal{S}_D$ turns to a statistical ensemble of classical
concentrated systems $\mathcal{S}_{dc}$. Under some conditions the classical
system $\mathcal{S}_{dc}$ describes a classical pointlike particle moving in a
given electromagnetic field. In general, the world line of the particle is a
helix, even if the electromagnetic field is absent. Both dynamic systems
$\mathcal{S}_D$ and $\mathcal{S}_{dc}$ appear to be non-relativistic in the
sense that the dynamic equations written in terms of hydrodynamic variables are
not relativistically covariant with respect to them, although all dynamic
variables are tensors or pseudo-tensors. They becomes relativistically
covariant only after addition of a constant unit timelike vector $f^{i}$ which
should be considered as a dynamic variable describing a space-time property.
This "constant" variable arises instead of $\gamma $-matrices which are removed
by means of zero divizors in the course of the transformation to hydrodynamic
variables. It is possible to separate out dynamic variables $\kappa $, $\kappa
^i$ responsible for quantum effects. It means that, setting $\kappa ,\kappa
^i\equiv 0$, the dynamic system $\mathcal{S}_D$ described by the Dirac equation
turns to a statistical ensemble $\mathcal{E}_{Dqu}$ of classical dynamic
systems $\mathcal{S}_{dc}$.
