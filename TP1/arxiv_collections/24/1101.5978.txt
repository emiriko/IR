The dynamics of the Buck and Sukumar model [B. Buck and C.V. Sukumar, Phys.
Lett. A 81 (1981) 132] are investigated using different semi-classical
information-theory tools. Interesting aspects of the periodicity inherent to
the model are revealed and somewhat unexpected features are revealed that seem
to be related to the classical-quantum transition.
