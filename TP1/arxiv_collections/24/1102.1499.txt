Earth is connected gravitationally, magnetically and electrically to its heat
source - a neutron star that is obscured from view by waste products in the
photosphere. Neutron repulsion is like the hot filament in an incandescent
light bulb. Excited neutrons are emitted from the solar core and decay into
hydrogen that glows in the photosphere like a frosted light bulb. Neutron
repulsion was recognized in nuclear rest mass data in 2000 as the overlooked
source of energy, the keystone of an arch that locked together these puzzling
space-age observations: 1.) Excess 136Xe accompanied primordial helium in the
stellar debris that formed the solar system (Fig. 1); 2.) The Sun formed on the
supernova core (Fig. 2); 3.) Waste products from the core pass through an
iron-rich mantle, selectively carrying lighter elements and lighter isotopes of
each element into the photosphere (Figs. 3-4); and 4.) Neutron repulsion powers
the Sun and sustains life (Figs. 5-7). Together these findings offer a
framework for understanding how: a.) The Sun generates and releases neutrinos,
energy and solar-wind hydrogen and helium; b.) An inhabitable planet formed and
life evolved around an ordinary-looking star; c.) Continuous climate change -
induced by cyclic changes in gravitational interactions of the Sun's energetic
core with planets - has favored survival by adaptation.
