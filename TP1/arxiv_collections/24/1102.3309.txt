We have investigated the formation and growth of nano sized ripple topography
on ZnO thin films by 10 keV O1+ bombardment at impact angles of 80{\degree} and
60{\degree}, varying the ion fluence from 5{times}10^16 to 1{\times}10^18
ions/cm2. At 800 the ripples are oriented along the ion beam direction whereas
at 600 it is perpendicular to the ion beam direction. The developed ion induced
structures are characterized by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and the
alignment, variation of rms roughness, wavelength and correlation length of the
structures are discussed with the existing model and basic concept of ion
surface interaction.
