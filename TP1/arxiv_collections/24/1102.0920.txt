We investigate in detail "instantaneous interquark potentials", interesting
gauge-dependent quantities defined from the spatial correlators of the temporal
link-variable $U_4$, in generalized Landau gauge using SU(3) quenched lattice
QCD. The instantaneous Q$\bar{\rm Q}$ potential has no linear part in the
Landau gauge, and it is expressed by the Coulomb plus linear potential in the
Coulomb gauge, where the slope is 2-3 times larger than the physical string
tension. Using the generalized Landau gauge, we find that the instantaneous
potential can be continuously described between the Landau and the Coulomb
gauges, and its linear part rapidly grows in the neighborhood of the Coulomb
gauge. We also investigate the instantaneous 3Q potential in the generalized
Landau gauge, and obtain similar results to the Q$\bar{\rm Q}$ case. $T$-length
terminated Polyakov-line correlators and their corresponding "finite-time
potentials" are also investigated in generalized Landau gauge.
