We report the first observation of two Cabibbo-suppressed decay modes of the
B0_s meson. Using a sample of p-pbar collisions at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV
corresponding to 5.9 fb-1 of integrated luminosity collected with the CDFII
detector at the Fermilab Tevatron, we search for new B0_s decay modes in a
sample of events containing J/psi to mu+ mu- decays. We reconstruct a B0_s to
J/psi K*(892)0 signal with K^*(892)0 to K+ pi-, observing a yield of 151 +/- 25
events with a statistical significance of 8.0 sigma. We also reconstruct a B0_s
to J/psi K0_S signal with K0_S to pi+ pi-, observing a yield of 64 +/- 14
events with a statistical significance of 7.2 sigma. From these yields, we
extract the branching ratios B(B0_s -> J/psi K*(892)0)= (8.3 +/- 3.8) x 10{-5}
and B(B0_s -> J/psi K0)= (3.5 +/- 0.8) x 10{-5}, where statistical, systematic
and fragmentation fraction uncertainties are included in the combined
uncertainty.
