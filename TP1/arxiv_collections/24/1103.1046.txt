Here we introduce a new design framework for synthetic biology that exploits
the advantages of Bayesian model selection. We will argue that the difference
between inference and design is that in the former we try to reconstruct the
system that has given rise to the data that we observe, while in the latter, we
seek to construct the system that produces the data that we would like to
observe, i.e. the desired behavior. Our approach allows us to exploit methods
from Bayesian statistics, including efficient exploration of models spaces and
high-dimensional parameter spaces, and the ability to rank models with respect
to their ability to generate certain types of data. Bayesian model selection
furthermore automatically strikes a balance between complexity and (predictive
or explanatory) performance of mathematical models. In order to deal with the
complexities of molecular systems we employ an approximate Bayesian computation
scheme which only requires us to simulate from different competing models in
order to arrive at rational criteria for choosing between them. We illustrate
the advantages resulting from combining the design and modeling (or in-silico
prototyping) stages currently seen as separate in synthetic biology by
reference to deterministic and stochastic model systems exhibiting adaptive and
switch-like behavior, as well as bacterial two-component signaling systems.
