Axisymmetric magnetic lines of nanometer sizes (chiral vortices or skyrmions)
have been predicted to exist in a large group of noncentrosymmetric crystals
more than two decades ago. Recently these magnetic textures have been directly
observed in nanolayers of cubic helimagnets and monolayers of magnetic metals.
We develop a micromagnetic theory of chiral skyrmions in thin magnetic layers
for magnetic materials with intrinsic and induced chirality. Such particle-like
and stable micromagnetic objects can exist in broad ranges of applied magnetic
fields including zero field. Chiral skyrmions can be used as a new type of
highly mobile nanoscale data carriers.
