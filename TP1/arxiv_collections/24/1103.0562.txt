Presented are selected results of semileptonic B decays at BaBar. Two
measurements of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $|V_{cb}|$ are
reported. One using moments of the hadronic-mass spectrum in inclusive $\bar{B}
\to X_{c} \ell^{-} \bar{\nu}$ decays, and the other, exclusive $\bar{B} \to D
\ell^- \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ decays. These results are based on data samples of 232
(inclusive $\bar{B} \to X_{c} \ell^{-} \bar{\nu}$) and 460 (exclusive $\var{B}
\to D \ell^- \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$) million $\Upsilon(4S) \to B\bar{B}$ decays,
recorded by the $BaBar$ detector at the PEP-II $e^+e^-$-storage rings.
Semileptonic B decays are identified by requiring a lepton ($e$ or $\mu$) in
events tagged with a full reconstruction of one of the B mesons in the
$B\bar{B}$ pair.
