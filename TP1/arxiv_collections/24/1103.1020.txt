We analyze theoretically a scheme that produces spin squeezing via the
continuous swapping of atom-photon entanglement into atom-atom entanglement,
and propose an explicit experimental system where the necessary atom-field
coupling can be realized. This scheme is found to be robust against
perturbations due to other atom-field coupling channels.
