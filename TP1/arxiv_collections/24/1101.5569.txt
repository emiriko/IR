Event-driven programming is used in many fields of modern Computer Science.
In event-driven programming languages user interacts with a program by
triggering the events. We propose a new approach that we denote command-event
driven programming in which the user interacts with a program by means of
events and commands. We describe a new programming language, T2Script, which is
based on command-event driven paradigm. T2Script has been already implemented
and used in one of industrial products. We describe the rationale, basic
concepts and advanced programming techniques of new T2Script language. We
evaluate the new language and show what advantages and limitations it has.
