We report fragmentation cross sections measured at 0 deg for beams of 14-N,
16-O, 20-Ne, and 24-Mg ions, at energies ranging from 290 MeV/nucleon to 1000
MeV/nucleon. Beams were incident on targets of C, CH2, Al, Cu, Sn, and Pb, with
the C and CH2 target data used to obtain hydrogen-target cross sections. Using
methods established in earlier work, cross sections obtained with both
large-acceptance and small-acceptance detectors are extracted from the data and
when necessary corrected for acceptance effects. The large-acceptance data
yield cross sections for fragments with charges approximately half of the beam
charge and above, with minimal corrections. Cross sections for lighter
fragments are obtained from small-acceptance spectra, with more significant,
model-dependent corrections that account for the fragment angular
distributions. Results for both charge-changing and fragment production cross
sections are compared to the predictions of the Los Alamos version of the Quark
Gluon String Model (LAQGSM) as well as the NUCFRG2 and PHITS models. For all
beams and targets, cross sections for fragments as light as He are compared to
the models. Estimates of multiplicity-weighted helium production cross sections
are obtained from the data and compared to PHITS and LAQGSM predictions.
Summary statistics show that the level of agreement between data and
predictions is slightly better for PHITS than for either NUCFRG2 or LAQGSM.
