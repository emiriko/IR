We examine ion acceleration by irradiating a hundred TW laser pulse on a
double-layer target. It is shown analytically and by three-dimensional
particle-in-cell simulations that higher energy protons are obtained by using
material with a high charge-to-mass ratio in the first layer of a double-layer
target, because a strong Coulomb explosion occurs in such a material. As a
result, the protons keep accelerating for a longer time. Using the optimal
conditions for the target, it is shown that high energy and high quality
protons can be generated.
