Dynamical gauge fields are essential to capture the short and large distance
behavior of gauge theories (confinement, mass gap, chiral symmetry breaking,
asymptotic freedom). I propose two possible strategies to use optical lattices
to mimic simulations performed in lattice gauge theory. I discuss how new
developments in optical lattices could be used to generate local invariance and
link composite operators with adjoint quantum numbers that could play a role
similar to the link variables used in lattice gauge theory. This is a slightly
expanded version of a poster presented at the KITP Conference: Frontiers of
Ultracold Atoms and Molecules (Oct 11-15, 2010) that I plan to turn into a more
comprehensive tutorial that could be used by members of the optical lattice and
lattice gauge theory communities. Suggestions are welcome.
