We address the issue whether quasifree single-nucleon knockout measurements
carry sufficient information about the nuclear interior. To this end, we
present comparisons of the reaction probability densities for $A(e,e'p)$ and
$A(p,2p)$ in quasifree kinematics for the target nuclei $^{4}$He, $^{12}$C,
$^{56}$Fe, and $^{208}$Pb. We adopt a comprehensive framework based on the
impulse approximation and on a relativized extension of Glauber
multiple-scattering reaction theory in which the medium effects related to
short-range correlations (SRC) are implemented. It is demonstrated that SRC
weaken the effect of attenuation. For light target nuclei, both the quasifree
$(p,2p)$ and $(e,e'p)$ can probe average densities of the same order as nuclear
saturation density $\rho_{0}$. For heavy nuclei like $^{208}$Pb, the probed
average densities are smaller than $0.1\rho_{0}$ and the $(e,e'p)$ reaction is
far more efficient in probing the bulk regions than $(p,2p)$.
