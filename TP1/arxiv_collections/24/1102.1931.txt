Single crystals of K0.80Fe1.76Se2.02 were suscessfully grown from a ternary
solution. We show that although crystals form when cooling a near
stoichiometric melt, crystals are actually growing out of a ternary solution
that remains liquid to at least 850 C. We investigated their chemical
composition, anisotropic magnetic susceptibility and resistivity, specific
heat, thermoelectric power, London penetration depth and flux penetration via
magneto-optical imaging. Whereas the samples appear to be homogeneously
superconducting at low temperatures, there appears to be a broadened transtion
range close to Tc ~ 30 K that may be associated with small variations in
stociometry.
