An emission line near 1319 A is one of the strongest unidentified lines in
the ultraviolet spectra of cool dwarf stars. In most line lists it is
identified as a transition in N I, although its intensity would then be
anomalous and the observed wavelength does not fit precisely that expected for
N I. The line is also observed in cool giant stars. The measured wavelength of
the line in stellar spectra is 1318.94 (+,- 0.01) A. Observations of giant
stars provide further evidence that this line is not due to N I. It is proposed
that this line is a decay from a previously unknown level in S I, which lies
above the first ionization limit. This is identified with the 3d singlet D (odd
parity) term. The previous tentative assignment of this term to the S I line at
1309.3 A then needs to be revised. The 1309.3 A line has been identified here
for the first time in an astrophysical source. The singlet D (odd parity) level
could, in principle, be populated by collisions from nearby autoionizing levels
that have large number-densities, through population by di-electronic capture.
Spin-orbit interaction with the autoionizing triplet D (odd parity) term might
also lead to di-electronic capture into the singlet D (odd parity) level. A
line at 1309.87 A observed in cool giant stars is identified as a transition in
P II, pumped by the O I resonance lines.
