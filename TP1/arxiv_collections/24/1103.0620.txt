By analyzing the real space nonequilibrium dynamics of polymers, we elucidate
the physics of driven translocation and propose its dynamical scaling scenario
analogous to that in the surface growth phenomena. We provide a detailed
account of the previously proposed tension-propagation formulation and extend
it to cover the broader parameter space relevant to real experiments; In
addition to a near-equilibrium regime, we identify three distinct
nonequilibrium regimes reflecting the steady-state property of a dragged
polymer with the finite extensibility. Finite size effects are also pointed
out. These elements are shown to be crucial for the appropriate comparison with
experiments and simulations.
