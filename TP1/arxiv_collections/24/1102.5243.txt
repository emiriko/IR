We study the Kondo lattice model using a class of canonical transformations
that allow us to faithfully represent the model entirely in terms of fermions
without constraints. The transformations generate interacting theories that we
study using mean field theory. Of particular interest is a new manifestly
O(3)-symmetric representation in terms of Majorana fermions at half-filling on
bipartite lattices. This representation suggests a natural O(3)-symmetric trial
state that is investigated and characterized as a gapped spin liquid.
