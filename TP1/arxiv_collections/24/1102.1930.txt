Recently reported quasiparticle interference imaging in underdoped
Ca(Fe{1-x}Co{x})_2As{2} shows pronounced C{2} asymmetry that is interpreted as
an indication of an electronic nematic phase with a unidirectional electron
band, dispersive predominantly along the $b$-axis of this orthorhombic
material. On the other hand, even more recent transport measurements on
untwinned samples show near isotropy of the resistivity in the $ab$ plane, with
slightly larger conductivity along a (and not b). We show that in fact both
sets of data are consistent with the calculated ab initio Fermi surfaces, which
has a decisively broken C_{4}, and yet similar Fermi velocity in both
directions. This reconciles completely the apparent contradiction between the
conclusions of the STM and the transport experiments.
