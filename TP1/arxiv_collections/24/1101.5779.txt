We design a cross-layer approach to optimize the joint use of multi-packet
reception and network coding, in order to relieve congestion. We construct a
model for the behavior of the 802.11 MAC and apply it to several key canonical
topology components and their extensions to any number of nodes. The results
obtained from this model match the available experimental results, which are
for routing and opportunistic network coding, with fidelity. Using this model,
we show that fairness allocation by the MAC can seriously impact performance;
hence, we devise a new MAC that not only substantially improves throughput
relative to the current 802.11 MAC, but also provides fairness to flows of
information rather than to nodes. We show that the proper combination of
network coding, multi-packet reception, and our new MAC protocol achieves
super-additive throughput gains of up to 6.3 times that of routing alone with
the use of the standard 802.11 MAC. Finally, we extend the model to analyze the
asymptotic behavior of our new MAC as the number of nodes increases.
