We present the phase diagram and the fluctuations of different conserved
charges like quark number, charge and strangeness at vanishing chemical
potential for the 2+1 flavor Polyakov Loop extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model
with eight-quark interaction terms using three-momentum cutoff regularisation.
The main effect of the higher order interaction term is to shift the critical
end point to the lower value of the chemical potential and higher value of the
temperature. The fluctuations show good qualitative agreement with the lattice
data.
