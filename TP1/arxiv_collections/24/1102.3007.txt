Recently, we predicted the existence of fundamental particles in Nature,
neutral Light Particles with spin 1 and rest mass $m=1.8\times 10^{-4} m_e$, in
addition to electrons, neutrons and protons. We call these particles Light
Bosons because they create electromagnetic field which represents Planck's gas
of massless photons together with a gas of Light Particles in the condensate.
Such reasoning leads to a breakdown of Stefan--Boltzmann's law at low
temperature. On the other hand, the existence of new fundamental neutral Light
Particles leads to correction of such physical concepts as Bose-Einstein
condensation of photons, polaritons and exciton polaritons.
