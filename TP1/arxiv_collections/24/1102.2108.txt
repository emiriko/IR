Diffraction of coherent x-ray beams is treated through the Fractionnal
Fourier transform. The transformation allow us to deal with coherent
diffraction experiments from the Fresnel to the Fraunhofer regime. The analogy
with the Huygens-Fresnel theory is first discussed and a generalized
uncertainty principle is introduced.
