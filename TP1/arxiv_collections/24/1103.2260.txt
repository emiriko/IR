A new type of electron sources has emerged which permits to inject particles
in a controllable manner, one at a time, into an electronic circuit. Such
single electron sources make it possible to fully exploit the particles'
quantum nature. We determine the single-particle coherence length from the
decay of the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations as a function of the imbalance of a
Mach-Zehnder interferometer connected to a single electron source. The
single-particle coherence length is of particular importance as it is an
intrinsic property of the source in contrast to the dephasing length.
