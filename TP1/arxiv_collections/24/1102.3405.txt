We report on the existence of a novel kind of squeezing in photonic crystal
fibers which is conceptually intermediate between the four-wave mixing induced
squeezing, in which all the participant waves are monochromatic waves, and the
self-phase modulation induced squeezing for a single pulse in a coherent state.
This hybrid squeezing occurs when an arbitrary short soliton emits
quasi-monochromatic resonant radiation near a zero group velocity dispersion
point of the fiber. Photons around the resonant frequency become strongly
correlated due to the presence of the classical soliton, and a reduction of the
quantum noise below the shot noise level is predicted.
