QED-model for multichain coupled qubit system, proposed in \cite{Part1}, was
confirmed by Raman scattering studies of carbon zigzag-shaped nanotubes,
produced by high energy ion beam modification of natural diamond single
crystals. New quantum optics phenomenon - Rabi waves - has been experimentally
identified for the first time. Raman spectra in perfect quasi-1D carbon
nanotubes are quite different in comparison with well known Raman spectra in 2D
carbon nanotubes of larger diameter. They characterized by vibronic mode of
Su-Schriffer-Heeger $\sigma$-polaron lattice and its revival part in frequency
representation, which is the consequence of Rabi wave packet formation.
