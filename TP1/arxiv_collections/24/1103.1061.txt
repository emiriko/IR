There are numerous applications where we have to deal with temporal
uncertainty associated with events. The Temporal Probabilistic (TP) Logic
Programs should provide support for valid-time indeterminacy of events, by
proposing the concept of an indeterminate instant, that is, an interval of
time-points (event's time-window) with an associated, lower and upper,
probability distribution. In particular, we propose the new semantics, for the
TP Logic Programs of Dekhtyar and Subrahmanian. Our semantics, based on the
possible world semantics is a generalization of the possible world semantics
for (non temporal) Probabilistic Logic Programming, and we define the new
syntax for PT-programs, with time variable explicitly represented in all atoms,
and show how the standard role of Herbrand interpretations used as possible
worlds for probability distributions is coherently extended to Temporal
Probabilistic Logic Programming.
