We show in this paper that it is possible to induce superconducting vortices
in a gold nanowire connected to superconducting electrodes. The gold nanowire
acquires superconductivity by the proximity effect. The differential
magnetoresistance of the nanowire beyond a critical magnetic field shows
uniform oscillations with increasing field with a period of \phi0/(2\pir^2)
(\phi0 = h/2e is the superconducting flux quantum, r = 35 nm is the radius of
the nanowire). We demonstrate that these periodic oscillations are the
signatures of the sequential generation and moving of vortices across the gold
nanowire.
