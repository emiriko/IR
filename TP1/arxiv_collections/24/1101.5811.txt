Exact solutions are given for the Maxwell equations driven by a gyrating
ultrarelativistic electron inside a reflecting cylindrical boundary. The axis
of the electrons's trajectory and the axis of the surrounding cylinder are
supposed to coincide. It is found that, at certain values of the ratio of the
cylinder's and of the trajectory's radii, the field amplitudes diverge as
functions of time. The physical reason for this resonance is the constructive
interference between the radiation emitted earlier and fed back by reflection
to the actual position of the radiating electron.
