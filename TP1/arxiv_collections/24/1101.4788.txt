A general diffeomorphism invariant SU(2) gauge theory is a gravity theory
with two propagating polarizations of the graviton. We develop this description
of gravity, in particular for future applications to the perturbative
quantization. Thus, the linearized theory, gauge symmetries, gauge fixing are
discussed in detail, and the propagator is obtained. The propagator takes a
simple form of that of Yang-Mills theory with an additional projector on
diffeomorphism equivalence classes of connections inserted. In our approach the
gravitational perturbation theory takes a rather unusual form in that the
Planck length is no longer fundamental.
