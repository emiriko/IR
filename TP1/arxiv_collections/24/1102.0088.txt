We study the applicability of the time optimal bang-bang control designed for
spin-1/2 [U. Boscain and P. Mason, J. Math. Phys. {\bf 47}, 062101 (2006)] to
the rotation of the electron spin of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond.
The spin of the NV center is a three-level system, with two levels forming a
relevant qubit subspace where the time-varying magnetic control field performs
rotation, and the third level being idle. We find that the bang-bang control
protocol decreases the rotation time by 20--25% in comparison with the
traditional oscillating sinusoidal driving. We also find that for most values
of the bias field the leakage to the idle level is very small, so that the NV
center is a suitable testbed for experimental study of the time-optimal
protocols. For some special values of the bias field, however, the unwanted
leakage is greatly increased. We demonstrate that this is caused by the
resonance with higher-order Fourier harmonics of the bang-bang driving field.
