We present accurate absolute astrometry of 6.7 GHz methanol masers detected
in the Arecibo Methanol Maser Galactic Plane Survey using MERLIN and the
Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA). We estimate the absolute astrometry to be
accurate to better than 15 and 80 milliarcseconds for the MERLIN and EVLA
observations respectively. We also derive the morphologies of the maser
emission distributions for sources stronger than ~ 1 Jy. The median spatial
extent along the major axis of the regions showing maser emission is ~ 775 AU.
We find a majority of methanol maser morphologies to be complex with some
sources previously determined to have regular morphologies in fact being
embedded within larger structures. This suggests that some maser spots do not
have a compact core, which leads them being resolved in high angular resolution
observations. This also casts doubt on interpretations of the origin of
methanol maser emission solely based on source morphologies. We also
investigate the association of methanol masers with mid-infrared emission and
find very close correspondence between methanol masers and 24 micron point
sources. This adds further credence to theoretical models that predict methanol
masers to be pumped by warm dust emission and firmly reinforces the finding
that Class II methanol masers are unambiguous tracers of embedded high-mass
protostars.
