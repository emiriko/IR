We recently proposed a spontaneous A4 flavor symmetry breaking scheme
implemented in a warped extra dimensional setup to explain the observed pattern
of quark and lepton masses and mixings. The quark mixing is induced by bulk A4
flavons mediating "cross-brane" interactions and a "cross-talk" between the
quark and neutrino sectors. In this work we explore the phenomenology of RS-A4
and systematically obtain bounds on the Kaluza-Klein (KK) mass scale implied by
flavor changing neutral current (FCNC) processes. In particular, we study the
constraints arising from Re(\epsilon'/\epsilon_K), b->s\gamma, the neutron EDM
and Higgs mediated FCNCs, while the tree level contribution to \epsilon_K
through a KK gluon exchange vanishes. We find an overall lower bound on the
Kaluza-Klein mass scale M_{KK} > 1.3 TeV from FCNCs, induced by b->s\gamma,
differently from flavor anarchic models. This bound is still weaker than the
bound M_{KK} > 4.6 TeV induced by Zb_L\bar{b}_L in RS-A4. The little CP
problem, related to the largely enhanced new physics contributions to the
neutron EDM in flavor anarchic models, is absent. The subtleties of having the
Higgs and flavons in the bulk are taken into account and final predictions are
derived in the complete three-generation case.
