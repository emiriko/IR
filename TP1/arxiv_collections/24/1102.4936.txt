In Israel-Stewart's theory of dissipative hydrodynamics, we have analyzed the
recent ALICE data for the centrality dependence of charged particle
multiplicity, centrality dependence of integrated elliptic flow and 0-5%
charged particles $p_T$ spectra in $\sqrt{s}_{NN}$=2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions
and determined the initial or the thermalisation time. Analysis indicate that
the ALICE data disfavor very early thermalsiation $\tau_i$=0.2 fm, or very late
thermalsation $\tau_i$= 4fm. Data are best explained for thermalisation time
$\tau_i=0.88^{-0.14}_{+0.68}$ fm.
