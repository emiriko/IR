A variational ansatz for momentum eigenstates of translation invariant
quantum spin chains is formulated. The matrix product state ansatz works
directly in the thermodynamic limit and allows for an efficient implementation
(cubic scaling in the bond dimension) of the variational principle. Unlike
previous approaches, the ansatz includes topologically non-trivial states
(kinks, domain walls) for systems with symmetry breaking. The method is
benchmarked using the spin-1/2 XXZ antiferromagnet and the spin-1 Heisenberg
antiferromagnet and we obtain surprisingly accurate results.
