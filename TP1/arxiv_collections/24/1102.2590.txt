We study the long-time behavior of the probability density associated with
the decoupled continuous-time random walk which is characterized by a
superheavy-tailed distribution of waiting times. It is shown that if the random
walk is unbiased (biased) and the jump distribution has a finite second moment
then the properly scaled probability density converges in the long-time limit
to a symmetric two-sided (an asymmetric one-sided) exponential density. The
convergence occurs in such a way that all the moments of the probability
density grow slower than any power of time. As a consequence, the reference
random walk can be viewed as a generic model of superslow diffusion. A few
examples of superheavy-tailed distributions of waiting times that give rise to
qualitatively different laws of superslow diffusion are considered.
