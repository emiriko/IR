We investigate spectral stability of vortex solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation, a mean-field approximation for Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in an
effectively two-dimensional axisymmetric harmonic trap. We study eigenvalues of
the linearization both rigorously and through computation of the Evans
function, a sensitive and robust technique whose use we justify mathematically.
The absence of unstable eigenvalues is justified a posteriori through use of
the Krein signature of purely imaginary eigenvalues, which also can be used to
significantly reduce computational effort. In particular, we prove general
basic continuation results on Krein signature for finite systems of eigenvalues
in infinite-dimensional problems.
