The feasibility of using data from the NASA STEREO mission for variable star
and asteroseismology studies has been examined. A data analysis pipeline has
been developed that is able to apply selected algorithms to the entire database
of nearly a million stars to search for signs of variability. An analysis
limited to stars of magnitude 10.5 has been carried out, which has resulted in
the extraction of 263 eclipsing binaries (EBs), of which 122 are not recorded
as such in the SIMBAD online database. The characteristics of the STEREO
observations are shown to be extremely well-suited to variable star studies
with the ability to provide continuous phase coverage for extended periods as
well as repeated visits that allow both short and long term variability to be
observed. This will greatly inform studies of particular stars, such as the
pre-cataclysmic variable V471 Tau, as well as entire classes of stars,
including many forms of rotational variability. The high-precision photometry
has also revealed a potentially substellar companion to a bright (R = 7.5 mag)
nearby star (HD 213597), detected with 5-sigma significance. This would provide
a significant contribution to exoplanet research if follow-up observations
ascertain the mass to be within the planetary domain. Some particularly unusual
EBs from the recovered sample are discussed, including a possible
reclassification of a well-known star as an EB rather than a rotational
variable (HR 7355) and several particularly eccentric systems, including very
long-period EBs.
