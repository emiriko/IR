This note demonstrates that it is possible to bound the expectation of an
arbitrary norm of a random matrix drawn from the Stiefel manifold in terms of
the expected norm of a standard Gaussian matrix with the same dimensions. A
related comparison holds for any convex function of a random matrix drawn from
the Stiefel manifold. For certain norms, a reversed inequality is also valid.
