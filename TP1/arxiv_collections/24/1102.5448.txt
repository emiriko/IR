We study convex relaxations of the image labeling problem on a continuous
domain with regularizers based on metric interaction potentials. The generic
framework ensures existence of minimizers and covers a wide range of
relaxations of the originally combinatorial problem. We focus on two specific
relaxations that differ in flexibility and simplicity -- one can be used to
tightly relax any metric interaction potential, while the other one only covers
Euclidean metrics but requires less computational effort. For solving the
nonsmooth discretized problem, we propose a globally convergent
Douglas-Rachford scheme, and show that a sequence of dual iterates can be
recovered in order to provide a posteriori optimality bounds. In a quantitative
comparison to two other first-order methods, the approach shows competitive
performance on synthetical and real-world images. By combining the method with
an improved binarization technique for nonstandard potentials, we were able to
routinely recover discrete solutions within 1%--5% of the global optimum for
the combinatorial image labeling problem.
