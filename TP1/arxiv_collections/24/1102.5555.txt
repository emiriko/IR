Operations of arbitrary arity expressible via addition modulo 2^n and bitwise
addition modulo 2 admit a simple description. The identities connecting these
two additions have finite basis. Moreover, the universal algebra with these two
operations is rationally equivalent to a nilpotent ring and, therefore,
generates a Specht variety.
