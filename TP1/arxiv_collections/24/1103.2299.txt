High-quality Pr0.7Ca0.3MnO3/SrRuO3 superlattices were fabricated by pulsed
laser deposition and were investigated by high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy and SQUID magnetometry. Superlattices with orthorhombic and
tetragonal SrRuO3 layers were investigated. The superlattices grew coherently;
in the growth direction Pr0.7Ca0.3MnO3 layers were terminated by MnO2- and
SrRuO3 layers by RuO2-planes. All superlattices showed antiferromagnetic
interlayer coupling in low magnetic fields. The coupling strength was
significantly higher for orthorhombic than for tetragonal symmetry of the
SrRuO3 layers. The strong interlayer exchange coupling in the superlattice with
orthorhombic SrRuO3 layers led to a magnetization reversal mechanism with a
partially inverted hysteresis loop.
