It is investigated how biofriendly is the Milky Way for photosynthetic life.
Special attention is dedicated to the role of the photobiological regime in the
emergence and evolution of this kind of life in terrestrial planets. Following
this line, it is investigated the potential role of stellar explosions as a
potential environmental perturbation in planets, emphasizing on Earth. The
difficulties in modelling the behaviour of stressed biological systems and the
robustness of life leads us to conclude the relative arbitrariness of defining
a galactic habitable zone with today's limited knowledge on the very possible
diverse sets of living creatures.
