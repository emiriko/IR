Food-web perturbations stemming from climate change, overexploitation,
invasive species, and habitat degradation often cause an initial loss of
species that results in a cascade of secondary extinctions, posing considerable
challenges to ecosystem conservation efforts. Here we devise a systematic
network-based approach to reduce the number of secondary extinctions using a
predictive modeling framework. We show that the extinction of one species can
often be compensated by the concurrent removal or population suppression of
other specific species, which is a counterintuitive effect not previously
tested in complex food webs. These compensatory perturbations frequently
involve long-range interactions that are not evident from local predator-prey
relationships. In numerous cases, even the early removal of a species that
would eventually be extinct by the cascade is found to significantly reduce the
number of cascading extinctions. These compensatory perturbations only exploit
resources available in the system, and illustrate the potential of human
intervention combined with predictive modeling for ecosystem management.
