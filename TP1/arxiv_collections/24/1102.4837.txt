In this contribution the question of the isotropy of the one-way speed of
light from an experimental perspective is addressed. In particular, we analyze
two experimental methods commonly used in its determination. The analysis is
aimed at clarifying the view that the one-way speed of light cannot be
determined by techniques in which physical entities close paths. The procedure
employed here will provide epistemological tools such that physicists
understand that a direct measurement of the speed not only of light but of any
physical entity is by no means trivial. Our results shed light on the physics
behind the experiments which may be of interest for both physicists with an
elemental knowledge in special relativity and philosophers of science.
