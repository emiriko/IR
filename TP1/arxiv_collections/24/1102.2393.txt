The equation of state inside very compact objects like neutron stars is still
largely unkown. Even though a lot progress has been made in recent years to
develop the so-called realistic equations of state, a lot of insight can be
gained by using polytropic equations of state to integrate the stellar
equations of structure. In this work we provide a brief review of the Newtonian
and relativistic equations of structure and present some numerical results,
which we believe that can be useful for students starting to work on this
field. The internal structure of the Newtonian polytropes is obtained by the
numerical integration of the Lane-Emden equation, and we used our results which
can also be used to study the Chandrasekhar limit for white dwarfs. However,
Newtonian physics cannot correctly describe very compact and massive objects.
There is an upper mass limit for neutron stars, supported by observations,
which is not predicted by the Newtonian equations. Neutron stars are best
described under the framework of General Relativity. The introduction of the
TOV equations (as well as the relativistic Lane-Emden equations) is, therefore,
necessary to correctly identify stable and non-stable models via the
mass-radius relation. The analysis of the EoS also becomes relevant to discard
models that allow a possible violation of causality (sound speed larger than
c).
