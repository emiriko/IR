In Ref. [1], we proved a duality between two optimizations problems. The
primary one is, given two quantum channels M and N, to find a quantum channel R
such that RN is optimally close to M as measured by the worst-case entanglement
fidelity. The dual problem involves the information obtained by the environment
through the so-called complementary channels M* and N*, and consists in finding
a quantum channel R' such that R'M* is optimally close to N*. It turns out to
be easier to find an approximate solution to the dual problem in certain
important situations, notably when M is the identity channel---the problem of
quantum error correction---yielding a good near-optimal worst-case entanglement
fidelity as well as the corresponding near-optimal correcting channel. Here we
provide more detailed proofs of these results. In addition, we generalize the
main theorem to the case where there are certain constraints on the
implementation of R, namely on the number of Kraus operators. We also offer a
simple algebraic form for the near-optimal correction channel in the case M=id.
For approximate error correction, we show that any epsilon-correctable channel
is, up to appending an ancilla, epsilon-close to an exactly correctable one. We
also demonstrate an application of our theorem to the problem of minimax state
discrimination.
