The low-temperature antiferromagnetic state of the Sm-ions in both
nonsuperconducting SmFeAsO and superconducting SmFeAsO$_{0.9}$F$_{0.1}$ single
crystals was studied by magnetic torque, magnetization, and magnetoresistance
measurements in magnetic fields up to 60~T and temperatures down to 0.6~K. We
uncover in both compounds a distinct rearrangement of the antiferromagnetically
ordered Sm-moments near $35-40$~T. This is seen in both, static and pulsed
magnetic fields, as a sharp change in the sign of the magnetic torque, which is
sensitive to the magnetic anisotropy and hence to the magnetic moment in the
$ab$-plane, ({\it i.e.} the FeAs-layers), and as a jump in the magnetization
for magnetic fields perpendicular to the conducting planes. This rearrangement
of magnetic ordering in $35-40$~T is essentially temperature independent and
points towards a canted or a partially polarized magnetic state in high
magnetic fields. However, the observed value for the saturation moment above
this rearrangement, suggests that the complete suppression of the
antiferromagnetism related to the Sm-moments would require fields in excess of
60~T. Such a large field value is particularly remarkable when compared to the
relatively small N\'{e}el temperature $T_{\rm N}\simeq5$~K, suggesting very
anisotropic magnetic exchange couplings. At the transition, magnetoresistivity
measurements show a crossover from positive to negative field-dependence,
indicating that the charge carriers in the FeAs planes are sensitive to the
magnetic configuration of the rare-earth elements. This is indicates a finite
magnetic/electronic coupling between the SmO and the FeAs layers which are
likely to mediate the exchange interactions leading to the long range
antiferromagnetic order of the Sm ions.
