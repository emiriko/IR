A method for determining the type of charge carrier, electron or hole, which
is transferred from metal contacts to graphene, is described. The Dirac point
is found to shift toward more negative (positive) gate voltages for electron
(hole) doping by shortening of the interelectrode spacing. The shift of the
Dirac point is accompanied by an enhancement of the electron-hole conductivity
asymmetry. Experimentally determined carrier types may be explained in terms of
the metal work functions modified by interactions with graphene.
