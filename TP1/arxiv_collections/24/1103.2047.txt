If G is a non-cyclic finite group, non-isomorphic G-sets X, Y may give rise
to isomorphic permutation representations C[X] and C[Y]. Equivalently, the map
from the Burnside ring to the representation ring of G has a kernel. Its
elements are called Brauer relations, and the purpose of this paper is to
classify them in all finite groups, extending the Tornehave-Bouc classification
in the case of p-groups.
