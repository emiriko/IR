We survey recent results on quantum corrections to the hypermultiplet moduli
space M in type IIA/B string theory on a compact Calabi-Yau threefold X, or,
equivalently, the vector multiplet moduli space in type IIB/A on X x S^1. Our
main focus lies on the problem of resumming the infinite series of D-brane and
NS5-brane instantons, using the mathematical machinery of automorphic forms. We
review the proposal that whenever the low-energy theory in D=3 exhibits an
arithmetic "U-duality" symmetry G(Z) the total instanton partition function
arises from a certain unitary automorphic representation of G, whose Fourier
coefficients reproduce the BPS-degeneracies. For D=4, N=2 theories on R^3 x S^1
we argue that the relevant automorphic representation falls in the quaternionic
discrete series of G, and that the partition function can be realized as a
holomorphic section on the twistor space Z over M. We also offer some comments
on the close relation with N=2 wall crossing formulae.
