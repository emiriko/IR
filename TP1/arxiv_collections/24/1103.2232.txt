Spin-1/2 electrons are scattered through one or two diamond-like loops, made
of quantum dots connected by one-dimensional wires, and subject to both an
Aharonov-Bohm flux and (Rashba and Dresselhaus) spin-orbit interactions. With
some symmetry between the two branches of each diamond, and with appropriate
tuning of the electric and magnetic fields (or of the diamond shapes) this
device completely blocks electrons with one polarization, and allows only
electrons with the opposite polarization to be transmitted. The directions of
these polarizations are tunable by these fields, and do not depend on the
energy of the scattered electrons. For each range of fields one can tune the
site and bond energies of the device so that the transmission of the fully
polarized electrons is close to unity. Thus, these devices perform as ideal
spin filters, and these electrons can be viewed as mobile qubits; the device
writes definite quantum information on the spinors of the outgoing electrons.
The device can also read the information written on incoming polarized
electrons: the charge transmission through the device contains full information
on this polarization. The double-diamond device can also act as a realization
of the Datta-Das spin field-effect transistor.
