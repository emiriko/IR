The scale length over which convection mixes mass in a star can be calculated
as the inverse of the vertical derivative of the unidirectional (up or down)
mass flux. This is related to the mixing length in the mixing length theory of
stellar convection. We give the ratio of mass mixing length to pressure scale
height for a grid of 3D surface convection simulations, covering from 4300\,K
to 6900\,K on the main-sequence, and up to giants at $\log g = 2.2$, all for
solar composition. These simulations also confirm what is already known from
solar simulations, that convection doesn't proceed by discrete convective
elements, but rather as a continuous, slow, smooth, warm upflow and turbulent,
entropy deficient, fast down drafts. This convective topology also results in
mixing on a scale as that of the classic mixing length formulation, and is
simply a consequence of mass conservation on flows in a stratified atmosphere.
