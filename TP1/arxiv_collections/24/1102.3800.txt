This article presents a direct measurement of the growth angle during the
growth of a cylindrical 2" silicon crystal using a radio-frequency heated
floating zone process. From the high-resolution pictures taken during the
process, this growth angle was evaluated to be 11{\deg}{\pm}2{\deg}.
Furthermore, the free surface of the melt was modeled using the Laplace-Young
equation. This model has to include the electromagnetic pressure calculated by
the surface ring currents approximation. The results were compared to the
experimental free surface derived from video frames. It could be shown that the
calculated free surface will only fit the experimentally determined one if the
right growth angle is considered.
