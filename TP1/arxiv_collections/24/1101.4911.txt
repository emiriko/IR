We demonstrate electrical control of the single photon emission spectrum from
chromium-based colour centres implanted in monolithic diamond. Under an
external electric field the tunability range is typically three orders of
magnitude larger than the radiative linewidth and at least one order of
magnitude larger than the observed linewidth. The electric and magnetic field
dependence of luminescence gives indications on the inherent symmetry and we
propose Cr-X or X-Cr-Y type noncentrosymmetric atomic configurations as most
probable candidates for these centres.
