We study the flow of energy between a harmonic oscillator (HO) and an
external environment consisting of N two-degrees of freedom non-linear
oscillators, ranging from integrable to chaotic according to a control
parameter. The coupling between the HO and the environment is bilinear in the
coordinates and scales with system size with the inverse square root of N. We
study the conditions for energy dissipation and thermalization as a function of
N and of the dynamical regime of the non-linear oscillators. The study is
classical and based on single realization of the dynamics, as opposed to
ensemble averages over many realizations. We find that dissipation occurs in
the chaotic regime for a fairly small N, leading to the thermalization of the
HO and environment a Boltzmann distribution of energies for a well defined
temperature. We develop a simple analytical treatment, based on the linear
response theory, that justifies the coupling scaling and reproduces the
numerical simulations when the environment is in the chaotic regime.
