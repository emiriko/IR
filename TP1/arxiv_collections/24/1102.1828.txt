We study the properties of a nano-electromechanical system in the coherent
regime, where the electronic and vibrational time scales are of the same order.
Employing a master equation approach, we obtain the stationary reduced density
matrix retaining the coherences between vibrational states. Depending on the
system parameters, two regimes are identified, characterized by either ($i$) an
{\em effective} thermal state with a temperature {\em lower} than that of the
environment or ($ii$) strong coherent effects. A marked cooling of the
vibrational degree of freedom is observed with a suppression of the vibron Fano
factor down to sub-Poissonian values and a reduction of the position and
momentum quadratures.
