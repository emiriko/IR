This article presents unified bijective constructions for planar maps, with
control on the face degrees and on the girth. Recall that the girth is the
length of the smallest cycle, so that maps of girth at least $d=1,2,3$ are
respectively the general, loopless, and simple maps. For each positive integer
$d$, we obtain a bijection for the class of plane maps (maps with one
distinguished root-face) of girth $d$ having a root-face of degree $d$. We then
obtain more general bijective constructions for annular maps (maps with two
distinguished root-faces) of girth at least $d$. Our bijections associate to
each map a decorated plane tree, and non-root faces of degree $k$ of the map
correspond to vertices of degree $k$ of the tree. As special cases we recover
several known bijections for bipartite maps, loopless triangulations, simple
triangulations, simple quadrangulations, etc. Our work unifies and greatly
extends these bijective constructions. In terms of counting, we obtain for each
integer $d$ an expression for the generating function
$F_d(x_d,x_{d+1},x_{d+2},...)$ of plane maps of girth $d$ with root-face of
degree $d$, where the variable $x_k$ counts the non-root faces of degree $k$.
The expression for $F_1$ was already obtained bijectively by Bouttier, Di
Francesco and Guitter, but for $d\geq 2$ the expression of $F_d$ is new. We
also obtain an expression for the generating function
$\G_{p,q}^{(d,e)}(x_d,x_{d+1},...)$ of annular maps with root-faces of degrees
$p$ and $q$, such that cycles separating the two root-faces have length at
least $e$ while other cycles have length at least $d$. Our strategy is to
obtain all the bijections as specializations of a single "master bijection"
introduced by the authors in a previous article. In order to use this approach,
we exhibit certain "canonical orientations" characterizing maps with prescribed
girth constraints.
