Inhomogeneous dynamical mean-field theory has been employed to solve many
interesting strongly interacting problems from transport in multilayered
devices to the properties of ultracold atoms in a trap. The main computational
step, especially for large systems, is the problem of calculating the inverse
of a large sparse matrix to solve Dyson's equation and determine the local
Green's function at each lattice site from the corresponding local self-energy.
We present a new efficient algorithm, the Lanczos-based low-rank algorithm, for
the calculation of the inverse of a large sparse matrix which yields this local
(imaginary time) Green's function. The Lanczos-based low-rank algorithm is
based on a domain decomposition viewpoint, but avoids explicit calculation of
Schur complements and relies instead on low-rank matrix approximations derived
from the Lanczos algorithm, for solving the Dyson equation. We report at least
a 25-fold improvement of performance compared to explicit decomposition (such
as sparse LU) of the matrix inverse. We also report that scaling relative to
matrix sizes, of the low-rank correction method on the one hand and domain
decomposition methods on the other, are comparable.
