The time structure of more than 10 years of hourly wind data measured in one
site in northern Italy from April 1996 to December 2007 is analysed. The data
are recorded by the Sodar Rass system, which measures the speed and the
direction of the wind at several heights above the ground level. To investigate
the wind speed time series at seven heights above the ground level we used two
different approaches: i) the Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis
(MF-DFA), which permits the detection of multifractality in nonstationary
series, and ii) the Fisher-Shannon (FS) information plane, which allows to
discriminate dynamical features in complex time series. Our results point out
to the existence of multifractal time fluctuations in wind speed and to a
dependence of the results on the height of the wind sensor. Even in the FS
information plane a height-dependent pattern is revealed, indicating a good
agreement with the multifractality. The obtained results could contribute to a
better understanding of the complex dynamics of wind phenomenon.
