We study linear electron transport through a single-molecule magnet (SMM) and
the interplay of its anisotropic spin with quantized vibrational distortions of
the molecule. We show that, despite the longitudinal anisotropy barrier and
small transverse anisotropy, vibrational fluctuations can induce quantum
spin-tunneling (QST) and a QST-Kondo effect. The interplay of spin scattering,
QST and molecular vibrations can strongly enhance the Kondo effect and induce
an anomalous magnetic field dependence of vibrational Kondo side-bands.
