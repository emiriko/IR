Two-dimensional dielectric microcavities are of widespread use in microoptics
applications. Recently, a trace formula has been established for dielectric
cavities which relates their resonance spectrum to the periodic rays inside the
cavity. In the present paper we extend this trace formula to a dielectric disk
with a small scatterer. This system has been introduced for microlaser
applications, because it has long-lived resonances with strongly directional
far field. We show that its resonance spectrum contains signatures not only of
periodic rays, but also of diffractive rays that occur in Keller's geometrical
theory of diffraction. We compare our results with those for a closed cavity
with Dirichlet boundary conditions.
