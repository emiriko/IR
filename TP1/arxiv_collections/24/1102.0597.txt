We discuss the results on the fundamental degrees of freedom underlying the
nucleon excitation spectrum and how they evolve as the resonance transitions
are investigated with increasingly better space-time resolution of the
electromagnetic probe. The search for undiscovered but predicted states
continues to be pursued with a vigorous experimental program. While recent data
from JLab and elsewhere provide intriguing hints of new states, final
conclusions will have to wait for the results of the broad experimental effort
currently underway with CLAS, and subsequent analyses involving the EBAC at
JLab.
