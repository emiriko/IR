The polymerization of actin filaments is coupled to the hydrolysis of
adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which involves both the cleavage of ATP and the
release of inorganic phosphate. We describe hydrolysis by a reduced two-state
model with a cooperative cleavage mechanism, where the cleavage rate depends on
the state of the neighboring actin protomer in a filament. We obtain
theoretical predictions of experimentally accessible steady state quantities
such as the size of the ATP-actin cap, the size distribution of ATP-actin
islands, and the cleavage flux for cooperative cleavage mechanisms.
