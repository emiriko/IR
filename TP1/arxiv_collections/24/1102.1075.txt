We consider a one-dimensional simple symmetric exclusion process in
equilibrium, constituting a dynamic random environment for a nearest-neighbor
random walk that on occupied/vacant sites has two different local drifts to the
right. We construct a renewal structure from which a LLN, a functional CLT and
large deviation bounds for the random walk under the annealed measure follow.
We further prove an Einstein relation under a suitable perturbation. A brief
discussion on the topic of random walks in slowly mixing dynamic random
environments is presented.
