This paper is an introduction to the modelling of viscoelastic fluids, with
an emphasis on micro-macro (or multiscale) models. Some elements of
mathematical and numerical analysis are provided. These notes closely follow
the lectures delivered by the second author at the Chinese Academy of Science
during the Workshop "Stress Tensor Effects on Fluid Mechanics", in January
2010.
