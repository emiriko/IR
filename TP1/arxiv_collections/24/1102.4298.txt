We have discovered a new rapidly oscillating Ap star among the Kepler Mission
target stars, KIC 10195926. This star shows two pulsation modes with periods
that are amongst the longest known for roAp stars at 17.1 min and 18.1 min,
indicating that the star is near the terminal age main sequence. The principal
pulsation mode is an oblique dipole mode that shows a rotationally split
frequency septuplet that provides information on the geometry of the mode. The
secondary mode also appears to be a dipole mode with a rotationally split
triplet, but we are able to show within the improved oblique pulsator model
that these two modes cannot have the same axis of pulsation. This is the first
time for any pulsating star that evidence has been found for separate pulsation
axes for different modes. The two modes are separated in frequency by 55
microHz, which we model as the large separation. The star is an alpha^2 CVn
spotted magnetic variable that shows a complex rotational light variation with
a period of Prot = 5.68459 d. For the first time for any spotted magnetic star
of the upper main sequence, we find clear evidence of light variation with a
period of twice the rotation period; i.e. a subharmonic frequency of $\nu_{\rm
rot}/2$. We propose that this and other subharmonics are the first observed
manifestation of torsional modes in an roAp star. From high resolution spectra
we determine Teff = 7400 K, log g = 3.6 and v sin i = 21 km/s. We have found a
magnetic pulsation model with fundamental parameters close to these values that
reproduces the rotational variations of the two obliquely pulsating modes with
different pulsation axes. The star shows overabundances of the rare earth
elements, but these are not as extreme as most other roAp stars. The spectrum
is variable with rotation, indicating surface abundance patches.
