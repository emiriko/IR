In connection with recent and proposed experiments, and new theoretical
results, my previous calculations of the Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen will be
reviewed and compared with other work. In addition, numerical results for
muonic deuterium and helium will be presented. Some previously neglected (but
very small) effects are included.
