We will show for undergraduate and graduate students of physics that Quantum
Mechanics is an incomplete and non-local theory. The problem of non-locality is
discussed by analyzing the Bell's theorem where are considered correlations
between measurements results performed on physical systems that are far apart,
but that interacted in the past. The experimental violations of Bell's theorem
show a very general result thatquantum phenomena are nonlocal and that,
inevitably, Quantum Mechanics is non-local.
