We analyse complementary HST and SUBARU data for the globular cluster NGC
2419. We make a detailed analysis of the horizontal branch (HB), that appears
composed by two main groups of stars: the luminous blue HB stars ---that extend
by evolution into the RR Lyrae and red HB region--- and a fainter, extremely
blue population. We examine the possible models for this latter group and
conclude that a plausible explanation is that they correspond to a significant
(~30 %) extreme second generation with a strong helium enhancement (Y~0.4). We
also show that the color dispersion of the red giant branch is consistent with
this hypothesis, while the main sequence data are compatible with it, although
the large observational error blurs the possible underlying splitting. While it
is common to find an even larger (50 -- 80) percentage of second generation in
a globular cluster, the presence of a substantial and extreme fraction of these
stars in NGC 2419 might be surprising, as the cluster is at present well inside
the radius beyond which the galactic tidal field would be dominant. If a
similar situation had been present in the first stages of the cluster life, the
cluster would have retained its initial mass, and the percentage of second
generation stars should have been quite small (up to ~10 %). Such a large
fraction of extreme second generation stars implies that the system must have
been initially much more massive and in different dynamical conditions than
today. We discuss this issue in the light of existing models of the formation
of multiple populations in globular clusters.
