We investigate the memory effect in a simple model for glassy relaxation, a
trap model with a Gaussian density of states. In this model thermal equilibrium
is reached at all finite temperatures and therefore we can consider jumps from
low to high temperatures in addition to the quenches usually considered in
aging studies. We show that the evolution of the energy following the
Kovacs-protocol can approximately be expressed as a difference of two
monotonously decaying functions and thus show the existence of a so-called
Kovacs hump whenever these functions are not single exponentials. It is well
established that the Kovacs effect also occurs in the linear response regime
and we show that most of the gross features do not change dramatically when
large temperature jumps are considered. However, there is one distinguishing
feature that only exists beyond the linear regime which we discuss in detail.
For the memory experiment with 'inverted' temperatures, i.e. jumping up and
then down again, we find a very similar behavior apart from an opposite sign of
the hump.
