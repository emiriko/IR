The recently developed Kraus representation for bosonic Gaussian channels is
employed to study analytically the robustness of non-Gaussian entanglement
against evolution under noisy attenuator and amplifier environments, and
compare it with the robustness of Gaussian entanglement. Our results show that
some non-Gaussian states with one ebit of entanglement are more robust than all
Gaussian states, even the ones with arbitrarily large entanglement, a
conclusion of direct consequence to the recent conjecture by Allegra et al.
