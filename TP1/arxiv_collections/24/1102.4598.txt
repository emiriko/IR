The problem of generating random quantum states is of a great interest from
the quantum information theory point of view. In this paper we present a
package for Mathematica computing system harnessing a specific piece of
hardware, namely Quantis quantum random number generator (QRNG), for
investigating statistical properties of quantum states. The described package
implements a number of functions for generating random states, which use
Quantis QRNG as a source of randomness. It also provides procedures which can
be used in simulations not related directly to quantum information processing.
