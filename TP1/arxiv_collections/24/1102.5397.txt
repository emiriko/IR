We present the results of a Chandra study of the Hydra A galaxy cluster,
where a powerful AGN outburst created a large-scale cocoon shock. We
investigated possible azimuthal variations in shock strength and shape, finding
indications for a weak shock with a Mach number in the range ~1.2-1.3. We
measured the temperature change across the shock front. However, the detection
of a temperature rise in the regions immediately inside of the front is
complicated by the underlying temperature profile of the cluster atmosphere. We
measured the global temperature profile of the cluster up to 700 kpc, which
represents the farthest measurement obtained with Chandra for this cluster. A
"plateau" in the temperature profile in the range ~70-150 kpc indicates the
presence of cool gas, which is likely the result of uplift of material by the
AGN outburst. After masking the cool filaments visible in the hardness ratio
map, the plateau disappears and the temperature profile recovers a typical
shape with a peak around 190 kpc, just inside the shock front. However, it is
unlikely that such a temperature feature is produced by the shock as it is
consistent with the general shape of the temperature profiles observed for
relaxed galaxy clusters. We studied the spectral properties of the cool
filaments finding evidence that ~10^11 M_sun of low-entropy material has been
dredged up by the rising lobes from the central 30 kpc to the observed current
position of 75-150 kpc. The energy required to lift the cool gas is >~2.2 x
10^60 erg, which is comparable to the work required to inflate the cavities and
is ~25% of the total energy of the large-scale shock. Our results show that the
AGN feedback in Hydra A is acting not only by directly heating the gas, but
also by removing a substantial amount of potential fuel for the SMBH.
