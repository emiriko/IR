This thesis presents three different results in quantum information theory.
The first result addresses the theoretical foundations of quantum metrology.
The Heisenberg limit considered as the ultimate limit in quantum metrology sets
a lower bound on how precisely a physical quantity can be measured given a
certain amount of resources in any possible measurement. Recently, however,
several measurement procedures have been proposed in which the Heisenberg limit
seemed to be surpassed. This led to an extensive debate over the question how
the sensitivity scales with the physical resources and the computational
resources that are used in estimation procedures. Here, we reconcile the
physical definition of the relevant resources with the information-theoretical
scaling in terms of the query complexity of a quantum network. This leads to a
novel and ultimate Heisenberg limit that applies to all conceivable measurement
procedures. The second result reveals a close relationship between quantum
metrology and the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm over continuous-variable quantum
systems. Here, we develop a general procedure, characterized by two parameters,
that unifies parameter estimation and the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. The
procedure estimates a value of an unknown parameter with Heisenberg-limited
precision or solves the Deutsch-Jozsa problem in a single run without the use
of any entanglement. The third result illustrates how physical principles that
govern interaction of light and matter can be efficiently employed to create a
computational resource for a (one-way) quantum computer. More specifically, we
demonstrate theoretically a scheme based on atomic ensembles and the dipole
blockade mechanism for generation of the so-called cluster states in a single
step. This procedure is significantly more efficient than any known robust
probabilistic entangling operation.
