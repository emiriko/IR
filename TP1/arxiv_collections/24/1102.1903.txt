We perform an analysis of a binding energy difference called delta
V_{pn}(N,Z) =- 1/4(E(Z,N)-E(Z,N-2)-E(Z-2,N)+ E(Z-2,N-2) in the framework of a
realistic nuclear model. Using the angular-momentum and particle-number
projected generator coordinate method and the Skyrme interaction SLy4, we
analyze the contribution brought to delta V_{pn} by static deformation and
dynamic fluctuations around the mean-field ground state. Our method gives a
good overall description of delta V_{pn} throughout the chart of nuclei with
the exception of the anomaly related to the Wigner energy along the N=Z line.
The main conclusions of our analysis are that (i) the structures seen in the
systematics of delta V_{pn} throughout the chart of nuclei can be easily
explained combining a smooth background related to the symmetry energy and
correlation energies due to deformation and collective fluctuations; (ii) the
characteristic pattern of delta V_{pn} around a doubly-magic nucleus is a
trivial consequence of the asymmetric definition of delta V_{pn}, and not due
to a the different structure of these nuclei; (iii) delta V_{pn} does not
provide a very reliable indicator for structural changes; (iv) \delta V_{pn}
does not provide a reliable measure of the proton-neutron interaction in the
nuclear EDF, neither of that between the last filled orbits, nor of the one
summed over all orbits; (v) delta V_{pn} does not provide a conclusive
benchmark for nuclear EDF methods that is superior or complementary to other
mass filters such as two-nucleon separation energies or Q values.
