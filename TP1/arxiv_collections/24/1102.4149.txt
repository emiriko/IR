To determine the universality class of critical phenomena, we propose a
method of statistical inference in the scaling analysis of critical phenomena.
The method is based on Bayesian statistics, most specifically, the Gaussian
process regression. It assumes only the smoothness of a scaling function, and
it does not need a form. We demonstrate this method for the finite-size scaling
analysis of the Ising models on square and triangular lattices. Near the
critical point, the method is comparable in accuracy to the least-square
method. In addition, it works well for data to which we cannot apply the
least-square method with a polynomial of low degree. By comparing the data on
triangular lattices with the scaling function inferred from the data on square
lattices, we confirm the universality of the finite-size scaling function of
the two-dimensional Ising model.
