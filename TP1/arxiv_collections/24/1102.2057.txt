The recently released Reflex scientific workflow environment supports the
interactive execution of ESO VLT data reduction pipelines. Reflex is based upon
the Kepler workflow engine, and provides components for organising the data,
executing pipeline recipes based on the ESO Common Pipeline Library, invoking
Python scripts, and constructing interaction loops. Reflex will greatly enhance
the quick validation and reduction of the scientific data. In this paper we
summarize the main features of Reflex, and demonstrate as an example its
application to the reduction of echelle UVES data.
