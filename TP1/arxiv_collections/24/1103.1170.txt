We study the fluctuations of the matrix entries of regular functions of
Wigner random matrices in the limit when the matrix size goes to infinity. In
the case of the Gaussian ensembles (GOE and GUE) this problem was considered by
A.Lytova and L.Pastur in J. Stat. Phys., v.134, 147-159 (2009). Our results are
valid provided the off-diagonal matrix entries have finite fourth moment, the
diagonal matrix entries have finite second moment, and the test functions have
four continuous derivatives in a neighborhood of the support of the Wigner
semicircle law.
