We show that closed hypersurfaces in Euclidean space with nonnegative scalar
curvature are weakly mean convex. In contrast, the statement is no longer true
if the scalar curvature is replaced by the k-th mean curvature, for k greater
than 2, as we construct the counter-examples for all k greater than 2. Our
proof relies on a new geometric inequality which relates the scalar curvature
and mean curvature of a hypersurface to the mean curvature of the level sets of
a height function. By extending the argument, we show that complete non-compact
hypersurfaces of finitely many regular ends with nonnegative scalar curvature
are weakly mean convex, and prove a positive mass theorem for such
hypersurfaces.
