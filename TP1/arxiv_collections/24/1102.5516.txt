We report on the superconducting properties of amorphous NbxSi1-x thin films.
The normal-state resistance and critical temperatures can be separately
adjusted to suit the desired application. Notably, the relatively low
electron-phonon coupling of these films makes them good candidates for an "all
electron bolometer" for Cosmological Microwave Background radiation detection.
Moreover, this device can be made to suit both high and low impedance readouts.
