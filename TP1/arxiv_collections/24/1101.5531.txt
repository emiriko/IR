We study a minimal lattice model which describes bidirectional transport of
"particles" driven along a one dimensional track, as is observed in microtubule
based, motor protein driven bidirectional transport of cargo vesicles, lipid
bodies and organelles such as mitochondria. This minimal model, a multi-species
totally asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP) with directional switching, can
provide a framework for understanding the interplay between the switching
dynamics of individual particles and the collective movement of particles in
1-dimension. When switching is much faster than translocation, the steady state
density and current profiles of the particles are homogeneous in the bulk and
are well described by a Mean-Field (MF) theory, as determined by comparison to
a Monte Carlo simulation. In this limit, we construct a non-equilibrium phase
diagram. Away from this fast switching regime, the MF theory fails, although
the average bulk density profile still remains homogeneous. We study the steady
state behaviour as a function of the ratio of the translocation and net
switching rates, Q, and find a unique first-order phase transition at a finite
Q associated with a discontinuous change of the bulk density. When the
switching rate is decreased further (keeping translocation rate fixed), the
system approaches a jammed phase with a net current that tends to zero as J ~
1/Q.
