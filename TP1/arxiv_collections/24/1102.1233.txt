We investigated the mganetic field effects (MFEs) on electron mobility in
tri-(8-hydroxyquinoline)-aluminum based light-emitting devices by
transient-electroluminescence method upon application of various offset
voltages. It is found the rising edges of EL pulses are well overlapped and the
falling edges of EL pulses are separated for the magnetic field on and off when
Voffset=0 V and Voffset>Vturnon of the devices. The results suggest the
bipolaron model and the triplet-polaron interaction model related to the
carriers mobilities are not the dominant mechanisms to explain the MFEs under
our experimental conditions, and the magnetic field affects the carriers
recombination process is confirmed.
