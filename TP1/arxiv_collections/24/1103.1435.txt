We present our discovery of a new hybrid pulsating subdwarf B star,
J08069+1527. The effective temperature and surface gravity of 28,500$\pm$400\,K
and 5.37$\pm$0.04\,dex, respectively, place this object inside the instability
strip and also among other pulsating hot subdwarfs of a hybrid nature, right
next to another fascinating star: Balloon\,090100001. From this proximity, we
anticipated this star could pulsate in both high and low frequency modes.
Indeed, our analysis of photometric data confirmed our prediction. We detected
two peaks in the high frequency region and two other peaks at low frequencies.
In addition, the amplitude of the dominant mode is very high and comparable to
the dominant peaks in other hybrid subdwarf B stars. Since this star is bright,
we performed time-series low resolution spectroscopy. Despite a low
signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio, we were able to detect the main peak from these
data. All our results strongly indicate that J08069+1527 is a high amplitude
pulsating hot subdwarf B star of hybrid nature. By analogy to the other
pulsating sdB star, we judge that the dominant mode we detected here has radial
nature. Future stellar modeling should provide us with quite good constrains as
p- and g-modes presented in this star are driven in different parts of its
interior.
