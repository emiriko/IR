The asymmetric dark matter scenario is known to give an interesting solution
for the cosmic coincidence problem between baryon and dark matter densities. In
the scenario, the dark matter asymmetry, which is translated to the dark matter
density in the present universe, is transferred from the B-L asymmetry
generated in the early universe. On the other hand, the generation of the B-L
asymmetry is simply assumed, though many mechanisms for the generation are
expected to be consistent with the scenario. We show that the generation of the
asymmetry in the sneutrino inflation scenario works similarly to the asymmetric
dark matter scenario, because the non-renormalizable operator which translates
the B-L asymmetry to the dark matter asymmetry is naturally obtained by
integrating right-handed neutrinos out. As a result, important issues
concerning cosmology (inflation, the mass density of dark matter, and the
baryon asymmetry of the universe) as well as neutrino masses and mixing have a
unified origin, namely, the right-handed neutrinos.
