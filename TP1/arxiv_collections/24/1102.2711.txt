New crystal technique - array of bent strips and a fan-type reflector, based
on thin straight plates - have been used for research of extraction and
collimation a circulating beam in the U-70 accelerator at the energy 50 GeV and
1.3 GeV. It is shown, that new devices can effectively steer a beam in a wide
energy range. For protons with energy 50 GeV efficiency of extraction and
collimation about 90 % has been achieved which is record for this method.
Reduction of particle losses in 2-3 times was observed also in accelerator at
application of different crystals in comparison with the usual one-stage
collimation scheme of beam with a steel absorber.
