In the present paper, a fuzzy logic based method is combined with wavelet
decomposition to develop a step-by-step dynamic hybrid model for the estimation
of financial time series. Empirical tests on fuzzy regression, wavelet
decomposition as well as the new hybrid model are conducted on the well known
$SP500$ index financial time series. The empirical tests show an efficiency of
the hybrid model.
