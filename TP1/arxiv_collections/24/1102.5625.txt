Ultrathin MgB2 superconducting films with a thickness down to 7.5 nm are
epitaxially grown on (0001) Al2O3 substrate by hybrid physical-chemical vapor
deposition method. The films are phase-pure, oxidation-free and continuous. The
7.5 nm thin film shows a Tc(0) of 34 K, which is so far the highest Tc(0)
reported in MgB2 with the same thickness. The critical current density of
ultrathin MgB2 films below 10 nm is demonstrated for the first time as Jc ~
10^6 A cm^{-2} for the above 7.5 nm sample at 16 K. Our results reveal the
excellent superconducting properties of ultrathin MgB2 films with thicknesses
between 7.5 and 40 nm on Al2O3 substrate.
