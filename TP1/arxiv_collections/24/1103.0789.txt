The paper describes the project, implementation and test of a C-band (5GHz)
Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) using new low noise Pseudomorphic High Electron
Mobility Transistors (pHEMTS) from Avago. The amplifier was developed to be
used as a cost effective solution in a receiver chain for Galactic Emission
Mapping (GEM-P) project in Portugal with the objective of finding affordable
solutions not requiring strong cryogenic operation, as is the case of massive
projects like the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), in Earth Sensing projects and
other niches like microwave reflectometry. The particular application and
amplifier requirements are first introduced. Several commercially available low
noise devices were selected and the noise performance simulated. An ultra-low
noise pHEMT was used for an implementation that achieved a Noise Figure of 0.6
dB with 13 dB gain at 5 GHz. The design, simulation and measured results of the
prototype are presented and discussed.
