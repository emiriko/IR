The entanglement between two atoms in a damping Jaynes-Cummings model is
investigated with different decay coefficients of the atoms from the upper
level to other levels under detuning between the atomic frequency and the
quantized light field frequency. The results indicate that the larger the decay
coefficient is, the more quickly the entanglement decays. The detuning enhances
the entanglement's average value at long times. More importantly, the results
show that the so-called sudden death effect can be avoided by enhancing the
detuning or the decay coefficient.
