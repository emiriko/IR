Plasma turbulence is thought to be associated with various physical processes
involved in solar flares, including magnetic reconnection, particle
acceleration and transport. Using Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager
({\it RHESSI}) observations and the X-ray visibility analysis, we determine the
spatial and spectral distributions of energetic electrons for a flare (GOES
M3.7 class, April 14, 2002 23$:$55 UT), which was previously found to be
consistent with a reconnection scenario. It is demonstrated that because of the
high density plasma in the loop, electrons have to be continuously accelerated
about the loop apex of length $\sim 2\times 10^9$cm and width $\sim 7\times
10^8$cm. Energy dependent transport of tens of keV electrons is observed to
occur both along and across the guiding magnetic field of the loop. We show
that the cross-field transport is consistent with the presence of magnetic
turbulence in the loop, where electrons are accelerated, and estimate the
magnitude of the field line diffusion coefficient for different phases of the
flare. The energy density of magnetic fluctuations is calculated for given
magnetic field correlation lengths and is larger than the energy density of the
non-thermal electrons. The level of magnetic fluctuations peaks when the
largest number of electrons is accelerated and is below detectability or absent
at the decay phase. These hard X-ray observations provide the first
observational evidence that magnetic turbulence governs the evolution of
energetic electrons in a dense flaring loop and is suggestive of their
turbulent acceleration.
