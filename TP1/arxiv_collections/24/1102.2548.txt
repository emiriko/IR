We present a focused study of a predictive unified model whose measurable
consequences are immediately relevant to early discovery prospects of
supersymmetry at the LHC. ATLAS and CMS have released their analysis with
35~pb$^{-1}$ of data and the model class we discuss is consistent with this
data. It is shown that with an increase in luminosity the LSP dark matter mass
and the gluino mass can be inferred from simple observables such as kinematic
edges in leptonic channels and peak values in effective mass distributions.
Specifically, we consider cases in which the neutralino is of low mass and
where the relic density consistent with WMAP observations arises via the
exchange of Higgs bosons in unified supergravity models. The magnitudes of the
gaugino masses are sharply limited to focused regions of the parameter space,
and in particular the dark matter mass lies in the range $\sim (50-65) ~\rm
GeV$ with an upper bound on the gluino mass of $575~{\rm GeV}$, with a typical
mass of $450~{\rm GeV}$. We find that all model points in this paradigm are
discoverable at the LHC at $\sqrt s = 7 \rm ~TeV$. We determine lower bounds on
the entire sparticle spectrum in this model based on existing experimental
constraints. In addition, we find the spin-independent cross section for
neutralino scattering on nucleons to be generally in the range of $\sigma^{\rm
SI}_{\na p} = 10^{-46 \pm 1}~\rm cm^2$ with much higher cross sections also
possible. Thus direct detection experiments such as CDMS and XENON already
constrain some of the allowed parameter space of the low mass gaugino models
and further data will provide important cross-checks of the model assumptions
in the near future.
