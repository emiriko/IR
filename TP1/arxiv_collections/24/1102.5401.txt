Author's Summary of the dissertation for the degree of the Candidate of
Science (physics and mathematics). The aim of the dissertation is to develop a
generalized Kalman Duality concept applicable for linear unbounded
non-invertible operators and introduce the minimax state estimation theory and
algorithms for linear differential-algebraic equations. In particular, the
dissertation pursues the following goals: - develop generalized duality concept
for the minimax state estimation theory for DAEs with unknown but bounded model
error and random observation noise with unknown but bounded correlation
operator; - derive the minimax state estimation theory for linear DAEs with
unknown but bounded model error and random observation noise with unknown but
bounded correlation operator; - describe how the DAE model propagates uncertain
parameters; - estimate the worst-case error; - construct fast estimation
algorithms in the form of filters; - develop a tool for model validation, that
is to assess how good the model describes observed phenomena.
  The dissertation contains the following new results: - generalized version of
the Kalman duality principle is proposed allowing to handle unbounded linear
model operators with non-trivial null-space; - new definitions of the minimax
estimates for DAEs based on the generalized Kalman duality principle are
proposed; - theorems of existence for minimax estimates are proved; - new
minimax state estimation algorithms (in the form of filter and in the
variational form) for DAE are proposed.
