This paper is an addendum to [arXiv:0808.2096] in which I point out that both
de Sitter space and Rindler space are fast scramblers. This fact naturally
suggests that the holographic description of a causal patch of de Sitter space
may be a matrix quantum mechanics at finite temperature. The same can be said
of Rindler space. Some qualitative features of these spaces can be understood
from the matrix description.
