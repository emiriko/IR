Processing large amounts of data to extract useful information is an
essential task within companies. To help in this task, visualization techniques
have been commonly used due to their capacity to present data in synthesized
views, easier to understand and manage. However, achieving the right
visualization display for a data set is a complex cartography process that
involves several transformation steps to adapt the (domain) data to the
(visualization) data format expected by visualization tools. To maximize the
benefits of visualization we propose Portolan, a generic model-driven
cartography framework that facilitates the discovery of the data to visualize,
the specification of view definitions for that data and the transformations to
bridge the gap with the visualization tools. Our approach has been implemented
on top of the Eclipse EMF modeling framework and validated on three different
use cases.
