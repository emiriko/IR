We investigate hydrodynamic evolution of the quark gluon plasma for the
colour glass condensate type initial conditions. We solve full second-order
viscous hydrodynamic equations in the longitudinal direction to find that
non-boost invariant expansion leads to visible deformation on the initial
rapidity distribution. The results indicate that hydrodynamic evolution with
viscosity plays an important role in determining parameters for the initial
distributions.
