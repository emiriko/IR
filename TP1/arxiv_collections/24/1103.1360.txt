This article presents an asynchronous FPGA architecture for implementing
cryptographic algorithms secured against physical cryptanalysis. We discuss the
suitability of asynchronous reconfigurable architectures for such applications
before proceeding to model the side channel and defining our objectives. The
logic block architecture is presented in detail. We discuss several solutions
for the interconnect architecture, and how these solutions can be ported to
other flavours of interconnect (i.e. single driver). Next We discuss in detail
a high speed asynchronous configuration chain architecture used to configure
our asynchronous FPGA with simulation results, and we present a 3 X 3 prototype
FPGA fabricated in 65 nm CMOS. Lastly we present experiments to test the high
speed asynchronous configuration chain and evaluate how far our objectives have
been achieved with proposed solutions, and we conclude with emphasis on
complementary FPGA CAD algorithms, and the effect of CMOS variation on
Side-Channel Vulnerability.
