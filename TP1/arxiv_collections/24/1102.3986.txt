We propose a polarization to orbital angular momentum teleportation scheme
using entangled photon pairs generated by spontaneous parametric down
conversion. By making a joint detection of the polarization and angular
momentum parity of a single photon, we are able to detect all the Bell-states
and perform, in principle, perfect teleportation from a discrete to a
continuous system using minimal resources. The proposed protocol implementation
demands experimental resources that are currently available in quantum optics
laboratories.
