Various experimental results providing information on thermodynamic density
of states in (Ga,Mn)As are analyzed theoretically assuming that holes occupy
GaAs-like valence bands. Allowing for Gaussian fluctuations of magnetization,
the employed model describes correctly a critical behavior of magnetic specific
heat found experimentally in (Ga,Mn)As near the Curie temperature T_C [S.
Yuldashev et al., Appl. Phys. Express 3, 073005 (2010)]. The magnitudes of room
temperature thermoelectric power, as measured for GaAs:Be and (Ga,Mn)As [M. A.
Mayer et al., Phys. Rev. B 81, 045205 (2010)], are consistent with the model
for the expected energy dependencies of the hole mobility. The same approach
describes also temperature variations of conductance specific to the
Anderson-Mott localization, found for various dimensionality (Ga,Mn)As
nanostructures at subkelvin temperatures [D. Neumaier et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.
103, 087203 (2009)]. We conclude that the examined phenomena do not provide
evidence for an enhancement of density of states by the presence of an impurity
band at the Fermi energy in ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn)As. Furthermore, we provide
for (Ga,Mn)As expected values of both electronic specific heat at low
temperatures T << T_C and magnetization as a function of the magnetic field at
T_C.
