For a generic dynamical decoupling sequence employing a single-axis control,
we study its efficiency in the presence of small errors in direction of the
controlling-pulses. In the case that the corresponding ideal
dynamical-decoupling sequence produces good results, the impact of the errors
is found to scale as $\xi^2$, with negligible first-order effect, where $\xi$
is the dispersion of the random errors. This analytical prediction is
numerically tested in a model, in which the environment is modeled by one qubit
coupled to a quantum kicked rotator in chaotic motion. In this model, with
periodic pulses applied to the qubit in the environment, it is shown
numerically that Uhrig dynamical decoupling is not necessarily better than the
bang-bang control.
