In the changepoint problem, we determine when the distribution observed has
changed to another one. We expand this problem to the quantum case where copies
of an unknown pure state are being distributed. We study the fundamental case,
which has only two candidates to choose. This problem is equal to identifying a
given state with one of the two unknown states when multiple copies of the
states are provided. In this paper, we assume that two candidate states are
distributed independently and uniformly in the space of the whole pure states.
The minimum of the averaged error probability is given and the optimal POVM is
defined as to obtain it. Using this POVM, we also compute the error probability
which depends on the inner product. These analytical results allow us to
calculate the value in the asymptotic case, where this problem approaches to
the usual discrimination problem.
