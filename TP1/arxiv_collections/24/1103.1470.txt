Advanced solar sailing has been an increasingly attractive propulsion system
for highly non-Keplerian orbits. Three new applications of the orbital angular
momentum reversal (H-reversal) trajectories using solar sails are presented in
this paper: space observation, heliocentric orbit transfer, and collision
orbits with asteroids. A theoretical proof for the existence of double
H-reversal trajectories (referred to as 'H2RTs') is given, and the
characteristics of the H2RTs are introduced before the discussion of the
mission applications. A new family of H2RTs was obtained using a 3D dynamic
model of the two-body frame. In a time-optimal control model, the minimum
period H2RTs both inside and outside the ecliptic plane were examined using an
ideal solar sail. Due to the quasi-heliostationary property at its two
symmetrical aphelia, the H2RTs were deemed suitable for space observation. For
the second application, the heliocentric transfer orbit was able to function as
the time-optimal H-reversal trajectory, as its perihelion velocity is circular
or elliptic velocity. Such a transfer orbit can place the sailcraft into a
clockwise orbit in the ecliptic plane, with a high inclination or displacement
above or below the Sun. The third application of the H-reversal trajectory was
simulated impacting an asteroid passing near Earth in a head-on collision. The
collision point can be designed through selecting different perihelia or
different launch windows. Sample orbits of each application were presented
through numerical simulation. The results can serve as a reference for
theoretical research and engineering design.
