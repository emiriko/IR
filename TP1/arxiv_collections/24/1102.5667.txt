The observed small, positive cosmological constant may originate from a
four-fermion interaction generated by the spin-torsion coupling in the
Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble gravity if the fermions are condensing. In
particular, such a condensation occurs for quark fields during the
quark-gluon/hadron phase transition in the early Universe. We study how the
torsion-induced four-fermion interaction is affected by adding two terms to the
Dirac Lagrangian density: the parity-violating pseudoscalar density dual to the
curvature tensor and a spinor-bilinear scalar density which measures the
nonminimal coupling of fermions to torsion.
