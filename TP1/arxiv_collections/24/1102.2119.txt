The properties of $\gamma$--jet pairs emitted in heavy-ion collisions provide
an accurate mean to perform a tomographic measurement of the medium created in
the collision through the study of the medium modified jet properties. The idea
is to measure the distribution of hadrons emitted on the opposite side of the
%oppositely by tagging the direct photon. The feasibility of such measurements
is studied by applying the approach on the simulation data, we have
demonstrated that this method allows us to measure, with a good approximation,
both the jet fragmentation and the back-to-back azimuthal alignment of the
direct photon and the jet. Comparing these two observables measured in pp
collisions with the ones measured in AA collisions reveals the modifications
induced by the medium on the jet structure and consequently allows us to infer
the medium properties. In this contribution, we discuss a first attempt of such
measurements applied to real proton-proton data from the ALICE experiment.
