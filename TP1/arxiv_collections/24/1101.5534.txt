Some time ago, Cuniberti et al have proposed a novel method for analytically
continuing thermal imaginary-time correlators to real time, which requires no
model input and should be applicable with finite-precision data as well. Given
that these assertions go against common wisdom, we report on a naive test of
the method with an idealized example. We do encounter two problems, which we
spell out in detail; this implies that systematic errors are difficult to
quantify. On a more positive note, the method is simple to implement and allows
for an empirical recipe by which a reasonable qualitative estimate for some
transport coefficient may be obtained, if statistical errors of an
ultraviolet-subtracted imaginary-time measurement can be reduced to roughly
below the per mille level.
