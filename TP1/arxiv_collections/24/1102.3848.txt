We investigate transport through nanoribbons in the presence of disorder
scattering. We show that size quantization patterns are only present when SU(2)
pseudospin symmetry is preserved. Symmetry breaking disorder renders transverse
quantization invisible, which may provide an explanation for the necessity of
suspending graphene nanoconstrictions to obtain size quantization signatures in
very recent experiments. Employing a quasi-classical Monte-Carlo simulation, we
are able to reproduce and explain key qualitative features of the full
quantum-mechanical calculations.
