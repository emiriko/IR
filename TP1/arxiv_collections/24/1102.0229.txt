We present the results of a deep, near-infrared, narrow band imaging survey
at a central wavelength of 1.062 microns (FWHM=0.01 microns) in the GOODS-South
field using the ESO VLT instrument, HAWK-I. The data are used to carry out the
highest redshift search for [OII]3727 emission line galaxies to date. The
images reach an emission line flux limit (5 sigma) of 1.5 x 10^-17 erg cm^-2
s^-1, additionally making the survey the deepest of its kind at high redshift.
In this paper we identify a sample of [OII]3727 emission line objects at
redshift z~1.85 in a co-moving volume of ~4100 Mpc^3. Objects are selected
using an observed equivalent width (EW_obs) threshold of EW_obs = 50 angstroms.
The sample is used to derive the space density and constrain the luminosity
function of [OII] emitters at z=1.85. We find that the space density of objects
with observed [OII] luminosities in the range log(L_[OII]) > 41.74 erg s^-1 is
log(rho)=-2.45+/-0.14 Mpc^-3, a factor of 2 greater than the observed space
density of [OII] emitters reported at z~1.4. After accounting for completeness
and assuming an internal extinction correction of A_Halpha=1 mag (equivalent to
A_[OII]=1.87), we report a star formation rate density of rho* ~0.38+/-0.06
Msun yr^-1 Mpc^-3. We independently derive the dust extinction of the sample
using 24 micron fluxes and find a mean extinction of A_[OII]=0.98+/-0.11
magnitudes (A_Halpha=0.52). This is significantly lower than the A_Halpha=1
(A[OII]=1.86) mag value widely used in the literature. Finally we incorporate
this improved extinction correction into the star formation rate density
measurement and report rho*~0.24+/-0.06 Msun yr^-1 Mpc^-3.
