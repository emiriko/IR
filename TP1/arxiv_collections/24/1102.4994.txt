We present a comprehensive analysis of the relaxation dynamics of a Luttinger
liquid subject to a sequence of sudden interaction quenches. We express the
critical exponent $\beta$ governing the decay of the steady-state propagator as
an explicit functional of the switching protocol. At long distances $\beta$
depends only on the initial state while at short distances it is also history
dependent. Continuous protocols of arbitrary complexity can be realized with
infinitely long sequences. For quenches of finite duration we prove that there
exist no protocol to bring the initial non-interacting system in the ground
state of the Luttinger liquid. Nevertheless memory effects are washed out at
short-distances. The adiabatic theorem is then investigated with
ramp-switchings of increasing duration, and several analytic results for both
the propagator and the excitation energy are derived.
