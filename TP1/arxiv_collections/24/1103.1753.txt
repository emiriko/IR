Photoelectron ionization spectra of a system interacting with a neighbor
two-level atom are investigated using the Laplace-transform method. These
spectra are typically composed of several peaks. Photoelectron ionization
spectra conditioned by the measurement on the two-level atom show oscillations
at the Rabi frequency. The presence of spectral zeros occurring periodically
with the Rabi period is predicted. This phenomenon is analyzed in detail.
