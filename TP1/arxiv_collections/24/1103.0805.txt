Locking of the spin of a quasi-particle to its momentum in split bands of on
the surfaces of metals and topological insulators (TIs) is understood in terms
of Rashba effect where a free electron in the surface states feels an effective
magnetic field. On the other hand, the orbital part of the angular momentum
(OAM) is usually neglected. We performed angle resolved photoemission
experiments with circularly polarized lights and first principles density
functional calculation with spin-orbit coupling on a TI, Bi2Se3, to study the
local OAM of the surface states. We show from the results that OAM in the
surface states of Bi2Se3 is significant and locked to the electron momentum in
opposite direction to the spin, forming chiral OAM states. Our finding opens a
new possibility to have strong light-induced spin-polarized current in the
surface states.
