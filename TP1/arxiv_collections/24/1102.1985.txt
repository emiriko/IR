Theoretical progress in understanding the dynamics of spreading processes on
graphs suggests the existence of an epidemic threshold below which no epidemics
form and above which epidemics spread to a significant fraction of the graph.
We have observed information cascades on the social media site Digg that spread
fast enough for one initial spreader to infect hundreds of people, yet end up
affecting only 0.1% of the entire network. We find that two effects, previously
studied in isolation, combine cooperatively to drastically limit the final size
of cascades on Digg. First, because of the highly clustered structure of the
Digg network, most people who are aware of a story have been exposed to it via
multiple friends. This structure lowers the epidemic threshold while moderately
slowing the overall growth of cascades. In addition, we find that the mechanism
for social contagion on Digg points to a fundamental difference between
information spread and other contagion processes: despite multiple
opportunities for infection within a social group, people are less likely to
become spreaders of information with repeated exposure. The consequences of
this mechanism become more pronounced for more clustered graphs. Ultimately,
this effect severely curtails the size of social epidemics on Digg.
