Using the data from SNO NCD phase, SuperK, Borexino and KamLAND Solar phase,
we derive in a model independent way, bounds on the possible components in the
solar neutrino flux. We update the limits on the antineutrino ($\bar\nu_x$)
flux and sterile ($\nu_s$) component and compare them with the previous results
obtained using SNO Salt phase data and data from SuperKamiokande experiments.
It is affirmed that the upper bound on $\bar\nu_x$ is independent of the
$\nu_s$ component. We recover the $\nu_s$ and $\bar\nu_x$ upper bounds existing
in the literature. We also obtain bounds on $f_B$, the SSM normalization factor
and the common parameter range for $f_B$ and the $\nu_s$ components in the
light of latest data. In summary, we update, in a model independent way, the
previous results existing in literature in the light of latest solar neutrino
data.
