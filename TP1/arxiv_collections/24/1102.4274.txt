We update the Standard-Model predictions for several quantities related to
$B_s - \bar B_s$ and $B_d - \bar B_d$ mixing. The mass and width differences in
the $B_s$ system read $ \Delta M_s^{\rm SM} = (17.3 \pm 2.6) ps^{-1}$ and
$\Delta \Gamma_s^{\rm SM}= (0.087 \pm 0.021) ps^{-1}$, respectively. The CP
asymmetries in flavour-specific decays are $a_{\rm fs}^{s,\rm SM} = (1.9 \pm
0.3) \cdot 10^{-5}$ and $a_{\rm fs}^{d,\rm SM} = - (4.1 \pm 0.6) \cdot
10^{-4}$. We further critically discuss the sensitivity of $\Delta \Gamma_d$ to
new physics and the uncertainties in the relation between $\Delta \Gamma_s$ and
the branching fraction of $B_s \to D_s^{(*)}{}^+ D_s^{(*)}{}^-$. Then we
present a numerical update of the average width $\Gamma_s$ in the $B_s$ system
and correlate $\Gamma_s$ with the $B^+$-$B_d$ lifetime ratio. Finally we
summarise the key results of our recent global analysis with the CKMfitter
collaboration addressing new physics in $B - \bar B$-mixing. In an
appropriately defined scenario parametrising new physics in $B - \bar B$-mixing
by two complex parameters $\Delta_d$ and $\Delta_s$ the Standard-Model point
{$\Delta_d=\Delta_s=1$} is disfavoured by 3.6 standard deviations.
