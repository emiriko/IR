We study frequency allocation in wireless networks. A wireless network is
modeled by an undirected graph, with vertices corresponding to cells. In each
vertex we have a certain number of requests, and each of those requests must be
assigned a different frequency. Edges represent conflicts between cells,
meaning that frequencies in adjacent vertices must be different as well. The
objective is to minimize the total number of used frequencies.
  The offline version of the problem is known to be NP-hard. In the incremental
version, requests for frequencies arrive over time and the algorithm is
required to assign a frequency to a request as soon as it arrives. Competitive
incremental algorithms have been studied for several classes of graphs. For
paths, the optimal (asymptotic) ratio is known to be 4/3, while for
hexagonal-cell graphs it is between 1.5 and 1.9126. For k-colorable graphs, the
ratio of (k+1)/2 can be achieved.
  In this paper, we prove nearly tight bounds on the asymptotic competitive
ratio for bipartite graphs, showing that it is between 1.428 and 1.433. This
improves the previous lower bound of 4/3 and upper bound of 1.5. Our proofs are
based on reducing the incremental problem to a purely combinatorial
(equivalent) problem of constructing set families with certain intersection
properties.
