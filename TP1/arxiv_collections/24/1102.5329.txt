We report on the study of indirect excitons in moving lattices - conveyers
created by a set of AC voltages applied to the electrodes on the sample
surface. The wavelength of this moving lattice is set by the electrode
periodicity, the amplitude is controlled by the applied voltage, and the
velocity is controlled by the AC frequency. We observed the dynamical
localization-delocalization transition for excitons in the conveyers and
measured its dependence on the exciton density and conveyer amplitude and
velocity. We considered a model for exciton transport via conveyers. The
theoretical simulations are in agreement with the experimental data.
