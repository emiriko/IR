We report an in-plane optical spectroscopy study on the iron-selenide
superconductor K$_{0.75}$Fe$_{1.75}$Se$_2$. The measurement revealed the
development of a sharp reflectance edge below T$_c$ at frequency much smaller
than the superconducting energy gap on a relatively incoherent electronic
background, a phenomenon which was not seen in any other Fe-based
superconductors so far investigated. Furthermore, the feature could be
noticeably suppressed and shifted to lower frequency by a moderate magnetic
field. Our analysis indicates that this edge structure arises from the
development of a Josephson-coupling plasmon in the superconducting condensate.
Together with the transmission electron microscopy analysis, our study yields
compelling evidence for the presence of nanoscale phase separation between
superconductivity and magnetism. The results also enable us to understand
various seemingly controversial experimental data probed from different
techniques.
