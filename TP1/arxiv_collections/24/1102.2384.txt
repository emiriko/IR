We introduce a simple mean-field lattice model to describe the behavior of
nematic elastomers. This model combines the Maier-Saupe-Zwanzig approach to
liquid crystals and an extension to lattice systems of the Warner-Terentjev
theory of elasticity, with the addition of quenched random fields. We use
standard techniques of statistical mechanics to obtain analytic solutions for
the full range of parameters. Among other results, we show the existence of a
stress-strain coexistence curve below a freezing temperature, analogous to the
P-V diagram of a simple fluid, with the disorder strength playing the role of
temperature. Below a critical value of disorder, the tie lines in this diagram
resemble the experimental stress-strain plateau, and may be interpreted as
signatures of the characteristic polydomain-monodomain transition. Also, in the
monodomain case, we show that random-fields may soften the first-order
transition between nematic and isotropic phases, provided the samples are
formed in the nematic state.
