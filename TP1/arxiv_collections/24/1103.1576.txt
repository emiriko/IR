We prove that the distortion function of the Gauss map of a harmonic surface
coincides with the distortion function of the surface. Consequently, Gauss map
of a harmonic surface is ${\mathcal{K}}$ quasiregular if and only if the
surface is ${\mathcal{K}}$ quasiregular, provided that the Gauss map is regular
or what is shown to be the same, provided that the surface is non-planar.
