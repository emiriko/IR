Dijet angular distributions are measured over a wide range of dijet invariant
masses in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV, at the CERN LHC. The event sample,
recorded with the CMS detector, corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 36
inverse picobarns. The data are found to be in good agreement with the
predictions of perturbative QCD, and yield no evidence of quark compositeness.
With a modified frequentist approach, a lower limit on the contact interaction
scale for left-handed quarks of Lambda = 5.6 TeV (6.7 TeV) for destructive
(constructive) interference is obtained at the 95% confidence level.
