Let $M$ be a scattering manifold, i.e., a Riemannian manifold with
asymptotically conic structure, and let $H$ be a Schr\"odinger operator on $M$.
We can construct a natural time-dependent scattering theory for $H$ with a
suitable reference system, and the scattering matrix is defined accordingly. We
here show the scattering matrices are Fourier integral operators associated to
a canonical transform on the boundary manifold generated by the geodesic flow.
In particular, we learn that the wave front sets are mapped according to the
canonical transform. These results are generalizations of a theorem by Melrose
and Zworski, but the framework and the proof are quite different. These results
may be considered as generalizations or refinements of the classical
off-diagonal smoothness of the scattering matrix for 2-body quantum scattering
on Euclidean spaces.
