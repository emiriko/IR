We present an open-source Mathematica importer for CERN ROOT files. Taking
advantage of Mathematica's import/export plug-in mechanism, the importer offers
a simple, unified interface that cleanly wraps around its MathLink-based core
that links the ROOT libraries with Mathematica. Among other tests for accuracy
and efficiency, the importer has also been tested on a large (~5 Gbyte) file
structure, D3PD, used by the ATLAS experiment for offline analysis without
problems. In addition to describing the installation and usage of the importer,
we discuss how the importer may be further improved and customized. A link to
the package can be found at:
