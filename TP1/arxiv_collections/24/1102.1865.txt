The flexoelectric (FE) effect provides a linear coupling between electric
polarization and orientational deformation in liquid crystals. It influences
many electrooptical phenomena and it is used in some bistable nematic devices.
A statistical theory of dipole FE polarization in biaxial nematic liquid
crystals is used to calculate temperature dependence of order parameters,
elastic constants, and FE coefficients. The splitting of the two Meyer FE
coefficients and the appearance of new FE coefficients is obtained at the
uniaxial-biaxial nematic transition. The ordering of the splited FE
coefficients corresponds to the ordering of the splited elastic constants.
