We present observations from the Small Array of the Arcminute Microkelvin
Imager (AMI) of eight high X-ray luminosity galaxy cluster systems selected
from the Local Cluster Substructure Survey (LoCuSS) sample.We detect the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect in seven of these clusters. With the assumptions
that galaxy clusters are isothermal, have a density profile described by a
spherical b -model and obey the theoretical M-T relation, we are able to derive
cluster parameters at r200 from our SZ data. With the additional assumption of
hydrostatic equilibrium we are able to derive parameters at r500. We present
posterior probability distributions for cluster parameters such as mass, radius
and temperature (TSZ, MT). Combining our sample with that of AMI Consortium:
Rodr'\iguez-Gonz\'alvez et al. (2011) and using large-radius X-ray temperature
estimates (TX) from Chandra and Suzaku observations, we find that there is
reasonable correspondence between TX and TSZ,MT values at low TX, but that for
clusters with TX above around 6keV the correspondence breaks down with TX
exceeding TSZ, MT; we stress that this finding is based on just ten clusters.
