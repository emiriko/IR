We show that a spin-polarized Landau level in a two-dimensional electron gas
can carry a spin-triplet supercurrent between two spin-singlet superconductors.
The supercurrent results from the interplay of Andreev reflection and Rashba
spin-orbit coupling at the normal--superconductor (NS) interface. We contrast
the current-phase relationship and the Fraunhofer oscillations of the
spin-triplet and spin-singlet Josephson effect in the lowest Landau level, and
find qualitative differences.
