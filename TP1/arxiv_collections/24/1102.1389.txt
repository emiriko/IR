We have systematically studied the transmission of electrical signals along
several 2-strip Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) in the frequency range
$f=0.1-3.5$GHz. Such a range was chosen to fully cover the bandwidth associated
to the very short rise-times of signals originated in RPCs used for sub-100ps
timing applications. This work conveys experimental evidence of the dominant
role of modal dispersion in counters built at the 1 meter scale, a fact that
results in large cross-talk levels and strong signal shaping. It is shown that
modal dispersion appears in RPCs due to the intrinsic unbalance between the
capacitive and the inductive coupling $C_m/C_o \neq L_m/L_o$. A practical way
to restore this symmetry has been introduced (hereafter `electrostatic
compensation'), allowing for a cross-talk suppression factor of around $\times
12$ and a rise-time reduction by 200ps. Under conditions of compensation the
signal transmission is only limited by dielectric losses, yielding a
length-dependent cutoff frequency of around 1GHz per 2 meter for typical float
glass -based RPCs ($\tan \delta|_{glass} = 0.025\pm0.005$).
  It is further shown that
  `electrostatic compensation' can be achieved for an arbitrary number of
strips as long as the nature of the coupling is `short-range', that is an
almost exact assumption for typical strip-line RPCs. Evidence for deviations
from the dominant TEM propagation mode has been observed, although they seem to
have negligible influence in practical signal observables. This work extends
the bandwidth of previous studies by a factor of almost $\times 20$.
