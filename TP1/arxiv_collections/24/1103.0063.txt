Based on the mean-field approximation and the phase space analysis, we study
the dynamics of an atom-molecule conversion system subject to particle loss.
Starting from the many-body dynamics described by a master equation, an
effective nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation is introduced. The classical phase
space is then specified and classified by fixed points. The boundary, which
separate different dynamical regimes have been calculated and discussed. The
effect of particle loss on the conversion efficiency and the self-trapping is
explored.
