It is proposed that an ultra-light fermionic species, dubbed cosmic magnino
has condensed into a ferromagnetic state in the Universe. The extended
structure of domain walls associated with this ferromagnetism accounts for the
observed Dark Energy. In modification of the situation with an electron gas, it
is proposed that the Stoner criterion is satisfied due to magnetic dipolar
repulsion. The cosmological requirements then yeild a lower bound on the
magnetic moment of the cosmic magnino. The proposed magnetism is supposed to be
associated with a new non-standard electromagnetism. If the magnino is also
electrically charged under this electromagnetism, the corresponding oppositely
charged heavier species would account partially or entirely for the Dark Matter
in the Universe.
