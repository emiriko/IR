Probabilties of formation of various hydrogenic species during the exothermic
nuclear $(n,{}^3$He$;t,p)-$reaction of atomic helium-3 with slow neutrons are
determined. In particular, we have found that the probability to form the
tritium atom ${}^3$H in its ground state is $\approx$ 55.19287 %, while
analogous probability to form the protium atom ${}^1$H is $\approx$ 1.02363 %.
Analogous probabilities of formation of the negatively charged hydrogen ions,
i.e. the ${}^3$H$^{-}$ and ${}^1$H$^{-}$ ions, in the nuclear $(n,{}^3$He$;
t,p)-$reaction with slow neutrons, are $\approx$ 7.8680 % and $\approx$ 0.06583
%, respectively. We also consider bremsstrahlung from fast fission-type
reactions in atomic systems. The spectrum of emitted radiation is analyzed.
