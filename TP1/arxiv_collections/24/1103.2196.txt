The atomistic simulations of carbon nanotube (CNT) - carbon reinforced
composite material are reported. The studied composite samples were obtained by
impregnating certain amounts of CNTs (3,3) and (6,6) into pristine graphite
matrix. The addition of CNTs is found to be of significant usefulness for
nanotube-reinforced carbon composites since it allows to achieve extreme
lightness and strength. Being impregnated into graphite matrix, nanotubes are
able to increase the critical component of its highly anisotropic Young modulus
by 2-8 times. The linear thermal expansion coefficients do not exceed 1E-5 K-1,
making these composites applicable for aviation and space vehicles. The
dispersion of CNTs within graphite matrix was found to drastically influence
composite properties.
