We derive new space-time uncertainty relations (STUR) at the fundamental
Planck length $L_P$ from quantum mechanics and general relativity (GR), both in
flat and curved backgrounds. Contrary to claims present in the literature, our
approach suggests that no minimal uncertainty appears for lengths, but instead
for minimal space and four-volumes. Moreover, we derive a maximal absolute
value for the energy density. Finally, some considerations on possible
commutators among quantum operators implying our STUR are done.
