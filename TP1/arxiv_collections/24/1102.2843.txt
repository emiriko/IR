We apply Schrodinger-functional techniques to the SU(2) lattice gauge theory
with N_f=2 flavors of fermions in the adjoint representation. Our use of
hypercubic smearing enables us to work at stronger couplings than did previous
studies, before encountering a critical point and a bulk phase boundary.
Measurement of the running coupling constant gives evidence of an infrared
fixed point g* where 1/g*^2 = 0.20(4)(3). At the fixed point, we find a mass
anomalous dimension gamma_m(g*) = 0.31(6).
