Examples exist of extended-real-valued closed functions on ${\bf R}^n$ whose
subdifferentials (in the standard, limiting sense) have large graphs. By
contrast, if such a function is semi-algebraic, then its subdifferential graph
must have everywhere constant local dimension $n$. This result is related to a
celebrated theorem of Minty, and surprisingly may fail for the Clarke
subdifferential.
