We advocate international consultations on societal and technical issues to
address the risk problem, and a moratorium on future METI transmissions until
such issues are resolved. Instead, we recommend continuing to conduct SETI by
listening, with no innate risk, while using powerful new search systems to give
a better total probability of detection of beacons and messages than METI for
the same cost, and with no need for a long obligatory wait for a response.
Realistically, beacons are costly. In light of recent work on the economics of
contact by radio, we offer alternatives to the current standard of SETI
searches. Historical leakage from Earth has been undetectable as messages for
credible receiver systems. Transmissions ('messages') to date are faint and
very unlikely to be detected, even by very nearby stars. Future space microwave
and laser power systems will likely be more visible.
