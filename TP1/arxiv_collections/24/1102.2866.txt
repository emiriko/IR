Consider a one-ended word-hyperbolic group. If it is the fundamental group of
a graph of free groups with cyclic edge groups then either it is the
fundamental group of a surface or it contains a finitely generated one-ended
subgroup of infinite index. As a corollary, the same holds for limit groups. We
also obtain a characterisation of surfaces with boundary among free groups
equipped with peripheral structures.
