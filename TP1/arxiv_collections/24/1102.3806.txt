Recent experimental data on dijet cross sections in diffractive
photoproduction at HERA collider are analysed with an emphasis on QCD
factorisation breaking effects. The possible sources of the contradiction in
conclusions of H1 and ZEUS collaborations such as different hadronisation
corrections and different phase space of both analyses are studied.
