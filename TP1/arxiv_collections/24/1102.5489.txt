We derive a two-parameter formula for the electromagnetic form factors of the
nucleon described as an instanton by "integrating out" all KK modes other than
the lowest mesons from the infinite-tower of vector mesons in holographic QCD
while preserving hidden local symmetry for the resultant vector fields. With
only two parameters, the proton Sachs form factors can be fit surprisingly well
to the available experimental data for momentum transfers $Q^2\lsim 0.5$
GeV$^2$ with $\chi^2$/dof $\lsim 2$. We interpret this agreement as indicating
the importance of an infinite tower in the soliton structure of the nucleon.
The prediction of the Sakai-Sugimoto holographic dual model is checked against
the fit values to assess its accuracy in describing the proton structure. We
find that the structure of the "core" of roughly 1/3 in the proton size
indicated in experiments and commonly associated with an intrinsic quark-gluon
structure in QCD is "hidden" in the infinite tower in the holographic model.
