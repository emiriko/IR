We develop a scenario whereby monopoles in a hidden sector yield a decaying
dark matter candidate of interest for the PAMELA and FERMI $e^\pm$ excesses.
The monopoles are not completely hidden due to a very small kinetic mixing and
a hidden photon mass. The latter also causes the monopoles and anti-monopoles
to be connected by strings. The resulting long-lived objects eventually decay
to hidden photons which tend to escape galactic cores before decaying. The mass
scales are those of the hidden photon ($\approx 500$ MeV), the monopole
($\approx 3$ TeV) and the mixing scale (close to the Planck scale). A gauge
coupling in the hidden sector is the only other parameter. This coupling must
be strong and this results in light point-like monopoles and light thin
strings.
