Kudekar et al. recently proved that for transmission over the binary erasure
channel (BEC), spatial coupling of LDPC codes increases the BP threshold of the
coupled ensemble to the MAP threshold of the underlying LDPC codes. One major
drawback of the capacity-achieving spatially-coupled LDPC codes is that one
needs to increase the column and row weight of parity-check matrices of the
underlying LDPC codes.
  It is proved, that Hsu-Anastasopoulos (HA) codes and MacKay-Neal (MN) codes
achieve the capacity of memoryless binary-input symmetric-output channels under
MAP decoding with bounded column and row weight of the parity-check matrices.
The HA codes and the MN codes are dual codes each other.
  The aim of this paper is to present an empirical evidence that
spatially-coupled MN (resp. HA) codes with bounded column and row weight
achieve the capacity of the BEC. To this end, we introduce a spatial coupling
scheme of MN (resp. HA) codes. By density evolution analysis, we will show that
the resulting spatially-coupled MN (resp. HA) codes have the BP threshold close
to the Shannon limit.
