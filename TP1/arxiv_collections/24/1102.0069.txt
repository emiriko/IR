We show that periodic magnetic nanostructures (magnonic crystals) represent
an ideal system for studying excitations on disordered periodical lattices
because of the possibility of controlled variation of the degree of disorder by
varying the applied magnetic field. Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) data
collected inside minor hysteresis loops for a periodic array of Permalloy
nanowires of alternating width and magnetic force microscopy images of the
array taken after running each of these loops were used to establish convincing
evidence that there is a strong correlation between the type of FMR response
and the degree of disorder of the magnetic ground state. We found two types of
dynamic responses: anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM), which
represent collective spin wave modes or collective magnonic states. Depending
on the history of sample magnetization either AFM or FM state is either the
fundamental FMR mode or represents a state of a magnetic defect on the
artificial crystal. A fundamental state can be transformed into a defect one
and vice versa by controlled magnetization of the sample.
