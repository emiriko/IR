In this paper we present the complete derivation of the effective contour
model for electrical discharges which appears as the asymptotic limit of the
minimal streamer model for the propagation of electric discharges, when the
electron diffusion is small. It consists of two integro-differential equations
defined at the boundary of the plasma region: one for the motion and a second
equation for the net charge density at the interface. We have computed explicit
solutions with cylindrical symmetry and found the dispersion relation for small
symmetry-breaking perturbations in the case of finite resistivity. We implement
a numerical procedure to solve our model in general situations. As a result we
compute the dispersion relation for the cylindrical case and compare it with
the analytical predictions. Comparisons with experimental data for a 2-D
positive streamers discharge are provided and predictions confirmed.
