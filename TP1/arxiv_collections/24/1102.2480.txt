In recent years, there has been increasing interest in consecutive pattern
avoidance in permutations. In this paper, we introduce two approaches to
counting permutations that avoid a set of prescribed patterns consecutively.
These algoritms have been implemented in the accompanying Maple package CAV,
which can be downloaded from the author's website. As a byproduct of the first
algorithm, we have a theorem giving a sufficient condition for when two pattern
sets are strongly (consecutively) Wilf-Equivalent. For the implementation of
the second algorithm, we define the cluster tail generating function and show
that it always satisfies a certain functional equation. We also explain how the
CAV package can be used to approximate asymptotic constants for single pattern
avoidance.
