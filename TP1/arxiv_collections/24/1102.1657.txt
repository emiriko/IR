Based on the super-fermion representation of quantum kinetic equations we
develop nonequilibrium, post-Hartree-Fock many-body perturbation theory for the
current through a region of interacting electrons. We apply the theory to out
of equilibrium Anderson model and discuss practical implementation of the
approach. Our calculations show that nonequilibrium electronic correlations may
produce significant quantitative and qualitative corrections to mean-field
electronic transport properties. We find that the nonequilibrium leads to
enhancement of electronic correlations.
