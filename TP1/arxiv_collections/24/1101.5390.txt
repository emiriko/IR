We consider one-loop radiative corrections from Lorentz- and CPT- violating
extended QED to address the specific problem of finding explicitly an effective
action describing amplitude of photon triple splitting. We show that it is not
possible to find a nonzero photon triple splitting effective action, at least
by using the derivative expansion method (at zero external momenta), up to
leading order in the Lorentz- and CPT- violating parameter.
