We consider the Berglund-H\"ubsch transpose of a bimodal invertible
polynomial and construct a triangulated category associated to the
compactification of a suitable deformation of the singularity. This is done in
such a way that the corresponding Grothendieck group with the (negative) Euler
form can be described by a graph which corresponds to the Coxeter-Dynkin
diagram with respect to a distinguished basis of vanishing cycles of the
bimodal singularity.
