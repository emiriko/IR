We predict a new state of matter in the triangular t-J model in a high doping
regime. Due to the altered role of quantum statistics the spins are `localized'
in statistical Landau orbits, while the charge carriers form a Bose metal that
feels the spins through random gauge fields. In contrast to the Fermi-liquid
state, this state naturally exhibits a Curie-Weiss susceptibility, large
thermopower, and linear-temperature resistivity, explaining the physics of
\textrm{Na}$_{x}$\textrm{CoO}$_{2}$ at $x>0.5.$ A `smoking gun' prediction for
neutron scattering is presented.
