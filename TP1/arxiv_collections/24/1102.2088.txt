We suggest that the mass of four compact stars SAX J1808.4$-$3658, KS
1731$-$260, SAX J1750.8$-$2900 and IGR J17191$-$2821 can be determined from the
difference in the observed kiloHertz quasi periodic oscillations (kHz QPO-s) of
these stars. The stellar radius is very close to the marginally stable orbit
$R_{ms}$ as predicted by Einstein's general relativity. It may be noted that
the first of these stars was suggested to be a strange star more than a decade
back by Li \emph{et al.} (1999) from the unique millisecond X-ray pulsations
with an accurate determination of its rotation period. It showed kHz QPO-s
eight years back and so far it is the only set that has been observed. This is
the first time we give an estimate of the mass of the star and of three other
compact stars in Low-Mass X-ray Binaries using their observed kHz QPO-s.
