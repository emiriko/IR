Collaborative tagging has emerged as a popular and effective method for
organizing and describing pages on the Web. We present Treelicious, a system
that allows hierarchical navigation of tagged web pages. Our system enriches
the navigational capabilities of standard tagging systems, which typically
exploit only popularity and co-occurrence data. We describe a prototype that
leverages the Wikipedia category structure to allow a user to semantically
navigate pages from the Delicious social bookmarking service. In our system a
user can perform an ordinary keyword search and browse relevant pages but is
also given the ability to broaden the search to more general topics and narrow
it to more specific topics. We show that Treelicious indeed provides an
intuitive framework that allows for improved and effective discovery of
knowledge.
