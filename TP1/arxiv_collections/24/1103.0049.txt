Frustrated magnetic systems exhibit highly degenerate ground states and
strong fluctuations, often leading to new physics. An intriguing example of
current interest is the antiferromagnet on a diamond lattice, realized
physically in A-site spinel materials. This is a prototypical system in three
dimensions where frustration arises from competing interactions rather than
purely geometric constraints, and theory suggests the possibility of unusual
magnetic order at low temperature. Here we present a comprehensive
single-crystal neutron scattering study of CoAl2O4, a highly frustrated A-site
spinel. We observe strong diffuse scattering that peaks at wavevectors
associated with Neel ordering. Below the temperature T*=6.5 K, there is a
dramatic change in the elastic scattering lineshape accompanied by the
emergence of well-defined spin-wave excitations. T* had previously been
associated with the onset of glassy behavior. Our new results suggest instead
that T* signifies a first-order phase transition, but with true long-range
order inhibited by the kinetic freezing of domain walls. This scenario might be
expected to occur widely in frustrated systems containing first-order phase
transitions and is a natural explanation for existing reports of anomalous
glassy behavior in other materials.
