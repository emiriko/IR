We perform comprehensive theoretical analysis of high magnetic field behavior
of the heavy-fermion (HF) compound YbRh2Si2. At low magnetic fields B, YbRh2Si2
has a quantum critical point related to the suppression of antiferromagnetic
ordering at a critical magnetic field. Our calculations of the thermodynamic
properties of YbRh2Si2 in wide magnetic field range allow us to straddle a
possible metamagnetic transition region and probe the properties of both
low-field HF liquid and high-field fully polarized one. Namely, high magnetic
fields B\sim B^*\sim 10 T fully polarize corresponding quasiparticle band
generating Landau Fermi liquid (LFL) state and suppressing HF (actually NFL)
one, while at elevating temperatures both HF state and corresponding NFL
properties are restored. Our calculations are in good agreement with
experimental facts and show that the fermion condensation quantum phase
transition is indeed responsible for the observed NFL behavior and
quasiparticles survive both high temperatures and high magnetic fields.
