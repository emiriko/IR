We present 13 years of pulsation timing measurements of the DBV white dwarf
EC 2005-5234. Each of the four O-C diagrams mimic the sinusoidal behavior
typically attributed to a planet + WD system. However, the amplitude and phase
of the O-C variations are inconsistent with each other. We discuss the impact
of this result on timing based WD planet searches.
