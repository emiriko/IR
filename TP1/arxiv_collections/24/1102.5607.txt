We perform a theoretical investigation on the thermal conductivity of
single-walled boron nitride nanotubes (SWBNT) using the kinetic theory. By
fitting to the phonon spectrum of boron nitride sheet, we develop an efficient
and stable Tersoff-derived interatomic potential which is suitable for the
study of heat transport in sp2 structures. We work out the selection rules for
the three-phonon process with the help of the helical quantum numbers $(\kappa,
n)$ attributed to the symmetry group (line group) of the SWBNT. Our calculation
shows that the thermal conductivity $\kappa_{\rm ph}$ diverges with length as
$\kappa_{\rm ph}\propto L^{\beta}$ with exponentially decaying $\beta(T)\propto
e^{-T/T_{c}}$, which results from the competition between boundary scattering
and three-phonon scattering for flexure modes. We find that the two flexure
modes of the SWBNT make dominant contribution to the thermal conductivity,
because their zero frequency locates at $\kappa=\pm\alpha$ where $\alpha$ is
the rotational angle of the screw symmetry in SWBNT.
