In this paper we develop a new statistical model for the irradiance
fluctuations of an unbounded optical wavefront (plane and spherical waves)
propagating through a turbulent medium under all irradiance fluctuation
conditions in homogeneous, isotropic turbulence. The major advantage of the
model is that leads to closed-form and mathematically-tractable expressions for
the fundamental channel statistics of an unbounded optical wavefront under all
turbulent regimes. Furthermore, it unifies most of the proposed statistical
models for the irradiance fluctuations derived in the bibliography providing,
in addition, an excellent agreement with the experimental data.
