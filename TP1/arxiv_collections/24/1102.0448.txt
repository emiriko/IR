The draft sequence of the human genome became available almost a decade ago
but the encoded proteome is not being explored to its fullest. Our bibliometric
analysis of several large protein families, including those known to be
"druggable", reveals that, even today, most papers focus on proteins that were
known prior to 2000. It is evident that one or more aspects of the biomedical
research system severely limits the exploration of the proteins in the 'dark
matter' of the proteome, despite unbiased genetic approaches that have pointed
to their functional relevance. It is perhaps not surprising that relatively few
genome-derived targets have led to approved drugs.
