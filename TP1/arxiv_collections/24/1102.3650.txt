We show that dielectric spheres can be cloaked by a shell of amorphously
arranged metallic nanoparticles. The shell represents an artificial medium with
tunable effective properties that can be adjusted such that the scattered
signals of shell and sphere almost cancel each other. We provide an analytical
model for the cloak design and prove numerically that the cloak operates as
desired. We show that more than 70% of the scattered signal of the sphere can
be suppressed at the design wavelength. Advantages and disadvantages of such a
cloak when compared to other implementations are disclosed.
