Directional detection of non-baryonic Dark Matter is a promising search
strategy for discriminating WIMP events from background. However, this strategy
requires both a precise measurement of the energy down to a few keV and 3D
reconstruction of tracks down to a few mm. To achieve this goal, the MIMAC
project has been developed. It is based on a gaseous micro-TPC matrix, filled
with CF4 and CHF3. The first results on low energy nuclear recoils (H, F)
obtained with a low mono-energetic neutron field are presented. The discovery
potential of this search strategy is discussed and illustrated by a realistic
case accessible to MIMAC.
