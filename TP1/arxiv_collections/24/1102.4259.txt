A heavy-mass electron state is realized in a doped valence bond solid
(Ti1-xVx)2O3. In this system, itinerant holes mediate the mainly ferromagnetic
RKKY interaction between the localized magnetic moments and become readily
spin-polarized under a magnetic field, while showing large negative
magnetoresistance. In spite of the ferromagnetic interaction among the
carriers, their effective mass is found to be 1 or 2 orders of magnitude larger
than that of usual doped semiconductors. Such strong mass renormalization is
ascribable to the polaron formation on the Ti-dimer, where the spin-singlet
state is originally formed. Doping dependence of the electronic specific-heat
coefficient implies that the dimeric lattice fluctuation or softening is
responsible for the enhanced electron-phonon interaction.
