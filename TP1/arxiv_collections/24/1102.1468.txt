Physics of chaos in a localized phase-space region is exploited to produce a
longitudinally uniformly distributed beam. Theoretical study and %numerical
simulations are used to study its origin and applicability in phase-space
dilution of beam bunch. Through phase modulation to a double-rf system, a
central region of localized chaos bounded by invariant tori are generated by
overlapping parametric resonances. Condition and stability of the chaos will be
analyzed. Applications include high-power beam, beam distribution
uniformization, and industrial beam irradiation.
