Second harmonic generation in negative index metamaterials is considered.
Theoretical analysis of the corresponding model demonstrated significant
difference of this phenomenon in conventional and negative index materials. In
contrast to conceptional materials there is nonzero critical phase mismatch.
The behavior of interacting weaves is dramatically different when phase
mismatch is smaller or greater than critical value.
