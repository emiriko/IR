Quantum spin liquids are phases of matter whose internal structure is not
captured by a local order parameter. Particularly intriguing are critical spin
liquids, where strongly interacting excitations control low energy properties.
Here we calculate their bipartite entanglement entropy that characterize their
quantum structure. In particular we calculate the Renyi entropy $S_2$, on model
wavefunctions obtained by Gutzwiller projection of a Fermi sea. Although the
wavefunctions are not sign positive, $S_2$ can be calculated on relatively
large systems (>324 spins), using the variational Monte Carlo technique. On the
triangular lattice we find that entanglement entropy of the projected Fermi-sea
state violates the boundary law, with $S_2$ enhanced by a logarithmic factor.
This is an unusual result for a bosonic wave-function reflecting the presence
of emergent fermions. These techniques can be extended to study a wide class of
other phases.
