We present the current status of hybrid approaches to describe heavy ion
collisions and their future challenges and perspectives. First we present a
hybrid model combining a Boltzmann transport model of hadronic degrees of
freedom in the initial and final state with an optional hydrodynamic evolution
during the dense and hot phase. Second, we present a recent extension of the
hydrodynamical model to include fluctuations near the phase transition by
coupling a chiral field to the hydrodynamic evolution.
