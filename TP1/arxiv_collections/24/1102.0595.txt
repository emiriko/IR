General symmetry arguments, dating back to de Gennes dictate that at scales
longer than the pitch, the low-energy elasticity of a chiral nematic liquid
crystal (cholesteric) and of a Dzyaloshinskii-Morya (DM) spiral state in a
helimagnet with negligible crystal symmetry fields (e.g., MnSi, FeGe) is
identical to that of a smectic liquid crystal, thereby inheriting its rich
phenomenology. Starting with a chiral Frank free-energy (exchange and DM
interactions of a helimagnet) we present a transparent derivation of the fully
nonlinear Goldstone mode elasticity, which involves an analog of the
Anderson-Higgs mechanism that locks the spiral orthonormal (director/magnetic
moment) frame to the cholesteric (helical) layers. This shows explicitly the
reduction of three orientational modes of a cholesteric down to a single phonon
Goldstone mode that emerges on scales longer than the pitch. At a harmonic
level our result reduces to that derived many years ago by Lubensky and
collaborators.
