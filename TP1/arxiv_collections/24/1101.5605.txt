The single and central diffractive production of the Standard Model Higgs
boson is computed using the diffractive factorization formalism, taking into
account a parametrization for the Pomeron structure function provided by the H1
Collaboration. We compute the cross sections at NLO accuracy for the gluon
fusion process, since it is the leading mechanism for the Higgs boson
production. The gap survival probability is also introduced to include the
rescattering corrections due to spectator particles present in the interaction.
The diffractive ratios are predicted for proton-proton collisions at the LHC,
since the beam luminosity is favorable to the Higgs boson detection. These
results provide updated estimations for the fraction of single and central
diffractive events in the LHC kinematical regime.
