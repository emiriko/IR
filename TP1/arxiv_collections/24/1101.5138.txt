The aim of Tau subgroup of the HFAG is to provide average values of the mass
and branching fractions of the tau lepton. Using the branching fractions, we
present tests of charged current lepton universality and obtain estimates for
|Vus|. We also summarize the status of searches for lepton flavor violating
decays of the tau lepton.
