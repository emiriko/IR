Influence of disorder on the temperature of superconducting transition (T_c)
is studied within the sigma-model renormalization group framework.
Electron-electron interaction in particle-hole and Cooper channels is taken
into account and assumed to be short-range. Two-dimensional systems in the weak
localization and antilocalization regime, as well as systems near mobility edge
are considered. It is shown that in all these regimes the Anderson localization
leads to strong enhancement of T_c related to the multifractal character of
wave functions.
