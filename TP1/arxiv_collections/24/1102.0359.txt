A general theory for the existence of solitary wave and double layer at M= Mc
has been discussed, where Mc is the lower bound of the Mach number M, i.e.,
solitary wave and/or double layer solutions of the well-known energy integral
start to exist for M> Mc. Ten important theorems have been proved to confirm
the existence of solitary wave and double layer at M = Mc. If
V({\phi})({\equiv}V(M,{\phi})) denotes the Sagdeev potential with {\phi} is the
perturbed field or perturbed dependent variable associated with the specific
problem, V(M,{\phi}) is well defined as a real number for all M {\in}
\mathcal{M} and for all {\phi} {\in} {\Phi}, and V(M,0)=V'(M,0)=V"(Mc,0)=0,
V"'(Mc,0)<0 (V"'(Mc,0)>0), \deltaV/\deltaM < 0 for all M({\in} \mathcal{M}) > 0
and for all {\phi}({\in} {\Phi}) > 0 ({\phi}({\in}{\Phi}) < 0), where "
'{\equiv} \delta/\delta{\phi} ", the main analytical results for the existence
of solitary wave and double layer solution of the energy integral at M= Mc are
as follows. Result-1: If there exists at least one value M0 of M such that the
system supports positive (negative) potential solitary waves for all Mc<M<M0,
then there exist either a positive (negative) potential solitary wave or a
positive (negative) potential double layer at M= Mc. Result-2: If the system
supports only negative (positive) potential solitary waves for M> Mc, then
there does not exist positive (negative) potential solitary wave at M= Mc.
Result-3: It is not possible to have coexistence of both positive and negative
potential solitary structures (including double layers) at M= Mc. Apart from
the conditions of Result-1, the double layer solution at M= Mc is possible only
when there exists a double layer solution in any right neighborhood of Mc.
Finally these analytical results have been applied to a specific problem on
dust acoustic waves in nonthermal plasma in search of new results.
