Tiny neutrino masses can arise naturally via loop diagrams. After a brief
review of the radiative mass generation mechanism, I present a new model
wherein TeV scale leptoquark scalars induce neutrino masses via two--loop
diagrams. This model predicts the neutrino oscillation parameter
\sin^2\theta_{13} to be close to the current experimental limit. The
leptoquarks are accessible to experiments at the LHC since their masses must
lie below 1.5 TeV, and their decay branching ratios probe neutrino oscillation
parameters. Rare lepton flavor violating processes mediated by leptoquarks have
an interesting pattern: mu --> e gamma may be suppressed, while mu --> 3 e and
mu-e conversion in nuclei are within reach of the next generation experiments.
Muon g-2 receives new positive contributions, which can resolve the discrepancy
between theory and experiment. New CP violating contributions to B_s- \B_s-bar
mixing via leptoquark box diagrams are in a range that can explain the recently
reported dimuon anomaly by the D0 collaboration.
