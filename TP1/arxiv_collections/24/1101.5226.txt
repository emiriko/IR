We show two experimental realizations of Hardy ladder test of quantum
nonlocality using energy-time correlated photons, following the scheme proposed
by A. Cabello \emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{102}, 040401 (2009)].
Unlike, previous energy-time Bell experiments, these tests require precise
tailored nonmaximally entangled states. One of them is equivalent to the
two-setting two-outcome Bell test requiring a minimum detection efficiency. The
reported experiments are still affected by the locality and detection
loopholes, but are free of the post-selection loophole of previous energy-time
and time-bin Bell tests.
