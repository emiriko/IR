We study the contribution of antisymmetric tensor unparticle mediation to the
charged lepton electric dipole moments and restrict the free parameters of the
model by using the experimental upper bounds. We observe that the charged
lepton electric dipole moments are strongly sensitive to the the scaling
dimension d_U and the fundamental scales M_U and \Lambda_U. The experimental
current limits of electric dipole moments are reached for the small values of
the scaling dimension d_U.
