We propose an algebraic method for proving estimates on moments of stochastic
integrals. The method uses qualitative properties of roots of algebraic
polynomials from certain general classes. As an application, we give a new
proof of a variation of the Burkholder-Davis-Gundy inequality for the case of
stochastic integrals with respect to real locally square integrable
martingales. Further possible applications and extensions of the method are
outlined.
