The 'Internal Linear Combination' (ILC) component separation method has been
extensively used to extract a single component, the CMB, from the WMAP
multifrequency data. We generalise the ILC approach for separating other
millimetre astrophysical emissions. We construct in particular a
multidimensional ILC filter, which can be used, for instance, to estimate the
diffuse emission of a complex component originating from multiple correlated
emissions, such as the total emission of the Galactic interstellar medium. The
performance of such generalised ILC methods, implemented on a needlet frame, is
tested on simulations of Planck mission observations, for which we successfully
reconstruct a low noise estimate of emission from astrophysical foregrounds
with vanishing CMB and SZ contamination.
