The parton and hadron cascade model PACIAE based on PYTHIA was utilized to
systematically investigate the strange particle production in pp collisions at
the RHIC and LHC energies. Taking the mechanism of reduction of the strange
quark suppression into account the STAR and ALICE data of strange particle
production in pp collisions are well reproduced. It turned out that the K/{\pi}
ratio as a function of reaction energy in pp collisions shows slightly
increasing from sqrt(s)=0.2 to 0.9 TeV and then turning to saturation.
