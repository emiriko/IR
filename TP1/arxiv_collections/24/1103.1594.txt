Detailed properties of resonance fluorescence from a single quantum dot in a
micropillar cavity are investigated, with particular focus on emission
coherence in dependence on optical driving field power and detuning.
Power-dependent series over a wide range could trace characteristic Mollow
triplet spectra with large Rabi splittings of $|\Omega| \leq 15$ GHz. In
particular, the effect of dephasing in terms of systematic spectral broadening
$\propto \Omega^2$ of the Mollow sidebands is observed as a strong fingerprint
of excitation-induced dephasing. Our results are in excellent agreement with
predictions of a recently presented model on phonon-dressed QD Mollow triplet
emission in the cavity-QED regime.
