The paper studies the concepts of hedging and arbitrage in a non
probabilistic framework. It provides conditions for non probabilistic arbitrage
based on the topological structure of the trajectory space and makes
connections with the usual notion of arbitrage. Several examples illustrate the
non probabilistic arbitrage as well perfect replication of options under
continuous and discontinuous trajectories, the results can then be applied in
probabilistic models path by path. The approach is related to recent financial
models that go beyond semimartingales, we remark on some of these connections
and provide applications of our results to some of these models.
