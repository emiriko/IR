The electric dipole moments (EDMs) of neutron-odd nuclei with even protons
are systematically evaluated. We first derive the relation between the EDM and
the magnetic moment operators by making use of the core polarization scheme.
This relation enables us to calculate the EDM of neutron-odd nuclei without any
free parameters. From this calculation, one may find the best atomic system
suitable for future EDM experiments.
