We introduce a general scheme for sequential one-way quantum computation
where static systems with long-living quantum coherence (memories) interact
with moving systems that may possess very short coherence times. Both the
generation of the cluster state needed for the computation and its consumption
by measurements are carried out simultaneously. As a consequence, effective
clusters of one spatial dimension fewer than in the standard approach are
sufficient for computation. In particular, universal computation requires only
a one-dimensional array of memories. The scheme applies to discrete-variable
systems of any dimension as well as to continuous-variable ones, and both are
treated equivalently under the light of local complementation of graphs. In
this way our formalism introduces a general framework that encompasses and
generalizes in a unified manner some previous system-dependent proposals. The
procedure is intrinsically well-suited for implementations with atom-photon
interfaces.
