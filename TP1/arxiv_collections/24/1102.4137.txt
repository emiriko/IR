In this paper, we propose to implement the dynamic decode-and-forward (DDF)
protocol with distributed rotations. In addition to being the first
minimum-delay implementation of the DDF protocol proposed for any number of
relays, this technique allows to exploit cooperative diversity without inducing
the high decoding complexity of a space-time code. The analysis of outage
probabilities for different number of relays and rotations shows that the
performance of this technique is close to optimal. Moreover, a lower-bound on
the diversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff (DMT) is provided in the case of a
single relay and two rotations. This lower-bound reaches the optimal DDF's DMT
when the frame-length grows to infinity, which shows that even a small number
of rotations is enough to obtain good performance.
