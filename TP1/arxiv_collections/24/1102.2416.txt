The single graphene layer is a novel material consisting of a flat monolayer
of carbon atoms packed in a two-dimensional honeycomb-lattice, in which the
electron dynamics is governed by the Dirac equation. A pseudo-spin phase-space
approach based on the Wigner-Weyl formalism is used to describe the transport
of electrons in graphene including quantum effects. Our full-quantum mechanical
representation of the particles reveals itself to be particularly close to the
classical description of the particle motion. We analyze the Klein tunneling
and the correction to the total current in graphene induced by this phenomenon.
The equations of motion are analytically investigated and some numerical tests
are presented. The temporal evolution of the electron-hole pairs in the
presence of an external electric field and a rigid potential step is
investigated. The connection of our formalism with the Barry-phase approach is
also discussed.
