We report from first-principles-based atomistic simulations that
ferroelectricity can be sustained in PbTiO3 nanoparticles of only a few lattice
constants in size as a result of a toroidal ordering. We found that
size-induced topological transformations lead to the stabilization of a
ferroelectric bubble by the alignment of vortex cores along a closed path.
These transformations, which are driven by the aspect ratio of the
nanostructure, change the topology of the polarization field, producing a rich
variety of polar configurations. For sufficiently flat nanostructures, a
multi-bubble state bridges the gap between 0D nanodots and 2D ultra-thin films.
The thermal properties of the ferroelectric bubbles indicate that this state is
suitable for the development of nanometric devices.
