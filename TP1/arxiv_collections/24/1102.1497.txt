The belief propagation (BP) based algorithm is investigated as a potential
decoder for both of error correcting codes and lossy compression, which are
based on non-monotonic tree-like multilayer perceptron encoders. We discuss
that whether the BP can give practical algorithms or not in these schemes. The
BP implementations in those kind of fully connected networks unfortunately
shows strong limitation, while the theoretical results seems a bit promising.
Instead, it reveals it might have a rich and complex structure of the solution
space via the BP-based algorithms.
