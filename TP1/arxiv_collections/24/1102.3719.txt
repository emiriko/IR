The compression of a low-density copper foam was simulated with a radiation,
hydrodynamics code. In one simulation, the foam had a density of $\rho_0 =
1.3407$ g/cm$^3$, 15% the density of copper at standard temperature and
pressure, and was composed of a tangle of standard density cylindrical copper
filaments with a diameter of $4.0\times10^{-7}$ cm. In another simulation, the
foam was a uniform material at the same density. The propagation velocity of
the shock wave ($U_f$) through the foam was measured and compared with
experimental results. The simulations show approximately the same agreement
with experimental results for $U_f$ and agreed with estimates from different
equations of state and simulations using molecular dynamics. Behavior of the
foam ahead of the shock wave is also discussed where the porous nature of the
foam allows for the formation of a vapor precursor.
