A large amount of data resulting from trajectories of moving objects
activities are collected thanks to localization based services and some
associated automated processes. Trajectories data can be used either for
transactional and analysis purposes in various domains (heath care, commerce,
environment, etc.). For this reason, modeling trajectory data at the conceptual
level is an important stair leading to global vision and successful
implementations. However, current modeling tools fail to fulfill specific
moving objects activities requirements. In this paper, we propose a new profile
based on UML in order to enhance the conceptual modeling of trajectory data
related to mobile objects by new stereotypes and icons. As illustration, we
present a mobile hospital use case.
