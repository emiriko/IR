Precursors can serve as a bound on the speed of information with dispersive
medium. We propose a method to identify the speed of optical precursors using
polarization-based interference in a solid-state device, which can bound the
accuracy of the precursors' speed to less than $10^{-4}$ with conventional
experimental conditions. Our proposal may have important implications for
optical communications and fast information processing.
