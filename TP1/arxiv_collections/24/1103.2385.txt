The time of occurrence of the large EQ that occurred recently in Japan (March
11th, 2011, Mw = 8.9) is compared to the time of peak amplitude occurrence of
the M1 and K1 tidal components. It is shown that the specific EQ occurred on
the peak of the M1 tidal component, and deviates for only 45 minutes from the
corresponding K1 tidal peak. Therefore, the specific seismic event complies
quite well with the earlier proposed physical mechanism (lithospheric
oscillation) that causes triggering of large EQs.
