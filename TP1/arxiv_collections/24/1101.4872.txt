The distribution of masses for neutron stars is analyzed using the Bayesian
statistical inference, evaluating the likelihood of proposed gaussian peaks by
using fifty-four measured points obtained in a variety of systems. The results
strongly suggest the existence of a bimodal distribution of the masses, with
the first peak around $1.37 {M_{\odot}}$, and a much wider second peak at $1.73
{M_{\odot}}$. The results support earlier views related to the different
evolutionary histories of the members for the first two peaks, which produces a
natural separation (even if no attempt to "label" the systems has been made
here), and argues against the single-mass scale viewpoint. The bimodal
distribution can also accommodate the recent findings of $\sim M_{\odot}$
masses quite naturally. Finally, we explore the existence of a subgroup around
$1.25 {M_{\odot}}$, finding weak, if any, evidence for it. This recently
claimed low-mass subgroup, possibly related to $O-Mg-Ne$ core collapse events,
has a monotonically decreasing likelihood and does not stand out clearly from
the rest of the sample.
