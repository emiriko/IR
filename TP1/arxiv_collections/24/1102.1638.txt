The effects of both density stratification and magnetic field expansion on
torsional Alfven waves in magnetic flux tubes are studied. The frequencies, the
period ratio P1/P2 of the fundamental and its first-overtone, and
eigenfunctions of torsional Alfven modes are obtained. Our numerical results
show that the density stratification and magnetic field expansion have opposite
effects on the oscillating properties of torsional Alfven waves.
