The Peter principle has been recently investigated by means of an agent-based
simulation and its validity has been numerically corroborated. It has been
confirmed that, within certain conditions, it can really influence in a
negative way the efficiency of a pyramidal organization adopting meritocratic
promotions. It was also found that, in order to bypass these effects,
alternative promotion strategies should be adopted, as for example a random
selection choice. In this paper, within the same line of research, we study
promotion strategies in a more realistic hierarchical and modular organization
and we show the robustness of our previous results, extending their validity to
a more general context. We discuss also why the adoption of these strategies
could be useful for real organizations.
