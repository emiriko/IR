In this paper we consider the classical capacities of quantum-classical
channels corresponding to measurement of observables. Special attention is paid
to the case of continuous observables. We give the formulas for unassisted and
entanglement-assisted classical capacities $C,C_{ea}$ and consider some
explicitly solvable cases which give simple examples of entanglement-breaking
channels with $C<C_{ea}.$ We also elaborate on the ensemble-observable duality
to show that $C_{ea}$ for the measurement channel is related to the
$\chi$-quantity for the dual ensemble in the same way as $C$ is related to the
accessible information. This provides both accessible information and the
$\chi$-quantity for the quantum ensembles dual to our examples.
