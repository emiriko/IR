EuC$_2$ is a ferromagnet with a Curie-temperature of $T_C \simeq 15\,$K. It
is semiconducting with the particularity that the resistivity drops by about 5
orders of magnitude on cooling through $T_C$, which is therefore called a
metal-insulator transition. In this paper we study the magnetization, specific
heat, thermal expansion, and the resistivity around this ferromagnetic
transition on high-quality EuC$_2$ samples. At $T_C$ we observe well defined
anomalies in the specific heat $c_p(T)$ and thermal expansion $\alpha(T)$ data.
The magnetic contributions of $c_p(T)$ and $\alpha(T)$ can satisfactorily be
described within a mean-field theory, taking into account the magnetization
data. In zero magnetic field the magnetic contributions of the specific heat
and thermal expansion fulfill a Gr\"uneisen-scaling, which is not preserved in
finite fields. From an estimation of the pressure dependence of $T_C$ via
Ehrenfest's relation, we expect a considerable increase of $T_C$ under applied
pressure due to a strong spin-lattice coupling. Furthermore the influence of
weak off stoichiometries $\delta$ in EuC$_{2 \pm \delta}$ was studied. It is
found that $\delta$ strongly affects the resistivity, but hardly changes the
transition temperature. In all these aspects, the behavior of EuC$_2$ strongly
resembles that of EuO.
