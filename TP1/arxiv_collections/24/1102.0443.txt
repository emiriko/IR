Cosmology, as a science, started at the beginning of the last century with
the advent of the Einstein cosmological equations. Based on these equations,
the present main stream cosmological model is the well known big-bang, this
name unwillingly coined by Fred Hoyle many years ago. Relatively recent
additions to this model have been inflation, dark matter and dark energy. We
present a smoothly behaved new cosmological model that mainly takes into
account the dark part of the Universe. We consider it as the background frame,
the substrate, of what we see. The inclusion of the holographic principle
clarifies the entropy problem that we also apply to the human brain. We take it
as an engineering information center. Finally, the inclusion of the quantum
vacuum in this scene creates an important challenge, an opportunity for future
research in the knowledge of the Universe.
