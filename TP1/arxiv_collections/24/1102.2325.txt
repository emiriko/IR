We develop a unified model of hadrons and quarks. Within this approach we
investigate the phase structure of the model as function of temperature and
chemical potential. Computing the equation of state of cold matter we determine
neutron and hybrid star masses and radii. In an extension of the investigation
we consider the cooling behavior of the compact stars and derive a general
relation between the star's mass and rotation and its cooling behavior. Finally
we study the effect of Delta resonances for star matter, especially with
respect to possible solutions of stars with small radii.
