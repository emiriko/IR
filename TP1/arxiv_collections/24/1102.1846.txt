It is numerically demonstrated by means of a magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) code
that precession can trigger the dynamo effect in a cylindrical container. This
result adds credit to the hypothesis that precession can be strong enough to be
one of the sources of the dynamo action in some astrophysical bodies.
