Static distributions of temperature and wind velocity at the transition
region are calculated within the framework of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) of
completely ionized hydrogen plasma. The numerical solution of the derived
equations gives the width of the transition layer between the chromosphere and
the corona as a self-induced opacity of high-frequency Alfven waves (AW). The
domain wall is direct consequence of the self-consistent MHD treatment of AW
propagation. The low-frequency MHD waves coming from the Sun are strongly
reflected by the narrow transition layer, while the high-frequency waves are
absorbed - that is why we predict considerable spectral density of the AW in
the photosphere. The numerical method allows consideration of incoming AW with
arbitrary spectral density. The idea that Alfven waves might heat the solar
corona belongs to Alfven, we simply solved the corresponding MHD equations. The
comparison of the solution to the experiment is crucial for revealing the
heating mechanism.
