By means of the first-principles calculations, we have studied in details the
structural, elastic and electronic properties of the new tetragonal
CaBe2Ge2-type 5.2K superconductor SrPt2As2 in comparison with two hypothetical
SrPt2As2 polymorphs with ThCr2Si2-type structures which differ by atomic
configurations of [Pt2As2] (or [Pt2As2]) blocks. We have found that
CaBe2Ge2-type SrPt2As2 is a quite unique system with complicated 2D-3D
character of near-Fermi bands, and the "intermediate" type of the Fermi
surface, which consists of electronic pockets having cylinder-like (2D)
topology (typical for 122 FeAs phases) together with 3D-like electronic and
hole pockets, which are characteristic for ThCr2Si2-like iron-free low-Tc
superconductors. Our analysis reveals that against ThCr2Si2-like 122 phases,
the other features for CaBe2Ge2-like SrPt2As2 are: (1). The essential
differences of contributions of states from [Pt2As2] and [Pt2As2] blocks into
near-Fermi region when the conduction is expected to be anisotropic and
happening mainly in [Pt2As2] blocks; (2). The formation of the 3D system of
strong covalent Pt-As bonds (inside and between of [Pt2As2]/[As2Pt2] blocks)
which is responsible for enhanced stability of this polymorph, and (3). the
essential charge anisotropy between the adjacent [Pt2As2] and [As2Pt2] blocks.
We have predicted also that CaBe2Ge2-like SrPt2As2 is mechanically stable,
relatively soft material with high compressibility and will behave in a ductile
manner. On the contrary the ThCr2Si2-type SrPt2As2 polymorphs which contain
only [Pt2As2] or [As2Pt2] blocks, are less stable, their Fermi surfaces adopt a
multi-sheet three-dimensional type - similar to ThCr2Si2-like iron-free 122
phases, and these polymorphs will be ductile materials with high elastic
anisotropy.
