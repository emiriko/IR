In the GmSUGRA scenario with the high-dimensional operators containing the
GUT Higgs fields, we systematically studied the supersymmetry breaking scalar
masses, SM fermion Yukawa coupling terms, and trilinear soft terms in the E_6
SUSY GUT model where the gauge symmetry is broken down to the SO(10)\tm U(1)
gauge symmetry, SU(3)_C\times SU(3)_L \times SU(3)_R gauge symmetry,
SU(6)\times SU(2)_a (a={\rm L,R,X}) gauge symmetry, flipped SU(5) gauge
symmetry etc. In addition, we considered the scalar and gaugino mass relations,
which can be preserved from the GUT scale to the electroweak scale under
one-loop RGE running, in the SU(3)_C\times SU(3)_L \times SU(3)_R model arising
from the E_6 model. With such relations, we may distinguish the mSUGRA and
GmSUGRA scenarios if we can measure the supersymmetric particle spectrum at the
LHC and ILC.
