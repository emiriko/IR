In this paper, a two-user discrete memoryless multiple-access channel
(DM-MAC) with correlated channel states, each known at one of the encoders is
considered, in which each encoder transmits independent messages and tries to
cooperate with the other one. To consider cooperating encoders, it is assumed
that each encoder strictly-causally receives and learns the other encoder's
transmitted symbols and tries to cooperate with the other encoder by
transmitting its message. Next, we study this channel in a special case; we
assume that the common part of both states is known at both, hence encoders use
this opportunity to get better rate region. For these scenarios, an achievable
rate region is derived based on a combination of block-Markov encoding and
Gel'fand-Pinsker coding techniques. Furthermore, the achievable rate region is
established for the Gaussian channel, and it is shown that the capacity region
is achieved in certain circumstances.
