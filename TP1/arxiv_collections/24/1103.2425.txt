The co-tunneling current through a two-level doubly occupied quantum dot
weakly coupled to ferromagnetic leads is calculated in the Coulomb blockade
regime. It is shown that the dependence of the differrential conductance on
applied voltage has a stair-case structure with different sets of "stairs" for
parallel and anti-parallel configurations of magnetization of the leads.
Contributions to the current from elastic and inelastic processes are
considered distinctly. It is observed that the interference part of the
co-tunneling current involves terms corresponding to inelastic processes.
Dependence of the co-tunneling current on the phases of the tunneling
amplitudes is studied.
