In this paper, we obtain infinitely many non-trivial identities and
inequalities between full rank differences for 2-marked Durfee symbols, a
generalization of partitions introduced by Andrews. A certain strict
inequality, which almost always holds, shows that identities for Dyson's rank,
similar to those proven by Atkin and Swinnerton-Dyer, are quite rare. By
showing an analogous strict inequality, we show that such non-trivial
identities are also rare for the full rank, but on the other hand we obtain an
infinite family of non-trivial identities, contrasting the partition theoretic
case.
