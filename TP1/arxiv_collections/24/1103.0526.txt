Using echelle spectroscopy, obtained at Las Campanas Observatory, we present
a detailed study of the internal kinematics of the nebular material in multiple
knots of the blue compact dwarf galaxy Haro 15. A detailed analysis of the
complex emission line profiles show the presence of an underlying broad
component in almost all knots, and the brightest star-forming region shows
unmistakable signs for the presence of two distinct narrow kinematical
components. We also study the information that our analysis provides regarding
the motion of the individual knots in the Haro 15 galaxy potential, confirming
that they follow galactic rotation. Finally, we examine the relation between
their velocity dispersion and luminosity, finding that almost all knots follow
the relation for virialised systems. This holds for the strong narrow
components identified in complex fits and for single profile fits, although the
latter show a flatter slope. In agreement with previous findings, in this paper
we show that the existence of multiple kinematical components among massive
starbursts cannot be overlooked, as it has a noticeable effect on any
subsequent analysis that relies on basic parameters.
