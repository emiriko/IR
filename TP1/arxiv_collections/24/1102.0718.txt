We introduce noncommutative phase spaces by minimal couplings (usual one,
dual one and their mixing). We then realize some of them as coadjoint orbits of
the anisotropic Newton-Hooke groups in two- and three-dimensional spaces.
Through these constructions the positions and the momenta of the phase spaces
do not commute due to the presence of a magnetic field and a dual magnetic
field.
