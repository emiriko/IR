The characters of the angular distributions of quark jets and gluon jets with
different flavors are carefully studied after introducing the cone angle of
jets. The quark jets and gluon jets are identified from the 3-jet events which
are produced by Monte Carlo simulation Jetset7.4 in e+e- collisions at $\sqrt
s$=91.2GeV. It turns out that the ranges of angular distributions of gluon jets
are obviously wider than that of quark jets at the same energies. The average
cone angles of gluon jets are much larger than that of quark jets. As the
multiplicity or the transverse momentum increases, the cone-angle distribution
without momentum weight of both the quark jet and gluon jet all increases, i.e
the positive linear correlation are present, but the cone-angle distribution
with momentum weight decreases at first, then increases when n > 4 or p_t > 2
GeV. The characters of cone angular distributions of gluon jets produced by
quarks with different flavors are the same, while there are obvious differences
for that of the quark jets with different flavors.
