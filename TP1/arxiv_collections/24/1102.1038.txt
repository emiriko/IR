We study the evolution of cooperation in populations where individuals play
prisoner's dilemma on a network. Every node of the network corresponds on an
individual choosing whether to cooperate or defect in a repeated game. The
players revise their actions by imitating those neighbors who have higher
payoffs. We show that when the interactions take place on graphs with large
girth, cooperation is more likely to emerge. On the flip side, in graphs with
many cycles of length 3 and 4, defection spreads more rapidly. One of the key
ideas of our analysis is that our dynamics can be seen as a perturbation of the
voter model. We write the transition kernel of the corresponding Markov chain
in terms of the pairwise correlations in the voter model. We analyze the
pairwise correlation and show that in graphs with relatively large girth,
cooperators cluster and help each other.
