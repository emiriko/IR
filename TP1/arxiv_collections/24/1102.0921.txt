Taking the examples of Legendre and Hermite orthogonal polynomials, we show
how to interpret the fact that these orthogonal polynomials are moments of
other orthogonal polynomials in terms of their associated Riordan arrays. We
use these means to calculate the Hankel transforms of the associated polynomial
sequences.
