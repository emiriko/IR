We study an optimal investment problem under contagion risk in a financial
model subject to multiple jumps and defaults. The global market information is
formulated as a progressive enlargement of a default-free Brownian filtration,
and the dependence of default times is modeled by a conditional density
hypothesis. In this Ito-jump process model, we give a decomposition of the
corresponding stochastic control problem into stochastic control problems in
the default-free filtration, which are determined in a backward induction. The
dynamic programming method leads to a backward recursive system of quadratic
backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) in Brownian filtration, and
our main result proves, under fairly general conditions, the existence and
uniqueness of a solution to this system, which characterizes explicitly the
value function and optimal strategies to the optimal investment problem. We
illustrate our solutions approach with some numerical tests emphasizing the
impact of default intensities, loss or gain at defaults and correlation between
assets. Beyond the financial problem, our decomposition approach provides a new
perspective for solving quadratic BSDEs with a finite number of jumps.
