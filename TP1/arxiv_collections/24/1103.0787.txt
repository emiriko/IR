We study spectral properties and the dynamics after a quench of
one-dimensional spinless fermions with short-range interactions and long-range
random hopping. We show that a sufficiently fast decay of the hopping term
promotes localization effects at finite temperature, which prevents
thermalization even if the classical motion is chaotic. For slower decays, we
find that thermalization does occur. However, within this model, the latter
regime falls in an unexpected universality class, namely, observables exhibit a
power-law (as opposed to an exponential) approach to their thermal expectation
values.
