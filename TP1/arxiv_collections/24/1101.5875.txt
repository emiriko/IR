This talk gives an overview, aimed at non-experts, of the recent progress on
the studies of technicolor models on the lattice. Phenomenologically successful
technicolor models require walking coupling; thus, an emphasis is put on the
determination of the beta-function of various models. As a case study we
consider SU(2) gauge field theory with two adjoint representation fermions,
so-called minimal walking technicolor theory.
