We consider a real massless scalar field in 1+1 dimensions satisfying
time-dependent Robin boundary condition at a static wall. This condition can
simulate moving reflecting mirrors whose motions are determined by the
time-dependence of the Robin parameter. We show that particles can be created
from vacuum, characterizing in this way a dynamical Casimir effect.
