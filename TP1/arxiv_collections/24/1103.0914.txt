The first calculation of the next-to-leading-order electroweak corrections to
Z-boson + jet hadroproduction including leptonic Z-boson decays is presented,
i.e. to the production of a charged lepton--anti-lepton final state in
association with one hard jet at the LHC and the Tevatron. The Z-boson
resonance is treated consistently using the complex-mass scheme, and all
off-shell effects as well as the contributions of the intermediate photon are
taken into account. The corresponding next-to-leading-order QCD corrections
have also been recalculated. The full calculation is implemented in a flexible
Monte Carlo code. Numerical results for cross sections and distributions of
this Standard Model benchmark process are presented for the Tevatron and the
LHC.
