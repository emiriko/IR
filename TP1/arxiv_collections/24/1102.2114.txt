An efficient Learning resource centre can be achieved with the help of a
network of collaborating, coordinating and communicating software agents.
Agent-oriented techniques represent an exciting new means of analysing,
designing and building complex software systems. The designing of the
interacting agents is done with the help of Gaia, extended for the multiagent
systems. Gaia is a methodology for agent-oriented analysis and design proposed
by M. Wooldridge [9].
