We examine several different simplified approaches for modelling the
chemistry of CO in three-dimensional numerical simulations of turbulent
molecular clouds. We compare the different models both by looking at the
behaviour of integrated quantities such as the mean CO fraction or the
cloud-averaged CO-to-H2 conversion factor, and also by studying the detailed
distribution of CO as a function of gas density and visual extinction. In
addition, we examine the extent to which the density and temperature
distributions depend on our choice of chemical model.
  We find that all of the models predict the same density PDF and also agree
very well on the form of the temperature PDF for temperatures T > 30 K,
although at lower temperatures, some differences become apparent. All of the
models also predict the same CO-to-H2 conversion factor, to within a factor of
a few. However, when we look more closely at the details of the CO
distribution, we find larger differences. The more complex models tend to
produce less CO and more atomic carbon than the simpler models, suggesting that
the C/CO ratio may be a useful observational tool for determining which model
best fits the observational data. Nevertheless, the fact that these chemical
differences do not appear to have a strong effect on the density or temperature
distributions of the gas suggests that the dynamical behaviour of the molecular
clouds on large scales is not particularly sensitive to how accurately the
small-scale chemistry is modelled.
