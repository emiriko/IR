We consider the concept of temperature in a setting beyond the standard
thermodynamics prescriptions. Namely, rather than restricting to standard
coarse-grained measurements, we consider observers able to master any possible
quantum measurement--a scenario that might be relevant at nanoscopic scales. In
this setting, we focus on quantum systems of coupled harmonic oscillators and
study the question of whether the temperature is an intensive quantity, in the
sense that a block of a thermal state can be approximated by an effective
thermal state at the same temperature as the whole system. Using the quantum
fidelity as figure of merit, we identify instances in which this approximation
is not valid, as the block state and the reference thermal state are
distinguishable for refined measurements. Actually, there are situation in
which this distinguishability even increases with the block size. However, we
also show that the two states do become less distinguishable with the block
size for coarse-grained measurements--thus recovering the standard picture. We
then go further and construct an effective thermal state which provides a good
approximation of the block state for any observables and sizes. Finally, we
point out the role entanglement plays in this scenario by showing that, in
general, the thermodynamic paradigm of local intensive temperature applies
whenever entanglement is not present in the system.
