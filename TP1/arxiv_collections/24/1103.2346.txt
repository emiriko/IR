We investigate scattering process in an ultra-high-Q optical microcavity
coupled to subwavelength scatterers by introducing "splitting quality" Qsp, a
dimensionless parameter defined as the ratio of the scatterer-induced mode
splitting to the total loss of the coupled system. A simple relation is
introduced to directly estimate the Purcell factor from single-shot measurement
of transmission spectrum of scatterer-coupled cavity. Experiments with
polystyrene (PS) and gold (Au) nanoparticles, Erbium ions and Influenza A
virions show that Purcell-factor-enhanced preferential funneling of scattering
into the cavity mode takes place regardless of the scatterer type.
Experimentally determined highest Qsp for single PS and Au nanoparticles are
9.4 and 16.19 corresponding to Purcell factors with lower bounds of 353 and
1049, respectively. The highest observed Qsp was 31.2 for an ensemble of Au
particles. These values are the highest Qsp and Purcell factors reported up to
date.
