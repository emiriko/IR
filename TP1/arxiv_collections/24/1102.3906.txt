It has been previously shown that calculation of renormalization group (RG)
functions of the scalar \phi^4 theory reduces to the analysis of thermodynamic
properties of the Ising model. Using high-temperature expansions for the
latter, RG functions of four-dimensional theory can be calculated for arbitrary
coupling constant g with an accuracy 10^{-4} for the Gell-Mann - Low function
\beta(g) and an accuracy 10^{-3} - 10^{-2} for anomalous dimensions. Expansions
of RG functions up to the 13th order in g^{-1/2} are obtained.
