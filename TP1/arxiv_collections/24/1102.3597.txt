We study the Bose-Einstein correlations of two photons and their coherent
properties that can provide the information about the space-time structure of
the emitting source through the Higgs-boson decays into two photons. We argue
that such an investigation could probe the Higgs-boson mass. The model is
rather sensitive to the temperature of the environment and to the external
distortion effect in medium.
