The ponderomotive force is derived for a relativistic charged particle
entering an electromagnetic standing wave with a general three-dimensional
field distribution and a nonrelativistic intensity, using a perturbation
expansion method. It is shown that the well-known ponderomotive gradient force
expression does not hold for this situation. The modified expression is still
of simple gradient form, but contains additional polarization-dependent terms.
These terms arise because the relativistic translational velocity induces a
quiver motion in the direction of the magnetic force, which is the direction of
large field gradients. Oscillation of the Lorentz factor effectively doubles
this magnetic contribution. The derived ponderomotive force generalizes the
polarization-dependent electron motion in a standing wave obtained earlier
[A.E. Kaplan and A.L. Pokrovsky, Phys. Rev. Lett. $\bm{95}$, 053601 (2005)].
Comparison with simulations in the case of a realistic, non-idealized,
three-dimensional field configuration confirms the general validity of the
analytical results.
