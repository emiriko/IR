We define and describe the class of Quasi-T\"oplitz functions. We then prove
an abstract KAM theorem where the perturbation is in this class. We apply this
theorem to a Non-Linear-Scr\"odinger equation on the torus $T^d$, thus proving
existence and stability of quasi-periodic solutions and recovering the results
of [10]. With respect to that paper we consider only the NLS which preserves
the total Momentum and exploit this conserved quantity in order to simplify our
treatment.
