We investigate the influence of static correlations beyond the pair level on
the dynamics of selected model glass-formers. We compare the pair structure,
angular distribution functions, and statistics of Voronoi polyhedra of two
well-known Lennard-Jones mixtures as well as of the corresponding
Weeks-Chandler-Andersen variants, in which the attractive part of the potential
is truncated. By means of the Voronoi construction we identify the atomic
arrangements corresponding to the locally preferred structures of the models.
We find that the growth of domains formed by interconnected locally preferred
structures signals the onset of the slow dynamics regime and allows to
rationalize the different dynamic behaviors of the models. At low temperature,
the spatial extension of the structurally correlated domains, evaluated at
fixed relaxation time, increases with the fragility of the models and is
systematically reduced by truncating the attractions. In view of these results,
proper inclusion of many-body static correlations in theories of the glass
transition appears crucial for the description of the dynamics of fragile
glass-formers.
