Are there physical, probabilistic or information-theoretic principles which
characterize the quantum probabilities and distinguish them from the classical
case as well as from other probability theories, or which reveal why quantum
mechanics requires its very special mathematical formalism? The paper
identifies the fundamental absence of third-order interference as such a
principle of `quantumness'. Considering three-slit experiments, the concept of
third-order interference was originally introduced by Sorkin in 1994.
