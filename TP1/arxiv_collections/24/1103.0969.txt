Recent ATLAS data significantly extend the exclusion limits for
supersymmetric particles. We examine the impact of such data on global fits of
the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM) to indirect and
cosmological data. We calculate the likelihood map of the ATLAS search, taking
into account systematic errors on the signal and on the background. We validate
our calculation against the ATLAS determinaton of 95% confidence level
exclusion contours. A previous CMSSM global fit is then re-weighted by the
likelihood map, which takes a bite at the high probability density region of
the global fit, pushing scalar and gaugino masses up.
