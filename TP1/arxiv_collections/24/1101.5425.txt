Let $A$ be a subset of integers and let $2\cdot A+k\cdot A=\{2a_1+ka_2 :
a_1,a_2\in A\}$. Y. O. Hamidoune and J. Ru\' e proved that if $k$ is an odd
prime and $A$ a finite set of integers such that $|A|>8k^k$, then $|2\cdot
A+k\cdot A|\ge (k+2)|A|-k^2-k+2$. In this paper, we extend this result for the
case when $k$ is a power of an odd prime and the case when $k$ is a product of
two odd primes.
