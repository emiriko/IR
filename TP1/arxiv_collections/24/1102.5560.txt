The configuration space of the reduced Hamiltonian formulation of quantum
gravity has been shown, for non-Ricci flat metrics, to be a higher-dimensional
analogue of the Teichm\"{u}ller space of conformal structures on a Riemann
surface. In this article we show that the configuration space of conformal
connection-dynamics is naturally a higher-dimensional Teichm\"{u}ller space,
subject to the same condition. An immediate consequence of this result is that
the Barbero-Immirzi parameter of loop quantum gravity naturally assumes a
dilatonic character in all conformal canonical gravity theories.
