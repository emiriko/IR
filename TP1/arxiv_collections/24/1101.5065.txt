An embedding method for solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation is
developed using the Dirac-Frenkel variational principle. Embedding allows the
time-evolution of the wavefunction to be calculated explicitly in a limited
region of space, the region of physical interest, the embedding potential
ensuring that the wavefunction satisfies the correct boundary conditions for
matching on to the rest of the system. This is applied to a study of the
excitation of electrons at a metal surface, represented by a one-dimensional
model potential for Cu(111). Time-dependent embedding potentials are derived
for replacing the bulk substrate, and the image potential and vacuum region
outside the surface, so that the calculation of electron excitation by a
surface perturbation can be restricted to the surface itself. The excitation of
the Shockley surface state and a continuum bulk state is studied, and the
time-structure of the resulting currents analysed. Non-linear effects and the
time taken for the current to arrive outside the surface are discussed. The
method shows a clear distinction between emission from the localized surface
state, where the charge is steadily depleted, and the extended continuum state
where the current emitted into the vacuum is compensated by current approaching
the surface from the bulk.
