The Seeebeck coefficients of the non-aqueous electrolytes tetrabutylammonium
nitrate, tetraoctylphosphonium bromide and tetradodecylammonium nitrate in
1-octanol, 1-dodecanol and ethylene-glycol are measured in a temperature range
from T=30 to T=45 C. The Seebeck coefficient is generally of the order of a few
hundreds of microvolts per Kelvin for aqueous solution of inorganic ions. Here
we report huge values of 7 mV/K at 0.1M concentration for tetrabutylammonium
nitrate in 1-dodecanol. These striking results open the question of
unexpectedly large kosmotrope or "structure making" effects of
tetraalkylammonium ions on the structure of alcohols.
