Radio frequency spectra of a trapped unitary 6Li gas are reported and
analyzed in terms of a theoretical approach that includes both final-state and
trap effects. Final-state effects play a crucial role in evidencing two main
peaks both above and below the critical temperature Tc as being associated with
two distinct phases that reside in different trap regions. These are the
pairing-gap and pseudo-gap phases below Tc, which evolve into the pseudo-gap
and no-gap phases above Tc. In this way, a long standing puzzle about the
interpretation of rf spectra for 6Li in a trap is solved.
