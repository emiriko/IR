Let $q\geq 3$, $2\leq r\leq \phi(q)$ and $a_1,...,a_r$ be distinct residue
classes modulo $q$ that are relatively prime to $q$. Assuming the Generalized
Riemann Hypothesis and the Grand Simplicity Hypothesis, M. Rubinstein and P.
Sarnak showed that the vector-valued function
$E_{q;a_1,...,a_r}(x)=(E(x;q,a_1),..., E(x;q,a_r)),$ where $E(x;q,a)=
\frac{\log x}{\sqrt{x}}(\phi(q)\pi(x;q,a)-\pi(x))$, has a limiting distribution
$\mu_{q;a_1,...,a_r}$ which is absolutely continuous on $\mathbb{R}^r$. Under
the same assumptions, we determine the asymptotic behavior of the large
deviations $\mu_{q;a_1,...,a_r}(||\vx||>V)$ for different ranges of $V$,
uniformly as $q\to\infty.$
