The interference channel with a cognitive relay consists of a classical
interference channel with two sourcedestination pairs and with an additional
cognitive relay that has a priori knowledge of the sources' messages and aids
in the sources' transmission. We derive a new outer bound for this channel
using an argument originally devised for the "more capable" broadcast channel,
and show the achievability of the proposed outer bound in the "very strong
interference" regime, a class of channels where there is no loss in optimality
if both destinations decode both messages. This result is analogous to the
"very strong interference" capacity result for the classical interference
channel and for the cognitive interference channel, and is the first capacity
known capacity result for the general interference channel with a cognitive
relay.
