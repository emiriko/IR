A comprehensive study of the color singlet heavy quark states above T_c is
given, using the Field Correlator Method (FCM) for nonperturbative Q{\bar Q}
potentials and the screened Coulomb potential with the T-dependent Debye
radius. Using these potentials we calculate binding energies and melting
temperatures of heavy mesons and baryons in the deconfined phase of quark-gluon
plasma and the J/\psi and Upsilon disintegration cross sections via the gluon
absorption.
