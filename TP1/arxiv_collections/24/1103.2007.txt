We investigate the dynamics of a single spherical void embedded in a
Friedmann-Lema\^itre universe, and analyze the void shape in the redshift
space. We find that the void in the redshift space appears as an ellipse shape
elongated in the direction of the line of sight (i.e., an opposite deformation
to the Kaiser effect). Applying this result to observed void candidates at the
redshift z~1-2, it may provide us with a new method to evaluate the
cosmological parameters, in particular the value of a cosmological constant.
