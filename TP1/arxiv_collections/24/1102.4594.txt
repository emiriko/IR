We present a method for controlled connection of gold electrodes with dsDNA
molecules (locally on a chip) by utilizing polymerase to elongate
single-stranded DNA primers attached to the electrodes. Thiol-modified
oligonucleotides are directed and immobilized to nanoscale electrodes by means
of dielectrophoretic trapping, and extended in a procedure mimicking PCR,
finally forming a complete dsDNA molecule bridging the gap between the
electrodes. The technique opens up opportunities for building from the
bottom-up, for detection and sensing applications, and also for molecular
electronics.
