In \cite{marjane2010}, we have introduced vectorial conception of FCSR's in
Fibonacci mode. This conception allows us to easily analyze FCSR's over binary
finite fields $\mathbb{F}_{2^{n}}$ for $n\geq 2$. In \cite{allailou2010}, we
describe and study the corresponding Galois mode and use it to design a new
stream cipher. In this paper, we introduce the Ring mode for vectorial FCSR,
explain the analysis of such Feedback registers and illustrate with a simple
example.
