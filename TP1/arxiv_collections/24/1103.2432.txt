We provide an inkling of recent progress in hadron physics made using QCD's
Dyson-Schwinger equations, reviewing: the notion of in-hadron condensates and a
putative solution of a gross problem with the cosmological constant; a
symmetry-preserving computation that simultaneously correlates the masses of
meson and baryon ground- and excited-states, and contributes to a resolution of
the conundrum of the Roper resonance; and a prediction for the Q^2-dependence
of u- and d-quark Dirac and Pauli form factors in the proton, which exposes the
critical role played by diquark correlations within the nucleon.
