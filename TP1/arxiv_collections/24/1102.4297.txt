Recent Kepler observations revealed an unexpected abundance of "hot"
Earth-size to Neptune-size planets in the inner ~0.02-0.2 AU from their parent
stars. Another "oddity" of recent observations is the discovery of a hot
jupiter planet around a very metal poor star of extragalactic origin.
  We point out that these observations have natural explanations in the
framework of the Tidal Downsizing hypothesis, a new and an alternative model
for planet formation. We show that disassociation of molecular hydrogen leads
to the "second collapse" of the giant planet embryos. The collapse forms much
denser fluid configurations, closely resembling isolated proto-giant planets on
the Hayashi track before they enter the degenerate "main sequence" phase. We
find that, in the early gas-rich phase of proto-planetary discs, these
configurations migrate inward more rapidly than they contract. They are
therefore tidally disrupted at characteristic distance of ~ 0.05 -0.1 AU from
their parent stars. The disruption is likely to leave solid cores behind, which
we identify with the hot Super-Earths observed by Kepler. In addition, we show
that single hot jupiters (also found by the Kepler telescope) are not
surprising in the context of TD hypothesis. Finally, formation of coreless
giant planets by the second collapse of the giant embryos occurs for either
very massive embryos (more than ~ 20 Jupiter masses) or very metal poor ones.
We suggest that this process explains the extra-galactic hot jupiter.
