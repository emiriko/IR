The magnetorotational instability (MRI) may dominate outward transport of
angular momentum in accretion disks, allowing material to fall onto the central
object. Previous work has established that the MRI can drive a mean-field
dynamo, possibly leading to a self-sustaining accretion system. Recently,
however, simulations of the scaling of the angular momentum transport parameter
$\alphaSS$ with the magnetic Prandtl number $\Prandtl$ have cast doubt on the
ability of the MRI to transport astrophysically relevant amounts of angular
momentum in real disk systems. Here, we use simulations including explicit
physical viscosity and resistivity to show that when vertical stratification is
included, mean field dynamo action operates, driving the system to a
configuration in which the magnetic field is not fully helical. This relaxes
the constraints on the generated field provided by magnetic helicity
conservation, allowing the generation of a mean field on timescales independent
of the resistivity. Our models demonstrate the existence of a critical magnetic
Reynolds number $\Rmagc$, below which transport becomes strongly
$\Prandtl$-dependent and chaotic, but above which the transport is steady and
$\Prandtl$-independent. Prior simulations showing $\Prandtl$-dependence had
$\Rmag < \Rmagc$. We conjecture that this steady regime is possible because the
mean field dynamo is not helicity-limited and thus does not depend on the
details of the helicity ejection process. Scaling to realistic astrophysical
parameters suggests that disks around both protostars and stellar mass black
holes have $\Rmag >> \Rmagc$. Thus, we suggest that the strong $\Prandtl$
dependence seen in recent simulations does not occur in real systems.
