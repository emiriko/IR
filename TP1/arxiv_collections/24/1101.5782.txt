While the notion of the position of photons is indispensable in the quantum
optical situations, it has been known in mathematical physics that any position
operator cannot be defined for a massless free particle with a non-zero finite
spin. This dilemma is resolved by introducing the "effective mass" of a photon
due to the interaction with matter. The validity of this interpretation is
confirmed in reference to the picture of "polariton", a basic notion in optical
and solid physics. In this connection, we discuss the long-standing controversy
between Minkowski's and Abraham's definitions of the momenta of a photon in
media from the general viewpoint adopted in the appendix.
