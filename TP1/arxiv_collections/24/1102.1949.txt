We discuss expectations for the total and inelastic cross-sections at LHC CM
energies $\sqrt{s}\ =\ 7\ TeV$ {and $ 14\ TeV$} obtained in an eikonal minijet
model augmented by soft gluon $k_t$-resummation, which we describe in some
detail. We present a band of predictions which encompass recent LHC data and
suggest that the inelastic cross-section described by two channel eikonal
models include only uncorrelated processes. We show that this interpretation of
the model is supported by the LHC data.
