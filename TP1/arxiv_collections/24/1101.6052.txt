In this note we extend to the random, stationary ergodic setting previous
results of periodic homogenization for a particular family of nonlinear
nonlocal "elliptic" equations with oscillatory coefficients. Such equations
include, but are not limited to Bellman equations and the Isaacs equations for
the control and differential games of some pure jump processes. The existence
of an effective equation and convergence the solutions of the family of the
original equations is obtained. Even in the linear case of the equations
contained herein the results appear to be new.
