We develop a characterization of quantum states by means of first order
variables and random variables, within a predicative logic with equality, in
the framework of basic logic and its definitory equations. We introduce the
notion of random first order domain and find a characterization of pure states
in predicative logic and mixed states in propositional logic, due to a focusing
condition. We discuss the role of first order variables and the related
contextuality, in terms of sequents.
