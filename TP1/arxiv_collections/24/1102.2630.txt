The use of single molecules to design electronic devices is an extremely
challenging and fundamentally different approach to further downsizing
electronic circuits. Two-terminal molecular devices such as diodes were first
predicted [1] and, more recently, measured experimentally [2]. The addition of
a gate then enabled the study of molecular transistors [3-5]. In general terms,
in order to increase data processing capabilities, one may not only consider
the electron's charge but also its spin [6,7]. This concept has been pioneered
in giant magnetoresistance (GMR) junctions that consist of thin metallic films
[8,9]. Spin transport across molecules, i.e. Molecular Spintronics remains,
however, a challenging endeavor. As an important first step in this field, we
have performed an experimental and theoretical study on spin transport across a
molecular GMR junction consisting of two ferromagnetic electrodes bridged by a
single hydrogen phthalocyanine (H2Pc) molecule. We observe that even though
H2Pc in itself is nonmagnetic, incorporating it into a molecular junction can
enhance the magnetoresistance by one order of magnitude to 52%.
