We prove a new kind of estimate that holds on any manifold with lower Ricci
bounds. It relates the geometry of two small balls with the same radius,
potentially far apart, but centered in the interior of a common minimizing
geodesic. It reveals new, previously unknown, properties that all generalized
spaces with a lower Ricci curvature bound must have and it has a number of
applications.
  This new kind of estimate asserts that the geometry of small balls along any
minimizing geodesic changes in a H\"older continuous way with a constant
depending on the lower bound for the Ricci curvature, the dimension of the
manifold, and the distance to the end points of the geodesic. We give examples
that show that the H\"older exponent, along with essentially all the other
consequences that we show follow from this estimate, are sharp. The unified
theme for all of these applications is convexity.
  Among the applications is that the regular set is convex for any
non-collapsed limit of Einstein metrics. In the general case of potentially
collapsed limits of manifolds with just a lower Ricci curvature bound we show
that the regular set is weakly convex and $a.e.$ convex, that is almost every
pair of points can be connected by a minimizing geodesic whose interior is
contained in the regular set. We also show two conjectures of Cheeger-Colding.
One of these asserts that the isometry group of any, even collapsed, limit of
manifolds with a uniform lower Ricci curvature bound is a Lie group; the key
point for this is to rule out small subgroups. The other asserts that the
dimension of any limit space is the same everywhere. Finally, we show that a
Reifenberg type property holds for collapsed limits and discuss why this
indicate further regularity of manifolds and spaces with Ricci curvature
bounds.
