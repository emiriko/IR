We consider spatially-coupled protograph-based LDPC codes for the three
terminal erasure relay channel. It is observed that BP threshold value, the
maximal erasure probability of the channel for which decoding error probability
converges to zero, of spatially-coupled codes, in particular spatially-coupled
MacKay-Neal code, is close to the theoretical limit for the relay channel.
Empirical results suggest that spatially-coupled protograph-based LDPC codes
have great potential to achieve theoretical limit of a general relay channel.
