The preliminary results on charged pion production in np collisions at an
incident beam energy of 1.25 GeV measured with HADES are presented. The np
reactions were isolated in dp collisions at 1.25 GeV/u using the Forward Wall
hodoscope, which allowed to register spectator protons. The results for np ->
pppi-, np -> nppi+pi- and np -> dpi+pi- channels are compared with OPE
calculations. A reasonable agreement between experimental results and the
predictions of the OPE+OBE model is observed.
