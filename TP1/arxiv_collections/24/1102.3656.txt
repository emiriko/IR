Several points regarding cylindrical Brans-Dicke geometries are studied. The
issue of particle trajectories for the vacuum cylindrical solution is
revisited. The possible particular nature of a global string metric is
analysed. The general form of the junction conditions for matching cylindrical
solutions within this theory is written down, and the relation with the general
relativity limit is discussed.
