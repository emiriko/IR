We consider semi-discrete first-order finite difference schemes for a
nonlinear degenerate convection-diffusion equations in one space dimension, and
prove an L1 error estimate. Precisely, we show that the L1 loc difference
between the approximate solution and the unique entropy solution converges at a
rate O(\Deltax 1/11), where \Deltax is the spatial mesh size. If the diffusion
is linear, we get the convergence rate O(\Deltax 1/2), the point being that the
O is independent of the size of the diffusion
