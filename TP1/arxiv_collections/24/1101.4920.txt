I am mainly interested in the formation and destruction of young star
clusters in nearby star forming galaxies such as the Antennae, M83, and M51.
One of the first analysis steps is to throw out all those pesky stars that keep
contaminating my young cluster samples. Recently, spurred on by our new WFC3
Early Release Science data of galaxies including M83, NGC 4214, M82, NGC 2841,
and Cen A, we began taking a closer look at the stellar component. Questions we
are addressing are: 1) what are the most luminous stars, 2) how can we use them
to help study the destruction of star clusters and the population of the field,
3) what fraction of stars, at least the bright stars, are formed in the field,
in associations, and in compact clusters. In this contribution we describe some
of the beginning steps in this process. More specifically, we describe how we
separate stars from clusters in our galaxies, and describe how candidate
Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) and "Single Star" HII (SSHII) regions have been
identified.
