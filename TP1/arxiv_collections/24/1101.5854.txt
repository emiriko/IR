Fusion-evaporation cross-sections {\sigma}evr in reactions known for fusion
hindrance phenomenon in coupled-channels calculations at below-barrier
energies, are studied in terms of the dynamical cluster-decay model (DCM) of
one of us (RKG) and Collaborators and the Wong formula extended by us, both
based on proximity potential, by using the concept of "barrier modification" at
sub-barrier energies, first advocated by Misicu and Esbensen for M3Y potential.
The DCM is shown to contain the "barrier lowering" as its inbuilt
characteristic, and the same is found essential, and introduced empirically, in
the extended-Wong formula.
