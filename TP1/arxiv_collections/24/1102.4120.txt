We address a central (and classical) issue in the theory of infinite games:
the reduction of the memory size that is needed to implement winning strategies
in regular infinite games (i.e., controllers that ensure correct behavior
against actions of the environment, when the specification is a regular
omega-language). We propose an approach which attacks this problem before the
construction of a strategy, by first reducing the game graph that is obtained
from the specification. For the cases of specifications represented by
"request-response"-requirements and general "fairness" conditions, we show that
an exponential gain in the size of memory is possible.
