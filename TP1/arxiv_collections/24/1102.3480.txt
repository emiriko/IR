We introduce shower deconstruction, a method to look for new physics in a
hadronic environment. The method aims to be a full information approach using
small jets. It assigns to each event a number chi that is an estimate of the
ratio of the probability for a signal process to produce that event to the
probability for a background process to produce that event. The analytic
functions we derive to calculate these probabilities mimic what full event
generators like Pythia or Herwig do and can be depicted in a diagrammatic way.
As an example, we apply this method to a boosted Higgs boson produced in
association with a Z-boson and show that this method can be useful to
discriminate this signal from the Z+jets background.
