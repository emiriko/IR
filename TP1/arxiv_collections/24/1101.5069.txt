Recent PHENIX measurements of the elliptic (v2) and hexadecapole (v4) Fourier
flow coefficients for charged hadrons as a function of transverse momentum
(pT), collision centrality and particle species are presented and compared with
results from the PHOBOS and STAR collaborations respectively. The status of
extensions to future PHENIX measurements at lower beam energies is also
discussed.
