We establish bounds on the maximum entanglement gain and minimum quantum
communication cost of the Fully Quantum Slepian-Wolf protocol in the one-shot
regime, which is considered to be at the apex of the existing family tree in
Quantum Information Theory. These quantities, which are expressed in terms of
smooth min- and max-entropies, reduce to the known rates of quantum
communication cost and entanglement gain in the asymptotic i.i.d. scenario. We
also provide an explicit proof of the optimality of these asymptotic rates. We
introduce a resource inequality for the one-shot FQSW protocol, which in
conjunction with our results, yields achievable one-shot rates of its children
protocols. In particular, it yields bounds on the one-shot quantum capacity of
a noisy channel in terms of a single entropic quantity, unlike previously
bounds. We also obtain an explicit expression for the achievable rate for
one-shot state redistribution.
