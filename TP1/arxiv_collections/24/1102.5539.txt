Abell 2256 is a rich, nearby (z=0.0594) galaxy cluster that has significant
evidence of merger activity. We present new radio and X-ray observations of
this system. The low-frequency radio images trace the diffuse synchrotron
emission of the Mpc-scale radio halo and relics as well as a number of recently
discovered, more compact, steep spectrum sources. The spectral index across the
relics steepens from the north-west toward the south-east. Analysis of the
spectral index gradients between low and and high-frequencies shows spectral
differences away from the north-west relic edge such that the low-frequency
index is significantly flatter than the high frequency spectral index near the
cluster core. This trend would be consistent with an outgoing merger shock as
the origin of the relic emission. New X-ray data from XMM-Newton reveal
interesting structures in the intracluster medium pressure, entropy and
temperature maps. The pressure maps show an overall low pressure core
co-incident with the radio halo emission, while the temperature maps reveal
multiple regions of cool emission within the central regions of Abell 2256. The
two cold fronts in Abell 2256 both appear to have motion in similar directions.
