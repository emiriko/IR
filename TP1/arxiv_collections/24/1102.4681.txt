In this paper, a linear univariate representation for the roots of a
zero-dimensional polynomial equation system is presented, where the roots of
the equation system are represented as linear combinations of roots of several
univariate polynomial equations. The main advantage of this representation is
that the precision of the roots can be easily controlled. In fact, based on the
linear univariate representation, we can give the exact precisions needed for
roots of the univariate equations in order to obtain the roots of the equation
system to a given precision. As a consequence, a root isolation algorithm for a
zero-dimensional polynomial equation system can be easily derived from its
linear univariate representation.
