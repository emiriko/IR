We investigate the dynamical properties of a trapped finite-temperature
normal Fermi gas with dipole-dipole interaction. For the free expansion
dynamics, we show that the expanded gas always becomes stretched along the
direction of the dipole moment. In addition, we present the temperature and
interaction dependences of the asymptotical aspect ratio. We further study the
collapse dynamics of the system by suddenly increasing the dipolar interaction
strength. We show that, in contrast to the anisotropic collapse of a dipolar
Bose-Einstein condensate, a dipolar Fermi gas always collapses isotropically
when the system becomes globally unstable. We also explore the interaction and
temperature dependences for the frequencies of the low-lying collective
excitations.
