The dynamics of baby universes which are branched off in pairs from a large
universe and whose respective members are entangled to each other has been
studied in quantum gravity and string theory. It is shown that the probability
measure for such pairs essentially keeps its Planckian form when one of their
two members is trapped by a Lorentzian tunnel and travels through it into
another large universe, so that the two baby universes of the pairs preserve
their mutual entanglement even when they are going to be finally branched in
distinct large universes. The conclusion is thus drawn that big fixing the
fundamental constants in our universe actually big fixes such constants in the
set of all single universes of the multiverse.
