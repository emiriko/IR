Modelling amplitudes of stochastically excited oscillations in stars is a
powerful tool for understanding the properties of the convective zones. For
instance, it gives us information on the way turbulent eddies are temporally
correlated in a very large Reynolds number regime. We discuss the way the time
correlation between eddies is modelled and we present recent theoretical
developments as well as observational results. Eventually, we discuss the
physical underlying meaning of the results by introducing the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, which is a sub-class of a Gaussian Markov process.
