The efficiency of institutionalized punishment is studied by evaluating the
stationary states in the spatial public goods game comprising unconditional
defectors, cooperators, and cooperating pool-punishers as the three competing
strategies. Fine and cost of pool-punishment are considered as the two main
parameters determining the stationary distributions of strategies on the square
lattice. Each player collects its payoff from five five-person public goods
games, and the evolution of strategies is subsequently governed by imitation
based on pairwise comparisons at a low level of noise. The impact of
pool-punishment on the evolution of cooperation in structured populations is
significantly different from that reported previously for peer-punishment.
Representative phase diagrams reveal remarkably rich behavior, depending also
on the value of the synergy factor that characterizes the efficiency of
investments payed into the common pool. Besides traditional single and
two-strategy stationary states, a rock-paper-scissors type cyclic dominance can
emerge in strikingly different ways.
