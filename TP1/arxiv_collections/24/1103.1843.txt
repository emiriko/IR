In General Gauge Mediation (GGM) all MSSM soft sfermion masses at a high
scale M_mess can be parameterised by three a priori independent scales
\Lambda_{S;1,2,3}(M_mess). (Similarly the gaugino masses are given by
\Lambda_{G;1,2,3}(M_mess).) For the first two generations this parameterisation
in terms of a set of running \Lambda_{S;1,2,3}(\mu) -- conveniently obtained
from appropriate RG invariants -- continues to hold all the way down to the
electroweak scale. This is not the case for the third generation because of the
large Yukawa couplings. Together these two observations imply that the
messenger scale is an additional parameter of GGM models. In models where all
messengers are in complete GUT multiplets (without significant mass
splittings), all \Lambda_{S,r} are equal at M_mess. Starting from the
observable mass spectrum at the electroweak scale we present a strategy to
determine if this unification occurs and at which scale. This approach uses
data accessible at colliders to gain insight into high scale unification
physics beyond the unification of gauge couplings.
