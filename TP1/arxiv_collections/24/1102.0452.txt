Microlensing is a mature and established tool of research over a broad range
of astrophysical issues, from dark matter searches to the detection of new
extrasolar planets of very low mass, down to Earth-size. This volume collects
the abstracts in extended format of the 15th Microlensing Conference held in
the University of Salerno on January 20-22, 2011
(http://smc2011.physics.unisa.it). The topics include: the status of current
surveys, planetary events, dark matter searches, cosmological microlensing,
theoretical investigations and an outlook towards the future, with in
particular a discussion on the possible role to be played by microlensing
searches of exoplanets in the forecoming space missions, WFIRST and EUCLID.
