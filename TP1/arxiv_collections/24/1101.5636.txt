A differential coupling of topological surface states to left- versus
right-circularly polarized light is the basis of many opto-spintronics
applications of topological insulators. Here we report direct evidence of
circular dichroism from the surface states of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ using a laser-based
time-of-flight angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. By employing a novel
sample rotational analysis, we resolve unusual modulations in the circular
dichroism photoemission pattern as a function of both energy and momentum,
which perfectly mimic the predicted but hitherto un-observed three-dimensional
warped spin-texture of the surface states. By developing a microscopic theory
of photoemission from topological surface states, we show that this correlation
is a natural consequence of spin-orbit coupling. These results suggest that our
technique may be a powerful probe of the spin-texture of spin-orbit coupled
materials in general.
