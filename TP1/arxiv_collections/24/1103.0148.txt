We have employed the improved Peierls-Nabarro (P-N) equation to study the
properties of 1/2<110> edge dislocation in {111} plane in FCC metals Al, Cu,
Ir, Pd, and Pt. The generalized-stacking-fault energy (GSFE) surface entering
the equation is calculated by using first-principles density functional theory
(DFT). The accuracy of the method has been tested by calculating values for
various stacking fault energies which favorably compare with the previous
theoretical and experimental results. The core structures, including the core
widths both of the edge and screw components, dissociation behavior for edge
dislocations have been investigated. The dissociated distance between two
partials for Al in our calculation agrees well with the values obtained from
the numeric simulation with DFT and molecular dynamics simulation, as well as
experiment. Our calculations show that it is preferred to create partial
dislocation in Cu, and to be easily observed full dislocation in Al, Ir, Pd,
and especially Pt.
