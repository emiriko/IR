We present two-dimensional fully-kinetic Particle-in-Cell simulations of
decaying electromagnetic fluctuations. The computational box is such that
wavelengths ranging from electron to ion gyroradii are resolved. The parameters
used are realistic for the solar wind, and the ion to electron mass ratio is
physical. The understanding of the dissipation of turbulent fluctuations at
small scales is thought to be a crucial mechanism for solar wind acceleration
and coronal heating. The computational results suggest that a power law cascade
of magnetic fluctuations could be sustained up to scales of the electron Larmor
radius and smaller. We analyse the simulation results in the light of the
Vlasov linear theory, and we comment on the particle heating. The dispersion
curves of lightly damped modes in this regime suggest that a linear mechanism
could be responsible for the observed steepening of power spectra at electron
scales, but a straightforward identification of turbulent fluctuations as an
ensemble of linear modes is not possible
