This study aims to develop a model for the user acceptance for implementing
the information security standard (i.e. ISO 27001) in Turkish public
organizations. The results of the surveys performed in Turkey reveal that the
legislation on information security public which organizations have to obey is
significantly related with the user acceptance during ISO 27001 implementation
process. The fundamental components of our user acceptance model are perceived
usefulness, attitude towards use, social norms, and performance expectancy.
