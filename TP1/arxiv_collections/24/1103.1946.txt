Scaling arguments and precise simulations are used to study the square
lattice $\pm J$ Ising spin glass, a prototypical model for glassy systems.
Droplet theory predicts, and our numerical results show,
entropically-stabilized long range spin glass order at zero temperature. The
low temperature scaling behavior has an important new crossover length scale
that produces a power-law dependence of the heat capacity on temperature.
