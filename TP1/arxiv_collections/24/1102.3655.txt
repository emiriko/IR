A newly discovered family of the Fe-based superconductors is isostructural
with the so-called 122 family of Fe pnictides, but has a qualitatively
different doping state. Early experiments indicate that superconductivity is
nodeless, yet prerequisites for the $s_\pm$ nodeless state (generally believed
to be realized in Fe superconductors) are missing. It is tempting to assign a
$d-$ wave symmetry to the new materials, and it does seem at first glance that
such a state may be nodeless. Yet a more careful analysis shows that it is not
possible, given the particular 122 crystallography, and that the possible
choice of admissible symmetries is severly limited: it is either a conventional
single-sign $s_{+}$ state, or another $s_\pm$ state, different from the one
believed to be present in other Fe-based superconductors.
