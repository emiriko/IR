A Weyl geometric scale covariant approach to gravity due to Omote, Dirac, and
Utiyama (1971ff) is reconsidered. It can be extended to the electroweak sector
of elementary particle fields, taking into account their basic scaling freedom.
Already Cheng (1988) indicated that electroweak symmetry breaking, usually
attributed to the Higgs field with a boson expected at $0.1 - 0.3 \,TeV$, may
be due to a coupling between Weyl geometric gravity and electroweak
interactions. Weyl geometry seems to be well suited for treating questions of
elementary particle physics, which relate to scale invariance and its
"breaking". This setting suggests the existence of a scalar field boson at the
surprisingly low energy of $\sim 1\, eV$. That may appear unlikely; but, as a
payoff, the acquirement of mass arises as a result of coupling to gravity in
agreement with the understanding of mass as the gravitational charge of fields.
