We present results for realistic modeling of the x-ray absorption near edge
structure (XANES) of the overdoped high-T_c superconductor La_2-xSr_xCuO_4 in
the hole doping range x = 0.20-0.30. Our computations are based on a real-space
Green's function approach in which strong-correlation effects are taken into
account in terms of a doping-dependent self-energy. The predicted O K-edge
XANES is found to be in good accord with the corresponding experimental results
in this overdoped regime. We find that the low energy spectra are dominated by
the contribution of O-atoms in the cuprate planes, with little contribution
from apical O-atoms.
