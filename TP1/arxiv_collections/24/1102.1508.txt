Research in blast-induced lung injury resulted in exposure thresholds that
are useful in understanding and protecting humans from such injury. Because
traumatic brain injury (TBI) due to blast exposure has become a prominent
medical and military problem, similar thresholds should be identified that can
put available research results in context and guide future research toward
protecting warfighters as well as diagnosis and treatment. At least three
mechanical mechanisms by which the blast wave may result in brain injury have
been proposed - a thoracic mechanism, head acceleration and direct cranial
transmission. These mechanisms need not be mutually exclusive. In this study,
likely regions of interest for the first two mechanisms based on blast
characteristics (positive pulse duration and peak effective overpressure) are
developed using available data from blast experiments and related studies,
including behind-armor blunt trauma and ballistic pressure wave studies. These
related studies are appropriate to include because blast-like pressure waves
are produced that result in neurological effects like those caused by blast.
Results suggest that injury thresholds for each mechanism are dependent on
blast conditions, and that under some conditions, more than one mechanism may
contribute. There is a subset of blast conditions likely to result in TBI due
to head acceleration and/or a thoracic mechanism without concomitant lung
injury. These results can be used to guide experimental designs and compare
additional data as they become available. Additional data are needed before
actual probabilities or severity of TBI for a given exposure can be described.
