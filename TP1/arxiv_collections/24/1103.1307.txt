Chiral Magnetic Wave (CMW) is a gapless collective excitation of quark-gluon
plasma in the presence of external magnetic field that stems from the interplay
of Chiral Magnetic (CME) and Chiral Separation Effects (CSE); it is composed by
the waves of the electric and chiral charge densities coupled by the axial
anomaly. We consider CMW at finite baryon density and find that it induces the
electric quadrupole moment of the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy ion
collisions: the "poles" of the produced fireball (pointing outside of the
reaction plane) acquire additional positive electric charge, and the "equator"
acquires additional negative charge. We point out that this electric quadrupole
deformation lifts the degeneracy between the elliptic flows of positive and
negative pions leading to $v_2(\pi^+) < v_2(\pi^-)$, and estimate the magnitude
of the effect.
