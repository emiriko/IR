Magnetic dependencies of the critical current of superconducting, aluminium
rings, with homogeneous section and with small narrow spot, are measured. Only
permitted state at each magnetic flux value is observed in the conventional
ring because of strong discreteness of its spectrum. But two states are
observed because of the small narrow spot.
