The effect of entanglement and correlated noise in a four-player quantum
Minority game is investigated. Different time correlated quantum memory
channels are considered to analyze the Nash equilibrium payoff of the 1st
player. It is seen that the Nash equilibrium payoff is substantially enhanced
due to the presence of correlated noise. The behaviour of damping channels
(amplitude damping and phase damping) is approximately similar. However,
bit-phase flip channel heavily influences the minority game as compared to
other channels in the presence of correlated noise. On the other hand, phase
flip channel has a symmetrical behaviour around 50% noise threshold. The
significant reduction in payoffs due to decoherence is well compensated due to
the presence of correlated noise. However, the Nash equilibrium of the game
does not change in the presence of noise. It is seen that in case of
generalized amplitude damping channel, entanglement plays a significant role at
lower level of decoherence. The channel has less dominant effects on the payoff
at higher values of decoherence. Furthermore, amplitude damping and generalized
amplitude damping channels have almost comparable effects at lower level of
decoherence $(p<0.5)$. Therefore, the game deserves careful study during its
implementation due to prominent role of noise for different channels.
