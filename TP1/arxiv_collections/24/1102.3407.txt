We report on recent results of the QCDSF/UKQCD Collaboration on
investigations of baryon structure using configurations generated with N_f=2+1
dynamical flavours of O(a) improved Wilson fermions. With the strange quark
mass as an additional dynamical degree of freedom in our simulations we avoid
the need for a partially quenched approximation when investigating the
properties of particles containing a strange quark, e.g. the hyperons. In
particular, we will focus on the nucleon and hyperon axial charges and quark
momentum fractions.
