Recovery of low-rank matrices has recently seen significant activity in many
areas of science and engineering, motivated by recent theoretical results for
exact reconstruction guarantees and interesting practical applications. A
number of methods have been developed for this recovery problem. However, a
principled method for choosing the unknown target rank is generally not
provided. In this paper, we present novel recovery algorithms for estimating
low-rank matrices in matrix completion and robust principal component analysis
based on sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) principles. Starting from a matrix
factorization formulation and enforcing the low-rank constraint in the
estimates as a sparsity constraint, we develop an approach that is very
effective in determining the correct rank while providing high recovery
performance. We provide connections with existing methods in other similar
problems and empirical results and comparisons with current state-of-the-art
methods that illustrate the effectiveness of this approach.
