This is the compendium of the cluster algebra and quiver package for sage.
The purpose of this package is to provide a platform to work with cluster
algebras in graduate courses and to further develop the theory by working on
examples, by gathering data, and by exhibiting and testing conjectures. In this
compendium, we include the relevant theory to introduce the reader to cluster
algebras assuming no prior background; this exposition has been written to be
accessible to an interested undergraduate. Throughout this compendium, we
include examples that the user can run in the sage notebook or command line,
and then close with a detailed description of the data structures and methods
in this package.
