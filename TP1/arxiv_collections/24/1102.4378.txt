Phase estimates in adaptive-optics systems are computed by use of wavefront
sensors such as Shack-Hartmann or curvature sensors. In either case the
standard error of the phase estimates is proportional to the standard error of
the measurements; but the error-propagation factors are different. We calculate
the ratio of these factors for curvature and Shack-Hartmann sensors in
dependence on the number of sensors, n, on a circular aperture. If the sensor
spacing is kept constant and the pupil is enlarged, the ratio increases as
n^0.4. When more sensing elements are accommodated on the same aperture, it
increases even faster, viz. proportional to n^0.8. With large numbers of
sensing elements this increase can limit the applicability of curvature
sensors.
