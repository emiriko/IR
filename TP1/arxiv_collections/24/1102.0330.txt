The simulation of quantum correlations with alternative nonlocal resources,
such as classical communication, gives a natural way to quantify their
nonlocality. While multipartite nonlocal correlations appear to be useful
resources, very little is known on how to simulate multipartite quantum
correlations. We present the first known protocol that reproduces 3-partite GHZ
correlations with bounded communication: 3 bits in total turn out to be
sufficient to simulate all equatorial Von Neumann measurements on the 3-partite
GHZ state.
