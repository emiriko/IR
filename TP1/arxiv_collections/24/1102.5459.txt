We study current-induced domain-wall dynamics in a thin ferromagnetic
nanowire. The domain-wall dynamics is described by simple equations with four
parameters. We propose the procedure to determine these parameters by
all-electric measurements of the time-dependent voltage induced by the
domain-wall motion. We provide an analytical expression for the time variation
of this voltage. Furthermore, we show that the measurement of the proposed
effects is within reach with current experimental techniques.
