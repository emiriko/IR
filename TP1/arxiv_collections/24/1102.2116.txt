Comparing the measurements of the hadronic final state from partonic showers
in proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions will reveal the modifications
generated by the medium on partons produced in hard scatterings. This can be
achieved by selecting the hard processes in which there is a direct photon in
the final state. The experimental technique consists in tagging events with a
well identified high energy direct photon and in measuring the azimuthal angle
correlation with charged hadrons. To establish a reference measurement for
heavy-ion collisions, proton-proton collision data collected with ALICE have
been analyzed. Preliminary results are presented together with photon and
$\pi^{0}$-charged hadrons correlations showing the characteristic di-jet
pattern from where the partonic momentum $k_{T}$ is extracted.
