HR8799 is so far the only directly imaged multiple exoplanet system. The
orbital configuration would, if better known, provide valuable insight into the
formation and dynamical evolution of wide-orbit planetary systems. We present
L'-band observations of the HR8799 system obtained with NACO at VLT, adding to
the astrometric monitoring of the planets HR8799b, c and d. We investigate how
well the two simple cases of (i) a circular orbit and (ii) a face-on orbit fit
the astrometric data for HR8799d over a total time baseline of ~2 years. The
results indicate that the orbit of HR8799d is inclined with respect to our line
of sight, and suggest that the orbit is slightly eccentric or non-coplanar with
the outer planets and debris disk.
