We present a sum-rule extraction of the decay constants of the charmed mesons
D and D_s from the two-point correlator of pseudoscalar currents. First, we
compare the perturbative expansion for the correlator and the decay constant
performed in terms of the pole and the running MSbar masses of the charm quark.
The perturbative expansion in terms of the pole mass shows no signs of
convergence whereas reorganizing this very expansion in terms of the MSbar mass
leads to a distinct hierarchy of the perturbative expansion. Furthermore, the
decay constants extracted from the pole-mass correlator turn out to be
considerably smaller than those obtained by means of the MSbar-mass correlator.
Second, making use of the OPE in terms of the MSbar mass, we determine the
decay constants of both D and D_s mesons with an emphasis on the uncertainties
in these quantities related both to the input QCD parameters and to the limited
accuracy of the method of sum rules.
