We present the Mathematica application DoFun which allows to derive
Dyson-Schwinger equations and renormalization group flow equations for n-point
functions in a simple manner. DoFun offers several tools which considerably
simplify the derivation of these equations from a given physical action. We
discuss the application of DoFun by means of two different types of quantum
field theories, namely a bosonic O(N) theory and the Gross-Neveu model.
