We use the technique of electro-magnetically induced transparency (EIT) to
probe the effect of attractive dipole-dipole interactions in a highly excited
Rydberg gas. The transient character of the EIT response is investigated by
rapidly scanning the probe laser through resonance. We characterize the
resulting cooperative optical non-linearity as a function of probe strength,
density and scan direction. For the 58D$_{5/2}$ Rydberg state, an atom density
of $1.6\times10^{10} $cm$^{-3}$ and a positive frequency scan we measure a
third-order non-linearity of $\chi^{(3)}=5\times 10^{-7}$ m$^2$V$^{-2}$. For
the reverse scan we observe a second order non-linearity of $\chi^{(2)}=5\times
10^{-6}$ mV$^{-1}$. The contrasting behaviour can be explained in terms of
motional effects and resonant excitation of Rydberg pairs.
