We study the production of the vector $U$ -unparticle stuff and a single
photon in decays of a dilaton. The signals of an unparticle can be detected
through the missing energy and momentum distribution carried away by $U$ once
it was produced in radiative decay of a dilaton The continuous energy spectrum
of the emitted photons encoding the recoil unparticle can be measured in
precision studies of rare decays of the dilaton or Higgs-boson after their
discoveres.
