Velocity correlations in a 2D granular fluid are studied in experiments and
numerical simulations. The transverse component of the velocity structure
factor reveals two well defined energy scales, associated with the external
"bath temperature" $T_b$ and with the internal granular one, $T_g<T_b$,
relevant at large and small wavelengths respectively. Experimental and
numerical data are discussed within a fluctuating hydrodynamics model, which
allows one to define and measure a non-equilibrium coherence length $\xi$,
growing with density, that characterizes order in the velocity field.
