In a recent computational study, we found highly structured ground states for
coarse-grained polymers adsorbed to ultrathin nanowires in a certain model
parameter region. Those tubelike configurations show, even at a first glance,
exciting morphological similarities to known atomistic nanotubes such as
single-walled carbon nanotubes. In order to explain those similarities in a
systematic way, we performed additional detailed and extensive simulations of
coarse-grained polymer models with various parameter settings.
  We show this here and explain why standard geometrical models for atomistic
nanotubes are not suited to interpret the results of those studies. In fact,
the general structural behavior of polymer nanotubes, as well as specific
previous observations, can only be explained by applying recently developed
polyhedral tube models.
