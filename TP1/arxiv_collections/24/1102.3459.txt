We present deep photometric observations of the open cluster NGC 2477 using
HST/WFPC2. By identifying seven cluster white dwarf candidates, we present an
analysis of the white dwarf age of this cluster, using both the traditional
method of fitting isochrones to the white dwarf cooling sequence, and by
employing a new Bayesian statistical technique that has been developed by our
group. This new method performs an objective, simultaneous model fit of the
cluster and stellar parameters (namely age, metallicity, distance, reddening,
as well as individual stellar masses, mass ratios, and cluster membership) to
the photometry. Based on this analysis, we measure a white dwarf age of 1.035
+/- 0.054 +/- 0.087 Gyr (uncertainties represent the goodness of model fits and
discrepancy among models, respectively), in good agreement with the cluster's
main sequence turnoff age. This work is part of our ongoing work to calibrate
main sequence turnoff and white dwarf ages using open clusters, and to improve
the precision of cluster ages to the ~5% level.
