We expand on the results of arXiv:1011.0780 where we presented new recursion
relations for correlation functions of the stress tensor and conserved currents
in conformal field theories with an AdS_p dual for p > 4. These recursion
relations are derived by generalizing the Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten (BCFW)
relations to amplitudes in anti-de Sitter space (AdS) that are dual to boundary
correlators, and are usually computed perturbatively by Witten diagrams. Our
results relate vacuum-correlation functions to integrated products of
lower-point transition amplitudes, which correspond to correlators calculated
between states dual to certain normalizable modes. We show that the set of
polarization vectors for which amplitudes behave well under the BCFW extension
is smaller than in flat-space. We describe how transition amplitudes for more
general external polarizations can be constructed by combining answers obtained
by different pairs of BCFW shifts. We then generalize these recursion relations
to supersymmetric theories. In AdS, unlike flat-space, even maximal
supersymmetry is insufficient to permit the computation of all correlators of
operators in the same multiplet as a stress-tensor or conserved current.
Finally, we work out some simple examples to verify our results.
