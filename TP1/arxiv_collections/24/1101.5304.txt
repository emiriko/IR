The masses of excited states of mixed orbital symmetry of nonstrange and
strange baryons belonging to the lowest $[{\bf 70},1^-]$ multiplet are
calculated in the $1/N_c$ expansion to order $1/N_c$ with a new method which
allows to considerably reduce the number of linearly independent operators
entering the mass formula. This study represents an extension to SU(6) of our
work on nonstrange baryons, the framework of which was SU(4). The conclusion
regarding the role of the flavor operator, neglected in previous SU(6) studies,
is reinforced. Namely, both the flavor and spin operators contribute dominantly
to the flavor-spin breaking.
