The bispectrum of scalar mode density perturbations is analysed for the
strong regime of warm inflationary models. This analysis generalises previous
results by allowing damping terms in the inflaton equation of motion that are
dependent on temperature. A significant amount of non-gaussianity emerges with
constant (or local) non-linearity parameter $f_{NL}\sim 20$, in addition to the
terms with non-constant $f_{NL}$ which are characteristic of warm inflation.
