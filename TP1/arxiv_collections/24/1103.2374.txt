In this work we focus on the surface roughness correction to the near-field
radiative heat transfer between a nanoparticle and a material with a rough
surface utilizing a direct perturbation theory up to second order in the
surface profile. We discuss the different distance regimes for the local
density of states above the rough material and the heat flux analytically and
numerically. We show that the heat transfer rate is larger than that
corresponding to a flat surface at short distances. At larger distances it can
become smaller due to surface polariton scattering by the rough surface. For
distances much smaller than the correlation length of the surface profile, we
show that the results converge to a proximity approximation, whereas in the
opposite limit the rough surface can be replaced by an equivalent surface
layer.
