We investigate the transverse electric field ($E$) dependence of the $\nu$=0
quantum Hall state (QHS) in dual-gated graphene bilayers in high magnetic
fields. The longitudinal resistivity ($\rho_{xx}$) measured at $\nu$=0 shows an
insulating behavior which is strongest in the vicinity of $E$=0, and at large
$E$-fields. At a fixed perpendicular magnetic field ($B$), the $\nu$=0 QHS
undergoes a transition as a function of $E$, marked by a minimum,
temperature-independent $\rho_{xx}$. This observation is explained by a
transition from a spin polarized $\nu$=0 QHS at small $E$-fields, to a valley
(layer) polarized $\nu$=0 QHS at large $E$-fields. The $E$-field value at which
the transition occurs has a linear dependence on $B$
