We propose to construct a family of states of one-dimensional spin chains by
replacing the finite dimensional matrices in matrix product states by infinite
dimensional operators constructed from bosonic annihilation and creation
operators. The resulting states are demonstrated to violate the area law and to
exhibit long range correlations. In addition, we propose an efficient way to
prepare the states experimentally, in which the spins interact sequentially
with an ancilla system.
