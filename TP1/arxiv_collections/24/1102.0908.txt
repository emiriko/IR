We present an alternative proof of a theorem by Courcelle, Makowski and
Rotics which states that problems expressible in MSO are solvable in linear
time for graphs of bounded rankwidth. Our proof uses a game-theoretic approach
and has the advantage of being self-contained, intuitive, and fairly easy to
follow. In particular, our presentation does not assume any background in logic
or automata theory. We believe that it is good to have alternative proofs of
this important result. Moreover our approach can be generalized to prove other
results of a similar flavor, for example, that of Courcelle's Theorem for
treewidth.
