A molecule model is proposed for the description of the properties of the
kaonic nuclear cluster (KNC) anti-KNN with the structure N(ant-KN)_(I = 0) and
quantum numbers I(J^P) = 1/2(0^-), the large binding energy B^(\exp)_(anti-KNN)
= 103(6) MeV and the width Gamma^(\exp)_(anti-KNN) = 118(13) MeV, observed
recently by the DISTO Collaboration. The theoretical values of the binding
energy B^(th)_(anti-KNN) = 118 MeV, the width Gamma^(th)_(anti-KNN) = 142 MeV
of the KNC anti-KNN and the density n_(anti-KNN) = 2.71 n_0, where n_0= 0.17
fm^(-3) is the normal nuclear density, reproduce well the large experimental
values. They are calculated with the trial harmonic oscillator wave functions
by using chiral Lagrangians, accounting for all self-energy terms, contributing
to the masses of the kaonic nuclear clusters (anti-KN)_(I = 0) and anti-KNN. In
addition the high Lambda*p sticking probability in the pp reaction at the
kinetic energy T_p = 2.85 GeV of the incident proton is explained.
