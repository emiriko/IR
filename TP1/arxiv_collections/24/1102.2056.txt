We have measured the annual parallax of the H2O maser source associated with
an infrared dark cloud MSXDC G034.43+00.24 from the observations with VERA
(VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry). The parallax is 0.643 +/- 0.049 mas,
corresponding to the distance of 1.56 +0.12/-0.11 kpc. This value is less than
the half of the previous kinematic distance of 3.7 kpc. We revise the core mass
estimates of MSXDC G034.43+00.24, based on virial masses, LTE masses and dust
masses and show that the core masses decrease from the previous estimations of
~1000 Mo to hundreds of Mo. The spectral type derived from the luminosity also
changes from O9.5 to B1 in the case of MM1. This spectral type is still
consistent with that of the massive star. The radial velocity derived from the
flat rotation model is smaller than the observed velocity, which corresponds to
the peculiar motion of ~40 km/s in the line-of-sight direction.
