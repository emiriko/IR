Heavy-quark interactions in the Quark-Gluon Plasma are analyzed in terms of a
selfconsistent Brueckner scheme using a thermodynamic $T$-matrix based on a
potential model. The interrelations between quarkonium correlators, spectral
functions and zero-modes, and open heavy-flavor transport and susceptibilities
are elaborated. Independent constraints from thermal lattice QCD can be used to
improve predictions for heavy-quark phenomenology in heavy-ion collisions.
