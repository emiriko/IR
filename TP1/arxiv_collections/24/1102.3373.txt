In this paper we demonstrate a technique that can create out-of-equilibrium
vortex configurations with almost arbitrary charge and geometry in a
Bose-Einstein condensate. We coherently transfer orbital angular momentum from
a holographically generated light beam to a Rubidium 87 condensate using a
two-photon stimulated Raman process. Using matter wave interferometry, we
verify the phase pattern imprinted onto the atomic wave function for a single
vortex and a vortex-antivortex pair. In addition to their phase winding, the
vortices created with this technique have an associated hyperfine spin texture.
