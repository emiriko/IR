We investigate the implications for supersymmetry from an assumed absence of
any signal in the first period of LHC data taking at 7 TeV center-of-mass
energy and with 1 to 7 fb^(-1) of integrated luminosity. We consider the
zero-lepton plus four jets and missing transverse energy signature, and perform
a combined fit of low-energy measurements, the dark matter relic density
constraint and potential LHC exclusions within a minimal supergravity model. A
non-observation of supersymmetry in the first period of LHC data taking would
still allow for an acceptable description of low-energy data and the dark
matter relic density in terms of minimal supergravity models, but would exclude
squarks and gluinos with masses below 1 TeV.
