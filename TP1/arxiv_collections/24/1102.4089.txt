This paper is essentially devoted to the study of some interesting relations
among the well known operators $I^{(x)}$ (the interpolated Invert), $L^{(x)}$
(the interpolated Binomial) and Revert (that we call $\eta$).
  We prove that $I^{(x)}$ and $L^{(x)}$ are conjugated in the group
$\Upsilon(R)$. Here $R$ is a commutative unitary ring. In the same group we see
that $\eta$ transforms $I^{(x)}$ in $L^{(-x)}$ by conjugation. These facts are
proved as corollaries of much more general results.
  Then we carefully analyze the action of these operators on the set $\mc{R}$
of second order linear recurrent sequences. While $I^{(x)}$ and $L^{(x)}$
transform $\mc{R}$ in itself, $\eta$ sends $\mc{R}$ in the set of moment
sequences $\mu_n(h,k)$ of particular families of orthogonal polynomials, whose
weight functions are explicitly computed.
  The moments come out to be generalized Motzkin numbers (if $R=\zz$, the
Motzkin numbers are $\mu_n(-1,1)$). We give several interesting expressions of
$\mu_n(h,k)$ in closed forms, and one recurrence relation.
  There is a fundamental sequence of moments, that generates all the other
ones, $\mu_n(0,k)$. These moments are strongly related with Catalan numbers.
This fact allows us to find, in the final part, a new identity on Catalan
numbers by using orthogonality relations.
