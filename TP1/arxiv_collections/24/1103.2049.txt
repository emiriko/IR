In this paper we consider the numerical solutions for a class of jump
diffusions with Markovian switching. After briefly reviewing necessary notions,
a new jump-adapted efficient algorithm based on the Euler scheme is constructed
for approximating the exact solution. Under some general conditions, it is
proved that the numerical solution through such scheme converge to the exact
solution. Moreover, the order of the error between the numerical solution and
the exact solution is also derived. Numerical experiments are carried out to
show the computational efficiency of the approximation.
