We review the status of the integrability and solvability of the geodesics
equations of motion on symmetric coset spaces that appear as sigma models of
supergravity theories when reduced over respectively the timelike and spacelike
direction. Such geodesic curves describe respectively timelike and spacelike
brane solutions. We emphasize the applications to black holes.
