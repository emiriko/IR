We consider the manifold of all quantum many-body states that can be
generated by arbitrary time-dependent local Hamiltonians in a time that scales
polynomially in the system size, and show that it occupies an exponentially
small volume in Hilbert space. This implies that the overwhelming majority of
states in Hilbert space are not physical as they can only be produced after an
exponentially long time. We establish this fact by making use of a
time-dependent generalization of the Suzuki-Trotter expansion, followed by a
counting argument. This also demonstrates that a computational model based on
arbitrarily rapidly changing Hamiltonians is no more powerful than the standard
quantum circuit model.
