We consider (local) parametrizations of Teichmuller space $T_{g,n}$ (of genus
$g$ hyperbolic surfaces with $n$ boundary components) by lengths of $6g-6+3n$
geodesics. We find a large family of suitable sets of $6g-6+3n$ geodesics, each
set forming a special structure called "admissible double pants decomposition".
For admissible double pants decompositions containing no double curves we show
that the lengths of curves contained in the decomposition determine the point
of $T_{g,n}$ up to finitely many choices. Moreover, these lengths provide a
local coordinate in a neighborhood of all points of $T_{g,n}\setminus X$, where
$X$ is a union of $3g-3+n$ hypersurfaces. Furthermore, there exists a groupoid
acting transitively on admissible double pants decompositions and generated by
transformations exchanging only one curve of the decomposition. The local
charts arising from different double pants decompositions compose an atlas
covering the Teichmuller space. The gluings of the adjacent charts are coming
from the elementary transformations of the decompositions, the gluing functions
are algebraic. The same charts provide an atlas for a large part of the
boundary strata in Deligne-Mumford compactification of the moduli space.
