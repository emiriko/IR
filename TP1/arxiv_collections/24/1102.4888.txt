Among various definitions of quantum correlations, quantum discord has
attracted considerable attention. To find analytical expression of quantum
discord is an intractable task. Exact results are known only for very special
states, namely, two-qubit X-shaped states. We present in this paper a geometric
viewpoint, from which two-qubit quantum discord can be described clearly. The
known results about X state discord are restated in the directly perceivable
geometric language. As a consequence, the dynamics of classical correlations
and quantum discord for an X state in the presence of decoherence is endowed
with geometric interpretation. More importantly, we extend the geometric method
to the case of more general states, for which numerical as well as analytica
results about quantum discord have not been found yet. Based on the support of
numerical computations, some conjectures are proposed to help us establish
geometric picture. We find that the geometric picture for these states has
intimate relationship with that for X states. Thereby in some cases analytical
expressions of classical correlations and quantum discord can be obtained.
