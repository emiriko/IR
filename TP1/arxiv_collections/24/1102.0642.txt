Numerical algorithms for solving problems of mathematical physics on modern
parallel computers employ various domain decomposition techniques. Domain
decomposition schemes are developed here to solve numerically initial/boundary
value problems for the Stokes system of equations in the primitive variables
pressure-velocity. Unconditionally stable schemes of domain decomposition are
based on the partition of unit for a computational domain and the corresponding
Hilbert spaces of grid functions.
