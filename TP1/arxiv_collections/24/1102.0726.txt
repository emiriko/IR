We analyze CP violation in supersymmetry with Effective Minimal Flavour
Violation, as recently proposed in arXiv:1011.0730. Unlike the case of standard
Minimal Flavour Violation, we show that all the phases allowed by the flavour
symmetry can be sizable without violating existing Electric Dipole Moment
constraints, thus solving the SUSY CP problem. The EDMs at one and two loops
are precisely analyzed as well as their correlations with the expected CP
asymmetries in B physics.
