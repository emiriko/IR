Deploying cloud computing in an enterprise infrastructure bring significant
security concerns. Successful implementation of cloud computing in an
enterprise requires proper planning and understanding of emerging risks,
threats, vulnerabilities, and possible countermeasures. We believe enterprise
should analyze the company/organization security risks, threats, and available
countermeasures before adopting this technology. In this paper, we have
discussed security risks and concerns in cloud computing and enlightened steps
that an enterprise can take to reduce security risks and protect their
resources. We have also explained cloud computing strengths/benefits,
weaknesses, and applicable areas in information risk management.
