We answer a weaker version of the classification problem for the homotopy
types of $(n-2)$-connected closed orientable $(2n-1)$-manifolds. Let $n\geq 6$
be an even integer, and $X$ be a $(n-2)$-connected finite orientable Poincar\'e
$(2n-1)$-complex such that $H^{n-1}(X;\mathbb{Q})=0$ and
$H^{n-1}(X;\mathbb{Z}_2)=0$. Then its loop space homotopy type is uniquely
determined by the action of higher Bockstein operations on
$H^{n-1}(X;\mathbb{Z}_p)$ for each odd prime $p$. A stronger result is obtained
when localized at odd primes.
