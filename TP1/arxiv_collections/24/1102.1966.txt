Given a singular Schubert variety Z in a compact Hermitian symmetric space it
is a longstanding question to determine when Z is homologous to a smooth
variety Y. We identify those Schubert varieties for which there exist
first-order obstructions to the existence of Y. This extends (independent) work
of M. Walters, R. Bryant and J. Hong.
  Key tools include: (i) a new characterization of Schubert varieties that
generalizes the well known description of the smooth Schubert varieties by
connected sub-diagrams of a Dynkin diagram; and (ii) an algebraic Laplacian (a
la Kostant), which is used to analyze the Lie algebra cohomology group
associated to the problem.
