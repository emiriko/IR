We present an efficient Monte-Carlo method for long-range interacting systems
to calculate free energy as a function of an order parameter. In this method, a
variant of the Wang-Landau method regarding the order parameter is combined
with the stochastic cutoff method, which has recently been developed for
long-range interacting systems. This method enables us to calculate free energy
in long-range interacting systems with reasonable computational time despite
the fact that no approximation is involved. This method is applied to a
three-dimensional magnetic dipolar system to measure free energy as a function
of magnetization. By using the present method, we can calculate free energy for
a large system size of $16^3$ spins despite the presence of long-range magnetic
dipolar interactions. We also discuss the merits and demerits of the present
method in comparison with the conventional Wang-Landau method in which free
energy is calculated from the joint density of states of energy and order
parameter.
