We have computed branching ratios of two-body nonleptonic B_c \to
X_{c\bar{c}}M decays, where X_{c\bar{c}} is the radially excited charmonium
\eta_c(2S) or \psi(2S) meson, and M is a pseudoscalar (P) or a vector (V) or an
axial-vector (A(^3P_1)) meson. We have assumed factorization hypothesis and
calculated the form factors in the nonrelativistic ISGW2 quark model. We have
found that some of these decays have branching ratios of the order of 10^{-3} -
10^{-4}.
