Reaction paths and probabilities are inferred, in a usual Monte Carlo or
Molecular Dynamic simulation, directly from the evolution of the positions of
the particles. The process becomes time-consuming in many interesting cases in
which the transition probabilities are small. A radically different approach
consists of setting up a computation scheme where the object whose time
evolution is simulated is the transition current itself. The relevant timescale
for such a computation is the one needed for the transition probability rate to
reach a stationary level, and this is usually substantially shorter than the
passage time of an individual system. As an example, we show, in the context of
the `benchmark' case of 38 particles interacting via the Lennard-Jones
potential (`LJ38' cluster), how this method may be used to explore the
reactions that take place between different phases, recovering efficiently
known results and uncovering new ones with small computational effort.
