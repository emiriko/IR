We discuss the stability properties of an autonomous system in loop quantum
cosmology. The system is described by a self-interacting scalar field $\phi$
with positive potential $V$, coupled with a barotropic fluid in the Universe.
With $\Gamma=VV"/V'^2$ considered as a function of $\lambda=V'/V$, the
autonomous system is extended from three dimensions to four dimensions. We find
that the dynamic behaviors of a subset, not all, of the fixed points are
independent of the form of the potential. Considering the higher-order
derivatives of the potential, we get an infinite-dimensional autonomous system
which can describe the dynamical behavior of the scalar field with more general
potential. We find that there is just one scalar-field-dominated scaling
solution in the loop quantum cosmology scenario.
