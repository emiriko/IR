We study the relationship between the differential conductance and the local
density of states in tight-binding tunnel junctions where the junction'
geometry can be varied between the point-contact and the planar-contact limits.
The conductances are found to differ significantly in these two limiting cases.
We also examine how the matrix element influences the tunneling characteristics
and produces contrast in a simple model of scanning tunneling microscope (STM).
Some implications regarding the interpretation of STM spectroscopic data in the
cuprates are discussed. The calculations are carried out within the real-space
Keldysh formalism.
