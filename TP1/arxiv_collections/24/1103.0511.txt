In this paper we present the results of a survey for radio transients using
data obtained from the Very Large Array archive. We have reduced, using a
pipeline procedure, 5037 observations of the most common pointings - i.e. the
calibrator fields. These fields typically contain a relatively bright point
source and are used to calibrate `target' observations: they are therefore
rarely imaged themselves. The observations used span a time range ~ 1984 - 2008
and consist of eight different pointings, three different frequencies (8.4, 4.8
and 1.4 GHz) and have a total observing time of 435 hours. We have searched for
transient and variable radio sources within these observations using components
from the prototype LOFAR transient detection system. In this paper we present
the methodology for reducing large volumes of Very Large Array data; and we
also present a brief overview of the prototype LOFAR transient detection
algorithms. No radio transients were detected in this survey, therefore we
place an upper limit on the snapshot rate of GHz frequency transients > 8.0 mJy
to rho less than or equal to 0.032 deg^-2 that have typical timescales 4.3 to
45.3 days. We compare and contrast our upper limit with the snapshot rates -
derived from either detections or non-detections of transient and variable
radio sources - reported in the literature. When compared with the current Log
N - Log S distribution formed from previous surveys, we show that our upper
limit is consistent with the observed population. Current and future radio
transient surveys will hopefully further constrain these statistics, and
potentially discover dominant transient source populations. In this paper we
also briefly explore the current transient commissioning observations with
LOFAR, and the impact they will make on the field.
