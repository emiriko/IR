The Hagedorn temperature, T_H is determined from the number of hadronic
resonances including all mesons and baryons. This leads to a stable result T_H
= 174 MeV consistent with the critical and the chemical freeze-out temperatures
at zero chemical potential. We use this result to calculate the speed of sound
and other thermodynamic quantities in the resonance hadron gas model for a wide
range of baryon chemical potentials following the chemical freeze-out curve. We
compare some of our results to those obtained previously in other papers.
