Offering of different attractive opportunities by different wireless
technologies trends the convergence of heterogeneous networks for the future
wireless communication system. To make a seamless handover among the
heterogeneous networks, the optimization of the power consumption, and optimal
selection of interface are the challenging issues for convergence networks. The
access of multi interfaces simultaneously reduces the handover latency and data
loss in heterogeneous handover. The mobile node (MN) maintains one interface
connection while other interface is used for handover process. However, it
causes much battery power consumption. In this paper we propose an efficient
interface selection scheme including interface selection algorithms, interface
selection procedures considering battery power consumption and user mobility
with other existing parameters for overlaying networks. We also propose a
priority based network selection scheme according to the service types. MN's
battery power level, provision of QoS/QoE in the target network and our
proposed priority parameters are considered as more important parameters for
our interface selection algorithm. The performances of the proposed scheme are
verified using numerical analysis.
