In this paper, we introduce a class of indicators that enable to compute
efficiently optimal transport plans associated to arbitrary distributions of N
demands and M supplies in R in the case where the cost function is concave. The
computational cost of these indicators is small and independent of N. A
hierarchical use of them enables to obtain an efficient algorithm.
