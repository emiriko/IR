We consider the free boundary problem for current-vortex sheets in ideal
incompressible magneto-hydrodynamics. It is known that current-vortex sheets
may be at most weakly (neutrally) stable due to the existence of surface waves
solutions to the linearized equations. The existence of such waves may yield a
loss of derivatives in the energy estimate of the solution with respect to the
source terms. However, under a suitable stability condition satisfied at each
point of the initial discontinuity and a flatness condition on the initial
front, we prove an a priori estimate in Sobolev spaces for smooth solutions
with no loss of derivatives. The result of this paper gives some hope for
proving the local existence of smooth current-vortex sheets without resorting
to a Nash-Moser iteration. Such result would be a rigorous confirmation of the
stabilizing effect of the magnetic field on Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities,
which is well known in astrophysics.
