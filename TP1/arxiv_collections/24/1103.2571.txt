We present a scale invariant extension of the standard model with new
QCD-like strong interaction in the hidden sector. A scale $\Lambda_H$ is
dynamically generated in the hidden sector by dimensional transmutation, and
chiral symmetry breaking occurs in the hidden sector. This scale is transmitted
to the SM sector by a real singlet scalar messenger S, and can trigger
electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). Thus all the mass scales in this model
arises from the hidden sector scale $\Lambda_H$ which has quantum mechanical
origin. Furthermore the lightest hadrons in the hidden sector is stable by the
flavor conservation of the hidden sector strong interaction, could be the cold
dark matter (CDM). We study collider phenomenology, and relic density and
direct detection rates of the CDM of this model.
