We propose two lattice models in one dimension, with stochastically hopping
particles which aggregate on contact. The hops are guided by "velocity rates"
which themselves evolve according to the rules of ballistic aggregation as in a
sticky gas in continuum. Our lattice models have both velocity and density
fields and an appropriate real time evolution, such that they can be compared
directly with event driven molecular dynamics (MD) results for the sticky gas.
We demonstrate numerically that the long time and large distance behavior of
the lattice models are identical to that of the MD, and some exact results
known for the sticky gas. In particular, the exactly predicted form of the
non-Gaussian tail of the velocity distribution function is clearly exhibited.
This correspondence of the lattice models and the sticky gas in continuum is
nontrivial, as the latter has a deterministic dynamics with local kinematic
constraint, in contrast with the former; yet the spatial velocity profiles
(with shocks) of the lattice models and the MD have striking match.
