The stochastic dynamics of the damped harmonic oscillator in a heat bath is
simulated with an algorithm that is exact for time steps of arbitrary size.
Exact analytical results are given for correlation functions and power spectra
in the form they acquire when computed from experimental time-lapse recordings.
Three applications are discussed: (i) Effects of finite sampling-rate and
-time, described exactly here, are similar for other stochastic dynamical
systems-e.g. motile micro-organisms and their time-lapse recorded trajectories.
(ii) The same statistics is satisfied by any experimental system to the extent
it is interpreted as a damped harmonic oscillator at finite temperature-such as
an AFM cantilever. (iii) Three other models of fundamental interest are
limiting cases of the damped harmonic oscillator at finite temperature; it
consequently bridges their differences and describes effects of finite sampling
rate and sampling time for these models as well. Finally, we give a brief
discussion of nondimensionalization.
