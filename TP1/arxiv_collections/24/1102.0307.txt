Large scale quantum computers will consist of many interacting qubits. In
this paper we expand the two flux qubit coupling scheme first devised in [Phys.
Rev. B {\bf 70}, 140501 (2004)] and realized in [Science {\bf 314}, 1427
(2006)] to a three-qubit, two-coupler scenario. We study L-shaped and
line-shaped coupler geometries, and show how the interaction strength between
qubits changes in terms of the couplers' dimensions. We explore two cases: the
"on-state" where the interaction energy between two nearest-neighbor qubits is
high, and the "off-state" where it is turned off. In both situations we study
the undesirable crosstalk with the third qubit. Finally, we use the GRAPE
algorithm to find efficient pulse sequences for two-qubit gates subject to our
calculated physical constraints on the coupling strength.
