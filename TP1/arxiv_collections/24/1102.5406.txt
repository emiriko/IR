We report on the formation and development of the photonic band gap in
two-dimensional 8-, 10- and 12-fold symmetry quasicrystalline lattices of low
index contrast. Finite size structures made of dielectric cylindrical rods were
studied and measured in the microwave region, and their properties compared
with a conventional hexagonal crystal. Band gap characteristics were
investigated by changing the direction of propagation of the incident beam
inside the crystal. Various angles of incidence from 0 \degree to 30\degree
were used in order to investigate the isotropic nature of the band gap. The
arbitrarily high rotational symmetry of aperiodically ordered structures could
be practically exploited to manufacture isotropic band gap materials, which are
perfectly suitable for hosting waveguides or cavities.
