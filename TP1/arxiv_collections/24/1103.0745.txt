The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board of the Fermi satellite detected
emission above 30 MeV only in a small fraction of the long gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) at 8 keV - 10 MeV.
Those bursts that were detected by the LAT were among the brightest GBM bursts.
We examine a sample of the most luminous GBM bursts with no LAT detection and
obtain upper limits on their high energy fluence. We find an average upper
limit of LAT/GBM fluence ratio of 0.13 for GeV fluence during $T_{90}$ and an
average upper limit ratio of 0.45 for GeV fluence during the first 600 seconds
after the trigger. These ratios strongly constrain various emission models and
in particular rule out SSC models for the prompt emission. In about a third of
both LAT detected and LAT non-detected bursts, we find that the extrapolation
of the MeV range Band spectrum to the GeV range is larger than the observed GeV
fluence (or its upper limit). While this excess is not highly significant for
any specific burst, the overall excess in a large fraction of the bursts
suggests a decline in the high energy spectral slope in at least some of these
bursts. Possibly an evidence for the long sought after pair creation limit.
