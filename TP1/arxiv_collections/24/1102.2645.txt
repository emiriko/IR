A prismatoid is a polytope with all its vertices contained in two parallel
facets, called its bases. Its width is the number of steps needed to go from
one base to the other in the dual graph. The author recently showed in
arXiv:1006.2814 that the existence of counter-examples to the Hirsch conjecture
is equivalent to that of $d$-prismatoids of width larger than $d$, and
constructed such prismatoids in dimension five. Here we show that the same is
impossible in dimension four. This is proved by looking at the pair of graph
embeddings on a 2-sphere that arise from the normal fans of the two bases of
$Q$.
