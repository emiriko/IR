In this paper we consider the achievable rate region of the Gaussian Multiple
Access Channel (MAC) when suboptimal transmission schemes are employed.
Focusing on the two-user MAC and assuming uncoded Pulse Amplitude Modulation
(PAM), we derive a rate region that is a pentagon, and propose a strategy with
which it can be achieved. We also compare the region with outer bounds and with
orthogonal transmission.
