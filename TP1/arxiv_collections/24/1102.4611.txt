The use of discrete symmetries, especially abelian ones, in physics beyond
the standard model of particle physics is discussed. A method is developed how
a general, abelian, discrete symmetry can be obtained via spontaneous symmetry
breaking. In addition, anomalies are treated in the path integral approach with
special attention to anomaly cancellation via the Green-Schwarz mechanism. All
this is applied to the minimal supersymmetric standard model. A unique Z_4^R
symmetry is discovered which solves the \mu-problem as well as problems with
proton decay and allows to embed the standard model gauge group into a simple
group, i.e. the Z_4^R is compatible with grand unification. Also the flavor
problem in the context of minimal flavor violation is addressed. Finally, a
string theory model is presented which exhibits the mentioned Z_4^R symmetry
and other desirable features.
