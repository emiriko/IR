The statistical theory of multiple exciton generation in quantum dots which
is based on the Fermi approach to the problem of multiple particle in
nucleon-nucleon collisions is presented. Our estimates of the multiple exciton
generation efficiency in different quantum dots, induced by absorption of a
single photon, are in a good agreement with the experimental data.
