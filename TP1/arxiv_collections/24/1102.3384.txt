Self-organized monolayers of highly flexible \Frechet dendrons were deposited
on graphite surfaces by solution casting. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)
reveals an unprecedented variety of patterns with up to seven stable
hierarchical ordering motifs serving as a versatile model system. The essential
molecular properties determined by molecular mechanics simulations are
condensed to a coarse grained interaction site model of various chain
configurations. In a Monte Carlo approach with random starting configurations
the experimental pattern diversity can be reproduced in all facets of the local
and global ordering. Based on an energy analysis of the Monte Carlo and
molecular mechanics modeling the thermodynamically most stable pattern is
predicted coinciding with the pattern, which dominates in the STM images after
several hours or upon moderate heating.
