We study the black hole particle production in a regular spacetime metric
obtained in a minisuperspace approach to loop quantum gravity. In different
previous papers the static solution was obtained and shown to be
singularity-free and self-dual. In this paper expanding a previous study of the
black hole dynamics we repeat the Hawking analysis which leads to a thermal
flux of particles at the future infinity. The evaporation time is infinite and
the unitarity is recovered due to the regularity of the spacetime and to the
characteristic behavior of the surface gravity.
