We survey the use of spectroscopic imaging STM to probe the electronic
structure of underdoped cuprates. Two distinct classes of electronic states are
observed in both the d-wave superconducting (dSC) and the pseudogap (PG)
phases. The first class consists of the dispersive Bogoliubov quasiparticle
excitations of a homogeneous d-wave superconductor, existing below a lower
energy scale E=Delta0. We find that the Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference
signatures of delocalized Cooper pairing are restricted to a k-space arc which
terminates near the lines connecting k=\pm(pi/a0,0) to k=\pm(pi/a0). This arc
shrinks continuously with decreasing hole density such that Luttinger's theorem
could be satisfied if it represents the front side of a hole-pocket which is
bounded behind by the lines between k=\pm(pi/a0,0) and k=\pm(0,pi/a0). In both
phases the only broken symmetries detected for the |E|<Delta0 states are those
of a d-wave superconductor. The second class of states occurs proximate to the
pseudogap energy scale E=Delta1. Here the non-dispersive electronic structure
breaks the expected 90o-rotational symmetry of electronic structure within each
unit cell, at least down to 180o-rotational symmetry. This Q=0 electronic
symmetry breaking was first detected as an electronic inequivalence at the two
oxygen sites within each unit cell by using a measure of nematic (C2) symmetry.
Incommensurate non-dispersive conductance modulations, locally breaking both
rotational and translational symmetries, coexist with this intra-unit-cell
electronic symmetry breaking at E=Delta1. Their characteristic wavevector Q is
determined by the k-space points where Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference
terminates and therefore changes continuously with doping. The distinct broken
electronic symmetry states (Q=0 and finite Q) coexisting at E~Delta1 are found
to be indistinguishable in the dSC and PG phases.
