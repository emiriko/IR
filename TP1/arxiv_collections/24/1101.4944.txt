We present a Chandra X-ray Observatory investigation of the millisecond
pulsars (MSPs) in the globular cluster M28 (NGC 6626). In what is one of the
deepest X-ray observations of a globular cluster, we firmly detect seven and
possibly detect two of the twelve known M28 pulsars. With the exception of PSRs
B1821-24 and J1824-2452H, the detected pulsars have relatively soft spectra,
with X-ray luminosities 10^30-31 ergs s^-1 (0.3-8 keV),similar to most
"recycled" pulsars in 47 Tucanae and the field of the Galaxy, implying thermal
emission from the pulsar magnetic polar caps. We present the most detailed
X-ray spectrum to date of the energetic PSR B1821-24. It is well described by a
purely non-thermal spectrum with spectral photon index 1.23 and luminosity
1.4x10^33Theta(D/5.5 kpc)^2 ergs s^-1 (0.3-8 keV), where Theta is the fraction
of the sky covered by the X-ray emission beam(s). We find no evidence for the
previously reported line emission feature around 3.3 keV, most likely as a
consequence of improvements in instrument calibration. The X-ray spectrum and
pulse profile of PSR B1821--24 suggest that the bulk of unpulsed emission from
this pulsar is not of thermal origin, and is likely due to low-level
non-thermal magnetospheric radiation, an unresolved pulsar wind nebula, and/or
small-angle scattering of the pulsed X-rays by interstellar dust grains. The
peculiar binary PSR J1824-2452H shows a relatively hard X-ray spectrum and
possible variability at the binary period, indicative of an intrabinary shock
formed by interaction between the relativistic pulsar wind and matter from its
non-degenerate companion star.
