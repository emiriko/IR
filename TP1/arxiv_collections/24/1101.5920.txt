The data recently obtained by PAMELA and ATIC show the presence of the peak
in the cosmic positron spectrum at energies above 100 GeV. In this paper it has
been shown that the peak can arise due to processes of the interaction of
cosmic rays with neutralino dark matter, which are accompanied by chargino
production and its leptonic decay.
