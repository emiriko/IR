Let $\mathcal{O}(U)$ denote the algebra of holomorphic functions on an open
subset $U\subset\mathbb{C}^n$ and $Z\subset\mathcal{O}(U)$ its
finite-dimensional vector subspace. By the theory of least space of de Boor and
Ron, there exists a projection $T_b$ from the local ring $\mathcal{O}_{n,b}$
onto the space $Z_b$ of germs of elements of $Z$ at $b$. At general $b\in U$,
its kernel is an ideal and induces a structure of an Artinian algebra on $Z_b$.
In particular, it holds at points where $k$-th jets of elements of $Z$ form a
vector bundle for each $k\le\dim_{\mathbb{C}}Z_b-1$. Using $T_b$ we define the
Taylor projector of order $d$ on an embedded curve $X\subset\mathbb{C}^m$ at a
general point $\boldsymbol{a}\in X$, generalising results of Bos and Calvi. It
is a retraction of $\mathcal{O}_{X,a}$ onto the set of the polynomial functions
on $X_a$ of degree up to $d$. For an embedded manifold $X\subset\mathbb{C}^m$,
we introduce a set of higher order tangents following Bos and Calvi and show a
zero-estimate for a system of generators of the maximal ideal of
$\mathbb{C}\{t-b\}$ at general $b\in X$. It means that $X$ is embedded in
$\mathbb{C}^n$ in not very highly transcendental manner at a general point.
