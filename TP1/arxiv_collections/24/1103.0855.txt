In this work we describe in detail the "Chopped RAndom Basis" (CRAB) optimal
control technique recently introduced to optimize t-DMRG simulations
[arXiv:1003.3750]. Here we study the efficiency of this control technique in
optimizing different quantum processes and we show that in the considered cases
we obtain results equivalent to those obtained via different optimal control
methods while using less resources. We propose the CRAB optimization as a
general and versatile optimal control technique.
