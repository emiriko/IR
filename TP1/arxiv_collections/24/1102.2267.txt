The existence of a higher nodal band state with a $^{3}$He cluster structure,
i.e. a vibrational mode in which the inter-cluster relative motion is excited,
in $^{19}$Ne in addition to those with the $\alpha$ cluster structure in
$^{20}$Ne and the $^{16}$O cluster structure in $^{32}$S, is suggested, which
reinforces the importance of the concept of $^3$He-clustering in nuclei. This
conclusion was reached by investigating $^{3}$He scattering from $^{16}$O in a
wide range of incident energies and prerainbow oscillations.
