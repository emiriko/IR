Electron diffusion in a liquid xenon time projection chamber has recently
been used to infer the $z$ coordinate of a particle interaction, from the width
of the electron signal. The goal of this technique is to reduce the background
event rate by discriminating edge events from bulk events. Analyses of dark
matter search data which employ it would benefit from increased longitudinal
electron diffusion. We show that a significant increase is expected if the
applied electric field is decreased. This observation is trivial to implement
but runs contrary to conventional wisdom and practice. We also extract a first
measurement of the longitudinal diffusion coefficient, and confirm the
expectation that electron diffusion in liquid xenon is highly anisotropic under
typical operating conditions.
