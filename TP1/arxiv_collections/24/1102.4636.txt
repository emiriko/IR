The aim of illocutionary logic is to explain how context can affect the
meaning of certain special kinds of performative utterances. Recall that
performative utterances are understood as follows: a speaker performs the
illocutionary act (e.g. act of assertion, of conjecture, of promise) with the
illocutionary force (resp. assertion, conjecture, promise) named by an
appropriate performative verb in the way of representing himself as performing
that act. In the paper I proposed many-valued interpretation of illocutionary
forces understood as modal operators. As a result, I built up a non-Archimedean
valued logic for formalizing illocutionary acts. A formal many-valued approach
to illocutionary logic was offered for the first time.
