The tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole provides us with
a rare glimpse of these otherwise dormant beasts. It has long been predicted
that the disruption will be accompanied by a thermal `flare', powered by the
accretion of bound stellar debris. Several candidate disruptions have been
discovered in this manner at optical, UV and X-ray wavelengths. Here we explore
the observational consequences if a modest fraction of the accretion power is
channeled into an ultra-relativistic outflow. We show that a relativistic jet
decelerates due to its interaction with the interstellar medium at sub-parsec
distances from the black hole. Synchrotron radiation from electrons accelerated
by the reverse shock powers a bright radio-infrared transient that peaks on a
timescale ~1 yr after disruption. Emission from the forward shock may be
detectable for several years after the peak. Deep radio follow-up observations
of tidal disruption candidates at late times can test for the presence of
relativistic ejecta. Upcoming radio transient surveys may independently
discover tens to hundreds of tidal disruptions per year, complimenting searches
at other wavelengths. Non-thermal emission from tidal disruption probes the
physics of jet formation under relatively clean conditions, in which the flow
parameters are independently constrained.
