We investigate the fabrication of electrical contacts using ion- and
electron-beam induced deposition of platinum at the sub-\mu m scale. Halos
associated with the metal surface decoration are characterized electrically in
the 0.05-2 \mu m range using transport measurements, conducting atomic force
microscopy and Kelvin probe microscopy. In contrast with IBID, EBID electrodes
exhibit weakly conductive halos at the sub-\mu m scale, and can thus be used to
achieve resist-free electrical contacts for transport measurements at the
sub-\mu m scale. Four-point transport measurements using \mu m-spaced EBID
contacts are provided in the case of a multiwalled carbon nanotube.
