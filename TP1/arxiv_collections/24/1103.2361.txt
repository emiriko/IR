We present a theoretical study of near-field heat transfer between two
anisotropic materials separated by a small vacuum gap and maintained in a
stationary non-equilibrium thermal situation. By combining standard stochastic
electrodynamics and the Maxwell-Garnett description for effective media, we
show that heat flux can be significantly enhanced by air inclusions. This
result is explained by : (a) the presence of extraordinary surface waves that
give rise to supplementary channels for heat transfer throughout the gap, (b)
an increase in the contribution given by the ordinary surface waves at
resonance, (c) and the appearance of frustrated modes over a broad spectral
range.
