QPACE is a novel massively parallel architecture optimized for lattice QCD
simulations. A single QPACE node is based on the IBM PowerXCell 8i processor.
The nodes are interconnected by a custom 3-dimensional torus network
implemented on an FPGA. The compute power of the processor is provided by 8
Synergistic Processing Units. Making efficient use of these accelerator cores
in scientific applications is challenging. In this paper we describe our
strategies for porting applications to the QPACE architecture and report on
performance numbers.
