The u- and d-quark contributions to the elastic nucleon electromagnetic form
factors have been determined using experimental data on GEn, GMn, GpE, and GpM.
Such a flavor separation of the form factors became possible up to 3.4 GeV2
with recent data on GEn from Hall A at JLab. At a negative four-momentum
transfer squared Q2 above 1 GeV2, for both the u- and d-quark components, the
ratio of the Pauli form factor to the Dirac form factor, F2/F1, was found to be
almost constant, and for each of F2 and F1 individually, the d-quark portions
of both form factors drop continuously with increasing Q2.
