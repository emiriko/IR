We describe the design and FPGA implementation of a 3D torus network (TNW) to
provide nearest-neighbor communications between commodity multi-core
processors. The aim of this project is to build up tightly interconnected and
scalable parallel systems for scientific computing. The design includes the
VHDL code to implement on latest FPGA devices a network processor, which can be
accessed by the CPU through a PCIe interface and which controls the external
PHYs of the physical links. Moreover, a Linux driver and a library implementing
custom communication APIs are provided. The TNW has been successfully
integrated in two recent parallel machine projects, QPACE and AuroraScience. We
describe some details of the porting of the TNW for the AuroraScience system
and report performance results.
