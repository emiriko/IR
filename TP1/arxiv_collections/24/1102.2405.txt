We define a logical framework with singleton types and one universe of small
types. We give the semantics using a PER model; it is used for constructing a
normalisation-by-evaluation algorithm. We prove completeness and soundness of
the algorithm; and get as a corollary the injectivity of type constructors.
Then we give the definition of a correct and complete type-checking algorithm
for terms in normal form. We extend the results to proof-irrelevant
propositions.
