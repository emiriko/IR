We use the properties of the Matuszewska indices to show asymptotic
inequalities for hazard rates. We discuss the relation between membership in
the classes of dominatedly or extended rapidly varying tail distributions and
corresponding hazard rate conditions. Convolution closure is established for
the class of distributions with extended rapidly varying tails.
