For an asymmetric double-well potential system, it is shown that, if the
potential is quadratic until it reaches several times of the zero-point
energies from the bottoms in each well, the energy eigenvalues of the low lying
excited states of the double-well system must be close to the eigenvalues of
the quadratic potentials. These eigenvalue structures suggest a method for the
coherent control of the tunneling as well as realizing almost complete
localization of the wave packet in one of the wells, by handling the
double-well asymmetry. Numerical examples are included to indicate that the
method could be useful also in a more general potential, and to propose
experimental confirmations.
