We investigate the interplay between ferromagnetic and superconducting order
at the edge of a quantum spin Hall insulator. Using complementary analytical
and self-consistent numerical approaches, we study a ferromagnetic Josephson
junction and show how the direct coupling between magnetism and the
superconducting U(1) phase gives rise to several unusual phenomena which
distinguishes the present system from its non-topological equivalent. In
particular, we demonstrate how the anomalous current-phase relation triggers
supercurrent-induced magnetization dynamics and also study the spatial
localization of the Majorana fermions appearing in the junction.
