Broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting is used to study a deep
sample of UV-selected sub-L* galaxies at z~2. They are found to be less dusty
than L* galaxies, and to contribute more mass to the cosmic mass budget at this
epoch than is inferred from shallower high-z surveys. Additionally, SFRs are
found to be proportional to stellar masses over three orders of magnitude in
mass; this phenomenon can be explained by assuming that new stars form out of
gas that co-accretes along with dark matter onto the galaxies' dark matter
halos, a scenario that naturally leads to SFRs that gradually increase with
time.
