Unconventional symmetries of the order parameter allowed some researchers to
maintain that a purely repulsive interaction between electrons provides
superconductivity without phonons in a number of high-temperature
superconductors. It is shown that the Cooper pairing in p and d states is not
possible with the realistic Coulomb repulsion between fermions at relevant
temperatures in any dimension.
