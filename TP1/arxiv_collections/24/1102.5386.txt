We present and study linear programming based detectors for two-dimensional
intersymbol interference channels. Interesting instances of two-dimensional
intersymbol interference channels are magnetic storage, optical storage and
Wyner's cellular network model.
  We show that the optimal maximum a posteriori detection in such channels
lends itself to a natural linear programming based sub-optimal detector. We
call this the Pairwise linear program detector. Our experiments show that the
Pairwise linear program detector performs poorly. We then propose two methods
to strengthen our detector. These detectors are based on systematically
enhancing the Pairwise linear program. The first one, the Block linear program
detector adds higher order potential functions in an {\em exhaustive} manner,
as constraints, to the Pairwise linear program detector. We show by experiments
that the Block linear program detector has performance close to the optimal
detector. We then develop another detector by
  {\em adaptively} adding frustrated cycles to the Pairwise linear program
detector. Empirically, this detector also has performance close to the optimal
one and turns out to be less complex then the Block linear program detector.
