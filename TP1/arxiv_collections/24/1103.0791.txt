Using numerical simulations, we perform an extensive finite-size analysis of
the transverse diffusion coefficient in a sheared 2D amorphous solid, over a
broad range of strain rates, at temperatures up to the supercooled liquid
regime. We thus obtain direct qualitative evidence for the persistence of
correlations between elementary plastic events up to the vicinity of the glass
transition temperature $T_g$. A quantitative analysis of the data, combined
with a previous study of the $T$- and $\dot\gamma$-dependence of the
macroscopic stress \cite{ChattorajCaroliLemaitre2010}, leads us to conclude
that the average avalanche size remains essentially unaffected by temperature
up to $T\sim0.75 T_g$.
