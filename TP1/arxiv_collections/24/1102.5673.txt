We consider the MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) Gaussian interference
channel with i.i.d. fading across antennas and channel uses and with the
delayed local channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT). For the
two-user case, achievability results for the degrees of freedom (DoF) region of
this channel are provided. We also prove the tightness of our achievable DoF
region for some antenna configurations. Interestingly, there are some cases in
which the DoF region with delayed local CSIT is identical to the DoF region
with perfect CSIT and that is strictly larger than the DoF region with no CSIT.
We then consider the $K$-user MISO (multiple-input single-output) IC and show
that the degrees of freedom of this channel could be greater than one with
delayed local CSIT.
