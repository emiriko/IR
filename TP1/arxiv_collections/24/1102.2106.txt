Shifting electrically a magnetic domain wall (DW) by the spin transfer
mechanism is one of the future ways foreseen for the switching of spintronic
memories or registers. The classical geometries where the current is injected
in the plane of the magnetic layers suffer from a poor efficiency of the
intrinsic torques acting on the DWs. A way to circumvent this problem is to use
vertical current injection. In that case, theoretical calculations attribute
the microscopic origin of DW displacements to the out-of-plane (field-like)
spin transfer torque. Here we report experiments in which we controllably
displace a DW in the planar electrode of a magnetic tunnel junction by vertical
current injection. Our measurements confirm the major role of the out-of-plane
spin torque for DW motion, and allow to quantify this term precisely. The
involved current densities are about 100 times smaller than the one commonly
observed with in-plane currents. Step by step resistance switching of the
magnetic tunnel junction opens a new way for the realization of spintronic
memristive devices.
