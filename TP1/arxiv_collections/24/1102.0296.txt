Solitons of a discrete nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation which includes the
next-nearest-neighbor interactions are studied by means of a variational
approximation and numerical computations. A large family of multi-humped
solutions, including those with a nontrivial phase structure which are a
feature particular to the next-nearest-neighbor interaction model, are
accurately predicted by the variational approximation. Bifurcations linking
solutions with the trivial and nontrivial phase structures are also captured
remarkably well, including a prediction of critical parameter values.
