The question of the averaging of inhomogeneous spacetimes in cosmology is
important for the correct interpretation of cosmological data. In this paper we
suggest a conceptually simpler approach to averaging in cosmology based on the
averaging of scalars within unimodular gravity. As an illustration, we consider
the example of an exact spherically symmetric dust model, and show that within
this approach averaging introduces correlations (corrections) to the effective
dynamical evolution equation in the form of a spatial curvature term.
