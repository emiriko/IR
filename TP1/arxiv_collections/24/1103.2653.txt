Each and every energy dependent partial-wave analysis is parameterizing the
pole positions in a procedure defined by the way how the continuous energy
dependence is implemented. These pole positions are, henceforth, inherently
model dependent. To reduce this model dependence, we use only one,
coupled-channel, unitary, fully analytic method based on the isobar
approximation to extract the pole positions from the each available member of
the worldwide collection of partial wave amplitudes which are understood as
nothing more but a good energy dependent representation of genuine experimental
numbers assembled in a form of partial-wave data. In that way, the model
dependence related to the different assumptions on the analytic form of the
partial-wave amplitudes is avoided, and the true confidence limit for the
existence of a particular resonant state, at least in one model, is
established. The way how the method works, and first results are demonstrated
for the S11 partial wave.
