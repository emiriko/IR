We introduce a simple optical gate to fuse arbitrary size polarization
entangled W-states to prepare larger W-states. The gate requires a polarizing
beam splitter (PBS), a half wave plate (HWP) and two photon detectors. We study
numerically and analytically the necessary resource consumption for preparing
larger W-states by fusing smaller ones with the proposed fusion gate. We show
analytically that resource requirement scales at most sub-exponentially with
the increasing size of the state to be prepared. We numerically determine the
resource cost for fusion without recycling where W-states of arbitrary size can
be optimally prepared. Moreover, we introduce another strategy which is based
on recycling and outperforms the optimal strategy for non-recycling case.
