We introduce a version of Aubry-Mather theory for the length functional of
causal curves in compact Lorentzian manifolds. Results include the existence of
maximal invariant measures, calibrations and calibrated curves. We prove two
versions of the Mather's graph theorem. A class of examples, the Lorentzian
Hedlund examples, shows the optimality of the obtained results.
