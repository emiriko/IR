Recent proposals of topological flat band (TFB) models have provided a new
route to realize the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) without Landau
levels. We study hard-core bosons with short-range interactions in two
representative TFB models, one of which is the well known Haldane model (but
with different parameters). We demonstrate that FQHE states emerge with
signatures of even number of quasi-degenerate ground states on a torus and a
robust spectrum gap separating these states from higher energy spectrum. We
also establish quantum phase diagrams for the filling factor 1/2 and illustrate
quantum phase transitions to other competing symmetry-breaking phases.
