The main properties of magnetized strangelets, namely, their energy per
baryon, radius and electric charge, are studied. Temperature effects are also
taken into account in order to study their stability compared to the 56Fe
isotope and non-magnetized strangelets using the liquid drop model. Massive
quarks are considered with the aim to have a more realistic description for
strangelets in the astrophysical context and the environment of heavy ion
colliders, playing also an important role in the thermodynamical quantities of
the quark gas. It is concluded that the presence of a magnetic field tends to
stabilize more the strangelets, even when temperature effects are taken into
account. Magnetized strangelets in a paired superconductor phase (magnetized
color flavor locked phase) are also discussed. It is shown that they are more
stable than ordinary magnetized strangelets for typical gap values of the order
of O(100) MeV.
