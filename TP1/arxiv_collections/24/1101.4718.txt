In this paper, we generalize the simple Euclidean 1-center approximation
algorithm of Badoiu and Clarkson (2003) to Riemannian geometries and study
accordingly the convergence rate. We then show how to instantiate this generic
algorithm to two particular cases: (1) hyperbolic geometry, and (2) Riemannian
manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices.
