In this work, we investigate the decay widths and the line shapes of the
open-charm radiative and pionic decays of Y(4274) with the
$D_s\bar{D}_{s0}(2317)$ molecular charmonium assignment. Our calculation
indicates that the decay widths of $Y(4274)\to D^{+}_{s}D^{*-}_{s}\gamma$ and
$Y(4274)\to D^+_{s}D^-_{s}\pi^0$ can reach up to 0.05 keV and 0.75 keV,
respectively. In addition, the result of the line shape of the photon spectrum
of $Y(4274)\to D_s^+ {D}_s^{*-} \gamma$ shows that there exists a very sharp
peak near the large end point of photon energy. The line shape of the pion
spectrum of $Y(4274)\to D_s^+ {D}_s^{*-} \pi^0$ is similar to that of the pion
spectrum of $Y(4274)\to D_s^+ {D}_s^{*-} \gamma$, where we also find a very
sharp peak near the large end point of pion energy. According to our
calculation, we suggest further experiments to carry out the search for the
open-charm radiative and pionic decays of Y(4274).
