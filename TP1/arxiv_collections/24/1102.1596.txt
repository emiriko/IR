At mean-field level the t-J model shows a phase diagram with close analogies
to the phase diagram of hole doped cuprates. An order parameter associated with
the flux or $d$ charge-density wave ($d$-CDW) phase competes and coexists with
superconductivity at low doping showing characteristics identified with the
observed pseudogap in underdoped cuprates. In addition, in the $d$-CDW state
the Fermi surface is reconstructed toward pockets with low spectral weight in
the outer part, resembling the arcs observed in angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy experiments. However, the $d$-CDW requires broken translational
symmetry, a fact that is not completely accepted. Including self-energy
corrections beyond the mean, field we found that the self-energy can be written
as two distinct contributions. One of these (called $\Sigma_{flux}$) dominates
at low energy and originates from the scattering between carriers and $d$-CDW
fluctuations in proximity to the $d$-CDW instability. The second contribution
(called $\Sigma_{R\lambda}$) dominates at large energy and originates from the
scattering between charge fluctuations under the constraint of non double
occupancy. In this paper it is shown that $\Sigma_{flux}$ is responsible for
the origin of low-energy features in the spectral function as a pseudogap and
Fermi arcs. The obtained doping and temperature dependence of the pseudogap and
Fermi arcs is similar to that observed in experiments. At low energy,
$\Sigma_{R \lambda}$ gives an additional contribution to the closure of the
pseudogap.
