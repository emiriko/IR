SuperB experiment could represent an ideal environment to test a new U (1)
symmetry related to light dark forces candidates. A promising discovery channel
is represented by the resonant production of a boson U, followed by its decay
into lepton pairs. Beyond approximations adopted in the literature, an exact
tree level calculation of the radiative processes $e+ e- \rightarrow \gamma, U
\rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^- \gamma, e^+ e^- \gamma$ and corresponding QED
backgrounds is performed, including also the most important higher-order
corrections. The calculation is implemented in a release of the generator
BabaYaga@NLO useful for data analysis and interpretation. The distinct features
of U boson production are shown and the statistical significance is analysed.
