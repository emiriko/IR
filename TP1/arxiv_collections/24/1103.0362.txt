In this paper, we introduce a simplified model for explaining the
observations of the optical intraday variability (IDV) of the BL Lac Objects.
We assume that the source of the IDV are the stochastic oscillations of an
accretion disk around a supermassive black hole. The Stochastic Fluctuations on
the vertical direction of the accretion disk are described by using a Langevin
type equation with a damping term and a random, white noise type force.
Furthermore, the preliminary numerical simulation results are presented, which
are based on the numerical analysis of the Langevin stochastic differential
equation.
