If neutrino tribimaximal mixing is explained by a non-Abelian discrete
symmetry such as $A_4$, $T_7$, $\Delta(27)$, etc., the charged-lepton Higgs
sector has a $Z_3$ residual symmetry (lepton flavor triality), which may be
observed directly in the decay chain $H^0 \to \psi_2^0 \bar\psi_2^0$, then
$\psi_2^0 (\bar\psi_2^0) \to l_i^+ l_j^- ~(i \neq j)$, where $H^0$ is a
standard-model-like Higgs boson and $\psi_2^0$ is a scalar particle needed for
realizing the original discrete symmetry. If kinematically allowed, this
unusual and easily detectable decay is observable at the LHC with 1 fb$^{-1}$
for E_{cm} = 7 TeV.
