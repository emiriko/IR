We describe the coupled atmosphere-wildfire model WRF-Fire, which is
distributed as a part of WRF. The fire module is based on a fire-spread model,
implemented by the level-set method. In each time step, the fire module takes
the wind as input and returns the latent and sensible heat fluxes. We report on
the software architecture and features of the software.
