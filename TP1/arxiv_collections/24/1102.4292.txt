In this paper, we classify distance regular graphs such that all of its
second largest local eigenvalues are at most one. Also we discuss the
consequences for the smallest eigenvalue of a distance-regular graph. These
extend a result by the first author, who classified the distance-regular graph
with smallest eigenvalue $-1-\frac{b_1}{2}$.
