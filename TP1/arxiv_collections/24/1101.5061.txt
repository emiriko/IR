This is my Th\`ese d'Habilitation (HDR) on the topic of spinfoam models for
quantum gravity, which I presented in l'Ecole Normale Sup\'erieure de Lyon on
december 16 2010. The spinfoam framework is a proposal for a regularized path
integral for quantum gravity, inspired from Topological Quantum Field Theory
(TQFT) and state-sum models. It can also be seen as defining transition
amplitudes for the quantum states of geometry for Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG).
