We describe the scientific motivation, experimental basis, design
methodology, and simulated performance of the ExaVolt Antenna (EVA) mission,
and planned ultra-high energy (UHE) particle observatory under development for
NASA's suborbital super-pressure balloon program in Antarctica. EVA will
improve over ANITA's integrated totals - the current state-of-the-art in UHE
suborbital payloads - by 1-2 orders of magnitude in a single flight. The design
is based on a novel application of toroidal reflector optics which utilizes a
super-pressure balloon surface, along with a feed-array mounted on an inner
membrane, to create an ultra-large radio antenna system with a synoptic view of
the Antarctic ice sheet below it. Radio impulses arise via the Askaryan effect
when UHE neutrinos interact within the ice, or via geosynchrotron emission when
UHE cosmic rays interact in the atmosphere above the continent. EVA's
instantaneous antenna aperture is estimated to be several hundred square meters
for detection of these events within a 150-600 MHz band. For standard
cosmogenic UHE neutrino models, EVA should detect of order 30 events per flight
in the EeV energy regime. For UHE cosmic rays, of order 15,000 geosynchrotron
events would be detected in total, several hundred above 10 EeV, and of order
60 above the GZK cutoff energy
