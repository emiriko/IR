V446 Her is the best example of an old nova which has developed dwarf nova
eruptions in the post-nova state. We report on observed properties of the
long-term light curve of V446 Her, using photometry over 19 years. Yearly
averages of the outburst magnitudes shows a decline of ~0.013 mag/yr,
consistent with the decline of other post-novae that do not have dwarf nova
outbursts. Previous suggestions of bimodal distributions of the amplitudes and
widths of the outbursts are confirmed. The outbursts occur at a mean spacing of
18 days but the range of spacings is large (13-30 days). From simulations of
dwarf nova outbursts it has been predicted that the outburst spacing in V446
Her will increase as M-dot from the red dwarf companion slowly falls following
the nova; however the large intrinsic scatter in the spacings serves to hide
any evidence of this effect. We do find a systematic change in the outburst
pattern in which the brighter, wider type of outbursts disappeared after late
2003, and this phenomenon is suggested to be due to falling M-dot following the
nova.
