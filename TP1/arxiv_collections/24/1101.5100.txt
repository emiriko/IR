With a parallactic distance of 170 pc, PSR J2144-3933 is the closest isolated
radio pulsar currently known. It is also the slowest (P = 8.51 s) and least
energetic (Edot = 2.6E28 erg/s) radio pulsar; its radio emission is difficult
to account for with standard pulsar models, since the position of PSR
J2144-3933 in the period-period derivative diagram is far beyond the typical
radio `death lines'. Here we present the first deep X-ray and optical
observations of PSR J2144-3933, performed in 2009 with XMM-Newton and European
Southern Observatory (ESO)/Very Large Telescope (VLT), from which we derive,
assuming a blackbody emission spectrum, a surface temperature upper limit of
2.3E5 K for a 13 km radius neutron star, 4.4E5 K for a 500 m radius hot spot
and 1.9E6 K for a 10 m radius polar cap. In addition, our non-detection of PSR
J2144-3933 constrains its non-thermal luminosity to be <30 per cent and <2 per
cent of the pulsar rotational energy loss in the 0.5-2 keV X-ray band and in
the B optical band, respectively.
