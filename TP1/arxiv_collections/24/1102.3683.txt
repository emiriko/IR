We use the new cosmological recombination code, CosmoRec, for parameter
estimation in the context of (future) precise measurements of the CMB
temperature and polarization anisotropies. We address the question of how
previously neglected physical processes in the recombination model of Recfast
affect the determination of key cosmological parameters, for the first time
performing a model-by-model computation of the recombination problem. In
particular we ask how the biases depend on different combinations of
parameters, e.g. when varying the helium abundance or the effective number of
neutrino species in addition to the standard six parameters. We also forecast
how important the recombination corrections are for a combined Planck, ACTPol
and SPTpol data analysis. Furthermore, we ask which recombination corrections
are really crucial for CMB parameter estimation, and whether an approach based
on a redshift-dependent correction function to Recfast is sufficient in this
context.
