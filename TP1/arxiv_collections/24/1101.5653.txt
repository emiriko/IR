We have obtained images and long-slit, spatially resolved echelle spectra for
twenty four planetary nebulae (PNe) that have confirmed close binary nuclei.
The sample shows a variety of morphologies, however toroids or dense equatorial
density enhancements are identified, both in the imagery and the spectra, as
the common structural component. These toroids are thought to be the remnant
fingerprints of the post common envelope phase. Based on the characteristics of
the present sample we suggest a list of additional PNe that are likely to host
close binary nuclei
