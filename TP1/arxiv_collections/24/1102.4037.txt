Classify simple games into sixteen "types" in terms of the four conventional
axioms: monotonicity, properness, strongness, and nonweakness. Further classify
them into sixty-four classes in terms of finiteness (existence of a finite
carrier) and algorithmic computability. For each such class, we either show
that it is empty or give an example of a game belonging to it. We observe that
if a type contains an infinite game, then it contains both computable ones and
noncomputable ones. This strongly suggests that computability is logically, as
well as conceptually, unrelated to the conventional axioms.
