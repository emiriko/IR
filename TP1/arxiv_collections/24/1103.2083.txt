We construct an example which shows that two isocausal spacetimes, in the
sense introduced by Garc\'ia-Parrado and Senovilla, may have c-boundaries which
are not equal (more precisely, not equivalent, as no bijection between the
completions can preserve all the binary relations induced by causality). This
example also suggests that isocausality can be useful for the understanding and
computation of the c-boundary.
