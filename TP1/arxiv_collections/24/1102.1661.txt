Using large-scale Monte Carlo simulations that combine parallel tempering
with specialized cluster updates, we show that Ising spin glasses with
Levy-distributed interactions share the same universality class as Ising spin
glasses with Gaussian or bimodal-distributed interactions. Corrections to
scaling are large for Levy spin glasses. In order to overcome these and show
that the critical exponents agree with the Gaussian case, we perform an
extended scaling of the two-point finite size correlation length and the spin
glass susceptibility. Furthermore, we compute the critical temperature and
compare its dependence on the disorder distribution width to recent analytical
predictions [J. Stat. Mech. (2008) P04006].
