By making use of a non-perturbative definition of a momentum diffusion
coefficient as well as Heavy Meson Chiral Perturbation Theory, we investigate
the Brownian motion and kinetic equilibration of heavy quark flavours deep in
the confined phase. It appears that the momentum diffusion coefficient can be
expressed in terms of known low-energy constants; it increases rapidly at
temperatures above 50 MeV, behaving as ~ T^7/F_pi^4 for m_pi / pi << T << F_pi,
where m_pi and F_pi are the pion mass and decay constant, respectively. The
early increase may suggest a broad peak in kappa/T^3 around the QCD crossover.
For a more detailed understanding the computation could be generalized in a
number of ways.
