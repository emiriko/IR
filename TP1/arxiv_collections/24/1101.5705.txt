We give examples of groups G such that G^00 is different from G^000. We also
prove that for groups G definable in an o-minimal structure, G has a "bounded
orbit" iff G is definably amenable. These results answer questions of
Gismatullin, Newelski, Petrykovski. The examples also give new non G-compact
first order theories.
