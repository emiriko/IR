The analytical expression for the signal-to-noise ratio of a slotted surface
coil with an arbitrary number of slots was derived using the quasi-static
approach. This surface coil based on the vane-type magnetron tube. To study the
coil perfomance, the theoretical signal-to-noise ratio predictions of this coil
design were computed using a different number of slots. Results were also
compared with theoretical results obtained for a circular coil with similar
dimensions. It can be appreciated that slotted surface coil performance
improves as the number of coils increases and, outperformed the circular-shaped
coil. This makes it a good candidate for other MRI applications involving coil
array techniques.
