Search engine has become an inevitable tool for retrieving information from
the WWW. Web researchers introduce lots of algorithms to modify search engine
based on different features. Sometimes those algorithms are domain related,
sometimes they are Web page ranking related, and sometimes they are efficiency
related and so on. We are introducing such a type of algorithm which is
multiple domains as well as efficiency related. In this paper, we are providing
multilevel indexing on top of Index Based Acyclic Graph (IBAG) which support
multiple Ontologies as well as reduce search time. IBAG contains only domains
related pages and are constructed from Relevant Page Graph (RPaG). We have also
provided a comparative study of time complexity for the various models.
