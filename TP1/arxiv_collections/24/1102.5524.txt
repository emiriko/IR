It is shown how to construct renormalization group flows of quantum field
theories in real space, as opposed to the usual Wilsonian approach in momentum
space. This is achieved by generalizing the multiscale entanglement
renormalization ansatz to continuum theories. The variational class of
wavefunctions arising from this RG flow are translation invariant and exhibit
an entropy-area law. We illustrate the construction for a free non-relativistic
boson model, and argue that the full power of the construction should emerge in
the case of interacting theories.
