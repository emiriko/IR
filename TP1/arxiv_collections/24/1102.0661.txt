Results of VLBI and GPS observations were analyzed with goal to investigate
differences in observed baseline length derived from both techniques. VLBI
coordinates for European stations were obtained from processing of all
available observations collected on European and global VLBI network. Advanced
model for antenna thermal deformation was applied to account for change of
horizontal component of baseline length. GPS data were obtained from
re-processing of the weekly EPN (European Permanent GPS Network) solutions.
Systematic differences between results obtained with two techniques including
linear drift and seasonal effects are determined.
