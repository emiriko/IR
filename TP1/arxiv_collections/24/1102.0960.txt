We study the light absorption and energy transferring in a donor-acceptor
system with a bionic structure. In the optimal case with uniform couplings, it
is found that the quantum dynamics of this seemingly complicated system is
reduced as a three-level system of $\Lambda$-type. With this observation, we
show that the dark state based electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT)
effect could enhance the energy transfer efficiency, through a quantum
interference effect suppressing the excited population of the donors. We
estimate the optimal parameters of the system to achieve the maximum output
power. The splitting behavior of maximum power may be used to explain the
phenomenon that the photosynthesis systems mainly absorb two colors of light.
