Based on the modeling of type IIB string theory vacua using gauged S-duality
and the Chan-Paton symmetries by introducing an infinite number of open string
charges (affinization), we derive the derived category formulation of the
quantum mechanical world including gravity. This leads to the concept of a
non-linear potential of gauged and affinized S-duality which specifies the
morphism structure of this derived category.
