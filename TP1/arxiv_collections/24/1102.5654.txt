We study the consequences of identifying the 'electron density parameter' N
of Miedema et al. as the accurate valence of metallic elements. The
incorporation of these as valence in Pauling's scheme for the electronic
structure of transition metals, predicts, for the first time, that the
electrical conductivity of transition metals would decrease in the order
{\sigma}_Ag > {\sigma}_Cu > {\sigma}_Au > {\sigma}_Rh > {\sigma}_others, as is
experimentally observed.
