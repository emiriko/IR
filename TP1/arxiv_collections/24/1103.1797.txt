PTF09dav is a peculiar subluminous type Ia supernova (SN) discovered by the
Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). Spectroscopically, it appears superficially
similar to the class of subluminous SN1991bg-like SNe, but it has several
unusual features which make it stand out from this population. Its peak
luminosity is fainter than any previously discovered SN1991bg-like SN Ia (M_B
-15.5), but without the unusually red optical colors expected if the faint
luminosity were due to extinction. The photospheric optical spectra have very
unusual strong lines of Sc II and Mg I, with possible Sr II, together with
stronger than average Ti II and low velocities of ~6000 km/s. The host galaxy
of PTF09dav is ambiguous. The SN lies either on the extreme outskirts (~41kpc)
of a spiral galaxy, or in an very faint (M_R>-12.8) dwarf galaxy, unlike other
1991bg-like SNe which are invariably associated with massive, old stellar
populations. PTF09dav is also an outlier on the light-curve-width--luminosity
and color--luminosity relations derived for other sub-luminous SNe Ia. The
inferred 56Ni mass is small (0.019+/-0.003Msun), as is the estimated ejecta
mass of 0.36Msun. Taken together, these properties make PTF09dav a remarkable
event. We discuss various physical models that could explain PTF09dav. Helium
shell detonation or deflagration on the surface of a CO white-dwarf can explain
some of the features of PTF09dav, including the presence of Sc and the low
photospheric velocities, but the observed Si and Mg are not predicted to be
very abundant in these models. We conclude that no single model is currently
capable of explaining all of the observed signatures of PTF09dav.
