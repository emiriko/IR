In this article we present a $W^n_2$-theory of stochastic parabolic partial
differential systems. In particular, we focus on non-divergent type. The space
domains we consider are $\bR^d$, $\bR^d_+$ and eventually general bounded
$C^1$-domains $\mathcal{O}$. By the nature of stochastic parabolic equations we
need weighted Sobolev spaces to prove the existence and the uniqueness. In our
choice of spaces we allow the derivatives of the solution to blow up near the
boundary and moreover the coefficients of the systems are allowed to oscillate
to a great extent or blow up near the boundary.
