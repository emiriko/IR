The Long Term Evolution of UMTS is one of the latest steps in an advancing
series of mobile telecommunications systems. Many articles have already been
published on the LTE subject but these publications have viewed the subject
from particular perspectives. In the present paper, a different approach has
been taken. We are interested in the security features and the cryptographic
algorithms used to ensure confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted
data. A closer look is taken to the two EPS confidentiality and integrity
algorithms based on the block cipher algorithm AES: the confidentiality
algorithm EEA2 and the integrity algorithm EIA2. Furthermore, we focused on the
implementation of both algorithms in C language in respect to the
specifications requirements. We have tested our implementations according to
the testsets given by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)
implementation document. Some examples of the implementation tests are
presented bellow.
