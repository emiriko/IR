In this paper we calculate the quark number susceptibility (QNS) of QCD at
finite temperature under the rainbow-ladder and Ball-Chiu type truncation
schemes of the Dyson-Schwinger approach. It is found that the difference
between the result of the rainbow-ladder truncation and that of Ball-Chiu type
truncation is small, which shows that the dressing effect of the quark-gluon
vertex on the QNS at finite temperature is small. It is also found that at low
temperature the quark number susceptibility is nearly zero and it increases
sharply when the temperature approaches the chiral phase transition point. A
comparison between the result in the present paper with those in the literature
is made.
