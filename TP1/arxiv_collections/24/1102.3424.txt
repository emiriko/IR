The CLEO-c Experiment has made several recent contributions to the study of
charmonium decays. This review briefly outlines the CLEO-c analyses of
charmonium that were completed or made public during 2010. Special attention is
given to the discovery of the process e+e- to pi+pi-h_c at a center of mass
energy of 4170 MeV.
