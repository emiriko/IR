This paper presents an overview of physical ideas and mathematical methods
for implementing non-smooth and discontinuous substitutions in dynamical
systems. General purpose of such substitutions is to bring the differential
equations of motion to the form, which is convenient for further use of
analytical and numerical methods of analyses. Three different types of
nonsmooth transformations are discussed as follows: positional coordinate
transformation, state variables transformation, and temporal transformations.
Illustrating examples are provided.
