Starting with the zero-square "zeon algebra", the regular representation
gives rise to a Boolean lattice representation of sl(2). We detail the su(2)
content of the Boolean lattice, providing the irreducible representations
carried by the algebra generated by the subsets of an n-set. The group elements
are found, exhibiting the "special functions" in this context. The
corresponding Leibniz rule and group law are shown. Krawtchouk polynomials, the
Hamming and the Johnson schemes appear naturally. Applications to the Boolean
poset and the structure of Hadamard-Sylvester matrices are shown as well.
