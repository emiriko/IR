Motivated by the debate of spin-density-wave (SDW) versus local-moment (LM)
picture in the iron-based superconducting (FeSC) materials, we consider a
two-band orbital-symmetric Hubbard model in which there is robust Fermi surface
nesting at $(\pi,0)$. We obtain the phase diagram of such system by a
mean-field slave-rotor approach, in which the Fermi surface nesting and the SDW
order are explicitly taken into account via a natural separation of scale
between the Hund's coupling and the Coulomb interaction. We find that for a
sizable range of Hund's coupling the Mott transition acquires a strong
first-order character, but there also exists a small range of stronger Hund's
coupling in which an enhancement of magnetization can be observed on the SDW
side. We interpret the former scenario as one in which a sharp distinction can
be drawn between LM and the SDW picture, and the latter scenario as one in
which signs of LM physics begin to develop in the metallic phase. It is
tempting to suggest that some FeSC materials are in the vicinity of the latter
scenario.
