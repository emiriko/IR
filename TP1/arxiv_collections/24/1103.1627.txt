We use the early Large Hadron Collider data to set the lower limit on the
scale of Left-Right symmetry, by searching for the right-handed charged gauge
boson $W_R$ via the final state with two leptons and two jets, for 33/pb
integrated luminosity and 7 TeV center-of-mass energy. In the absence of a
signal beyond the Standard Model background, we set the bound M_WR > 1.4 TeV at
95% C.L.. This result is obtained for a range of right-handed neutrino masses
of the order of few 100 GeV, assuming no accidental cancelation in right-handed
lepton mixings.
