We start from a noncompact Lie algebra isomorphic to the Dirac algebra and
relate this Lie algebra in a brief review to low energy hadron physics
described by the compact group SU(4). This step permits an overall physical
identification of the operator actions. Then we discuss the geometrical origin
of this noncompact Lie algebra and 'reduce' the geometry in order to introduce
in each of these steps coordinate definitions which can be related to an
algebraic representation in terms of the spontaneous symmetry breakdown along
the Lie algebra chain su*(4) $\longrightarrow$ usp(4) $\longrightarrow$
su(2)$\times$u(1). Standard techniques of Lie algebra decomposition(s) as well
as the (physical) operator identification give rise to interesting physical
aspects and lead to a rank-1 Riemannian space which provides an analytic
representation and leads to a 5-dimensional hyperbolic space $H_{5}$ with
SO(5,1) isometries. The action of the (compact) symplectic group decomposes
this (globally) hyperbolic space into $H_{2}\oplus H_{3}$ with SO(2,1) and
SO(3,1) isometries, respectively, which we relate to electromagnetic
(dynamically broken SU(2) isospin) and Lorentz transformations. Last not least,
we attribute this symmetry pattern to the algebraic representation of a
projective geometry over the division algebra $H$ and subsequent coordinate
restrictions.
