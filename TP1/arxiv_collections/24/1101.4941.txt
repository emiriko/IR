We present mid-infrared spectra and photometry from the Infrared Spectrograph
on the Spitzer Space Telescope for 51 OH megamasers (OHMs), along with 15
galaxies confirmed to have no megamaser emission above L_OH = 10^2.3 L_sun. The
majority of galaxies display moderate-to-deep 9.7 um amorphous silicate
absorption, with OHM galaxies showing stronger average absorption and steeper
20-30 um continuum emission than non-masing galaxies. Emission from multiple
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), especially at 6.2, 7.7, and 11.3 um,
is detected in almost all systems. Fine-structure atomic emission (including
[Ne II], [Ne III], [S III], and [S IV]) and multiple H2 rotational transitions
are observed in more than 90% of the sample. A subset of galaxies show emission
from rarer atomic lines, such as [Ne V], [O IV], and [Fe II]. 50% of the OHMs
show absorption from water ice and hydrogenated amorphous carbon grains (HACs),
while absorption features from CO2, HCN, C2H2, and crystalline silicates are
also seen in several OHMs. Column densities of OH derived from 34.6 um OH
absorption are similar to those derived from 1667 MHz OH absorption in
non-masing galaxies, indicating that the abundance of masing molecules is
similar for both samples. This data paper presents full mid-infrared spectra
for each galaxy, along with measurements of line fluxes and equivalent widths,
absorption feature depths, and spectral indices.
