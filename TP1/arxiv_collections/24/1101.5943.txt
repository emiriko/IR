The high temperature ferromagnetism in Sr3YCo4O10+delta perovskite, whose
origin has been the subject of a considerable debate, has been studied by
neutron powder diffraction and synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements.
Oxygen vacancy ordering creates a complex pattern of zigzag stripes in the
oxygen-deficient CoO4+delta layers, where the Co ions are found in three
distinct coordinations. The symmetry of this unprecedented structural
modulation, in conjunction with the existence of different Co spin states,
provide a straightforward explanation for the appearance of ferrimagnetism. A
model for the magnetic structure compatible with these structural features is
proposed, based on the refinement of powder neutron data. The macroscopic
moment as a function of temperature that can be calculated from the values of
the ordered spins extracted from refinements, is in excellent agreement with
bulk magnetization. Unlike previous models, a collinear G-type magnetic
structure with uncompensated moments due to distinct spin-states of Co imposed
by different coordination is found.
