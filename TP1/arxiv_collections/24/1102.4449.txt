Based on the signal and idler photon pairs produced in a piece of high
nonlinear fiber by a pulsed pump, we characterize the heralded single photon
source from both the theoretical and experimental aspects. In the theory model,
started from the derived expression of Bogoliubov transformation for a
broadband pulsed pump, the second-order intensity correlation function
$g_c^{(2)}(0)$, heralding efficiency $H$, indistinguishability and brightness
of the heralded single photons as a function of source parameters are analyzed
and discussed. In the experiments, using several kinds of combinations of the
source parameters, the values of $g_c^{(2)}(0)$ and $H$ are measured and
compared. The experimental results are consistent with the theoretical
predictions. The investigations are useful for optimizing the parameters and
for developing a single photon source suitable for quantum information
processing.
