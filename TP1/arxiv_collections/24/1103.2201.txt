Bell's theorem basically states that local hidden variable theory cannot
predict the correlations produced by quantum mechanics. It is based on the
assumption that Alice and Bob can choose measurements from a measurement set
containing multiple elements. We establish a new paradigm that departs from
Bell's paradigm by assuming that there are no choices for Alice and Bob and
that the measurements Alice and Bob will make are fixed from the start. We
include a process of quantum computation in our model. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to connect quantum computation and nonlocality, the
two faces of entanglement.
