In this work we discuss the atomic states in a vertical optical lattice in
proximity of a surface. We study the modifications to the ordinary
Wannier-Stark states in presence of a surface and we characterize the energy
shifts produced by the Casimir-Polder interaction between atom and mirror. In
this context, we introduce an effective model describing the finite size of the
atom in order to regularize the energy corrections. In addition, the
modifications to the energy levels due to a hypothetical non-Newtonian
gravitational potential as well as their experimental observability are
investigated.
