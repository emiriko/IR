We study a supersymmetric model for strongly interacting lattice fermions in
the presence of a staggering parameter. The staggering is introduced as a
tunable parameter in the manifestly supersymmetric Hamiltonian. We obtain
analytic expressions for the ground states in the limit of small and large
staggering for the model on the class of doubly decorated lattices. On this
type of lattice there are two ground states, each with a different density. In
one limit we find these ground states to be a simple Wigner crystal and a
valence bond solid (VBS) state. In the other limit we find two types of quantum
liquids. As a special case, we investigate the quantum liquid state on the one
dimensional chain in detail. It is characterized by a massless kink that
separates two types of order.
