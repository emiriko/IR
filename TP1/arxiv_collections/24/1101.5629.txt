We consider control of reaction and population systems by deterministically
imposed transitions between the states with different numbers of particles or
individuals. Even where the imposed transitions are significantly less frequent
than spontaneous transitions, they can exponentially strongly modify the rates
of rare events, including switching between metastable states or population
extinction. We also study optimal control of rare events, and specifically,
optimal control of disease extinction for a limited vaccine supply. A
comparison is made with control of rare events by modulating the rates of
elementary transitions rather than imposing transitions. It is found that,
unexpectedly, for the same mean control parameters, controlling the transitions
rates can be more efficient.
