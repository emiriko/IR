By observing the local luminous infrared galaxy NGC5135 with the near-IR IFU
spectrograph SINFONI (ESO-VLT), we report an approx. 600 pc (in projection) AGN
outflow traced by [SiVI]1.96mum emission. This is the largest outflow traced by
a coronal line ever reported. Its large spatial scale suggests that shocks, in
addition to AGN continuum emission, are needed to locally produce [SiVI]
emission. We also show, for the first time, clear kinematical evidence of the
AGN-outflow vs. ISM interaction through variations in the 2D velocity fields of
different gas phases. Such local perturbations in the kinematics clearly match
the outflow structure. We use the [FeII]1.64mum emission, a supernovae tracer,
to estimate the supernovae rate in different star-forming knots (approx. 250 pc
across) within the central 2.3 kpc of NGC5135. The estimated supernovae rates
go from 0.02 to 0.08 yr^{-1} being in excellent agreement with predictions from
6 cm radio emission in the same areas.
