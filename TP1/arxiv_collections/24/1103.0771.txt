MHD Turbulence is a critical component of the current paradigms of star
formation, particle transport, magnetic reconnection and evolution of the ISM,
to name just a few. Progress on this difficult subject is made via numerical
simulations and observational studies, however in order to connect these two,
statistical methods are required. This calls for new statistical tools to be
developed in order to study turbulence in the interstellar medium. Here we
briefly review some of the recently developed statistics that focus on
characterizing gas compressibility and magnetization and their uses to
interstellar studies.
