We interpret solar flares as events originating from active regions that have
reached the Self Organized Critical state, by using a refined Cellular
Automaton model with initial conditions derived from observations. Aims: We
investigate whether the system, with its imposed physical elements,reaches a
Self Organized Critical state and whether well-known statistical properties of
flares, such as scaling laws observed in the distribution functions of
characteristic parameters, are reproduced after this state has been reached.
Results: Our results show that Self Organized Criticality is indeed reached
when applying specific loading and relaxation rules. Power law indices obtained
from the distribution functions of the modeled flaring events are in good
agreement with observations. Single power laws (peak and total flare energy) as
well as power laws with exponential cutoff and double power laws (flare
duration) are obtained. The results are also compared with observational X-ray
data from GOES satellite for our active-region sample. Conclusions: We conclude
that well-known statistical properties of flares are reproduced after the
system has reached Self Organized Criticality. A significant enhancement of our
refined Cellular Automaton model is that it commences the simulation from
observed vector magnetograms, thus facilitating energy calculation in physical
units. The model described in this study remains consistent with fundamental
physical requirements, and imposes physically meaningful driving and
redistribution rules.
