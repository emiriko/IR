Motzkin numbers are derived from a special case of Random Domino Automaton -
recently proposed toy model of earthquakes. An exact solution of the set of
equations describing stationary state of Random Domino Automaton in
"inverse-power" case is presented. A link with Motzkin numbers allows to
present explicit form of asymptotic behaviour of the automaton.
