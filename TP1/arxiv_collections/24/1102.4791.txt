We show how the conversion of magnetic field energy via magnetic reconnection
can progress in a fully three-dimensional, fast, volume-filling regime. An
initial configuration representative of many laboratory, space and
astrophysical plasmas spontaneously evolves from the well-known regime of slow,
resistive reconnection to a new regime that allows to explain the rates of
energy transfer observed in jets emitted from accretion disks, in stellar/solar
flare processes as well as in laboratory plasmas. This process does not require
any pre-existing turbulence seed which often is not observed in the host
systems prior to the onset of the energy conversion. The dynamics critically
depends on the interplay of perturbations developing along the magnetic field
lines and across them, a process possible only in three-dimensions. The
simulations presented here are the first able to show this transition in a
fully three-dimensional configuration.
