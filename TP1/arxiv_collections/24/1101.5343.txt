PSR J1713+0747 is a binary system comprising millisecond radio pulsar with a
spin period of 4.57 ms, and a low-mass white dwarf (WD) companion orbiting the
pulsar with a period of 67.8 days. Using the general relativistic Shapiro
delay, the masses of the WD and pulsar components were previously found to be
$0.28\pm 0.03 M_{\odot}$ and $1.3\pm 0.2 M_{\odot}$ (68% confidence),
respectively. Standard binary evolution theory suggests that PSR J1713+0747
evolved from a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB). Here, we test this hypothesis. We
used a binary evolution code and a WD evolution code to calculate evolutionary
sequences of LMXBs that could result in binary millisecond radio pulsars such
as PSR J1713+0747. During the mass exchange, the mass transfer is
nonconservative. Because of the thermal and viscous instabilities developing in
the accretion disk, the neutron star accretes only a small part of the incoming
material. We find that the progenitor of PSR J1713+0747 can be modelled as an
LMXB including a donor star with mass $1.3-1.6 M_{\odot}$ and an initial
orbital period ranging from 2.40 to 4.15 days. If the cooling timescale of the
WD is 8 Gyr, its present effective temperature is between 3870 and 4120 K,
slightly higher than the observed value. We estimate a surface gravity of ${\rm
Log} (g) \approx 7.38 - 7.40$.
