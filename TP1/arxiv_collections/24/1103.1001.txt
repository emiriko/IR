This paper presents a high-order differentiator for delayed measurement
signal. The proposed differentiator not only can correct the delay in signal,
but aslo can estimate the undelayed derivatives. The differentiator consists of
two-step algorithms with the delayed time instant. Conditions are given
ensuring convergence of the estimation error for the given delay in the
signals. The merits of method include its simple implementation and interesting
application. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed
differentiator.
