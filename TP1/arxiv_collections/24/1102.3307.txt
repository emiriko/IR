Context. 3C 454.3 is a very active flat spectrum radio quasar (blazar) that
has undergone a recent outburst in all observed bands, including the optical.
  Aims. In this work we explore the short-term optical variability of 3C 454.3
during its outburst by searching for time delays between different optical
bands. Finding one would be important for understanding the evolution of the
spectrum of the relativistic electrons, which generate the synchrotron jet
emission.
  Methods. We performed photometric monitoring of the object by repeating
exposures in different optical bands (BVRI). Occasionally, different telescopes
were used to monitor the object in the same band to verify the reliability of
the smallest variations we observed.
  Results. Except on one occasion, where we found indications of a lag of the
blue wavelengths behind the red ones, the results are inconclusive for most of
the other cases. There were either no structures in the light curves to be able
to search for patterns, or else different approaches led to different
conclusions.
