We give rates of convergence in the strong invariance principle for
stationary sequences satisfying some projective criteria. The conditions are
expressed in terms of conditional expectations of partial sums of the initial
sequence. Our results apply to a large variety of examples, including mixing
processes of different kinds. We present some applications to symmetric random
walks on the circle, to functions of dependent sequences, and to a reversible
Markov chain.
