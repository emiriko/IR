We study the spin quantum Hall effect and transitions between Hall plateaus
in quasi two-dimensional network models consisting of several coupled layers.
Systems exhibiting the spin quantum Hall effect belong to class C in the
symmetry classification for Anderson localisation, and for network models in
this class there is an established mapping between the quantum problem and a
classical one involving random walks. This mapping permits numerical studies of
plateau transitions in much larger samples than for other symmetry classes, and
we use it to examine localisation in systems consisting of $n$ weakly coupled
layers. Standard scaling ideas lead one to expect $n$ distinct plateau
transitions, but in the case of the unitary symmetry class this conclusion has
been questioned. Focussing on a two-layer model, we demonstrate that there are
two separate plateau transitions, with the same critical properties as in a
single-layer model, even for very weak interlayer coupling.
