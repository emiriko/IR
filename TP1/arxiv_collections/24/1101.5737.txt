We present a theory of second phase conductive filaments in phase
transformable systems; applications include threshold switches, phase change
memory, and shunting in thin film structures. We show that the average filament
parameters can be described thermodynamically. In agreement with the published
data, the predicted filament current voltage characteristics exhibit negative
differential resistance vanishing at high currents where the current density
becomes a bulk material property. Our description is extendible to filament
transients and allows for efficient numerical simulation.
