We show that one can construct two equivalent gauge theories from a linking
theory and give a general construction principle for linking theories which we
use to construct a linking theory that proves the equivalence of General
Relativity and Shape Dynamics, a theory with fixed foliation but spatial
conformal invariance. This streamlines the rather complicated construction of
this equivalence performed previously. We use this streamlined argument to
extend the result to General Relativity with asymptotically flat boundary
conditions. The improved understanding of linking theories naturally leads to
the Lagrangian formulation of Shape Dynamics, which allows us to partially
relate the degrees of freedom.
