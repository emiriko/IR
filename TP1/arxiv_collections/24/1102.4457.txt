In this note we make use of some properties of vector fields on a manifold to
give an alternate proof to [3] for the equivalence between connections and
parallel transport on vector bundles over manifolds. Out of the proof will
emerge a new approach to connections on a bundle as a consistent way to lift
the dynamics of the manifold to the bundle.
