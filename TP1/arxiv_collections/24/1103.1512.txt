Ultrafast laser-induced demagnetization of Gd(0001) has been investigated by
magneto-induced optical second harmonic generation and the magneto-optical Kerr
effect which facilitate a comparison of surface and bulk dynamics. We observe
pronounced differences in the transient changes of the surface and bulk
sensitive magneto-optical signals which we attribute to transfer of optically
excited, spin-polarized carriers between surface and bulk states of the
Gd(0001) film. A fluence dependent analysis of the bulk magnetization dynamics
results in a weak variation of the demagnetization time constant, which starts
at about 700 fs and increases by 10% within a fluence variation up to 1 mJ/cm2.
We compare these results with fluence dependent changes in the transient energy
density calculated by the two temperature model. The determined characteristic
times of excess energy transfer from the electron system to the lattice, which
is mediated by e-ph scattering, range from 0.2 - 0.6 ps. Such a more pronounced
fluence dependent change in the characteristic time compared to the observed
rather weakly varying demagnetization times suggests a more advanced
description of the optically excited state than by the two-temperature model.
