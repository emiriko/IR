We describe the physical model, numerical algorithms, and software structure
of WRF-Fire. WRF-Fire consists of a fire-spread model, implemented by the
level-set method, coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting model. In
every time step, the fire model inputs the surface wind, which drives the fire,
and outputs the heat flux from the fire into the atmosphere, which in turn
influences the atmosphere. The level-set method allows submesh representation
of the burning region and flexible implementation of various ignition modes.
WRF-Fire is distributed as a part of WRF and it uses the WRF parallel
infrastructure for parallel computing.
