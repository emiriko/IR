Miniaturization and portability of new electronics lead up to wearable
devices embedded within garments: a European program called ProeTEX developed
multi-purpose sensors integrated within emergency operators' garments in order
to monitor their health state and the surrounding environment. This work deals
with the development of an autonomous Long Range communication System (LRS),
suitable to transmit data between operators' equipment and the local command
post, where remote monitoring software is set up. The LRS infrastructure is
based on Wi-Fi protocol and modular architecture. Field tests carried out on
the developed prototype showed a high reliability in terms of correctly
exchanged data and recovering capabilities in case of temporary disconnection,
due to the operator's movements.
