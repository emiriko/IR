Radiative transfer has a strong impact on the collapse and the fragmentation
of prestellar dense cores. We present the radiation-hydrodynamics solver we
designed for the RAMSES code. The method is designed for astrophysical
purposes, and in particular for protostellar collapse. We present the solver,
using the co-moving frame to evaluate the radiative quantities. We use the
popular flux limited diffusion approximation, under the grey approximation (one
group of photon). The solver is based on the second-order Godunov scheme of
RAMSES for its hyperbolic part, and on an implicit scheme for the radiation
diffusion and the coupling between radiation and matter. We report in details
our methodology to integrate the RHD solver into RAMSES. We test successfully
the method against several conventional tests. For validation in 3D, we perform
calculations of the collapse of an isolated 1 M_sun prestellar dense core,
without rotation. We compare successfully the results with previous studies
using different models for radiation and hydrodynamics. We have developed a
full radiation hydrodynamics solver in the RAMSES code, that handles adaptive
mesh refinement grids. The method is a combination of an explicit scheme and an
implicit scheme, accurate to the second-order in space. Our method is well
suited for star formation purposes. Results of multidimensional dense core
collapse calculations with rotation are presented in a companion paper.
