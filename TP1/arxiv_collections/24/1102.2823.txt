In this article I present the motivation for introducing the invariant
functions of mass matrices, based on my own work, and give some examples. Since
their introduction in 1985, in the framework of the standard electroweak model,
they have been used by many authors. Some authors have gone further along this
path and have studied the extensions of this concept to frameworks beyond the
standard model. I hope, in the near future, to give a more detailed account of
this subject, including recent developments.
