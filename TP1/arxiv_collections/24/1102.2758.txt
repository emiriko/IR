We investigate the background dynamics when dark energy is coupled to dark
matter in the universe described by loop quantum cosmology. We consider dark
energy of the form modified Chaplygin gas. The dynamical system of equations is
solved numerically and a stable scaling solution is obtained. It henceforth
resolves the famous cosmic coincidence problem in modern cosmology. The
statefinder parameters are also calculated to classify this dark energy model.
