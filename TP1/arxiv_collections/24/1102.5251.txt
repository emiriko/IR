The UV-IR mixing of scalar field theory on the Moyal space is removed by the
harmonic term, so that the theory is renormalizable. We will present different
properties of this scalar model and its associated gauge theory, which is
candidate to renormalizability. The supergeometric interpretation of the
harmonic term, for both scalar and gauge models, and related to the
Langmann-Szabo duality, will be exposed.
