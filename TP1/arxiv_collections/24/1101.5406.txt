We simulate ultra-cold interacting Bosons in quasi-one-dimensional,
incommensurate optical lattices. In the tight-binding limit, these lattices
have pseudo-random on-site energies and thus can potentially lead to Anderson
localization. We explore the parameter regimes that lead to Anderson
localization and investigate the role of repulsive interactions, harmonic
confinement and finite temperature. We find that interactions can obscure the
exponential localization characteristic of Anderson localization, thus impeding
the direct observation of this phenomenon when interactions are present.
