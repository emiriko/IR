We report electronic structure calculations of an iron impurity in gold host.
The spin, orbital and dipole magnetic moments were investigated using the
LDA+$U$ correlated band theory. We show that the {\em
around-mean-field}-LDA+$U$ reproduces the XMCD experimental data well and does
not lead to formation of a large orbital moment on the Fe atom. Furthermore,
exact diagonalization of the multi-orbital Anderson impurity model with the
full Coulomb interaction matrix and the spin-orbit coupling is performed in
order to estimate the spin Hall angle. The obtained value $\gamma_S \approx
0.025$ suggests that there is no giant extrinsic spin Hall effect due to
scattering on iron impurities in gold.
