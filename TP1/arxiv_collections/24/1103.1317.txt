We give an estimate for the upper bounds on rates of lepton flavor violating
(LFV) decays M to mu(pm) + e(mp) of vector mesons M = rho0, omega, phi, J/psi,
Upsilon and the Z0 boson in a model independent way, analyzing the
corresponding lowest dimension effective operators. These operators also
contribute to nuclear mu-e-conversion. Based on this observation and using the
existing experimental limits on this LFV nuclear process, we show that the
studied two-body LFV decays of vector bosons are strongly suppressed
independent on the explicit realization of new physics. The upper limits on the
rates of some of these decays are significantly more stringent than similar
limits known in the literature. In view of these results experimental
observation of the two-body LFV decays of vector bosons looks presently
unrealistic.
