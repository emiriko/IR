We report an analytical investigation of the force and torque acting upon a
magnetic dipole placed in the vicinity of a moving electrically conducting
nonmagnetic plate. This problem is relevant to contactless electromagnetic flow
measurement in metallurgy and extends previous theoretical works (Thess et al.
Phys. Rev. Lett. 96(2006), 164501; New J. Phys. 9(2007), 299) to the case where
the orientation of the magnetic dipole relative to the plate is arbitrary. It
is demonstrated that for the case of low magnetic Reynolds number the
three-dimensional distributions of the induced electric potential, of the eddy
currents and of the induced magnetic field can be rigorously derived. It is
also shown that all components of the force and torque can be computed without
any further approximation. The results of the present work serve as a benchmark
problem that can be used to verify numerical simulations of more complex
magnetic field distributions.
