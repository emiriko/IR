Screening correlators and masses were studied at finite temperature in QCD
with two flavours of dynamical staggered quarks on a lattice. The spectrum of
screening masses show a hierarchical approach to chiral symmetry restoration.
Control of explicit chiral symmetry breaking through the quark mass was shown
to be an important step to understanding this phenomenon. No sign of decays was
found in the finite temperature scalar meson-like correlators in the confined
phase.
