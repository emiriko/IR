Sensitive spectral observations made in two frequency bands near 6.0 and 17.6
GHz are described for Orion and W51. Using frequency switching we were able to
achieve a dynamic range in excess of 10,000 without fitting sinusoidal or
polynomial baselines. This enabled us to detect lines as weak as T$_{A} ~1mK in
these strong continuum sources. Hydrogen recombination lines with $\Delta n$ as
high as 25 have been detected in Orion. In the Orion data, where the lines are
stronger, we have also detected a systematic shift in the line center
frequencies proportional to linewidth that cannot be explained by normal
optical depth effects.
