The security of quantum key distribution (QKD) can easily be obscured if the
eavesdropper can utilize technical imperfections of the actual implementation.
Here we describe and experimentally demonstrate a very simple but highly
effective attack which even does not need to intercept the quantum channel at
all. Only by exploiting the dead time effect of single photon detectors the
eavesdropper is able to gain (asymptotically) full information about the
generated keys without being detected by state-of-the-art QKD protocols. In our
experiment, the eavesdropper inferred up to 98.8% of the key correctly, without
increasing the bit error rate between Alice and Bob significantly. Yet, we find
an evenly simple and effective countermeasure to inhibit this and similar
attacks.
