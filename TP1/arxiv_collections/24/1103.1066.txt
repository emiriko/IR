We show that for an RSII braneworld filled with interacting viscous dark
energy and dark matter, one can always rewrite the Friedmann equation in the
form of the first law of thermodynamics, $dE=T_hdS_h+WdV$, at apparent horizon.
In addition, the generalized second law of thermodynamics can fulfilled in a
region enclosed by the apparent horizon on the brane for both constant and time
variable 5-dynamical Newton's constant $G_5$. These results hold regardless of
the specific form of the dark energy. Our study further support that in an
accelerating universe with spatial curvature, the apparent horizon is a
physical boundary from the thermodynamical point of view.
