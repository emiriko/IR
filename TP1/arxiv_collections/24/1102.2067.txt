Emission of bremsstrahlung photons accompanying proton decay of nuclei is
studied. The new improved multipolar model describing such a process is
presented. The angular formalism of calculations of the matrix elements is
stated in details. The bremsstrahlung probabilities for the $^{157}{\rm Ta}$,
$^{161}{\rm Re}$, $^{167}{\rm Ir}$ and $^{185}{\rm Bi}$ nuclei decaying from
the $2s_{1/2}$ state, the $^{109}_{53}{\rm I}_{56}$ and $^{112}_{55}{\rm
Cs}_{57}$ nuclei decaying from the $1d_{5/2}$ state, the $^{146}_{69}{\rm
Tm}_{77}$ and $^{151}_{71}{\rm Lu}_{80}$ nuclei decaying from the $0h_{11/2}$
state are predicted. Such spectra have orders of values similar to the
experimental data for the bremsstrahlung photons emitted during the
$\alpha$-decay. This indicates on real possibility to study bremsstrahlung
photons during proton decay experimentally and perform further measurements.
