In complex networks it is common to model a network or generate a surrogate
network based on the conservation of the network's degree distribution. We
provide an alternative network model based on the conservation of connection
density within a set of nodes. This density is measure by the rich-club
coefficient. We present a method to generate surrogates networks with a given
rich-club coefficient. We show that by choosing a suitable local linking term,
the generated random networks can reproduce the degree distribution and the
mixing pattern of real networks. The method is easy to implement and produces
good models of real networks.
