The paper studies spin-orbit interaction (i.e. the effect the spin has on the
particle's trajectory in a magnetic field) as a model of quantum computation.
The two-level spin quantum system is examined using the stochastic mechanics
formulation. The control of the entangled spin state is considered as a problem
of control of the mean moment of a particles ensemble along a reference
trajectory. It is shown that such a control can be succeeded by applying an
open-loop control scheme.
