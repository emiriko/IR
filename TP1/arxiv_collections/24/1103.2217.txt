We present a measurement of the Pi0 transverse momentum spectrum and of the
Eta/Pi0 ratio in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV at the CERN LHC.
In this analysis the reconstruction of Pi0 and Eta mesons has been done via
photon conversions in the central tracking system of ALICE. Therefore, this
method is completely independent from the electromagnetic calorimeters. It
makes the Pi0 (Eta) measurement possible down to pt = 0.4 (0.6) GeV/c with a
very good resolution and a very small background. For 100 Mio. pp collisions
the pt reach is 7 GeV/c. The results are compared to NLO pQCD calculations.
