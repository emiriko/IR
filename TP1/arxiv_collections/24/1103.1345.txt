The graph-theoretic Ramsey numbers are notoriously difficult to calculate. In
fact, for the two-color Ramsey numbers $R(m,n)$ with $m,n\geq 3$, only nine are
currently known. We present a quantum algorithm for the computation of the
Ramsey numbers $R(m,n)$. We show how the computation of $R(m,n)$ can be mapped
to a combinatorial optimization problem whose solution can be found using
adiabatic quantum evolution. We numerically simulate this adiabatic quantum
algorithm and show that it correctly determines the Ramsey numbers R(3,3) and
R(2,s) for $5\leq s\leq 7$. We then discuss the algorithm's experimental
implementation, and close by showing that Ramsey number computation belongs to
the quantum complexity class QMA.
