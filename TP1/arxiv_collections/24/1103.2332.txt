We have calculated the strength distributions of the dipole response in
spherical nuclei, ranging all over the periodic table. The calculations were
performed within two microscopic models: the discretized quasiparticle random
phase approximation (QRPA) and the quasiparticle continuum RPA, which takes
into account the coupling of the single-particle continuum in an exact way.
Pairing correlations are treated with the BCS model. In the calculations, two
density functionals were used, namely the functional PC-F1 and the functional
DD-PC1. Both are based on relativistic point coupling Lagrangians. It is
explicitly shown that this model is capable of reproducing the giant as well as
the pygmy dipole resonance for open-shell nuclei in a high level of
quantitative agreement with the available experimental observations.
