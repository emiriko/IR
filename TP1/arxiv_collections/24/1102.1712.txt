Recently we have developed an algorithm for reconstructing volumetric images
and extracting 3D tumor motion information from a single x-ray projection. We
have demonstrated its feasibility using a digital respiratory phantom with
regular breathing patterns. In this work, we present a detailed description and
a comprehensive evaluation of the improved algorithm. The algorithm was
improved by incorporating respiratory motion prediction. The accuracy and
efficiency were then evaluated on 1) a digital respiratory phantom, 2) a
physical respiratory phantom, and 3) five lung cancer patients. These
evaluation cases include both regular and irregular breathing patterns that are
different from the training dataset. For the digital respiratory phantom with
regular and irregular breathing, the average 3D tumor localization error is
less than 1 mm. On an NVIDIA Tesla C1060 GPU card, the average computation time
for 3D tumor localization from each projection ranges between 0.19 and 0.26
seconds, for both regular and irregular breathing, which is about a 10%
improvement over previously reported results. For the physical respiratory
phantom, an average tumor localization error below 1 mm was achieved with an
average computation time of 0.13 and 0.16 seconds on the same GPU card, for
regular and irregular breathing, respectively. For the five lung cancer
patients, the average tumor localization error is below 2 mm in both the axial
and tangential directions. The average computation time on the same GPU card
ranges between 0.26 and 0.34 seconds.
