The risk minimizing problem
$\mathbf{E}[l((H-X_T^{x,\pi})^{+})]\overset{\pi}{\longrightarrow}\min$ in the
multidimensional Black-Scholes framework is studied. Specific formulas for the
minimal risk function and the cost reduction function for basket derivatives
are shown. Explicit integral representations for the risk functions for
$l(x)=x$ and $l(x)=x^p$, with $p>1$ for digital, quantos, outperformance and
spread options are derived.
