We study theoretically the Josephson effect and pairing correlations in
planar SF1F2S junctions that consist of conventional superconductors (S)
connected by two metallic monodomain ferromagnets (F1 and F2) with transparent
interfaces. We obtain both spin-singlet and -triplet pair amplitudes and the
Josephson current-phase relations for arbitrary orientation of the
magnetizations using the self-consistent solutions of Eilenberger equations in
the clean limit and for a moderate disorder in ferromagnets. We find that the
long-range spin-triplet correlations cannot prevail in symmetric junctions with
equal ferromagnetic layers. Surprisingly, the long-range spin-triplet
correlations give the dominant second harmonic in the Josephson current-phase
relation of highly asymmetric SF1F2S junctions. The effect is robust against
moderate disorder and variations in the layers thickness and exchange energy of
ferromagnets.
