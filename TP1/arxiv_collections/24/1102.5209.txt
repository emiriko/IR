We collected notes and simple estimates about putative narrow nucleon
N*(1685) - the candidate for the non-strange member of the exotic anti-decuplet
of baryons. In particular, we consider the recent high precision data on eta
photoproduction off free proton obtained by the Crystal Ball Collaboration at
MAMI. We show that it is difficult to describe peculiarities of these new data
in the invariant energy interval of W ~ 1650-1750 MeV in terms of known wide
resonances. Using very simple estimates, we show that the data may indicate an
existence of a narrow N*(1685) with small photocoupling to the proton.
