Eddy Current Model of Ball Lightning Calculations show that high-energy ball
lightning may consist of a ball of plasma containing a large circular electric
current arising as an eddy current generated by lightning. Synthetic ball
lightning might serve as a method of plasma confinement for purposes of nuclear
fusion. In this paper, three articles concerning ball lightning and the related
phenomenon of large ball lightning are combined to provide insight into this
rarely glimpsed occurrence.
