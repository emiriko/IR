We describe extensive synoptic multi-wavelength observations of the
transition disk LRLL 31 in the young cluster IC 348. We combined four epochs of
IRS spectra, nine epochs of MIPS photometry, seven epochs of cold-mission IRAC
photometry and 36 epochs of warm mission IRAC photometry along with multi-epoch
near-infrared spectra, optical spectra and polarimetry to explore the nature of
the rapid variability of this object. We find that the inner disk, as traced by
the 2-5micron excess stays at the dust sublimation radius while the strength of
the excess changes by a factor of 8 on weekly timescales, and the 3.6 and
4.5micron photometry shows a drop of 0.35 magnitudes in one week followed by a
slow 0.5 magnitude increase over the next three weeks. The accretion rate, as
measured by PaBeta and BrGamma emission lines, varies by a factor of five with
evidence for a correlation between the accretion rate and the infrared excess.
While the gas and dust in the inner disk are fluctuating the central star stays
relatively static. Our observations allow us to put constraints on the physical
mechanism responsible for the variability. The variabile accretion, and wind,
are unlikely to be causes of the variability, but both are effects of the same
physical process that disturbs the disk. The lack of periodicity in our
infrared monitoring indicates that it is unlikely that there is a companion
within ~0.4 AU that is perturbing the disk. The most likely explanation is
either a companion beyond ~0.4 AU or a dynamic interface between the stellar
magnetic field and the disk leading to a variable scale height and/or warping
of the inner disk.
