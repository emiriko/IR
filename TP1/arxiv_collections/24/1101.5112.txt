We develop the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism for classical field theory on
generic globally hyperbolic spacetimes. A crucial aspect of our treatment is
the incorporation of the principle of local covariance which amounts to
formulate the theory without reference to a distinguished spacetime. In
particular, this allows a homological construction of the Poisson algebra of
observables in classical gravity. Our methods heavily rely on the differential
geometry of configuration spaces of classical fields.
