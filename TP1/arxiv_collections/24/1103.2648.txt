Many online marketplaces enjoy great success. Buyers and sellers in
successful markets carry out cooperative transactions even if they do not know
each other in advance and a moral hazard exists. An indispensable component
that enables cooperation in such social dilemma situations is the reputation
system. Under the reputation system, a buyer can avoid transacting with a
seller with a bad reputation. A transaction in online marketplaces is better
modeled by the trust game than other social dilemma games, including the
donation game and the prisoner's dilemma. In addition, most individuals
participate mostly as buyers or sellers; each individual does not play the two
roles with equal probability. Although the reputation mechanism is known to be
able to remove the moral hazard in games with asymmetric roles, competition
between different strategies and population dynamics of such a game are not
sufficiently understood. On the other hand, existing models of reputation-based
cooperation, also known as indirect reciprocity, are based on the symmetric
donation game. We analyze the trust game with two fixed roles, where trustees
(i.e., sellers) but not investors (i.e., buyers) possess reputation scores. We
study the equilibria and the replicator dynamics of the game. We show that the
reputation mechanism enables cooperation between unacquainted buyers and
sellers under fairly generous conditions, even when such a cooperative
equilibrium coexists with an asocial equilibrium in which buyers do not buy and
sellers cheat. In addition, we show that not many buyers may care about the
seller's reputation under cooperative equilibrium. Buyers' trusting behavior
and sellers' reputation-driven cooperative behavior coevolve to alleviate the
social dilemma.
