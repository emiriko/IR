The Kepler Mission provides nearly continuous monitoring of ~156 000 objects
with unprecedented photometric precision. Coincident with the first data
release, we presented a catalog of 1879 eclipsing binary systems identified
within the 115 square degree Kepler FOV. Here, we provide an updated catalog
augmented with the second Kepler data release which increases the baseline
nearly 4-fold to 125 days. 386 new systems have been added, ephemerides and
principle parameters have been recomputed. We have removed 42 previously
cataloged systems that are now clearly recognized as short-period pulsating
variables and another 58 blended systems where we have determined that the
Kepler target object is not itself the eclipsing binary. A number of
interesting objects are identified. We present several exemplary cases: 4 EBs
that exhibit extra (tertiary) eclipse events; and 8 systems that show clear
eclipse timing variations indicative of the presence of additional bodies bound
in the system. We have updated the period and galactic latitude distribution
diagrams. With these changes, the total number of identified eclipsing binary
systems in the Kepler field-of-view has increased to 2165, 1.4% of the Kepler
target stars.
