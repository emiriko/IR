After a few historic remarks on magnetic materials we introduce the basic
definitions related to permanent magnets. The magnetic properties of the most
common materials are reviewed and the production processes are described.
Measurement techniques for the characterization of macroscopic and microscopic
properties of permanent magnets are presented. Field simulation techniques for
permanent magnet devices are discussed. Today, permanent magnets are used in
many fields. This article concentrates on the applications of permanent magnets
in accelerators starting from dipoles and quadrupoles on to wigglers and
undulators.
