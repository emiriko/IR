New vector-like quarks can have sizable couplings to first generation quarks
without conflicting with current experimental constraints. The coupling with
valence quarks and unique kinematics make single production the optimal
discovery process. We perform a model-independent analysis of the discovery
reach at the Large Hadron Collider for new vector-like quarks considering
single production and subsequent decays via electroweak interactions. An early
LHC run with 7 TeV center of mass energy and 1 fb-1 of integrated luminosity
can probe heavy quark masses up to 1 TeV and can be competitive with the
Tevatron reach of 10 fb-1. The LHC with 14 TeV center of mass energy and 100
fb-1 of integrated luminosity can probe heavy quark masses up to 3.7 TeV for
order one couplings.
