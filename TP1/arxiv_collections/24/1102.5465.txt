In this paper we give two proofs of the mass formula for definite central
division algebras over global function fields, due to Denert and Van Geel. The
first proof is based on a calculation of Tamagawa measures. The second proof is
based on analytic methods, in which we establish the relationship directly
between the mass and the value of the associated zeta function at zero.
