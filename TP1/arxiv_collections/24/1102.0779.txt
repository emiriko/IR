The overall evolution of low-mass stars is heavily influenced by the
processes occurring in the stellar interior. In particular, mixing processes in
convectively unstable zones and overshooting regions affect the resulting
observables and main sequence lifetime. We study the effects of different
convective boundary definitions and mixing prescriptions in convective cores of
low-mass stars, to discriminate the existence, size, and evolutionary stage of
the central mixed zone by means of asteroseismology. We implemented the Ledoux
criterion for convection in our stellar evolution code, together with a
time-dependent diffusive approach for mixing of elements when semiconvective
zones are present. We compared models with masses ranging from 1 M* to 2 M*
computed with two different criteria for convective boundary definition and
including different mixing prescriptions within and beyond the formal limits of
the convective regions. Using calculations of adiabatic oscillations
frequencies for a large set of models, we developed an asteroseismic diagnosis
using only l=0 and l=1 modes based on the ratios of small to large separations
r01 and r10 defined by Roxburgh & Vorontsov (2003). These variables are almost
linear in the expected observable frequency range, and we show that their slope
depends simultaneously on the central hydrogen content, the extent of the
convective core, and the amplitude of the sound-speed discontinuity at the core
boundary. By considering about 25 modes and an accuracy in the frequency
determinations as expected from the CoRoT and Kepler missions, the technique we
propose allows us to detect the presence of a convective core and to
discriminate the different sizes of the homogeneously mixed central region
without the need of a strong a priori for the stellar mass.
