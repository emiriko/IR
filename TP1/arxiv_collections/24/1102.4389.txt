We introduce a Brauer type algebra $B_G (\Upsilon) $ associated with every
pseudo reflection group and every Coxeter group $G$. When $G$ is a Coxeter
group of simply-laced type we show $B_G (\Upsilon)$ is isomorphic to the
generalized Brauer algebra of simply-laced type introduced by Cohen, Gijsbers
and Wales ({\it J. Algebra}, {\bf 280} (2005), 107-153). We also prove $B_G
(\Upsilon)$ has a cellular structure and be semisimple for generic parameters
when $G$ is a dihedral group or the type $H_3$ Coxeter group. Moreover, in the
process of construction, we introduce a further generalization of
Lawrence-Krammer representation to complex braid groups associated with all
pseudo reflection groups.
