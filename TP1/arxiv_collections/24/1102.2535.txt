In this work we give a proof of universality with respect to the choice of
the statistical distribution of the quenched noise, for mean field bipartite
spin glasses. We use mainly techniques of spin glasses theory, as Guerra's
interpolation and the cavity approach. As a direct conseguence of our results,
we have a proof of convergence in the sup norm of the free energy of the
Hopfield Model to its expectation value.
