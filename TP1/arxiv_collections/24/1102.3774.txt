Quantum anticipation explorer is a computer program allowing the numerical
exploration of quantum anticipation which has been analyzed in arXiv:0810.183v1
and arXiv:1003.1090v1 for H-Atom, equidistant, random and custom spectra. This
tool determines the anticipation strength at those times orthogonal evolution
is possible. This paper is the user's guide explaining its capabilities,
installation and usage, and documenting the mathematics and algorithms
implemented in the software. A zip file containing the setup and documentation
