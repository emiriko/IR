When a core collapse supernova occurs in a binary system, the surviving star
as well as the compact remnant emerging from the SN, may reach a substantial
space velocity. With binary population synthesis modelling at solar and one
fifth of solar metallicity, we predict the velocities of such runaway stars or
binaries. We compile predictions for runaway OB stars, red supergiants and
Wolf-Rayet stars. For those stars or binaries which undergo a second stellar
explosion we compute their further evolution and the distance travelled until a
Type II or Type Ibc SN or a long or short gamma-ray burst occurs. We find our
predicted population of OB runaway stars broadly matches the observed
population of stars but, to match the fastest observed WR runaway stars, we
require that black holes receive an asymmetric kick upon formation. We find
that at solar metallicity Type Ic SN progenitors travel shorter distances than
the progenitors of other SN types because they are typically more massive and
thus have shorter lifetimes. Those of Type IIP SN can fly farthest about 48 pc
on average at solar metallicity. In considering the consequences of assuming
that the progenitors of long GRBs are spun-up secondary stars that experience
quasi-homogeneous evolution, we find that such evolution has a dramatic effect
on the population of runaway WR stars and that some 30 per cent of GRBs could
occur a hundred parsecs or more from their initial positions. We also consider
mergers of double compact object binaries consisting of neutron stars and/or
black holes. We find the most common type of visible mergers are neutron
star--black hole mergers that are roughly ten times more common than neutron
star--neutron star mergers. We also find that there may be a population of
low-velocity neutron stars that are ejected from a binary rather than by their
own natal kick.
