We give an explicit formula for the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) charge
associated with Poisson superalgebras. To this end, we split the master
equation for the BRST charge into a pair of equations such that one of them is
equivalent to the original one. We find the general solution to this equation.
The solution possesses a graphical representation in terms of diagrams.
