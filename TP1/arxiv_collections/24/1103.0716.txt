Based on the Coulomb gauge, the accurate Klein-Gordon equation in static
scalar and vector potentials was derived from Klein-Gordon equation in
electromagnetic environment. The correct equation developed in this comment
demonstrates that so-called the Klein-Gordon equation with scalar and vector
potentials is incorrect; therefore, some papers published to solve Klein-Gordon
equation with equal scalar and vector potential are also wrong.
