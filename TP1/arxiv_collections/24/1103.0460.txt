We investigated the magnetic and optical properties of
[(LaMnO3)n/(SrTiO3)8]20 (n = 1, 2, and 8) superlattices grown by pulsed laser
deposition. We found a weak ferromagnetic and semiconducting state developed in
all superlattices. An analysis of the optical conductivity showed that the
LaMnO3 layers in the superlattices were slightly doped. The amount of doping
was almost identical regardless of the LaMnO3 layer thickness up to eight unit
cells, suggesting that the effect is not limited to the interface. On the other
hand, the magnetic ordering became less stable as the LaMnO3 layer thickness
decreased, probably due to a dimensional effect.
