We derive a general formalism for evaluating the high-frequency limit of the
thermoelectric power of strongly correlated materials, which can be
straightforwardly implemented in available first principles LDA+DMFT programs.
We explore this formalism using model Hamiltonians and we investigate the
validity of approximating the static thermoelectric power $S_0$, by its
high-temperature limit, $S^*$. We point out that the behaviors of $S^*$ and
$S_0$ are qualitatively different for a correlated Fermi liquid near the Mott
transition, when the temperature is in the coherent regime. When the
temperature is well above the coherent regime, e.g., when the transport is
dominated by incoherent excitations, $S^*$ provides a good estimation of $S_0$.
