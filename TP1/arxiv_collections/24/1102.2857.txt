Suppose a small compact object (black hole or neutron star) of mass $m$
orbits a large black hole of mass $M \gg m$. This system emits gravitational
waves (GWs) that have a radiation-reaction effect on the particle's motion.
EMRIs (extreme--mass-ratio inspirals) of this type will be important GW sources
for LISA; LISA's data analysis will require highly accurate EMRI GW templates.
In this article I outline the "Capra" research program to try to model EMRIs
and calculate their GWs \textit{ab initio}, assuming only that $m \ll M$ and
that the Einstein equations hold. Here we treat the EMRI spacetime as a
perturbation of the large black hole's "background" (Schwarzschild or Kerr)
spacetime and use the methods of black-hole perturbation theory, expanding in
the small parameter $m/M$. The small body's motion can be described either as
the result of a radiation-reaction "self-force" acting in the background
spacetime or as geodesic motion in a perturbed spacetime. Several different
lines of reasoning lead to the (same) basic $\O(m/M)$ "MiSaTaQuWa" equations of
motion for the particle. Surprisingly, for a nonlinear field theory such as
general relativity, modelling the small body as a point particle works well.
The particle's own field is singular along the particle worldline so it's
difficult to formulate a meaningful "perturbation" theory or equations of
motion there. I discuss "mode-sum" and "puncture-function" regularization
schemes that resolve this difficulty and allow practical self-force
calculations, and I outline an important recent calculation of this type.
  Most Capra research to date has used 1st order perturbation theory. To obtain
the very high accuracies needed to fully exploit LISA's observations of the
strongest EMRIs, 2nd order perturbation theory will probably be needed.
