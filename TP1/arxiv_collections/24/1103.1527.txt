The evolution properties of Yukawa couplings and quark mixings are performed
for the one-loop renormalization group equations in the Universal Extra
Dimension (UED) model. It is found that the UED model has a substantial effect
on the scaling of the fermion masses, including both quark and lepton sectors,
whilst the radiative effects on the unitarity triangle is not a sensitive test
in this model. Also, for this model, the renormalization invariants $R_{13}$
and $R_{23}$ describe the correlation between the mixing angles and mass ratios
to a good approximation, with a variation of the order of $\lambda^4$ and
$\lambda^5$ under energy scaling respectively.
