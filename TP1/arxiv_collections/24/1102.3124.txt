Oscillations of coronal loops in the Sun have been reported in both imaging
and spectral observations at the onset of flares. Images reveal transverse
oscillations, whereas spectra detect line-of-sight velocity or Doppler-shift
oscillations. The Doppler-shift oscillations are commonly interpreted as
longitudinal modes. Our aim is to investigate the relationship between loop
dynamics and flows seen in TRACE 195\AA images and Doppler shifts observed by
SUMER in Si III 1113.2\AA and Fe XIX 1118.1\AA at the time of a C.8-class limb
flare and an associated CME. We carefully co-aligned the sequence of TRACE 195
\AA images to structures seen in the SUMER Si III, Ca X,and Fe XIX emission
lines. Additionally, H-alpha observations of a lifting prominence associated
with the flare and the coronal mass ejection (CME) are available in three bands
around 6563.3 \AA . They give constraints on the timing and geometry.
Large-scale Doppler-shift oscillations in Fe XIX and transverse oscillations in
intensity images were observed over a large region of the corona after the
passage of a wide bright extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) disturbance, which suggests
ionization, heating, and acceleration of hot plasma in the wake of a blast
wave.
