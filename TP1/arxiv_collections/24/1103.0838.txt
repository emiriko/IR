Dynamics of external cavity semiconductor lasers is known to be a complex and
uncontrollable phenomenon. Due to the lack of experimental studies on the
nature of the external cavity semiconductor lasers, there is a need to
theoretically clarify laser dynamics. The stability of laser dynamics in the
present paper, is analyzed through plotting the Lyapunov exponent spectra,
bifurcation diagrams, phase portrait and electric field intensity time series.
The analysis is preformed with respect to applied feedback phase $C_p$,
feedback strength $\eta$ and the pump current of the laser. The main argument
of the paper is to show that the laser dynamics can not be accounted for
through simply a bifurcation diagram and single-control parameter. The
comparison of the obtained results provides a very detailed picture of the
qualitative changes in laser dynamics.
