The five J$\Pi$ levels within a $np^2$ or $np^4$ ground state complex provide
an excellent testing ground for the comparison of theoretical line ratios with
astrophysically observed values, in addition to providing valuable electron
temperature and density diagnostics. The low temperature nature of the line
ratios ensure that the theoretically derived values are sensitive to the
underlying atomic structure and electron-impact excitation rates. Previous
R-matrix calculations for the Ne$^{2+}$ O-like ion exhibit large spurious
structure in the cross sections at higher electron energies, which may affect
Maxwellian averaged rates even at low temperatures. Furthermore, there is an
absence of comprehensive excitation data between the excited states that may
provide newer diagnostics to compliment the more established lines discussed in
this paper. To resolve these issues, we present both a small scale 56-level
Breit-Pauli (BP) calculation and a large-scale 554 levels R-matrix Intermediate
Coupling Frame Transformation (ICFT) calculation that extends the scope and
validity of earlier JAJOM calculations both in terms of the atomic structure
and scattering cross sections. Our results provide a comprehensive
electron-impact excitation data set for all transitions to higher $n$ shells.
The fundamental atomic data for this O-like ion is subsequently used within a
collisional radiative framework to provide the line ratios across a range of
electron temperatures and densities of interest in astrophysical observations.
