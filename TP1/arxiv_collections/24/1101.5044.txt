We present an improved phase estimation scheme employing entangled coherent
states and demon- strate that the states give the smallest variance in the
phase parameter in comparison to NOON, BAT and "optimal" states under perfect
and lossy conditions. As these advantages emerge for very modest particle
numbers, the optical version of entangled coherent state metrology is
achievable with current technology.
