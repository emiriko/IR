The Lp-Liouville property of a non-local operator A is investigated via the
associated Dirichlet form. We will show that any non-negative continuous Lp
E-subharmonic functions are constant under a quite mild assumption on the
kernel of E if p is not less than 2. On the contrary, if 1 < p < 2, we need an
additional assumption: either, the kernel has compact support; or f is Holder
continuous.
