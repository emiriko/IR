We describe the results of the first year of a program to localize new
Galactic Transient sources discovered by MAXI with NASA's Swift mission. Swift
is ideally suited for follow-up of MAXI discovered transients as its X-ray
Telescope (XRT) field of view (~0.2 degrees radius) is closely matched to the
typical MAXI error circle. The XRT is capable of localizing new sources to an
accuracy of up to 1.5 arc-seconds radius (90% confidence), and the Swift
Optical/UV Telescope also provides optical imaging of any optical counterpart
of the X-ray source. If no optical counterpart is found with Swift (usually due
to absorption), the XRT position is good enough to allow for ground based IR
telescopes to positively identify the optical counterpart. Although
localization and identification of MAXI transients is the main aim of the
program, these are often followed up by long term monitoring of the source. We
present here results from 2 of these monitoring programs: the black-hole
candidate MAXI J1659-152, and the Be/X-ray binary candidate MAXI J1409-619.
