This paper introduces a new object called the momentum tensor. Together with
the velocity tensor it forms a basis for establishing the tensorial picture of
classical and relativistic mechanics. Some properties of the momentum tensor
are derived as well as its relation with the velocity tensor. For the sake of
clarity only two-dimensional case is investigated. However, general conclusions
are also valid for higher dimensional spacetimes.
