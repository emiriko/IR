In this paper we consider two classes of random Hamiltonians on $L^2(\RR^d)$
one that imitates the lattice case and the other a Schr\"odinger operator with
non-decaying, non-sparse potential both of which exhibit a.c. spectrum. In the
former case we also know the existence of dense pure point spectrum for some
disorder thus exhibiting spectral transition valid for the Bethe lattice and
expected for the Anderson model in higher dimension.
