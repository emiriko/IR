Based on a combined quantum-classical treatment, a complete study of the
strong field dynamics of H2+, i.e. including all nuclear and electronic DOF as
well as dissociation and ionization, is presented. We find that the
ro-vibrational nuclear dynamics enhances dissociation and, at the same time,
suppresses ionization, confirming experimental observations by I. Ben-Itzhak et
al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 073002 (2005)]. In addition and counter-intuitively,
it is shown that for large initial vibrational excitation ionization takes
place favorably at large angles between the laser polarization and molecular
axis. A local ionization model delivers a transparent explanation of these
findings.
