Severe storms, tropical cyclones, and associated tornadoes, floods,
lightning, and microbursts threaten life and property. Reliable, precise, and
accurate alerts of these phenomena can trigger defensive actions and
preparations. However, these crucial weather phenomena are difficult to
forecast. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the potential of 4d-VAR
(four dimensional variational data assimilation) for exigent forecasting (XF)
of severe storm precursors and to thereby characterize the probability of a
worst-case scenario. 4d-VAR is designed to adjust the initial conditions (IC)
of a numerical weather prediction model consistent with the uncertainty of the
prior estimate of the IC while at the same time minimizing the misfit to
available observations. For XF the same approach is taken but instead of
fitting observations, a measure of damage or loss or an equivalent proxy is
maximized or minimized. To accomplish this will require development of a
specialized cost function for 4d-VAR. When 4d-VAR solves the XF problem a
by-product will be the value of the background cost function that provides a
measure of the likelihood of occurrence of the forecast exigent conditions.
4d-VAR has been previously applied to a special case of XF in hurricane
modification research. A summary of a case study of Hurricane Andrew (1992) is
presented as a prototype of XF. The study of XF is expected to advance
forecasting high impact weather events, refine methodologies for communicating
warning and potential impacts of exigent weather events to a threatened
population, be extensible to commercially viable products, such as forecasting
freezes for the citrus industry, and be a useful pedagogical tool.
