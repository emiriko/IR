Entropic uncertainty relations express the quantum mechanical uncertainty
principle by quantifying uncertainty in terms of entropy. Central questions
include the derivation of lower bounds on the total uncertainty for given
observables, the characterization of observables that allow strong uncertainty
relations, and the construction of such relations for the case of several
observables. We demonstrate how the stabilizer formalism can be applied to
these questions. We show that the Maassen-Uffink entropic uncertainty relation
is tight for the measurement in any pair of stabilizer bases. We compare the
relative strengths of variance-based and various entropic uncertainty relations
for dichotomic anticommuting observables.
