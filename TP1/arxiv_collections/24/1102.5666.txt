We explain effective charge anomalies recently observed for fractional
quantum Hall edge states at $\nu=5/2$ [M. Dolev, Y. Gross, Y. C. Chung, M.
Heiblum, V. Umansky, and D. Mahalu, Phys.Rev. B. \textbf{81}, 161303(R)
(2010)]. The experimental data of differential conductance and excess noise are
fitted, using the anti-Pfaffian model, by properly take into account
renormalizations of the Luttinger parameters induced by the coupling of the
system with an intrinsic $1/f$ noise. We demonstrate that a peculiar
agglomerate excitation with charge $e/2$, double of the expected $e/4$ charge,
dominates the transport properties at low energies.
