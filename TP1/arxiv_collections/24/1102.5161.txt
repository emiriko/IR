This volume contains the proceedings of the 8th Workshop on Security Issues
in Concurrency (SecCo 2010). The workshop was held in Paris, France on August
30th, 2010, as a satellite workshop of CONCUR'10. The aim of the SecCo workshop
series is to cover the gap between the security and the concurrency
communities. More precisely, the workshop promotes the exchange of ideas,
trying to focus on common interests and stimulating discussions on central
research questions. In particular, we called for papers dealing with security
issues (such as authentication, integrity, privacy, confidentiality, access
control, denial of service, service availability, safety aspects, fault
tolerance, trust, language-based security, probabilistic and information
theoretic models) in emerging fields like web services, mobile ad-hoc networks,
agent-based infrastructures, peer-to-peer systems, context-aware computing,
global/ubiquitous/pervasive computing.
