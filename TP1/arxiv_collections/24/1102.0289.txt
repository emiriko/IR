The MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is an alternative to the dark matter
assumption that can explain the observed flat rotation curve of galaxies. Here
hydrodynamic accretion is considered to critically check the consistency and to
constrain the physical interpretation of this theory. It is found that, in case
of spherically symmetrical hydrodynamic accretion, the modified Euler's
equation has real solution if the interpretation is assumed to be a
modification of the law of dynamics. There is no real solution if it is assumed
to be an acceleration scale dependent modification of the gravitational law.
With the modified Euler's equation, the steady state mass accretion rate is
found to change up to ~ 15%. The astrophysical and cosmological implications of
these results are also discussed.
