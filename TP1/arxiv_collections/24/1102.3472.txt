We suggest new setup where SUSY breaking spurion F-term possesses lepton
number. This setup not only modifies sparticle mass spectra but also realizes
several new models, where neutrino mass is naturally induced through radiative
corrections. We here suggest two new models; the first one is (i):
pseudo-Dirac/Schizophrenic neutrino model, and the second one is (ii): pure
Majorana neutrino model. We will also show this setup can naturally apply to
the supersymmetric Zee-Babu model.
