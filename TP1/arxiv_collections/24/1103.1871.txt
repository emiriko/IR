We measure the correlation between the spin of the top quark and the spin of
the anti-top quark in (ttbar -> W+ W- b bbar -> l+ nu b l- nubar bbar) final
states produced in ppbar collisions at a center of mass energy sqrt(s)=1.96
TeV, where l is an electron or muon. The data correspond to an integrated
luminosity of 5.4 fb-1 and were collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab
Tevatron collider. The correlation is extracted from the angles of the two
leptons in the t and tbar rest frames, yielding a correlation strength C=
0.10^{+0.45}_{-0.45}, in agreement with the NLO QCD prediction within two
standard deviations, but also in agreement with the no correlation hypothesis.
