We report the results of three-dimensional numerical simulations of
convection-driven dynamos in relatively thin rotating spherical shells that
show a transition from an strong non-oscillatory dipolar magnetic field to a
weaker regularly oscillating dipolar field. The transition is induced primarily
by the effects a stress-free boundary condition. The variation of the inner to
outer radius ratio is found to have a less important effect.
