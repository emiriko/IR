In this paper we are interested in indexing texts for substring matching
queries with one edit error. That is, given a text $T$ of $n$ characters over
an alphabet of size $\sigma$, we are asked to build a data structure that
answers the following query: find all the $occ$ substrings of the text that are
at edit distance at most $1$ from a given string $q$ of length $m$. In this
paper we show two new results for this problem. The first result, suitable for
an unbounded alphabet, uses $O(n\log^\epsilon n)$ (where $\epsilon$ is any
constant such that $0<\epsilon<1$) words of space and answers to queries in
time $O(m+occ)$. This improves simultaneously in space and time over the result
of Cole et al. The second result, suitable only for a constant alphabet, relies
on compressed text indices and comes in two variants: the first variant uses
$O(n\log^{\epsilon} n)$ bits of space and answers to queries in time
$O(m+occ)$, while the second variant uses $O(n\log\log n)$ bits of space and
answers to queries in time $O((m+occ)\log\log n)$. This second result improves
on the previously best results for constant alphabets achieved in Lam et al.
(Algorithmica 2008) and Chan et al. (Algorithmica 2010).
