Inter-Landau-level transitions in the bilayer graphene at high perpendicular
magnetic field at the filling-factor v<<1 have been studied. The
next-nearest-neighbor transitions, energy difference between dimer and
non-dimer sites and layer asymmetry are included. The influence of Coulomb
interaction is taken into account. The magnetoplasmon excitations in bilayer
graphene at small momenta are considered in the frame of the Hartree-Fock
approximation. It is shown that asymmetry in cyclotron resonance of clean
bilayer graphene depends on magnetic field. At lower magnetic fields the energy
splitting in the spectrum is due to electron-hole one-particle asymmetry, at
higher magnetic fields the energy splitting in the spectrum is due to Coulomb
interaction. For the fullsymmetric case with half-filled zero-energy levels the
energy splitting proportional to the energy of Coulomb interaction is found
both for bilayer and monolayer graphene.
