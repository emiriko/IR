In this paper we study, $\textsf{Prob}(n,a,b),$ the probability that all the
eigenvalues of finite $n$ unitary ensembles lie in the interval $(a,b)$. This
is identical to the probability that the largest eigenvalue is less than $b$
and the smallest eigenvalue is greater than $a$. It is shown that a quantity
allied to $\textsf{Prob}(n,a,b)$, namely, $$
H_n(a,b):=\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial a}+\frac{\partial}{\partial
b}\right]\ln\textsf{Prob}(n,a,b),$$ in the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) and
$$ H_n(a,b):=\left[a\frac{\partial}{\partial a}+b\frac{\partial}{\partial
b}\right]\ln \textsf{Prob}(n,a,b),$$ in the Laguerre Unitary Ensemble (LUE)
satisfy certain nonlinear partial differential equations for fixed $n$,
interpreting $H_n(a,b)$ as a function of $a$ and $b$. These partial
differential equations maybe considered as two variable generalizations of a
Painlev\'{e} IV and a Painlev\'{e} V system, respectively. As an application of
our result, we give an analytic proof that the extreme eigenvalues of the GUE
and the LUE, when suitably centered and scaled, are asymptotically independent.
