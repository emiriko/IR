We prove that $K_{\chi(G)}$ is the only critical graph $G$ with $\chi(G) \geq
\Delta(G) \geq 6$ and $\omega(\mathcal{H}(G)) \leq \left \lfloor
\frac{\Delta(G)}{2} \right \rfloor - 2$. Here $\mathcal{H}(G)$ is the subgraph
of $G$ induced on the vertices of degree at least $\chi(G)$. Setting
$\omega(\mathcal{H}(G)) = 1$ proves a conjecture of Kierstead and Kostochka.
