We study the influence of Unruh effect on quantum Stackelberg duopoly. We
show that the acceleration of noninertial frame strongly effects the payoffs of
the firms. The validation of subgame perfect Nash equilibrium is limited to a
particular range of acceleration of the noninertial frame. The benefit of
initial state entanglement in the quantum form of the duopoly is adversely
affected by the acceleration. The duopoly can become as a follower advantage
only in a small region of the acceleration.
