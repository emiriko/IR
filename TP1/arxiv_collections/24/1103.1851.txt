We describe the new version (v2.49t) of the code HFODD which solves the
nuclear Skyrme Hartree-Fock (HF) or Skyrme Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov (HFB)
problem by using the Cartesian deformed harmonic-oscillator basis. In the new
version, we have implemented the following physics features: (i) the isospin
mixing and projection, (ii) the finite temperature formalism for the HFB and
HF+BCS methods, (iii) the Lipkin translational energy correction method, (iv)
the calculation of the shell correction. A number of specific numerical methods
have also been implemented in order to deal with large-scale multi-constraint
calculations and hardware limitations: (i) the two-basis method for the HFB
method, (ii) the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM) for multi-constraint
calculations, (iii) the linear constraint method based on the approximation of
the RPA matrix for multi-constraint calculations, (iv) an interface with the
axial and parity-conserving Skyrme-HFB code HFBTHO, (v) the mixing of the HF or
HFB matrix elements instead of the HF fields. Special care has been paid to
using the code on massively parallel leadership class computers. For this
purpose, the following features are now available with this version: (i) the
Message Passing Interface (MPI) framework, (ii) scalable input data routines,
(iii) multi-threading via OpenMP pragmas, (iv) parallel diagonalization of the
HFB matrix in the simplex breaking case using the ScaLAPACK library. Finally,
several little significant errors of the previous published version were
corrected.
