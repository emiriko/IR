The ground-based Konkoly Blazhko Survey I and II aim to collect accurate,
extended, multicolour light curves of galactic field RRab stars in order to
determine the incidence rate of the modulation in the sample, to study the
modulation in details, to study long-term changes in the modulation properties
and to find changes in the mean global physical parameters of the stars with
Blazhko phase. Here the diversity of light curve variations of Blazhko stars is
demonstrated through a sub-sample of the modulated RRab stars found by the
first part of this survey.
