The surface abundances of extreme helium (EHe) and R Coronae Borealis (RCB)
stars are discussed in terms of the merger of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf with
a helium white dwarf. The model is expressed as a linear mixture of the
individual layers of both constituent white dwarfs, taking account of the
specific evolution of each star. In developing this recipe from previous
versions, particular attention has been given to the inter-shell abundances of
the asymptotic giant branch star which evolved to become the carbon-oxygen
white dwarf. Thus the surface composition of the merged star is estimated as a
function of the initial mass and metallicity of its progenitor. The question of
whether additional nucleosynthesis occurs during the white dwarf merger has
been examined.
  The high observed abundances of carbon and oxygen must either originate by
dredge-up from the core of the carbon-oxygen white dwarf during a cold merger
or be generated directly by alpha-burning during a hot merger. The presence of
large quantities of O18 may be consistent with both scenarios, since a
significant O18 pocket develops at the carbon/helium boundary in a number of
our post-AGB models.
  The production of fluorine, neon and phosphorus in the AGB intershell
produces n overabundance at the surface of the merged stars, but generally not
in sufficient quantity. However, the evidence for an AGB origin for these
elements points to progenitor stars with initial masses in the range 1.9 - 3
solar masses.
  There is not yet sufficient information to discriminate the origin (fossil or
prompt) of all the abundance anomalies observed in EHe and RCB stars. Further
work is required on argon and s-process elements in the AGB intershell, and on
the predicted yields of all elements from a hot merger.
