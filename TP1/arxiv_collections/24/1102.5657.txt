In an article "Missing Transverse-Doppler Effect in Time-Dilation Experiments
with High-Speed Ions" by S. Devasia [arXiv:1003.2970v1], our recent Doppler
shift experiments on fast ion beams are reanalyzed. Contrary to our analysis,
Devasia concludes that our results provide an "indication of Lorentz
violation". We argue that this conclusion is based on a fundamental
misunderstanding of our experimental scheme and reiterate that our results are
in excellent agreement with Special Relativity.
