We analyze the proximity effect of superconductor/ferromagnet nanostructures
and point out that the scattering of quasiparticle of spin-triplet pairs by
local magnetic moments leads to large resistance peak slightly below the
superconducting transition temperature of the superconductor. Both the
temperature and the magnitude of the resistance peak decrease with increasing
magnetic field, which agree quite well with the experimental results reported
in [Nature Phys. 6, 389 (2010)].
