Simulation of human motion is the subject of study in a number of
disciplines: Biomechanics, Robotics, Computer Animation, Control Theory,
Neurophysiology, Medicine, Ergonomics. Since the author has never visited any
of these fields, this review is indeed a passer-by's impression. On the other
hand, he happens to be a human (who occasionally is moving) and, as everybody
else, rates himself an expert in Applied Common Sense. Thus the author hopes
that this view from the {\em outside} will be of some interest not only for the
strangers like himself, but for those who are {\em inside} as well.
  Two flaws of the text that follows are inevitable. First, some essential
issues that are too familar to the specialists to discuss them may be missing.
Second, the author probably failed to provide the uniform "level-of-detail" for
this wide range of topics.
