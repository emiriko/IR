Quantum posts are assembled by epitaxial growth of closely spaced quantum dot
layers, modulating the composition of a semiconductor alloy, typically InGaAs.
In contrast with most self-assembled nanostructures, the height of quantum
posts can be controlled with nanometer precision, up to a maximum value limited
by the accumulated stress due to the lattice mismatch. Here we present a strain
compensation technique based on the controlled incorporation of phosphorous,
which substantially increases the maximum attainable quantum post height. The
luminescence from the resulting nanostructures presents giant linear
polarization anisotropy.
