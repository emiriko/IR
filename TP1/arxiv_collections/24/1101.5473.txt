A standard assumption in quantum chaology is the absence of correlation
between spectra pertaining to different symmetries. Doubts were raised about
this statement for several reasons, in particular, because in semiclassics
spectra of different symmetry are expressed in terms of the same set of
periodic orbits. We reexamine this question and find absence of correlation in
the universal regime. In the case of continuous symmetry the problem is reduced
to parametric correlation, and we expect correlations to be present up to a
certain time which is essentially classical but larger than the ballistic time.
