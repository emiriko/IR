Models based on their binary origin have been very successful in reproducing
the properties of field subdwarf-B stars, but the observations of their
analogues in globular clusters has posed new problems, while the discovery of
multiple populations offered an appealing alternative scenario for the
formation of these stars. We search for binaries of period P<200 days among a
sample of blue horizontal branch stars (Teff=12000-22000 K) in NGC2808, a
cluster known to host three distinct stellar populations and a multimodal
horizontal branch. The final sample consists of 64 targets. The radial velocity
of the targets was measured in fourteen epochs, spanning a temporal interval of
about 75 days. We detect no RV variable object among stars cooler than the
photometric G1 gap at 17000 K, while two close (P<10 days) and two
intermediate-period (P=10-50 days) systems are found among hotter targets. The
close and intermediate-period binary fraction for stars cooler than the gap are
fc<5% and fip<10%, respectively, with 95% confidence. The most probable values
among hotter stars are fc~20% and fip~30%, but the 90%- confidence level
intervals are large (6-42% and 11-72%, respectively). The G1 gap appears as a
discontinuity in the binary faction, with a higher incidence of binaries among
hotter stars, but a constant increase in f with temperature rather than a
discontinuity cannot be excluded from our observations. We find that
intermediate-period binaries, never investigated before among cluster HB stars,
could play an important role, being more than ~15-20% of the hottest stars of
our sample. Our results indicate that fc among hot HB stars is most probably
higher for younger clusters, confirming the recently proposed age-fc relation.
However, the large observed difference in binary fraction between clusters
(e.g. NGC2808 and NGC6752) is still not reproduced by binary population
synthesis models.
