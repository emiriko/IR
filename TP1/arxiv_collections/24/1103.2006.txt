The new discovered short-period close binary star, XY LMi, was monitored
photometrically since 2006. It is shown that the light curves are typical
EW-type and show complete eclipses with an eclipse duration of about 80
minutes. By analyzing the complete B, V, R, and I light curves with the 2003
version of the W-D code, photometric solutions were determined. It is
discovered that XY LMi is a high fill-out, extreme mass ratio overcontact
binary system with a mass ratio of q=0.148 and a fill-out factor of f=74.1%,
suggesting that it is on the late evolutionary stage of late-type tidal-locked
binary stars. As observed in other overcontact binary stars, evidence for the
presence of two dark spots on both components are given. Based on our 19
epoches of eclipse times, it is found that the orbital period of the
overcontact binary is decreasing continuously at a rate of
dP/dt=-1.67\times10^{-7}\,days/year, which may be caused by the mass transfer
from the primary to the secondary or/and angular momentum loss via magnetic
stellar wind. The decrease of the orbital period may result in the increase of
the fill-out, and finally, it will evolve into a single rapid-rotation star
when the fluid surface reaching the outer critical Roche Lobe.
