A spin-1/2 Anderson impurity in a semiconductor quantum well with Rashba and
Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings is studied by using a variational wave
function method. The local magnetic moment is found to be quenched at low
temperatures. The spin-spin correlations of the impurity and the conduction
electron density show anisotropy in both spatial and spin spaces, which
interpolates the Kondo spin screenings of a conventional metal and of a surface
of three-dimensional topological insulators.
