Current-induced dynamics in spin valves including composite free layer with
antiferromagnetic interlayer exchange coupling is studied theoretically within
the diffusive transport regime. We show that current-induced dynamics of a
synthetic antiferromagnet is significantly different from dynamics of a
synthetic ferrimagnet. From macrospin simulations we obtain conditions for
switching the composite free layer, as well as for appearance of various
self-sustained dynamical modes. Numerical simulations are compared with simple
analytical models of critical current based on linearized
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation.
