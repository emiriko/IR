Moving micron scale objects are strongly coupled to each other by
hydrodynamic interactions. The strength of this coupling decays as the inverse
particle separation when the two objects are sufficiently far apart. It has
been recently demonstrated that the reduced dimensionality of thin fluid layer
gives rise to longer ranged, logarithmic coupling. Using holographic tweezers
we show that microrods display both behaviors interacting like point particle
in 3D at large distance and like point particles in 2D for distances shorter
then their length. We derive a simple analytical expression that fits
remarkably well our data and further validate it with finite element analysis.
