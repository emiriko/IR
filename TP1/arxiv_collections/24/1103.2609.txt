Conflicting coupling of unpaired nucleons in the odd-odd nuclei is discussed.
A very simple explanation is suggested for the damping of the energy spacing of
the lowest levels in the rotational bands in the odd-odd nuclei in the case of
a "conflicting" coupling of the odd proton and neutron comparative to those of
the bands based on the state of the strongly-coupled particle in the
neighbouring odd nuclei entering the "conflicting" configuration.
