Pleijel's inequality is an approximate inversion formula for the Stieltjes
transform (or Cauchy integral) of a distribution function on positive
semi-axis. It implies a Tauberian theorem due to Malliavin. The proposed
analogs of Pleijel's inequality deal with (1) approximate recovery of the Riesz
means of the distribution function from its Stieltjes transform, and (2)
approximate recovery of the distribution function with power growth for which
the ordinary Stieltjes transform does not exist. In the latter case, a power of
the Cauchy (or Stieltjes) kernel is used to define the "generalized Stieltjes
transform". A previously unpublished theorem stated in Appendix pertains to
combination of the two situations (input: generalized Stieltjes transform;
output: Riesz means).
