We analyze a manifestation of the partial ordering transition of adatoms on
graphene in resistivity measurements. We find that Kekule mosaic ordering of
adatoms increases sheet resistance of graphene, due to a gap opening in its
spectrum, and that critical fluctuations of the order parameter lead to a
non-monotonic temperature dependence of resistivity, with a cusp-like minimum
at T=T_c.
