In the inflationary scenario of loop quantum cosmology in the presence of
inverse-volume corrections, we give analytic formulas for the power spectra of
scalar and tensor perturbations convenient to compare with observations. Since
inverse-volume corrections can provide strong contributions to the running
spectral indices, inclusion of terms higher than the second-order runnings in
the power spectra is crucially important. Using the recent data of cosmic
microwave background and other cosmological experiments, we place bounds on the
quantum corrections.
