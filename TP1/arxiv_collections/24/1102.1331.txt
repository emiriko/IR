In this paper, we analyze the polarized muon decay at rest (PMDaR) and
elastic neutrino-electron scattering (ENES) admitting the non-standard V+A
interaction in addition to standard V-A interaction. Considerations are made
for Dirac massive muon neutrino and electron antineutrino. Moreover, muon
neutrinos are transversely polarized. It means that the outgoing muon-neutrino
beam is a mixture of the left- and right-chirality muon neutrinos and has a
fixed direction of transverse spin polarization with respect to production
plane. We show that the angle-energy distribution of muon neutrinos contains
the interference terms between the standard V-A and exotic V+A couplings, which
are proportional to the transverse components of muon neutrino spin
polarization. They do not vanish in a limit of massless neutrino and include
the relative phases to test the CP violation. In consequence, it allows to
calculate a neutrino flux and an expected event number in the ENES (detection
process) both for the standard model prediction and the case of neutrino
left-right mixture.
