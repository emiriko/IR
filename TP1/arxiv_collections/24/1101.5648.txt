We discuss theoretical issues related to the extraction of deep
inelastic~(DIS) structure function of neutron from inclusive DIS scattering off
the deuteron at large Bjorken x. Theoretical justification is given to the
consideration of only $pn$ component of the deuteron wave function and
consistency with both the baryonic number and light-cone momentum conservation
sum rules. Next we discuss the EMC type effects and argue that in all cases
relevant to the nuclear DIS reactions at large x the main issue is the medium
modification of the properties of bound nucleon rather than the non-nucleonic
components like pions. We give brief description of the color screening model
of EMC and within this model we estimate uncertainties in the extraction of the
neutron DIS structure function at large x. We emphasize also that these
uncertainties are rather "model independent" since any theoretical framework
accounting for the medium modification is proportional to the magnitude of the
virtuality of bound nucleon which increases with an increase of x.
