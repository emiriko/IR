In this talk we briefly review the current CDMS/XENON constraints on the
neutralino dark matter in three popular supersymmetric models: the minimal
(MSSM), the next-to-minimal (NMSSM) and the nearly minimal (nMSSM). The
constraints from the dark matter relic density and various collider experiments
are also taken into account. The conclusion is that for each model the current
CDMS/XENON limits can readily exclude a large part of the parameter space
allowed by other constraints and the future SuperCDMS or XENON100 can cover
most of the allowed parameter space. The implication for the Higgs search at
the LHC is also discussed. It is found that in the currently allowed parameter
space the MSSM charged Higgs boson is quite unlikely to be discovered at the
LHC while the neutral Higgs bosons $H$ and $A$ may be accessible at the LHC in
the parameter space with a large $\mu$ parameter.
