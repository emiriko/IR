Observations of weak gravitational lensing combined with statistical
tomographic techniques have revealed that galaxies have formed along filaments,
essentially one-dimensional lines or strings, which form sheets and voids.
These have, in the main, been interpreted as "dark matter" effects. To the
contrary here we report the discovery that the dynamical 3-space theory
possesses such filamentary solutions. These solutions are purely space
self-interaction effects, and are attractive to matter, and as well generate
electromagnetic lensing. This theory of space has explained bore hole
anomalies, supermassive black hole masses in spherical galaxies and globular
clusters, flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies, and other gravitational
anomalies. The theory has two constants, G and alpha, where the bore hole
experiments show that alpha approx 1/137 is the fine structure constant.
