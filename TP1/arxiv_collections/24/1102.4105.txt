In an attempt to simultaneously explain the observed masses and mixing
patterns of both quarks and leptons, we recently proposed a model
(JHEP08(2010)115) based on the non abelian discrete flavor group A4,
implemented in a custodial RS setup with a bulk Higgs. We showed that the
standard model flavor structure can be realized within the zero mode
approximation (ZMA), with nearly tribimaximal (TBM) neutrino mixing and a
realistic CKM matrix with rather mild assumptions. An important advantage of
this framework with respect to flavor anarchic models is the vanishing of the
dangerous tree level KK gluon contribution to \epsilon_K and the suppression of
the new physics one loop contributions to the neutron EDM, \epsilon'/\epsilon,
b->s\gamma and Higgs mediated flavor changing neutral current (FCNC) processes.
These results are obtained beyond the ZMA, in order to account for the the full
flavor structure and mixing of the zero modes and first Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes
of all generations. The resulting constraints on the KK mass scale are shown to
be significantly relaxed compared to the flavor anarchic case, showing
explicitly the role of non abelian discrete flavor symmetries in relaxing
flavor violation bounds within the RS setup. As a byproduct of our analysis we
also obtain the same contributions for the custodial anarchic case with two
SU(2)_R doublets for each fermion generation.
