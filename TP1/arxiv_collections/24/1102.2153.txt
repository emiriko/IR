The paper deals with a spatially homogeneous and totally anisotropic Bianchi
II cosmological models representing massive strings in normal gauge for Lyra's
manifold. The modified Einstein's field equations have been solved by applying
variation law for Hubble's parameter. This law generates two type of solutions
for average scale factor, one is of power law type and other is of exponential
law type. The power law describes the dynamics of Universe from big bang to
present epoch while exponential law seems reasonable to project dynamics of
future Universe. It has been found that the displacement actor $(\beta)$ is a
decreasing function of time and it approaches to small positive value at late
time, which is collaborated with Halford (1970) as well as recent observations
of SN Ia. The study reveals that massive strings dominate in early Universe and
eventually disappear from Universe for sufficiently large time, which is in
agreement with the current astronomical observations.
