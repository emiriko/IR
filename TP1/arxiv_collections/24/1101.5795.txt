We calculate the conductance of a ballistic point contact to a
superconducting wire, produced by the s-wave proximity effect in a
semiconductor with spin-orbit coupling in a parallel magnetic field. The
conductance G as a function of contact width or Fermi energy shows plateaus at
half-integer multiples of 4e^2/h if the superconductor is in a topologically
nontrivial phase. In contrast, the plateaus are at the usual integer multiples
in the topologically trivial phase. Disorder destroys all plateaus except the
first, which remains precisely quantized, consistent with previous results for
a tunnel contact. The advantage of a ballistic contact over a tunnel contact as
a probe of the topological phase is the strongly reduced sensitivity to finite
voltage or temperature.
