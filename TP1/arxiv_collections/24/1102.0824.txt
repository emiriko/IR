We explore the salient features of the `Kitaev ladder', a two-legged ladder
version of the spin-1/2 Kitaev model on a honeycomb lattice, by mapping it to a
one-dimensional fermionic p-wave superconducting system. We examine the
connections between spin phases and topologically non-trivial phases of
non-interacting fermionic systems, demonstrating the equivalence between the
spontaneous breaking of global Z2 symmetry in spin systems and the existence of
isolated Majorana modes. In the Kitaev ladder, we investigate topological
properties of the system in different sectors characterized by the presence or
absence of a vortex in each plaquette of the ladder. We show that vortex
patterns can yield a rich parameter space for tuning into topologically
non-trivial phases. We introduce a new topological invariant which explicitly
determines the presence of zero energy Majorana modes at the boundaries of such
phases. Finally, we discuss dynamic quenching between topologically non-trivial
phases in the Kitaev ladder, and in particular, the post-quench dynamics
governed by tuning through a quantum critical point.
