In this paper, we propose an approach to controller synthesis for a class of
constrained nonlinear systems. It is based on the use of a hybridization, that
is a hybrid abstraction of the nonlinear dynamics. This abstraction is defined
on a triangulation of the state-space where on each simplex of the
triangulation, the nonlinear dynamics is conservatively approximated by an
affine system subject to disturbances. Except for the disturbances, this
hybridization can be seen as a piecewise affine hybrid system on simplices for
which appealing control synthesis techniques have been developed in the past
decade. We extend these techniques to handle systems subject to disturbances by
synthesizing and coordinating local robust affine controllers defined on the
simplices of the triangulation. We show that the resulting hybrid controller
can be used to control successfully the original constrained nonlinear system.
Our approach, though conservative, can be fully automated and is
computationally tractable. To show its effectiveness in practical applications,
we apply our method to control a pendulum mounted on a cart.
