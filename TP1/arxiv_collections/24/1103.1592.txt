It is shown that a well-known theory of random stationary processes contain
contradictions. Integral representations of correlation functions and random
stationary processes are investigated further. The new method of struggle with
handicaps is received on the basis of the carried out researches. Method of
dealing with noise leads to a new method of identification of dynamic
characteristics of control objects in a class of multidimensional linear
stationary models. As an example, describe an algorithm for obtaining the
differential equation-wire feed control aircraft pitch, taking into account the
elastic deformation of the structure of class IL -96 aircraft.
