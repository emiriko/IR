The pseudogap state is widely regarded as a precursor to high-temperature
superconductivity yet remains poorly understood. Using high field (30 T) NMR,
we report two electronically distinct oxygen sites within the copper-oxygen
(Cu-O) planes of an underdoped cuprate in the pseudogap state. At temperatures
well above the bulk superconducting transition, roughly 25% of the oxygen sites
evidence superconducting pair formation, the remaining evidence
antiferromagnetic ordering on the nearest neighbor Cu sites. Any
superconducting fluctuations are slower than the microsecond timescales of the
NMR probe, a confirmation that the (nearly) static bimodality of electronic
sites in the Cu-O plane - first reported using scanning tunneling microscopy on
surfaces - extends throughout the bulk pseudogap state.
