A closed form solution is derived for the biphoton k-vector spectrum for an
arbitrary pump spatial mode. The resulting mode coefficients for the pump input
that maximize the probability of biphoton detection in the far field are found.
It is thus possible to include the effect of arbitrary crystal poling
strucures, and optimize the resulting biphoton flux.
