While diverse fracture characteristics have been observed in liquid metal
embrittlement (LME) depending on the solid-liquid metal pairs, the penetration
of nanometer-thick liquid metal films along the grain boundary has been
identified as one of the key mechanisms for embrittlement in many classical LME
systems, such as Al-Ga, Cu-Bi and Ni-Bi. For example, liquid Ga quickly
penetrates deep into grain boundaries in Al, leading to intergranular fracture
under very small stresses. We report on a series of molecular dynamics
simulations of liquid Ga in contact with an Al bicrystal under a constant
strain rate. We identify the grain boundary dislocations that are nucleated at
the grain boundary groove tip and climb down along the grain boundary during Ga
penetration and characterize their atomic structures based on topological
method.
