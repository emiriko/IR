Magnetic frustration effects in artificial kagome arrays of nanomagnets are
investigated using x-ray photoemission electron microscopy and Monte Carlo
simulations. Spin configurations of demagnetized networks reveal unambiguous
signatures of long range, dipolar interaction between the nanomagnets. As soon
as the system enters the spin ice manifold, the kagome dipolar spin ice model
captures the observed physics, while the short range kagome spin ice model
fails.
