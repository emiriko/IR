The rare earth pyrochlore magnet Yb2Ti2O7 is among a handful of materials
that apparently exhibit no long range order down to the lowest explored
temperatures and well below the Curie-Weiss temperature. Paramagnetic neutron
scattering on a single crystal sample has revealed the presence of anisotropic
correlations and recent work has led to the proposal of a detailed microscopic
Hamiltonian for this material involving significantly anisotropic exchange. In
this article, we compute the local sublattice susceptibility of Yb2Ti2O7 from
the proposed model and compare with the measurements of Cao and coworkers
[Physical Review Letters, {103}, 056402 (2009)], finding quite good agreement.
In contrast, a model with only isotropic exchange and long range magnetostatic
dipoles gives rise to a local susceptiblity that is inconsistent with the data.
