We present an improved study of the expected shape of the line-of-sight
velocity distribution in shell galaxies. We found a simple analytical
expression connecting prominent and in principle observable characteristics of
the line profile and mass-distribution of the galaxy. The prediction was
compared with the results from a test-particle simulation of a radial merger.
