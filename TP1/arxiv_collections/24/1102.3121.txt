In distributed quantum information processing, small devices composed of a
single or a few qubits are networked together through shared entanglement to
achieve a scalable machine. Typically, photons are utilized to generate remote
entanglement between optically active matter qubits. In this paper, we consider
another possibility for achieving entanglement between nodes: using mobile
electron spins as mediators of the interaction between static qubits at each
node. A strong interaction between electrons makes it feasible to couple the
flying electron with the static electron. However, since the electrons easily
interact with the environment, error accumulation during the entanglement
operation could be more severe than with the other strategy using photons as
flying qubits. We introduce a new scheme especially designed to minimize such
error accumulation by using several distillation protocols. The conclusion is
that a high fidelity entanglement operation can be constructed even under the
effect of typical imperfections, and this suggestion therefore offers a
feasible route for the realization of distributed quantum information
processing in solid state systems.
