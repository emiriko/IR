Detectors with an electroluminesence readout show an excellence performance
in respect of energy resolution making them interesting for various
applications as X-ray detection, double beta and dark matter experiments,
Compton and gamma cameras, etc. In the following the study of a readout based
on avalanche photo diodes to detect directly the VUV photons is presented.
Results of measurements with 5 APDs in xenon at pressures between 1 and 1.65
bar are shown indicating that such a readout can provide excellent energy and a
moderate position resolution.
