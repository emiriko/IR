We study a 2-dimensional Box-Ball system which is a ultradiscrete analog of
the discrete KP equation. We construct an algorithm to calculate the
fundamental cycle, which is an important conserved quantity of the 2-dim.
Box-Ball system with periodic boundary condition, by using the tropical curve
theory.
