Analyzing DISTO data of $pp -> p Lambda K^+$ at $T_p = 2.50$ and 2.85 GeV to
populate a previously reported X(2265) resonance with $M_X = 2267$ MeV/$c^2$
and $Gamma_X = 118$ MeV at 2.85 GeV, we found that the production of X(2265) at
2.50 GeV is much less than that at 2.85 GeV (less than 10%), though it is
expected from a kinematical consideration to be produced as much as 33% of that
at 2.85 GeV. The small population of X(2265) at 2.50 GeV is consistent with the
very weak production of Lambda (1405) at the same incident energy toward its
production threshold, thus indicating that Lambda (1405) plays an important
role as a doorway state for the formation of X(2265).
