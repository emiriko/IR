Photonic analogues of the relativistic Kronig-Penney model and of
relativistic surface Tamm states are proposed for light propagation in fibre
Bragg gratings (FBGs) with phase defects. A periodic sequence of phase slips in
the FBG realizes the relativistic Kronig-Penney model, the band structure of
which being mapped into the spectral response of the FBG. For the semi-infinite
FBG Tamm surface states can appear and can be visualized as narrow resonance
peaks in the transmission spectrum of the grating.
