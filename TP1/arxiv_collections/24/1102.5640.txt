Sufficient energy resolution is the key issue for the calorimetry in particle
and nuclear physics. The calorimeter of the A4 parity violation experiment at
MAMI is a segmented calorimeter where the energy of an event is determined by
summing the signals of neighbouring channels. In this case the precise matching
of the individual modules is crucial to obtain a good energy resolution. We
have developped a calibration procedure for our total absorbing electromagnetic
calorimeter which consists of 1022 lead fluoride (PbF_2) crystals. This
procedure reconstructs the the single-module contributions to the events by
solving a linear system of equations, involving the inversion of a 1022 x
1022-matrix. The system has shown its functionality at beam energies between
300 and 1500 MeV and represents a new and fast method to keep the calorimeter
permanently in a well-calibrated state.
