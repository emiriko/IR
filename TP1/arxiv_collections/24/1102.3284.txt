The yield of bremsstrahlung from collisions of fast electrons (energy at
least 6 MeV) with a Tungsten target can be significantly improved by
exploitation of Tungsten wall scatter in a multi-layered target. A simplified
version of a previously developed principle is also able to focus small angle
scattered electrons by a Tungsten wall. It is necessary that the thickness of
each Tungsten layer does not exceed 0.04 mm - a thickness of 0.03 mm is
suitable for accelerators in medical physics. Further focusing of electrons
results from suitable magnetic fields with field strength between 0.5 Tesla and
1.2 Tesla (if the cone with multi-layered targets is rather narrow). Linear
accelerators in radiation therapy only need focusing by wall scatter without
further magnetic fields (standard case: 31 plates with 0.03 mm thickness and 1
mm distance between the plates). We considered three cases with importance in
medical physics: A very small cone with additional magnetic field for focusing
(field diameter at 90 cm depth: 6cm), a medium cone with optional magnetic
field (field diameter at 90 cm depth: 13 cm) and broad cone without magnetic
field (field diameter at 90 cm depth: 30 cm). All these cases can be positioned
in a carousel. Measurements have been performed in the existing carousel
positioned in the plane of the flattening filter and scatter foils for
electrons.
