A proximity focusing Cherenkov imager called CHERCAM, has been built for the
charge measurement of nuclear cosmic rays with the CREAM instrument. It
consists of a silica aerogel radiator plane across from a detector plane
equipped with 1,600 1" diameter photomultipliers. The two planes are separated
by a ring expansion gap. The Cherenkov light yield is proportional to the
charge squared of the incident particle. The expected relative light collection
accuracy is in the few percents range. It leads to an expected single element
separation over the range of nuclear charge Z of main interest 1 < Z < 26.
CHERCAM is designed to fly with the CREAM balloon experiment. The design of the
instrument and the implemented technical solutions allowing its safe operation
in high altitude conditions (radiations, low pressure, cold) are presented.
