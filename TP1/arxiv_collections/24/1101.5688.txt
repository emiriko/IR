We carry out a coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation of phospholipid
vesicles with transmembrane proteins. We measure the mean and Gaussian
curvatures of our protein-embedded vesicles and quantitatively show how protein
clusters change the shapes of their host vesicles. The effects of depletion
force and vesiculation on protein clustering are also investigated. By
increasing the protein concentration, clusters are fragmented to smaller
bundles, which are then redistributed to form more symmetric structures
corresponding to lower bending energies. Big clusters and highly aspherical
vesicles cannot be formed when the fraction of protein to lipid molecules is
large.
