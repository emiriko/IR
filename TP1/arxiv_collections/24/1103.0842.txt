Recently, span programs have been shown to be equivalent to quantum query
algorithms. It is an open problem whether this equivalence can be utilized in
order to come up with new quantum algorithms. We address this problem by
providing span programs for some linear algebra problems.
  We develop a notion of a high level span program, that abstracts from loading
input vectors into a span program. Then we give a high level span program for
the rank problem. The last section of the paper deals with reducing a high
level span program to an ordinary span program that can be solved using known
quantum query algorithms.
