The properties of the quark-gluon medium observed in high energy
nucleus-nucleus collisions are discussed. The main experimental facts about
these collisions are briefly described and compared with data about
proton-proton collisions. Both microscopic and macroscopic approaches to their
description are reviewed. The chromodynamics of the quark-gluon medium at high
energies is mainly considered. The energy loss of partons moving in this medium
is treated. The principal conclusion is that the medium possesses some
collective properties which are crucial for understanding the experimental
observations.
