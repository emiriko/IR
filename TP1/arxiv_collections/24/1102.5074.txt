Symmetry breaking effect for left- and right-handed circularly polarized
light beams propagating in a rotationally symmetric graded-index optical fiber
is presented. It is shown that a left-right asymmetry manifested as an unequal
transmission for opposite circular polarizations occurs due to spin-to-spin
angular momentum conversion caused by tensor interaction.
