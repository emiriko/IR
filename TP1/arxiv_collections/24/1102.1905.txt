We investigate the thermodynamics of a combined Dicke- and Ising-model which
exhibits a rich phenomenology arising from the second order and quantum phase
transitions from the respective models. The partition function is calculated
using mean field theory, and the free energy is analyzed in detail to determine
the complete phase diagram for the system. The analysis reveals both first- and
second-order Dicke phase transitions into a super-radiant state, and the cavity
mean-field in this regime acts as an effective magnetic field, which restricts
the Ising chain dynamics to parameter ranges away from the Ising phase
transition. Physical systems with a first order phase transitions are natural
candidates for metrology and calibration purposes, and we apply filter theory
to show that the sensitivity of the physical system to temperature and external
fields reaches the 1/N Heisenberg limit.
