We present the current development of the photoproduction approach for the
Higgs boson with its application to $pp$ and $pA$ collisions at the LHC. We
perform a different analysis for the Gap Survival Probability, where we
consider a probability of 3% and also a more optimistic value of 10% based on
the HERA data for dijet production. As a result, the cross section for the
exclusive Higgs boson production is about 2 fb and 6 fb in $pp$ collisions and
617 and 2056 fb for $p$Pb collisions, considering the gap survival factor of 3%
and 10%, respectively.
