Traditional spatial queries return, for a given query object $q$, all
database objects that satisfy a given predicate, such as epsilon range and
$k$-nearest neighbors. This paper defines and studies {\em inverse} spatial
queries, which, given a subset of database objects $Q$ and a query predicate,
return all objects which, if used as query objects with the predicate, contain
$Q$ in their result. We first show a straightforward solution for answering
inverse spatial queries for any query predicate. Then, we propose a
filter-and-refinement framework that can be used to improve efficiency. We show
how to apply this framework on a variety of inverse queries, using appropriate
space pruning strategies. In particular, we propose solutions for inverse
epsilon range queries, inverse $k$-nearest neighbor queries, and inverse
skyline queries. Our experiments show that our framework is significantly more
efficient than naive approaches.
