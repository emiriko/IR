The study of stochastic systems has received considerable interest over the
years. Their dynamics can describe many equilibrium and nonequilibrium
fluctuating systems. At the same time, nonequilibrium constraints interact with
the time evolution in various ways. Here we review the dynamics of stochastic
systems from the viewpoint of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. We explore the
effect of external thermodynamic forces on the possible dynamical regimes and
show that the time evolution can become intrinsically different under
nonequilibrium conditions. For example, nonequilibrium systems with real
dynamical components are similar to equilibrium ones when their state space
dimension N < 5, but this equivalence is lost in higher dimensions. Out of
equilibrium systems thus present new dynamical behaviors with respect to their
equilibrium counterpart. We also study the dynamical modes of generalized,
non-stochastic evolution operators such as those arising in counting
statistics.
