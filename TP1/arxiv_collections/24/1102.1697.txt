The Telescope Array's Middle Drum fluorescence detector was constructed using
refurbished telescopes from the High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) experiment.
As such, there is a direct comparison between these two experiments'
fluorescence energy spectra. An energy spectrum has been calculated based on
one year of collected data by the Middle Drum site of Telescope Array and
agrees well with the HiRes monocular spectra. The quality of the Middle Drum
results has also been determined to show good agreement.
