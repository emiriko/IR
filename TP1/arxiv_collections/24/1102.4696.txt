The dynamics of pions and strange particles in heavy-ion collisions in the
region of 1A GeV energies is investigated by the lanzhou quantum molecular
dynamics model for probing the nuclear equation of state at supra-saturation
densities. The total multiplicities and the ratios obtained in
$^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au over $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C systems are calculated for
selected Skyrme parameters SkP, SLy6, Ska and SIII, which correspond to
different modulus of incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter and
different cases of the stiffness of symmetry energy. A decrease trend of the
excitation functions of the ratios for strange particle production with
increasing incident energy was observed. The available data of K$^{+}$
production measured by KaoS collaboration are described well with the parameter
SkP, which results in a soft equation of state. The conclusions can not be
modified by an in-medium kaon-nucleon potential.
