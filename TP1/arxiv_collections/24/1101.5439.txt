We investigate theoretically the transport properties of the side-coupled
double quantum dots in connection with the experimental study of Sasaki {\it et
al.} Phys.Rev.Lett.{\bf 103}, 266806 (2009). The novelty of the set-up consists
in connecting the Kondo dot directly to the leads, while the side dot provides
an interference path which affects the Kondo correlations. We analyze the
oscillations of the source-drain current due to the periodical Coulomb blockade
of the many-level side-dot at the variation of the gate potential applied on
it. The Fano profile of these oscillations may be controlled by the
temperature, gate potential and interdot coupling. The non-equilibrium
conductance of the double dot system exhibits zero bias anomaly which, besides
the usual enhancement, may show also a suppression (a dip-like aspect) which
occurs around the Fano {\it zero}. In the same region, the weak temperature
dependence of the conductance indicates the suppression of the Kondo effect.
Scaling properties of the non-equilibrium conductance in the Fano-Kondo regime
are discussed. Since the SIAM Kondo temperature is no longer the proper scaling
parameter, we look for an alternative specific to the double-dot. The extended
Anderson model, Keldysh formalism and equation of motion technique are used.
