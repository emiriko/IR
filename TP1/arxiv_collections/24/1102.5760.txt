This is a survey of the language of polyhedral divisors describing
T-varieties. This language is explained in parallel to the well established
theory of toric varieties. In addition to basic constructions, subjects touched
on include singularities, separatedness and properness, divisors and
intersection theory, cohomology, Cox rings, polarizations, and equivariant
deformations, among others.
