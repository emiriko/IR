We present results of deep radio continuum observations of two galactic
globular clusters 47 Tucanae (47 Tuc) and Omega Centauri (Omega Cen) with
Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). No statistically significant evidence
for radio emission was found from the central region for the two clusters.
However, both clusters show a 2.5-sigma detection near the center that may be
confirmed by future deeper radio observations. The 3-sigma upper limits of the
radio observations is 20 and 40 microJy/beam for Omega Cen and 47 Tuc,
respectively. By using the fundamental plane of accreting black holes which
describes the relationship between radio luminosity, X-ray luminosity and black
hole mass, we constrain the mass of a possible intermediate-mass black hole
(IMBH) in the globualar clusters. We also compare our results with other
globular clusters and discuss the existence of IMBHs in globular clusters.
