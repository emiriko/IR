We investigate this class of groups originally called ulf (universal locally
finite groups) of cardinality $\lambda$. We prove that for every locally finite
group $G$ there is a canonical existentially closed extention of the same
cardinality, unique up to isomorphism and increasing with $G$. Also we get,
e.g. existence of complete members (i.e. with no non-inner automorphisms) in
many cardinals (provably in ZFC). We also get a parallel to stability theory in
the sense of investigating definable types.
