We compare the orbital angular momentum of the 'quark' in the scalar diquark
model as well as that of the electron in QED (to order {\alpha}) obtained from
the Jaffe-Manohar de- composition to that obtained from the Ji relation. We
estimate the importance of the vector potential in the definition of orbital
angular momentum.
