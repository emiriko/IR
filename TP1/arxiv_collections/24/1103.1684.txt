We overview a holographic QCD based on the D4-D8 string theory model, with
emphasis on baryons and nucleon-meson interactions thereof. Baryons are
realized as holographic images of Skyrmions, but with much qualitative changes.
This allows us to derive, without adjustable parameters, couplings of baryons
to the entire tower of spin one mesons and also to pseudoscalar mesons. We find
some surprisingly good match against empirical values for nucleons, in
particular. Tensor couplings to all axial-vectors and iso-singlet vectors all
vanish, while, for $\rho$ mesons, tensor couplings are found to be dominant. We
close with various cautionary comments and speculations.
