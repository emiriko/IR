Local properties of families of algebraic subsets $W_g$ in Birkhoff strata
$\Sigma_{2g}$ of Gr$^{(2)}$ containing hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ are
studied. It is shown that the tangent spaces $T_g$ for $W_g$ are isomorphic to
linear spaces of 2-coboundaries. Particular subsets in $W_g$ are described by
the intergrable dispersionless coupled KdV systems of hydrodynamical type
defining a special class of 2-cocycles and 2-coboundaries in $T_g$. It is
demonstrated that the blows-ups of such 2-cocycles and 2-coboundaries and
gradient catastrophes for associated integrable systems are interrelated.
