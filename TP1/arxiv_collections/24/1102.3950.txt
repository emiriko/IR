Under certain integrability and geometric conditions, we prove division
theorems for the exact sequences of holomorphic vector bundles and improve the
results in the case of Koszul complex. By introducing a singular Hermitian
structure on the trivial bundle, our results recover Skoda's division theorem
for holomorphic functions on pseudoconvex domains in complex Euclidean spaces.
