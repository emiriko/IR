Geometric and dynamic properties of embeddings of SL(2,Z) into the Cremona
group are studied. Infinitely many non-conjugate embeddings which preserve the
type (i.e. which send elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic elements onto elements
of the same type) are provided. The existence of infinitely many non-conjugate
elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic embeddings is also shown.
  In particular, a group G of automorphisms of a smooth surface S obtained by
blowing-up 10 points of the complex projective plane is given. The group G is
isomorphic to SL(2,Z), preserves an elliptic curve and all its elements of
infinite order are hyperbolic.
