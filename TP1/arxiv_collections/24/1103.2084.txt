We present a decomposition of the hadronic tensor for a general polarized
Drell-Yan process AB --> l^+ l^- X in terms of helicity structure functions
using the helicity axes of the dilepton rest frame as a basis. Next, we
consider a QCD parton model and in the framework of a generalized QCD
factorization scheme, which applies when the dilepton invariant mass M is much
larger than the transverse component of the photon momentum, q_T, in the
hadronic center of mass frame. In this approximation we compute the angular
distribution of the unpolarized Drell Yan cross section and of the Sivers
effect, in single polarized Drell-Yan scattering, by taking into account the
transverse motion of partons inside the initial hadrons, k_\perp. Interesting
and simple results are found in the kinematical region of k_\perp similar to
q_T << M, to first order in a q_T / M expansion. Finally, explicit analytical
expressions, convenient for phenomenological studies, are obtained assuming a
factorized Gaussian dependence on intrinsic momenta for the unpolarized and
Sivers distribution functions, in analogy to those obtained for semi-inclusive
deep inelastic scattering.
