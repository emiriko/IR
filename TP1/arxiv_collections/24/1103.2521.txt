We have investigated the vibrational density of states (VDOS) of a thin Cu
nanowire with $<100>$ axial orientation and considered the effect of axial
strain. The VDOS are calculated using a real space Green's function approach
with the force constant matrices extracted from interaction potential based on
the embedded atom method. Results for the vibrational density of states of a
strain-free nanowire show quite distinctive characteristics compared to that of
a bulk atom, the most striking feature of which is the existence of high
frequency modes above the top of the bulk spectrum. We further predict that the
low frequency characteristics of the VDOS reveal the quasi-1 dimensional (Q1D)
behavior only when the wire is extremely thin. Through decomposition of VDOS
into local atoms we also exhibit that while the anomalous increase in low
frequency density of states is mainly due to the corner atoms, the enhancement
in high frequency modes is primarily moderated by core atoms. We, additionally,
find that while the high frequency band above the top of the bulk phonon shifts
to higher frequencies, the characteristics at low frequencies remains almost
the same upon stretching the nanowire along the axial direction.
