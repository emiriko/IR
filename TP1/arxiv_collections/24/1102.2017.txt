The optimal dimensional synthesis for planar mechanisms using differential
evolution (DE) is demonstrated. Four examples are included: in the first case,
the synthesis of a mechanism for hybrid-tasks, considering path generation,
function generation, and motion generation, is carried out. The second and
third cases pertain to path generation, with and without prescribed timing.
Finally, the synthesis of an Ackerman mechanism is reported. Order defect
problem is solved by manipulating individuals instead of penalizing or
discretizing the search space for the parameters. A technique that consists in
applying a transformation in order to satisfy the Grashof and crank conditions
to generate an initial elitist population is introduced. As a result, the
evolutionary algorithm increases its efficiency.
