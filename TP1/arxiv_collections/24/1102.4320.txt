In a recent paper, Bancal et al. put forward the concept of
device-independent witnesses of genuine multipartite entanglement. These
witnesses are capable of verifying genuine multipartite entanglement produced
in a lab without resorting to any knowledge of the dimension of the state space
or of the specific form of the measurement operators. As a by-product they
found a three-party three-setting Bell inequality which enables to detect
genuine tripartite entanglement in a noisy 3-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger
(GHZ) state for visibilities as low as 2/3 in a device-independent way. In this
paper, we generalize this inequality to an arbitrary number of settings,
demonstrating a threshold visibility of 2/pi~0.6366 for number of settings
going to infinity. We also present a pseudo-telepathy Bell inequality achieving
the same threshold value. We argue that our device-independent witnesses are
optimal in the sense that the above value cannot be beaten with
three-party-correlation Bell inequalities.
