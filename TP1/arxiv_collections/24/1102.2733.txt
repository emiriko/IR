The intrinsic excitation energy of fission fragments is dynamically evaluated
in terms of the time dependent pairing equations. These equations are
corroborated with two conditions. One of them fixes the number of particles and
the another separates the pairing active spaces associated to the two fragments
in the vicinity of the scission configuration. The fission path is obtained in
the frame of the macroscopic-microscopic model. The single particle level
schemes are obtained within the two center Woods-Saxon shell model. It is shown
that the available intrinsic dissipated energy is not shared proportionally to
the masses of the two fission fragments. If the heavy fragment possesses
nucleon numbers close to the magic ones, the accumulated intrinsic excitation
energy is lower than that of the light fragment.
