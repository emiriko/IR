Molecular spintronics is recognized to as an attractive new research
direction in a field of spintronics, following to metallic spintronics and
inorganic semiconductor spintronics, and attracts many people in recent
decades. The purpose of this manuscript is to describe the history of molecular
spintronics by introducing important achievements and to show the current
status of this field. In addition, the authors briefly introduce several
theories for implementing studies in molecular spintronics.
