The future program of the NA62 experiment at CERN SPS is currently in
advanced stage of development. The main goal of the experiment is to measure
the branching ratio of the ultra-rare decay K^+ -> pi+\nu\nubar, by detecting
approximately 80 events with a background on the order of 10%. In the present
paper, the motivation behind this measurement and the overall design strategy
of the experiment are briefly outlined. The experiment's construction status is
discussed and perspectives are given for the first runs with the new detector.
