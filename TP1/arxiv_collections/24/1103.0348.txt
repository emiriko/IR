We present the Suzaku results of a supernova remnant (SNR), G359.1-0.5 in the
direction of the Galactic center region. From the SNR, we find prominent
K-shell lines of highly ionized Si and S ions, together with unusual structures
at 2.5-3.0 and 3.1-3.6 keV. No canonical SNR plasma model, in either ionization
equilibrium or under-ionization, can explain the structures. The energies and
shapes of the structures are similar to those of the radiative transitions of
free electrons to the K-shell of He-like Si and S ions (radiative recombination
continuum: RRC). The presence of the strong RRC structures indicates that the
plasma is in over-ionization. In fact, the observed spectrum is well fitted
with an over-ionized plasma model. The best-fit electron temperature of 0.29
keV is far smaller than the ionization temperature of 0.77 keV, which means
that G359.1-0.5 is in extreme condition of over-ionization. We report some
cautions on the physical parameters, and comment possible origins for the
over-ionized plasma.
