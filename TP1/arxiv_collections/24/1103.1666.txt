We present five new pulsating subdwarf B (sdB) stars discovered by the Kepler
spacecraft during the asteroseismology survey phase. We perform time-series
analysis on the nearly continuous month-long Kepler datasets of these 5
objects; these datasets provide nearly alias-free time-series photometry at
unprecedented precision. Following an iterative prewhitening process we derive
the pulsational frequency spectra of these stars, separating out artefacts of
known instrumental origin. We find that these new pulsating sdB stars are
multiperiodic long-period pulsators of the V1093 Her type, with the number of
periodicities ranging from 8 (KIC8302197) to 53 (KIC11558725). The frequencies
and amplitudes are typical of g-mode pulsators of this type. We do not find any
evidence for binarity in the five stars from their observed pulsation
frequencies. As these are g-mode pulsators, we briefly looked for period
spacings for mode identification, and found average spacings about 260s and
145s. This may indicate l=1 and 2 patterns. Some modes may show evidence of
rotational splitting. These discoveries complete the list of compact pulsators
found in the survey phase. Of the 13 compact pulsators, only one star was
identified as a short-period (p-mode) V361Hya pulsator, while all other new
pulsators turned out to be V1093 Her class objects. Among the latter objects,
two of them seemed to be pure V1093 Her while the others show additional low
amplitude peaks in the p-mode frequency range, suggesting their hybrid nature.
Authenticity of these peaks will be tested with longer runs currently under
analysis.
