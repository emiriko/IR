The ability to generate complete, or almost complete, chaotic mixing is of
great interest in numerous applications, particularly for microfluidics. For
this purpose, we propose a strategy that allows us to quickly target the
parameter values at which complete mixing occurs. The technique is applied to a
time periodic, two-dimensional electro-osmotic flow with spatially and
temporally varying Helmoltz-Smoluchowski slip boundary conditions. The strategy
consists of following the linear stability of some key periodic pathlines in
parameter space (i.e., amplitude and frequency of the forcing), particularly
through the bifurcation points at which such pathlines become unstable.
