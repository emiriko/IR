Work can be extracted from a single heat bath if additional information is
available. For the paradigmatic case of a Brownian particle in a harmonic
potential, whose position has been measured with finite precision, we determine
the optimal protocol for manipulating the center and stiffness of the potential
in order to maximize this work in a finite-time process. The bound on this work
imposed by a generalized second law inequality involving information can be
reached only if both position and stiffness of the potential are controlled and
the process is quasistatic. Estimates on the power delivered by such an
"information machine" operating cyclically follow from our analytical results.
