We report on extensive photometry of DK Lac obtained during the interval
1990-2009, which includes a 2 mag low state during 2001-2003. Much of the
photometry consists of exposures obtained with a typical spacing of several
days, but also includes 26 sequences of continuous photometry each lasting 2 to
7 hours. We find no evidence for periodicities in our data. We do find that the
random variations in the low state are ~2x those in the high state, when
expressed in magnitudes. The lack of orbital-time-scale variations is
attributed to the nearly face-on presentation of the disk. There is a 0.2 mag
decline in the high state brightness of the system over 19 years, which is
consistent with the behavior of other old novae in the decades following
outburst. High-state spectra are also presented and discussed. We find that the
equivalent width of H$\alpha$ falls by ~2x from 1991 to 2008. The photometric
properties are discussed in the context of the hibernation scenario for the
behavior of novae between outbursts, in which we conclude that low states in
old novae are probably unrelated to their possible entrance into hibernation.
