Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equations for the coexistent states of superconductivity
and magnetism are derived microscopically from the extended Hubbard model with
on-site repulsive and nearest-neighbor attractive interactions. In the derived
GL free energy a cubic term that couples the spin-singlet and spin-triplet
components of superconducting order parameters (SCOP) with magnetization
exists. This term gives rise to a spin-triplet SCOP near the interface between
a spin-singlet superconductor and a ferromagnet, consistent with previous
theoretical studies based on the Bogoliubov de Gennes method and the
quasiclassical Green's function theory. In coexistent states of singlet
superconductivity and antiferromagnetism it leads to the occurrence of
pi-triplet SCOPs.
