Gurau argued in [arXiv:1006.0714] that the gluing spaces arising as Feynman
diagrams of three-dimensional group field theory are not all pseudo-manifolds.
I dispute this conclusion: albeit not properly triangulated, these spaces are
genuine pseudo-manifolds, viz. their singular locus is of codimension at least
two.
