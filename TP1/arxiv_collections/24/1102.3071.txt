This article investigates the stability of a generic Kasner spacetime to
linear perturbations, both at late and early times. It demonstrates that the
perturbation of the Weyl tensor diverges at late time in all cases but in the
particular one in which the Kasner spacetime is the product of a
two-dimensional Milne spacetime and a two-dimensional Euclidean space. At early
times, the perturbation of the Weyl tensor also diverges unless one imposes a
condition on the perturbations so as to avoid the most divergent modes to be
excited.
