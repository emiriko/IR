We demonstrate by experiments and numerical simulations that the
low-temperature current-voltage characteristics in diffusive bilayer graphene
(BLG) exhibit a strong superlinearity at finite bias voltages. The
superlinearity is weakly dependent on doping and on the length of the graphene
sample. This effect can be understood as a result of Joule heating. It is
stronger in BLG than in monolayer graphene (MLG), since the conductivity of BLG
is more sensitive to temperature due to the higher density of electronic states
at the Dirac point.
