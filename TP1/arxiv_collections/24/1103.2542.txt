We formulate a simple and convenient criterion under which skew-adjoint
Z_2-graded total differential operators are Hamiltonian, provided that their
images are closed under commutation in the Lie algebras of evolutionary vector
fields on the infinite jet spaces for vector bundles over smooth manifolds.
