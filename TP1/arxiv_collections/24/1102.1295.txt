Spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD has traditionally been
inferred indirectly through low-energy theorems and comparison with
experiments. Thanks to the understanding of an unexpected connection between
chiral Random Matrix Theory and chiral Perturbation Theory, the spontaneous
breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD can now be shown unequivocally from first
principles and lattice simulations. In these lectures I give an introduction to
the subject, starting with an elementary discussion of spontaneous breaking of
global symmetries.
