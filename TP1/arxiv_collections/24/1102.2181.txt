COrE (Cosmic Origins Explorer) is a fourth-generation full-sky,
microwave-band satellite recently proposed to ESA within Cosmic Vision
2015-2025. COrE will provide maps of the microwave sky in polarization and
temperature in 15 frequency bands, ranging from 45 GHz to 795 GHz, with an
angular resolution ranging from 23 arcmin (45 GHz) and 1.3 arcmin (795 GHz) and
sensitivities roughly 10 to 30 times better than PLANCK (depending on the
frequency channel). The COrE mission will lead to breakthrough science in a
wide range of areas, ranging from primordial cosmology to galactic and
extragalactic science. COrE is designed to detect the primordial gravitational
waves generated during the epoch of cosmic inflation at more than $3\sigma $
for $r=(T/S)>=10^{-3}$. It will also measure the CMB gravitational lensing
deflection power spectrum to the cosmic variance limit on all linear scales,
allowing us to probe absolute neutrino masses better than laboratory
experiments and down to plausible values suggested by the neutrino oscillation
data. COrE will also search for primordial non-Gaussianity with significant
improvements over Planck in its ability to constrain the shape (and amplitude)
of non-Gaussianity. In the areas of galactic and extragalactic science, in its
highest frequency channels COrE will provide maps of the galactic polarized
dust emission allowing us to map the galactic magnetic field in areas of
diffuse emission not otherwise accessible to probe the initial conditions for
star formation. COrE will also map the galactic synchrotron emission thirty
times better than PLANCK. This White Paper reviews the COrE science program,
our simulations on foreground subtraction, and the proposed instrumental
configuration.
