In this presentation, we report our recent studies on the $K^*\Lambda(1116)$
photoproduction off the proton target, using the tree-level Born approximation,
via the effective Lagrangian approach. In addition, we include the nine (three-
or four-star confirmed) nucleon resonances below the threshold
$\sqrt{s}_\mathrm{th}\approx2008$ MeV, to interpret the discrepancy between the
experiment and previous theoretical studies, in the vicinity of the threshold
region. From the numerical studies, we observe that the $S_{11}(1535)$ and
$S_{11}(1650)$ play an important role for the cross-section enhancement near
the $\sqrt{s}_\mathrm{th}$. It also turns out that, in order to reproduce the
data, we have the vector coupling constants
$g_{K^*S_{11}(1535)\Lambda}=(7.0\sim9.0)$ and
$g_{K^*S_{11}(1650)\Lambda}=(5.0\sim6.0)$.
