FLASH II is an upgrade to the existing free electron laser (FEL) FLASH. The
echo-enabled harmonic generation (EEHG) scheme is proposed to be a potential
seeding option of FLASH II. In this paper, the possibility of EEHG operation of
FLASH II is investigated for the first time. With a combination of existing
numerical codes, i.e. a laser-beam interaction code in an undulator (LBICU), a
beam tracking code in a chicane (ELEGANT) and an universal FEL simulating code
(GENESIS), the effects of beam energy chirp and coherent synchrotron radiation
(CSR) on EEHG operation are studied as well. In addition, several interesting
issues concerning EEHG simulation are discussed.
