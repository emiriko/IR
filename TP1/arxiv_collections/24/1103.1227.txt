The objective of this paper is to prove the convergence of a linear implicit
multi-step numerical method for ordinary differential equations. The algorithm
is obtained via Taylor approximations. The convergence is proved following the
Dahlquist theory. As an additional topic, the time stability is established
too. Comparative tests between some of the most known numerical methods and
this method are presented.
