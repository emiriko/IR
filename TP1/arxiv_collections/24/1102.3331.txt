We report on electrical properties of the two sensing proteins:
bacteriorhodopsin and rat olfactory receptor OR-I7. As relevant transport
parameters we consider the small-signal impedance spectrum and the static
current-voltage characteristics. Calculations are compared with available
experimental results and the model predictability is tested for future
perspectives.
