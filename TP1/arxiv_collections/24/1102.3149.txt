Recent CMS data significantly extend the direct search exclusion for
supersymmetry. We examine the impact of such data on global fits of the
constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM) to indirect and
cosmological data. By simulating supersymmetric signal events at the LHC, we
construct a likelihood map for the recent CMS data, validating it against the
exclusion region calculated by the experiment itself. A previous CMSSM global
fit is then re-weighted by our likelihood map. The CMS results nibble away at
the high fit probability density region, transforming probability distributions
for the scalar and gluino masses. The CMS search has a non-trivial effect on
tan beta due to correlations between the parameters implied by the fits to
indirect data.
