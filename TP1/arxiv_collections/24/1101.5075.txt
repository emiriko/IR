We propose a single observable to witness the nonzero quantum discord of an
unknown quantum state provided that we have four copies of the state. The
expectation value of this observable provides a necessary and sufficient
condition for nonzero quantum discord in $2\times N$ systems and a necessary
condition in higher finite-dimensional bipartite systems. Furthermore, a
nontrivial lower bound of quantum discord can be obtained from this expectation
value. The proposed observable can be experimentally measured in exactly the
same easy manner as that of the entanglement witness, moreover a quantum
circuit is designed to determine the expectation value of our observable with
four simultaneous local qubit-measurements.
