Multistationarity in biological systems is a mechanism of cellular decision
making. In particular, signaling pathways regulated by protein phosphorylation
display features that facilitate a variety of responses to different biological
inputs. The features that lead to multistationarity are of particular interest
to determine as well as the stability properties of the steady states. In this
paper we determine conditions for the emergence of multistationarity in small
motifs without feedback that repeatedly occur in signaling pathways. We derive
an explicit mathematical relationship between the concentration of a chemical
species at steady state and a conserved quantity of the system such as the
total amount of substrate available. We show that the relation determines the
number of steady states and provides a necessary condition for a steady state
to be stable, that is, to be biologically attainable. Further, we identify
characteristics of the motifs that lead to multistationarity, and extend the
view that multistationarity in signaling pathways arises from multisite
phosphorylation. Our approach relies on mass-action kinetics and the
conclusions are drawn in full generality without resorting to simulations or
random generation of parameters. The approach is extensible to other systems.
