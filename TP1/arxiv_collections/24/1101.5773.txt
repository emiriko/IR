In order to describe the dynamics of monochromatic surface waves in deep
water, we derive a nonlinear and dispersive system of equations for the free
surface elevation and the free surface velocity from the Euler equations in
infinite depth. From it, and using a multiscale perturbative methods, an
asymptotic model for small-aspect-ratio waves is derived. The model is shown to
be completely integrable. The Lax pair, the first conserved quantities as well
as the symmetries are exhibited. Theoretical and numerical studies reveal that
it supports periodic progressive Stokes waves which peak and break in finite
time. Comparison between the limiting wave solution of the asymptotic model and
classical irrotational results is performed.
