The CMS and the ATLAS Collaborations have recently reported on the search for
supersymmetry with 35 pb$^{-1}$ of data and have put independent limits on the
parameter space of the supergravity unified model with universal boundary
conditions at the GUT scale for soft breaking, i.e., the mSUGRA model. We
extend this study by examining other regions of the mSUGRA parameter space in
$A_0$ and $\tan\beta$. Further, we contrast the reach of CMS and ATLAS with 35
pb$^{-1}$ of data with the indirect constraints, i.e., the constraints from the
Higgs boson mass limits, from flavor physics and from the dark matter limits
from WMAP. Specifically it is found that a significant part of the parameter
space excluded by CMS and ATLAS is essentially already excluded by the indirect
constraints and the fertile region of parameter space has yet to be explored.
We also emphasize that gluino masses as low as 400 GeV but for squark masses
much larger than the gluino mass remain unconstrained and further that much of
the hyperbolic branch of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking, with low
values of the Higgs mixing parameter $\mu$, is essentially untouched by the
recent LHC analysis.
