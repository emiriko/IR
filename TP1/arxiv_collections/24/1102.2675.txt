The type-Q equations lie on the top level of the hierarchy introduced by
Adler, Bobenko and Suris (ABS) in their classification of discrete counterparts
of KdV-type integrable partial differential equations. We ask what
singularities are possible in the solutions of these equations, and examine the
relationship between the singularities and the principal integrability feature
of multidimensional consistency. These questions are considered in the global
setting and therefore extend previous considerations of singularities which
have been local. What emerges are some simple geometric criteria that determine
the allowed singularities, and the interesting discovery that generically the
presence of singularities leads to a breakdown in the global consistency of
such systems despite their local consistency property. This failure to be
globally consistent is quantified by introducing a natural notion of monodromy
for isolated singularities.
