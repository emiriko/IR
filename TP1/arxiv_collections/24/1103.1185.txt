We report a systematic investigation on the high-temperature thermoelectric
response in a typical filling-control Mott transition system La1-xSrxVO3. In
the vicinity of the Mott transition, incoherent charge transport appears with
increasing temperature and the thermopower undergoes two essential crossovers,
asymptotically approaching the limit values expected from the entropy
consideration, as known as Heikes formula. By comparison with the results of
the dynamical mean field theory, we show that the thermopower in the Mott
critical state mainly measures the entropy per charge carrier that depends on
electronic degrees of freedom available at the measurement temperature. Our
findings verify that the Heikes formula is indeed applicable to the real
correlated electron systems at practical temperatures (T>200K).
