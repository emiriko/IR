We theoretically study the stability of a normal, spin disordered, homogenous
spin-1 Bose gas against ferromagnetism, pairing, and condensation through a
Random Phase Approximation which includes exchange (RPA-X). Repulsive
spin-independent interactions stabilize the normal state against both
ferromagnetism and pairing, and for typical interaction strengths leads to a
direct transition from an unordered normal state to a fully ordered single
particle condensate. Atoms with much larger spin-dependent interaction may
experience a transition to a ferromagnetic normal state or a paired superfluid,
but, within the RPA-X, there is no instability towards a normal state with
spontaneous nematic order. We analyze the role of the quadratic Zeeman effect
and finite system size.
