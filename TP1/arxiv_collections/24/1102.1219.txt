We introduce a method to compute from first principles the anomalous
dimension of short operators in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory at strong coupling,
where they are described in terms of superstring vertex operators in an anti-de
Sitter background. We focus on the Konishi multiplet, dual to the first massive
level of the superstring, and compute the one-loop correction to its anomalous
dimension at strong coupling, using the pure spinor formalism for the
superstring.
