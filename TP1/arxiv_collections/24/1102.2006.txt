A very low-cost, easy-to-make stopwatch is presented to support various
experiments in mechanics. The high-resolution stopwatch is based on two
photodetectors connected directly to the microphone input of the sound card. A
dedicated free open-source software has been developed and made available to
download. The efficiency is demonstrated by a free fall experiment.
