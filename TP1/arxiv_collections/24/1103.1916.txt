Lepton flavour violation and neutrino masses are a signal for new Physics
beyond the Standard Model and are deeply related. The minimal extension of the
Standard Model to make it include neutrino masses is not satisfactory from a
conceptual point of view, since it requires a severe fine-tuning of Yukawa
couplings. See-saw models provide a consistent and natural mechanism to
generate neutrino masses and require Physics beyond the Standard Model. In this
thesis, the connections between models for neutrino masses and processes that
violate lepton flavour are explored. The reconstruction of high energy
parameters from neutrino data is partially possible within the framework of
these see-saw models and it is enhanced by the knowledge of phenomena outside
the neutrino sector, as it is the case of lepton number violation processes.
Grand Unification SUSY models offer a consistent theoretical framework for Type
I, Type II and Type III see-saw models. On the other hand, Type II see-saw has
the attractive feature of producing a lepton asymmetry through triplet decays
which can be converted into a baryon asymmetry with leptogenesis. Thus being,
we studied a model to explain the baryonic density of the Universe constrained
by the phenomenological neutrino data.
