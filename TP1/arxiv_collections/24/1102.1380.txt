The motion of a rigid body immersed in an incompressible perfect fluid which
occupies a three- dimensional bounded domain have been recently studied under
its PDE formulation. In particular classical solutions have been shown to exist
locally in time. In this note, following the celebrated result of Arnold
concerning the case of a perfect incompressible fluid alone, we prove that
these classical solutions are the geodesics of a Riemannian manifold of
infinite dimension, in the sense that they are the critical points of an
action, which is the integral over time of the total kinetic energy of the
fluid-rigid body system.
