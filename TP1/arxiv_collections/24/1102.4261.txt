We report the development of a compact turn-key module that boosts the
resolution in quasi-elastic neutron scattering by several orders of magnitude
down to the low sub-micro-eV range. It is based on a pair of neutron resonance
spin flippers that generate a well defined temporal intensity modulation, also
known as MIEZE (Modulation of IntEnsity by Zero Effort). The module may be used
under versatile conditions, in particular in applied magnetic fields and for
depolarising and incoherently scattering samples. We demonstrate the power of
MIEZE in studies of the helimagnetic order in MnSi under applied magnetic
fields.
