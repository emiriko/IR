Millisecond pulsars are believed to descend from low mass x-ray binaries.
Observable parameters of binary millisecond pulsars e.g. mass of the pulsar,
mass of the companion, spin period of the pulsar, orbital period, orbital
eccentricity etc are used to probe the past accretion history of the
millisecond pulsars. But unfortunately in these studies, binding energy of the
neutron star is not considered commonly. We show that the effect of the binding
energy is significant in the estimation of the amount of mass accretion and
thus should be incorporated in models for binary evolutions. Moreover,
different Equations of State for dense matter give different values for the
accreted mass for the same amount of increase in the gravitational mass of the
neutron star implying the need of constraining dense matter Equations of State
even to understand the spin-up procedure properly.
