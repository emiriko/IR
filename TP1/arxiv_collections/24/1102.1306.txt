Following a recent work on equation of state for strongly interacting
quark-gluon plasma [J. Phys. G: Nucl. Part. Phys. 32, 993 (2006)], we revisited
the equation of state by incorporating the non-perturbative effects in the
deconfined plasma phase. Our results on thermodynamic observables viz.
pressure, energy density, speed of sound etc. nicely fit with the lattice
equation of state for gluon, massless and as well massive flavored plasma.
Motivated by this agreement with lattice results, we have employed our equation
of state to estimate the quarkonium suppression in an expanding, dissipative
strongly interacting QGP produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and our
prediction matches exactly with the recent PHENIX data on the centrality
dependence of $J/\psi$ suppression in Au+Au collisions at BNL RHIC. We have
also predicted for the $\Upsilon$ suppression in Pb+Pb collisions at LHC energy
which could be tested in the ALICE experiments at CERN LHC.
