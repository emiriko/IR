Identifying non-Markovianity with non-divisibility, we propose a measure for
non-Markovinity of quantum process. Three examples are presented to illustrate
the non-Markovianity, measure for non-Markovianity is calculated and discussed.
Comparison with other measures of non-Markovianity is made. Our
non-Markovianity measure has the merit that no optimization procedure is
required and it is finite for any quantum process, which greatly enhances the
practical relevance of the proposed measure.
