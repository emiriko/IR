Recent results from CDF and D{\O} collaborations favor a large CP asymmetry
in B_s^0-\bar{B}_s^0 mixing, while the standard model prediction is very small.
Such a large phase may imply sizable new physics effects in B_s^0-\bar{B}_s^0
mixing. We compute the gluino-mediated supersymmetry contributions to
B_s^0-\bar{B}_s^0 mixing, B_s->K^{(*)-}K^{(*)+} and B->X_s\gamma decays in the
frame of the mass insertion approximation. Combining the constraints of
\DeltaM_s, \Delta\Gamma_s, \phi^{J/\psi\phi}_s, B(B_s->K^{-}K^{+}) and B(B->X_s
\gamma), we find that the effects of the constrained LL and RR insertions in
B_s->K^{(*)-}K^{(*)+} decays are small because of the absence of gluino mass
enhancement. For m^2_{\tilde{g}}/m^2_{\tilde{q}}=9, the constrained LR
insertion can provide sizable contributions to all observables of
B_s->K^{(*)-}K^{(*)+} decays except A^{dir}_{CP}(B_s->K^{-}K^{+}), and many
observables are sensitive to the modulus and the phase of the LR insertion
parameter. Near future experiments at Fermilab Tevatron and CERN LHC-b can test
these predictions and shrink/reveal the mass insertion parameter spaces.
