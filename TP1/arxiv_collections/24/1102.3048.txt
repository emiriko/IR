We consider the large N limit of the Nahm transform, which relates charge N
monopoles to solutions to the Nahm equation involving NxN matrices. In the
large N limit the former approaches a magnetic bag, and the latter approaches a
solution of the Nahm equation based on the Lie algebra of area-preserving
vector fields on the 2-sphere. We show that the Nahm transform simplifies
drastically in this limit.
