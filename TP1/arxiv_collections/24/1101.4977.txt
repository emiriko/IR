Space missions to NEOs are being planned at all major space agencies, and
recently a manned mission to an NEO was announced as a NASA goal. Efforts to
find and select suitable targets (plus backup targets) are severely hampered by
our lack of knowledge of the physical properties of dynamically favorable NEOs.
In particular, current mission scenarios tend to favor primitive low-albedo
objects. For the vast majority of NEOs the albedo is unknown.
  Here we report new constraints on the size and albedo of 65 NEOs with
rendezvous deltaV < 7 km/s. Our results are based on thermal-IR flux data
obtained in the framework of our ongoing (2009--2011) ExploreNEOs survey
(Trilling et al. 2010) using NASA's "Warm Spitzer" space telescope. As of 2010
July 14, we have results for 293 objects in hand (including the 65 low-deltaV
NEOs presented here); before the end of 2011 we expect to have measured the
size and albedo of ~ 700 NEOs (including probably ~ 160 low-deltaV NEOs).
  While there are reasons to believe that primitive volatile-rich materials are
universally low in albedo, the converse need not be true: the orbital evolution
of some dark objects likely has caused them to lose their volatiles by coming
too close to the Sun. For all our targets, we give the closest perihelion
distance they are likely to have reached (using orbital integrations from
Marchi et al. 2009) and corresponding upper limits on the past surface
temperature. Low-deltaV objects for which both albedo and thermal history may
suggest a primitive composition include (162998) 2001 SK162, (68372) 2001 PM9,
and (100085) 1992 UY4.
