We get the distributions of shower partons initiated by heavy quarks $c$ and
$b$ by studying the fragmentation functions in the framework of the
recombination model. The transverse momentum spectra of heavy flavored mesons
are predicted with these distributions. We find that the contribution from the
recombination of thermal-shower partons is an important part in the total
spectrum for the mesons. We predict the heavy flavored meson productions for
different centralities with the heavy quark fugacities fitted by the
experimental data of $J/\psi$ transverse momentum spectra in Au+Au collisions.
