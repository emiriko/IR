With the advance of Web Services technologies and the emergence of Web
Services into the information space, tremendous opportunities for empowering
users and organizations appear in various application domains including
electronic commerce, travel, intelligence information gathering and analysis,
health care, digital government, etc. However, the technology to organize,
search, integrate these Web Services has not kept pace with the rapid growth of
the available information space. The number of Web Services to be integrated
may be large and continuously changing. To ease and improve the process of Web
services discovery in an open environment like the Internet, it is suggested to
gather similar Web services into groups known as communities. Although Web
services are intensively investigated, the community management issues have not
been addressed yet In this paper we draw an overview of several Web services
Communities' management approaches based on some currently existing communities
platforms and frameworks. We also discuss different approaches for querying and
selecting Web services under the umbrella of Web services communities'. We
compare the current approaches among each others with respect to some key
requirements.
