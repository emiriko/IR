With rapid growth of the database of the BES III and the proposed super
flavor factory, measurement on the rare $\psi(2S)$ decays may be feasible,
especially the weak decays into baryon final states. In this work we study the
decay rate of $\psi(2S)$ to $\Lambda_c+\overline{\Sigma^+}$ in the SM and
physics beyond the SM (here we use the unparticle model as an example). The QPC
model is employed to describe the creation of a pair of $q\bar q$ from vacuum.
We find that the rate of $\psi(2S)\rightarrow \Lambda_c+\overline{\Sigma^+}$ is
at order of $10^{-10}$ in the SM, whereas the contribution of the unparticle is
too small to be substantial. Therefore if a large branching ratio is observed,
it must be due to new physics beyond SM, but by no means the unparticle.
