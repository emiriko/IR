We have introduced a class of spiraling elliptic solitons in generic nonlocal
nonlinear media. The spiraling elliptic solitons carry the orbital angular
momentum. This class solitons are stable for any degree of nonlocality except
for the local case when the response function of the material is Gaussian
function.
