We present a novel method for direct detection and characterization of
exoplanets from space. This method uses four collecting telescopes, combined
with phase chopping and a spectrometer, with observations on only a few
baselines rather than on a continuously rotated baseline. Focusing on the
contiguous wavelength spectra of typical exoplanets, the (u, v) plane can be
simultaneously and uniformly filled by recording the spectrally resolved
signal. This concept allows us to perfectly remove speckles from reconstructed
images. For a target comprising a star and multiple planets, observations on
three baselines are sufficient to extract the position and spectrum of each
planet. Our simulations show that this new method allows us to detect an analog
Earth around a Sun-like star at 10 pc and to acquire its spectrum over the
wavelength range from 8 to 19 {\mu}m with a high spectral resolution of 100.
This method allows us to fully characterize an analog Earth and to similarly
characterize each planet in multi-planet systems.
