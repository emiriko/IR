In this paper, capacity inner and outer bounds are established for the
multiuser channels with Channel State Information (CSI) known non-causally at
the transmitters: The Multiple Access Channel (MAC), the Broadcast Channel (BC)
with common information, and the Relay Channel (RC). For each channel, the
actual capacity region is also derived in some special cases. Specifically, it
is shown that for some deterministic models with non-causal CSI at the
transmitters, similar to Costa's Gaussian channel, the availability of CSI at
the deterministic receivers does not affect the capacity region.
