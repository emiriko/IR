We present BV RI photometric and low-resolution spectroscopic investigation
of a type II core-collapse supernova (SN) 2008gz, which occurred in a star
forming arm and within a half-light radius (solar metallicity region) of a
nearby spiral galaxy NGC 3672. The SN event was detected late and a detailed
investigation of its light curves and spectra spanning 200 days suggest that it
is an event of type IIP similar to archetypal SNe 2004et and 1999em. However,
in contrast to other events of its class, the SN 2008gz exhibits rarely
observed V magnitude drop of 1.5 over the period of a month during plateau to
nebular phase. Using 0.21 mag of Av as a lower limit and a distance of 25.5
Mpc, we estimate synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of 0.05 \pm 0.01 M* and a
mid-plateau Mv of -16.6 \pm 0.2 mag. The photospheric velocity is observed to
be higher than that was observed for SN 2004et at similar epochs, indicating
explosion energy was comparable to or higher than SN 2004et. Similar trend was
also seen for the expansion velocity of H-envelopes. By comparing its
properties with other well studied events as well as by using a recent
simulation of pre-SN models of Dessart, Livne & Waldman (2010), we infer an
explosion energy range of 2 - 3 x 10$^{51}$ erg and this coupled with the
observed width of the forbidden [O I] 6300-6364 {\AA} line at 275 days after
the explosion gives an upper limit for the main-sequence (non-rotating, solar
metallicity) progenitor mass of 17 M*. Our narrow-band H{\alpha} observation,
taken nearly 560 days after the explosion and the presence of an emission kink
at zero velocity in the Doppler corrected spectra of SN indicate that the event
took place in a low luminosity star forming H II region.
