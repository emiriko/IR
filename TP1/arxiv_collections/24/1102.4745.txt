We analyze the profiles of iron emission lines observed in solar coronal
dimmings associated with coronal mass ejections, using the EUV Imaging
Spectrometer on board Hinode. We quantify line profile distortions with
empirical coefficients (asymmetry and peakedness) that compare the fitted
Gaussian to the data. We find that the apparent line broadenings reported in
previous studies are likely to be caused by inhomogeneities of flow velocities
along the line of sight, or at scales smaller than the resolution scale, or by
velocity fluctuations during the exposure time. The increase in the amplitude
of Alfv\'en waves cannot, alone, explain the observed features. A
double-Gaussian fit of the line profiles shows that, both for dimmings and
active region loops, one component is nearly at rest while the second component
presents a larger Doppler shift than that derived from a single-Gaussian fit.
