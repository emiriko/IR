For N=1 supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics, regularized by higher
derivatives, a method for summation of all Feynman diagrams defining the
beta-function is presented. Using this method we prove that the beta-function
is given by an integral of a total derivative, which can be easily calculated.
It is shown that surviving terms give the exact NSVZ beta-function. The results
are compared with the explicit three-loop calculation.
