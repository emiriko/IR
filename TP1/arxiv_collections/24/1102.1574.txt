The reaction $np \rightarrow np \pi^+ \pi^-$ was studied at the various
momenta of incident neutrons. It was shown that the characteristics of the
reaction at the momenta above 3 GeV/c could be described by the model of
reggeized $\pi$ exchange (OPER). At the momenta below 3 GeV/c, it was necessary
to use additionally the mechanism of one baryon exchange (OBE).
