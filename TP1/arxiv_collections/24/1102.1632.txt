In this work, we have considered the DBI-essence dark energy model in FRW
Universe. We have found the exact solutions of potential, warped brane tension
and DBI scalar field. We also calculate the statefinder parameters for our
model that make it distinguishable among numerous dark energy models. Moreover,
we establish correspondence between DBI-essence and modified Chaplygin gas
(MCG) and hence reconstruct the potential and warped brane tension. By this
reconstruction, we observe that DBI scalar field and potential increase and
warped brane tension decreases during evolution of the Universe. Finally, we
investigate the validity of the generalized second law (GSL) of thermodynamics
in the presence of DBI-essence and modified Chaplygin gas. It is observed that
the GSL breaks down for DBI-essence model but GSL always satisfied for MCG
model.
