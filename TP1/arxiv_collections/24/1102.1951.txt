Adopting the setting for the study of existence and scale locality of the
energy cascade in 3D viscous flows in physical space recently introduced by the
authors to 3D inviscid flows, it is shown that the anomalous dissipation is --
in the case of decaying turbulence -- indeed capable of triggering the cascade
which then continues ad infinitum, confirming Onsager's predictions.
