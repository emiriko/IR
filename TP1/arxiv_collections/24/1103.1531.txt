The backreaction of inhomogeneities on the global expansion history of the
Universe suggests a possible link of the formation of structures to the recent
accelerated expansion. In this paper, the origin of this conjecture is
illustrated and a model without Dark Energy that allows for a more explicit
investigation of this link is discussed. Additionally to this conceptually
interesting feature, the model leads to a LCDM-like distance-redshift relation
that is consistent with SN data.
