Position-dependent property of the neutrino produced in high-energy pion
decay is studied theoretically using a wave packet formalism. It is found that
the neutrino probability has a universal finite-distance correction if the pion
has a long coherence length. This correction has origins in the interference of
the neutrino that is caused by the small neutrino mass and a light-cone
singularity of the pion and muon system. This term is positive definite and
leads excess to the neutrino flux over the in-coherent value at macroscopic
distance of near detector region. The flux decreases slowly with distance in a
universal manner that is determined by the absolute value of the neutrino mass
and energy. Absolute value of the neutrino mass is expected to be measured
indirectly from the neutrino detection probability at finite distance.
