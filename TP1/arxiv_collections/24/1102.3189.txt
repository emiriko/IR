We investigate the LHC discovery potential of R-parity violating
supersymmetric models with a right-handed selectron or smuon as the lightest
supersymmetric particle (LSP). These LSPs arise naturally in R-parity violating
minimal supergravity models. We classify the hadron collider signatures and
perform for the first time within these models a detailed signal over
background analysis. We develop an inclusive three-lepton search and give
prospects for a discovery at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV as well as 14
TeV. There are extensive parameter regions which the LHC can already test with
7 TeV and an integrated luminosity of 1 inverse femtobarn. We also propose a
method for the mass reconstruction of the supersymmetric particles within our
models at 14 TeV.
