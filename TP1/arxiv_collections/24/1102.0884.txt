This paper investigates the impact of the changes of the characteristic
polynomials and initial loadings, on behaviour of aliasing errors of parallel
signature analyzer (Multi-Input Shift Register), used in an LFSR based digital
circuit testing technique. The investigation is carried-out through an
extensive simulation study of the effectiveness of the LFSR based digital
circuit testing technique. The results of the study show that when the
identical characteristic polynomials of order n are used in both pseudo-random
test-pattern generator, as well as in Multi-Input Shift Register (MISR)
signature analyzer (parallel type) then the probability of aliasing errors
remains unchanged due to the changes in the initial loadings of the
pseudo-random test-pattern generator.
