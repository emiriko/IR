This paper addresses combinatorial optimization scheme for solving the
multicriteria Steiner tree problem for communication network topology design
(e.g., wireless mesh network). The solving scheme is based on several models:
multicriteria ranking, clustering, minimum spanning tree, and minimum Steiner
tree problem. An illustrative numerical example corresponds to designing a
covering long-distance Wi-Fi network (static Ad-Hoc network). The set of
criteria (i.e., objective functions) involves the following: total cost, total
edge length, overall throughput (capacity), and estimate of QoS. Obtained
computing results show the suggested solving scheme provides good network
topologies which can be compared with minimum spanning trees.
