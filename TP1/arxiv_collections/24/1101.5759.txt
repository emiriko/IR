On 17 January 2005 two fast coronal mass ejections were recorded in close
succession during two distinct episodes of a 3B/X3.8 flare. Both were
accompanied by metre-to-kilometre type-III groups tracing energetic electrons
that escape into the interplanetary space and by decametre-to-hectometre type-
II bursts attributed to CME-driven shock waves. A peculiar type-III burst group
was observed below 600 kHz 1.5 hours after the second type III group. It
occurred without any simultaneous activity at higher frequencies, around the
time when the two CMEs were expected to interact. We associate this emission
with the interaction of the CMEs at heliocentric distances of about 25 R\odot.
Near-relativistic electrons observed by the EPAM experiment onboard ACE near 1
AU revealed successive particle releases that can be associated with the two
flare/CME events and the low-frequency type-III burst at the time of CME
interaction. We compare the pros and cons of shock acceleration and
acceleration in the course of magnetic reconnection for the escaping electron
beams revealed by the type III bursts and for the electrons measured in situ.
