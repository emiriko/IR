The great flexibility of a view camera allows to take high quality
photographs that would not be possible any other way. But making a given object
into focus is a long and tedious task, although the underlying laws are well
known. This paper presents the result of a project which has lead to the design
of a computer controlled view camera and to its companion software. Thanks to
the high precision machining of its components, and to the known optical
parameters of lenses and sensor, we have been able to consider a reliable
mathematical model of the view camera, allowing the acquisition of 3D
coordinates to build a geometrical model of the object. Then many problems can
be solved, e.g. minimizing the f-number while maintaining the object within the
depth of field, which takes the form of a constrained optimization problem. All
optimization algorithms have been validated on a virtual view camera before
implementation on the prototype
