A bandwidth puzzle was recently proposed to defend against colluding
adversaries in peer-to-peer networks. The colluding adversaries do not do
actual work but claim to have uploaded contents for each other to gain free
credits from the system. The bandwidth puzzle guarantees that if the
adversaries can solve the puzzle, they must have spent substantial bandwidth,
the size of which is comparable to the size of the contents they claim to have
uploaded for each other. Therefore, the puzzle discourages the collusion. In
this paper, we study the performance of the bandwidth puzzle and give a lower
bound on the average number of bits the adversaries must receive to be able to
solve the puzzles with a certain probability. We show that our bound is tight
in the sense that there exists a strategy to approach this lower bound
asymptotically within a small factor. The new bound gives better security
guarantees than the existing bound, and can be used to guide better choices of
puzzle parameters to improve the system performance.
