We have performed a numerical solution for band structure of an Abrikosov
vortex lattice in type-II superconductors forming a periodic array in two
dimensions for applications of incorporating the photonic crystals concept into
superconducting materials with possibilities for optical electronics. The
implemented numerical method is based on the extensive numerical solution of
the Ginzburg-Landau equation for calculating the parameters of the two-fluid
model and obtaining the band structure from the permittivity, which depends on
the above parameters and the frequency. This is while the characteristics of
such crystals highly vary with an externally applied static normal magnetic
field, leading to nonlinear behavior of the band structure, which also has
nonlinear dependence on the temperature. The similar analysis for every
arbitrary lattice structure is also possible to be developed by this approach
as presented in this work. We also present some examples and discuss the
results.
