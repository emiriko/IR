In this article we address the problem of Euler's buckling instability in a
charged semi-flexible polymer that is under the action of a compressive force.
We consider this instability as a phase transition and investigate the role of
thermal fluctuations in the buckling critical force. By performing molecular
dynamic simulations, we show that the critical force decreases when the
temperature increases. Repulsive electrostatic interaction in the finite
temperature is in competition with thermal fluctuations to increase the
buckling threshold.
