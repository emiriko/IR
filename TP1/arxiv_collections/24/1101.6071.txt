The evolution of organismal populations is not typically thought of in terms
of classical mechanics. However, many of the conceptual models used to
approximate evolutionary trajectories have implicit parallels to dynamic
physical systems. The parallels between currently-used evolutionary models and
a type of model related to Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) will be
explored. The limits of evolvability in a population can be treated in a way
analogous to fronts, waves, and other aggregate formations observed in fluid
dynamics. Various measures and architectural features will be introduced.
Relevant scenarios include so-called evolvable boundaries and related scenarios
involving evolutionary neutrality, such as migrations, demographic bottlenecks,
and island biogeography. The LCS-like model introduced here could eventually be
applied to a wide range of problems that normally utilize forms of evolutionary
modeling.
