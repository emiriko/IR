The anisotropic properties of an optimally doped
Nd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} single crystal have been studied both below
and above the critical temperature Tc via the resistivity measurement in
magnetic field H up to 12 T. By scaling the conductivity fluctuation around the
superconducting transition, the upper critical field H_{c2}(T) has been
determined for field parallel to the c-axis or to the basal ab-plane. The
anisotropy factor \gamma={H_c2||ab}/{H_c2||c} is estimated to be about 8. In
the normal state (50=<T=<180 K), the magnetoresistance (MR) basically follows
an H^2 dependence and for H||c it is almost 10 times larger than that for
H||ab. Comparing with hole-doped cuprates it suggests that the optimally doped
Nd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} cuprate superconductor has a moderate
anisotropy.
