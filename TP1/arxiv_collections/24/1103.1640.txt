We report on a Chandra Director's Discretionary Time observation of the
globular cluster Terzan 5, carried out ~7 weeks after the cessation of the 2010
outburst of the newly discovered transiently accreting 11 Hz X-ray pulsar. We
detect a thermal spectrum that can be fitted with a neutron star atmosphere
model with a temperature for an observer at infinity of kT~100 eV, and a
quiescent thermal bolometric luminosity of Lq~2E33 erg/s for an assumed
distance of 5.5 kpc. The thermal emission is elevated above the quiescent base
level measured in 2003 and 2009, i.e., prior to the recent accretion outburst.
A likely explanation is that the neutron star crust was significantly heated
during the recent accretion episode and needs to cool until it restores thermal
equilibrium with the core. Although this has been observed for neutron star
low-mass X-ray binaries that undergo accretion episodes of years to decades, it
is the first time that evidence for crustal heating is detected for a transient
system with a regular outburst duration of weeks. This opens up a new window to
study heating and cooling of transiently accreting neutron stars.
