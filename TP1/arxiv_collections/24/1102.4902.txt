An improvement of the scheme by Brunner and Simon [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105,
010405 (2010)] is proposed in order to show that quantum weak measurements can
provide a method to detect ultrasmall longitudinal phase shifts, even with
white light. By performing an analysis in the frequency domain, we find that
the amplification effect will work as long as the spectrum is large enough,
irrespective of the behavior in the time domain. As such, the previous scheme
can be notably simplified for experimental implementations.
