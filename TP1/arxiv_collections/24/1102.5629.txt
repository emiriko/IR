Consistent statistical physical description is given for systems where the
elementary excitations are composite objects. Explicit calculational scheme is
constructed for the energy density and the total number of thermodynamical
degrees of freedom, based on the spectral function of the system. One
demonstrates through characteristic examples that single quasiparticle
contributions combine non-linearly in these quantities. Relation to the Gibbs
paradox is also discussed.
