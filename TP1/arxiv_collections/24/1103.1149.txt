The Chandra Carina Complex contains 200 known O- and B type stars. The
Chandra survey detected 68 of the 70 O stars and 61 of 127 known B0-B3 stars.
We have assembled a publicly available optical/X-ray database to identify OB
stars that depart from the canonical Lx/Lbol relation, or whose average X-ray
temperatures exceed 1 keV. Among the single O stars with high kT we identify
two candidate magnetically confined wind shock sources: Tr16-22, O8.5 V, and LS
1865, O8.5 V((f)). The O4 III(fc) star HD 93250 exhibits strong, hard, variable
X-rays, suggesting it may be a massive binary with a period of >30 days. The
visual O2 If* binary HD 93129A shows soft 0.6 keV and hard 1.9 keV emission
components, suggesting embedded wind shocks close to the O2 If* Aa primary, and
colliding wind shocks between Aa and Ab. Of the 11 known O-type spectroscopic
binaries, the long orbital-period systems HD 93343, HD 93403 and QZ Car have
higher shock temperatures than short-period systems such as HD 93205 and FO 15.
Although the X-rays from most B stars may be produced in the coronae of unseen,
low-mass pre-main-sequence companions, a dozen B stars with high Lx cannot be
explained by a distribution of unseen companions. One of these, SS73 24 in the
Treasure Chest cluster, is a new candidate Herbig Be star.
