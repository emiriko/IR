We have derived the corresponding equations and found their solutions both
for nonparaxial and paraxial beams. The paraxial solutions we have presented in
the form of the generalized Hermite-Gaussian beams propagating perpendicular to
the optical axis of a uniaxial crystal. We have also constructed the
generalized Laguerre-Gaussian beams at the z=0 plane and analyzed their
evolution in a homogeneous isotropic medium. Comparing it with the evolution of
the standard Laguerre-Gaussian beams with and in the crystal we have revealed
that the additional elliptic deformation of the extraordinary beam results in
topological reactions that essentially distorts field structure for the account
of different rotation rates of the vortex row originated from the centered
degenerate optical vortex and the conoscopic pattern. We have predicted
conversion of the vortex topological charge at the beam axis similar to that in
astigmatic lenses and analyzed the radical differences with this process. We
have revealed the synchronic oscillations of the spin angular momentum and the
sign of the vortex topological charge at the beam axis.
