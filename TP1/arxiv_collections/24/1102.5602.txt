We utilize a chemical equilibrium code in order to study the condensation
process which occurs in protoplanetary discs during the formation of the first
solids. The model specifically focuses on the thermodynamic behaviour on the
solid species assuming the regular solution model. For each solution, we
establish the relationship between the activity of the species, the composition
and the temperature using experimental data from the literature. We then apply
the Gibbs free energy minimization method and study the resulting condensation
sequence for a range of temperatures and pressures within a protoplanetary
disc. Our results using the regular solution model show that grains condense
over a large temperature range and therefore throughout a large portion of the
disc. In the high temperature region (T > 1400 K) Ca-Al compounds dominate and
the formation of corundum is sensitive to the pressure. The mid-temperature
region is dominated by Fe(s) and silicates such as Mg2SiO4 and MgSiO3 . The
chemistry of forsterite and enstatite are strictly related, and our simulations
show a sequence of forsterite-enstatite-forsterite with decreasing temperature.
In the low temperature regions (T < 600 K) a range of iron compounds and
sulfides form. We also run simulations using the ideal solution model and see
clear differences in the resulting condensation sequences with changing
solution model In particular, we find that the turning point in which
forsterite replaces enstatite in the low temperature region is sensitive to the
solution model. Our results show that the ideal solution model is often a poor
approximation to experimental data at most temperatures important in
protoplanetary discs. We find some important differences in the resulting
condensation sequences when using the regular solution model, and suggest that
this model should provide a more realistic condensation sequence.
