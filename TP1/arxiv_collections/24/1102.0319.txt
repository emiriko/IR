We examine the influence of microwave photoexcitation on the amplitude of
Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations in a two dimensional GaAs/AlGaAs electron
system in a regime where the cyclotron frequency, $\omega_{c}$, and the
microwave angular frequency, $\omega$, satisfy $2 \omega \le \omega_{c} \le 3.5
\omega$. A SdH lineshape analysis indicates that increasing the incident
microwave power has a weak effect on the amplitude of the SdH oscillations, in
comparison to the influence of modest temperature changes on the dark-specimen
SdH effect. The results indicate negligible electron heating under modest
microwave photoexcitation, in good agreement with theoretical predictions.
