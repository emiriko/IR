We study the dynamical quasiparticle scattering by spin and charge
fluctuations in Fe-based pnictides within a five-orbital model with on-site
interactions. The leading contribution to the scattering rate is calculated
from the second-order diagrams with the polarization operator calculated in the
random-phase approximation. We find one-particle scattering rates which are
highly anisotropic on each Fermi surface sheet due to the momentum dependence
of the spin susceptibility and the multi-orbital composition of each Fermi
pocket. This fact, combined with the anisotropy of the effective mass, produces
disparity between electrons and holes in conductivity, the Hall coefficient,
and the Raman initial slope, in qualitative agreement with experimental data.
