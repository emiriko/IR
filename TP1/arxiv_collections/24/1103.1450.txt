We present the review of some new problems in cosmology and physics of stars
in connection with future launching of WSO. We discuss three problems. UV
observations of distant z > 6 quasars allow to obtain information on the soft <
1 KeV X-ray radiation of the accretion disk around a supermassive black hole
because of its cosmological redshift. Really the region of X-ray radiation is
insufficiently investigated because of high galactic absorption. In a result
one will get important information on the reionization zone of the Universe.
Astronomers from ESO revealed the effect of alignment of electric vectors of
polarized QSOs. One of the probable mechanism of such alignment is the
conversion of QSO radiation into low mass pseudoscalar particles (axions) in
the extragalactic magnetic field. These boson like particles have been
predicted by new SUSY particle physics theory. Since the probability of such
conversion is increasing namely in UV spectral range one can expect the strong
correlation between UV spectral energy distribution of QSO radiation and
polarimetric data in the optical range. In the stellar physics one of the
interesting problems is the origin of the X-ray sources with super Eddington
luminosities. The results of UV observations of these X-ray sources will allow
to find the origin of these sources as accreting intermediate mass black holes.
