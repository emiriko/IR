We express the asymptotics of the remainders of the partial sums {s_n} of the
generalized hypergeometric function q+1_F_q through an inverse power series z^n
n^l \sum_k c_k/n^k, where the exponent l and the asymptotic coefficients {c_k}
may be recursively computed to any desired order from the hypergeometric
parameters and argument. From this we derive a new series acceleration
technique that can be applied to any such function, even with complex
parameters and at the branch point z=1. For moderate parameters (up to
approximately ten) a C implementation at fixed precision is very effective at
computing these functions; for larger parameters an implementation in higher
than machine precision would be needed. Even for larger parameters, however,
our C implementation is able to correctly determine whether or not it has
converged; and when it converges, its estimate of its error is accurate.
