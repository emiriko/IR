In this paper are made some considerations of the application of
phenomenological thermodynamics in risk analysis for the transaction on
financial markets, using the concept of economic entropy and the macrostate
parameter introduced by us in a previous works [15,16]. The investment risk
diagrams for a number of Romanian listed companies in 2008 and 2009 years were
calculed. Also, the evolution of the macrostate parameter during financial and
economic crisis in Romania are studied.
