In memory of Polish mathematicians murdured by the Soviets and the Nazis.
  The total record of accomplishments of Marcinkiewicz in his short life, his
talent, perceptions rich in concepts, and technical novelties, go far beyond my
ability to give full play within the confines of one article. The importance of
Marcinkiewicz's short paper is reflected in the myriad applications and
generalizations which earns the right to be called Marcinkiewicz Interpolation
Theory
  Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem came after the celebrated convexity
theorem of M. Riesz and his student G.O. Thorin. These fundamental works by M.
Riesz, G.O. Thorin and J. Marcinkiewicz deal with estimates of the Lp-norms of
an operator, knowing its behavior at the end-points of the interval of the
exponents p, where the operator is still defined. There are, however, some
subtle differences between the Riesz-Thorin and the Marcinkiewicz ideas.
Marcinkiewicz approach can be adapted to nonlinear operators, this is what we
demonstrate in the present paper.
