After a long technical and consequently philosophical disgression about the
necessity of the construction presented in this book, a logically consistent
and precise theory of quantum gravity is presented. The construction of this
theory goes in several steps; at first we take a fairly conservative point of
view and stumble upon some technical difficulties. Consequently, we investigate
a new mathematical implication of an old idea to solve these problems; the
latter suggest however a completely new way of doing quantum theory. This novel
theory automatically incoorporates an extended form of gravity as well as a
quantum gauge theory. We compute that the well known free quantum field
theories and Newtonian gravity emerge in a suitable limit. The philosophy
constructed here is to a high degree Whiteheadian.
