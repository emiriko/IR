We consider filtration consistent nonlinear expectations in probability
spaces satisfying only the usual conditions and separability. Under a
domination assumption, we demonstrate that these nonlinear expectations can be
expressed as the solutions to Backward Stochastic Differential Equations with
Lipschitz continuous drivers, where both the martingale and the driver terms
are permitted to jump, and the martingale representation is infinite
dimensional. To establish this result, we show that this domination condition
is sufficient to guarantee that the comparison theorem for BSDEs will hold, and
we generalise the nonlinear Doob-Meyer decomposition of Peng to a general
context.
