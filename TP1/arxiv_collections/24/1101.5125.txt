The Beam Energy Scan program has been undertaken at the Relativistic Heavy
Ion Collider (RHIC) to search for the QCD critical point. The presence of the
critical point is expected to lead to non-monotonic behavior of several
quantities. Here we report the result of higher moments of net-charge
distributions for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 39 GeV as measured by
the STAR experiment. The STAR results are compared with results from HIJING
event generator and Hadron Resonance (HRG) Models.
