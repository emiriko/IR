We present follow-up observations of two galaxy clusters detected blindly via
the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect and released in the Planck Early Release
Compact Source Catalogue. We use the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager, a dual-array
14-18 GHz radio interferometer. After radio source subtraction, we find a SZ
decrement of integrated flux density -1.08+/-0.10 mJy toward PLCKESZ
G121.11+57.01, and improve the position measurement of the cluster, finding the
centre to be RA 12 59 36.4, Dec +60 04 46.8, to an accuracy of 20 arcseconds.
The region of PLCKESZ G115.71+17.52 contains strong extended emission, so we
are unable to confirm the presence of this cluster via the SZ effect.
