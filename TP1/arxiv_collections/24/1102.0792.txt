We prove a large deviations principle for the empirical measures of a class
of biorthogonal and multiple orthogonal polynomial ensembles that includes
biorthogonal Laguerre, Jacobi and Hermite ensembles, the matrix model of Lueck,
Sommers and Zirnbauer for disordered bosons, the Stieltjes-Wigert matrix model
of Chern-Simons theory, and Angelesco ensembles.
