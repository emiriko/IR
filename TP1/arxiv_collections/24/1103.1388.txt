We elaborate on a recently proposed mechanism to suppress large contributions
to the electroweak precision observables in five dimensional (5D) warped
models, without the need for an extended 5D gauge sector. The main ingredient
is a modification of the AdS metric in the vicinity of the infrared (IR) brane
corresponding to a strong deviation from conformality in the IR of the 4D
holographic dual. We compute the general low energy effective theory of the 5D
warped Standard Model, emphasizing additional IR contributions to the wave
function renormalization of the light Higgs mode. We also derive expressions
for the S and T parameters as a function of a generic 5D metric and zero-mode
wave functions. We give an approximate formula for the mass of the radion that
works even for strong deviation from the AdS background. We proceed to work out
the details of an explicit model and derive bounds for the first KK masses of
the various bulk fields. The radion is the lightest new particle although its
mass is already at about 1/3 of the mass of the lightest resonances, the KK
states of the gauge bosons. We examine carefully various issues that can arise
for extreme choices of parameters such as the possible reintroduction of the
hierarchy problem, the onset of nonperturbative physics due to strong IR
curvature or the creation of new hierarchies near the Planck scale. We conclude
that a KK scale of 1 TeV is compatible with all these constraints.
