Liquid marbles, which are droplets coated with a hydrophobic powder, were
exposed to a uniform electric field. It was established that a threshold value
of the electric field, 15 cgse, should be surmounted for deformation of liquid
marbles. The shape of the marbles was described as a prolate spheroid. The
semi-quantitative theory describing deformation of liquid marbles in a uniform
electric field is presented. The scaling law relating the radius of the contact
area of the marble to the applied electric field shows a satisfactory agreement
with the experimental data.
