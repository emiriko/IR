Accurate modeling of the pi-bands of armchair graphene nanoribbons (AGNRs)
requires correctly reproducing asymmetries in the bulk graphene bands as well
as providing a realistic model for hydrogen passivation of the edge atoms. The
commonly used single-pz orbital approach fails on both these counts. To
overcome these failures we introduce a nearest-neighbor, three orbital per atom
p/d tight-binding model for graphene. The parameters of the model are fit to
first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) - based calculations as well
as to those based on the many-body Green's function and screened-exchange (GW)
formalism, giving excellent agreement with the ab initio AGNR bands. We employ
this model to calculate the current-voltage characteristics of an AGNR MOSFET
and the conductance of rough-edge AGNRs, finding significant differences versus
the single-pz model. These results show that an accurate bandstructure model is
essential for predicting the performance of graphene-based nanodevices.
