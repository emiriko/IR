Let $G$ be a finite group. Denote by $\textrm{Irr}(G)$ the set of all
irreducible complex characters of $G.$ Let
$\textrm{cd}(G)=\{\chi(1)\;|\;\chi\in \textrm{Irr}(G)\}$ be the set of all
irreducible complex character degrees of $G$ forgetting multiplicities, and let
$\textrm{X}_1(G)$ be the set of all irreducible complex character degrees of
$G$ counting multiplicities. Let $H$ be any non-abelian simple exceptional
group of Lie type. In this paper, we will show that if $S$ is a non-abelian
simple group and $\textrm{cd}(S)\subseteq \textrm{cd}(H)$ then $S$ must be
isomorphic to $H.$ As a consequence, we show that if $G$ is a finite group with
$\textrm{X}_1(G)\subseteq \textrm{X}_1(H)$ then $G$ is isomorphic to $H.$ In
particular, this implies that the simple exceptional groups of Lie type are
uniquely determined by the structure of their complex group algebras.
