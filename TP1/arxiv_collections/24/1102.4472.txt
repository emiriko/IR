The photoconductivity spectra of NbS_3 (phase I) crystals are studied. A drop
of photoconductivity corresponding to the Peierls gap edge is observed.
Reproducible spectral features are found at energies smaller the energy gap
value. The first one is a peak at the energy 0.6 eV that is close to the midgap
one. It has a threshold-like dependence of the amplitude on the electrical
field applied. Another feature is a peak at the energy 0.9 eV near to the edge
of the gap. We ascribe the origin of this peak to the stacking faults. The
third one are continuous states between these peaks at energies 0.6-0.8 eV. We
observed bleaching of the photoconductivity even below zero at this energies in
the high electric field (700 V/cm) and under additional illumination applied.
