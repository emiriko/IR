The question "what is the observable electromagnetic (EM) signature of a
compact binary merger?" is an intriguing one with crucial consequences to the
quest for gravitational waves (GW). Compact binary mergers are prime sources of
GW, targeted by current and next generation detectors. Numerical simulations
have demonstrated that these mergers eject energetic sub-relativistic (or even
relativistic) outflows. This is certainly the case if the mergers produce short
GRBs, but even if not, significant outflows are expected. The interaction of
such outflows with the surround matter inevitably leads to a long lasting radio
signal. We calculate the expected signal from these outflows (our calculations
are also applicable to short GRB orphan afterglows) and we discuss their
detectability. We show that the optimal search for such signal should,
conveniently, take place around 1.4 GHz. Realistic estimates of the outflow
parameters yield signals of a few hundred $\mu$Jy, lasting a few weeks, from
sources at the detection horizon of advanced GW detectors. Followup radio
observations, triggered by GW detection, could reveal the radio remnant even
under unfavorable conditions. Upcoming all sky surveys can detect a few dozen,
and possibly even thousands, merger remnants at any give time, thereby
providing robust merger rate estimates even before the advanced GW detectors
become operational. In fact, the radio transient RT 19870422 fits well the
overall properties predicted by our model and we suggest that its most probable
origin is a compact binary merger radio remnant.
