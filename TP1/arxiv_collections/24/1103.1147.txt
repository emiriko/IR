We extend the one-pair Cooper configuration towards Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer
(BCS) model of superconductivity by adding one-by-one electron pairs to an
energy layer where a small attraction acts. To do it, we solve Richardson's
equations analytically in the dilute limit of pairs on the one-Cooper pair
scale. We find, through only keeping the first order term in this expansion,
that the $N$ correlated pair energy reads as the energy of $N$ isolated pairs
within a $N(N-1)$ correction induced by the Pauli exclusion principle which
tends to decrease the average pair binding energy when the pair number
increases. Quite remarkably, extension of this first-order result to the dense
regime gives the BCS condensation energy exactly. This leads us to suggest a
different understanding of the BCS condensation energy with a pair number equal
to the number of pairs feeling the potential and an average pair binding energy
reduced by Pauli blocking to half the single Cooper pair energy - instead of
the more standard but far larger superconducting gap.
