Recent results on jet cross sections and heavy-flavor production in
photoproduction and neutral current deep inelastic ep scattering from the H1
and ZEUS Collaborations are presented. The jet measurements are used to perform
stringent tests of perturbative QCD, to extract precise values of the strong
coupling and to constrain further the proton and photon parton distribution
functions. The measurement of beauty and charm production at HERA is an
important testing ground for perturbative QCD and can provide information on
the structure of the proton.
