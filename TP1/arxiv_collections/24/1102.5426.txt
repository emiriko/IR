The semileptonic $D_{l4}$ decay including $D\to K\pi l\nu$ and $D\to \pi\pi
l\nu$ have been extensively studied. In these references, the form factors and
differential decay rate are explicitly stated. However, we would like to stress
that in these papers the final state interactions are often overlooked, i.e.
rescattering effect of the pseudoscalars produced by $D_{l4}$ decay may be very
important, at least on the side of phase of form factors due to Watson's
theorem. In this short paper, we will display this rescattering effect in the
framework of heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory, it thus must be a very
useful and indispensable supplement of the previous papers on $D_{l4}$ study.
