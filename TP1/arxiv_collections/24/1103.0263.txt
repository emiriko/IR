We have performed coherent x-ray scattering experiments on the hexagonally
reconstructed Pt (001) surface to study the temperature-dependent surface
dynamics. By correlating speckle patterns collected at the (001) anti-Bragg
position we are able to measure surface dynamics when the averaged incoherent
x-ray scattering appears static. In the temperature range above the rotational
epitaxy transition and below the roughening transition (1750 K - 1830 K), we
have observed well-defined oscillatory autocorrelations of speckles that
persist for tens of minutes, in addition to the expected thermal decorrelation.
The observed oscillations indicate surface dynamics due to "step-flow" motion.
This is shown with a simple model in which the phase of the scattered x-rays
from the steps within the illumination area is retained in the coherent x-ray
scattering. This demonstrates a possibility that x-ray speckles can be used to
monitor the real-space real-time evolution of surfaces in addition to the
traditional decorrelation measurements.
