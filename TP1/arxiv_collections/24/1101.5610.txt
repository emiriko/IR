The success of tensor network approaches in simulating strongly correlated
quantum systems crucially depends on whether the many body states that are
relevant for the problem can be encoded in a local tensor network. Despite
numerous efforts, strongly correlated projective states, fractional quantum
Hall states in particular, have not yet found a local tensor network
representation. Here we show that one can encode the calculation of averages of
local operators in a Grassmann tensor network which is local. Our construction
is explicit, and allows the use of physically motivated trial wavefunctions as
starting points in tensor network variational calculations.
