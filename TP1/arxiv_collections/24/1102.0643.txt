In the experimental searches for neutrino magnetic moments using germanium
detectors one studies the ionization channel in the neutrino-atom scattering.
We find that the so-called stepping approximation to the neutrino-impact
ionization is exact in the semiclassical limit, and that the deviations from
this approximation are very small.
