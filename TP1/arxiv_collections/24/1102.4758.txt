We consider the interlacement Poisson point process on the space of
doubly-infinite Z^d-valued trajectories modulo time-shift, tending to infinity
at positive and negative infinite times. The set of vertices and edges visited
by at least one of these trajectories is the graph induced by the random
interlacements at level u of Sznitman arXiv:0704.2560. We prove that for any
u>0, almost surely, the random interlacement graph is transient.
