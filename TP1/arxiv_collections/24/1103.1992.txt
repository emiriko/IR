Using a modified damped harmonic oscillator model equivalent to a model of
market dynamics with price expectations, we analyze the reaction of financial
markets to shocks. In order to do this, we gather data from indices of a
variety of financial markets for the 1987 Black Monday, the Russian crisis of
1998, the crash after September 11th (2001), and the recent downturn of markets
due to the subprime mortgage crisis in the USA (2008). Analyzing those data we
were able to establish the amount by which each market felt the shocks, a
dampening factor which expresses the capacity of a market of absorving a shock,
and also a frequency related with volatility after the shock. The results gauge
the efficiency of different markets in recovering from such shocks, and measure
some level of dependence between them. We also show, using the correlation
matrices between the indices used, that financial markets are now much more
connected than they were two decades ago.
