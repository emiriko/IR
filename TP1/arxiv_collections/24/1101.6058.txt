The observation of the $Y(4140)$ structure in $B^\pm\rightarrow J/\psi\,\phi
K^\pm$ decays produced in $\bar{p} p $ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=1.96~\TeV$ is
reported with a statistical significance greater than 5 standard deviations. A
fit to the $J/\psi\,\phi$ mass spectrum is performed assuming the presence of a
Breit-Wigner resonance. The fit yields a signal of $19^{+6}_{-5}$ resonance
events, and resonance mass and width of
  $4143.4^{+2.9}_{-3.0}(\mathrm{stat})\pm0.6(\mathrm{syst})~\MeVcc$ and
$15.3^{+10.4}_{-6.1}(\mathrm{stat})\pm2.5(\mathrm{syst})~\MeVcc$ respectively.
The parameters of this resonance-like structure are consistent with values
reported from an earlier CDF analysis.
