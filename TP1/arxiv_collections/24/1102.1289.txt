A novel concept for contactless active removal of large space debris is
proposed exploiting the use of a high-speed targeted ion beam. The ion beam
shepherd spacecraft (IBS) is equipped with an electric propulsion system
generating a quasi-neutral plasma pointed against the space debris to remotely
modify its orbit without physical contact with the latter. The beam shepherd
must be equipped with a secondary propulsion system which counteracts the
reaction force exerted by the ion beam hence keeping the distance between the
space debris constant throughout the deorbit (or reorbit) process. A
preliminary analysis of the concept is provided highlighting the expected
performance and the main technologicals challenges. The concept has the
potential of making large debris removal operations possible in the near
future.
