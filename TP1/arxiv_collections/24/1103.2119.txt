In this work we introduce a deterministic scheme of synchronization of linear
and nonlinear cellular automata (CA) with complex behavior, connected through a
master-slave coupling. By using a definition of Boolean derivative, we use the
linear approximation of the automata to determine a function of coupling that
promotes synchronization without perturbing all the sites of the slave system.
