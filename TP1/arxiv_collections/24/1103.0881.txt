This paper presents the results of the characterisation of a pixel sensor
manufactured in OKI 0.2 micron SOI technology integrated on a high-resistivity
substrate, and featuring several pixel cell layouts for charge collection
optimisation. The sensor is tested with short IR laser pulses, X-rays and 200
GeV pions. We report results on charge collection, particle detection
efficiency and single point resolution.
