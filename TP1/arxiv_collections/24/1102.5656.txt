X-ray magnetic circular dichroism at the Er M4,5 edge is used to study the
switching behavior of the hard ErFe2 layers in an epitaxial
[ErFe2(70{\AA})/YFe2 (150{\AA})]{\times}25 exchange-spring superlattice.
Magnetic hysteresis loops for the Er magnetization, at temperatures T < 200 K,
reveal a switching behavior with a single type of irreversible switch
corresponding to vertical exchange spring states. Experiments at T > 200 K
reveal a crossover to a regime with two types of switching processes.
Computational modelling for this system gives a semi-quantitative agreement
with the experiment and reveals that the observed high temperature switching
behavior is due to a spin-flop like reorientation transition. In contrast to
conventional spin-flop transitions in antiferromagnets, in this exchange spring
system the increase in anisotropy energy of the hard magnetic layers is
overcome by the decrease in Zeeman energy of the soft layers. Computational
studies also reveal the presence of transitions between vertical exchange
spring and spin-flop states with a first-order character as well as continuous
transitions between these states.
