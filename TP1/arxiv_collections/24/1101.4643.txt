From WASP photometry and SOPHIE radial velocities we report the discovery of
WASP-40b (HAT-P-27b), a 0.6 Mjup planet that transits its 12th magnitude host
star every 3.04 days. The host star is of late G-type or early K-type and
likely has a metallicity greater than solar ([Fe/H] = 0.14 +/- 0.11). The
planet's mass and radius are typical of the known hot Jupiters, thus adding
another system to the apparent pileup of transiting planets with periods near 3
to 4 days. Our parameters match those of the recent HATnet announcement of the
same planet, thus giving confidence in the techniques used. We report a
possible indication of stellar activity in the host star.
