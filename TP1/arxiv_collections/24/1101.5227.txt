In classical Arthur-Merlin games, the class of languages whose membership
proofs can be verified by Arthur using logarithmic space (AM(log-space))
coincides with the class P \cite{Co89}. In this note, we show that if Arthur
has a fixed-size quantum register (the size of the register does not depend on
the length of the input) instead of another source of random bits, membership
in any language in NP can be verified with any desired error bound.
