We define invariants of unoriented knots and links by enhancing the integral
kei counting invariant Phi_X^Z (K) for a finite kei X using representations of
the kei algebra, Z_K[X], a quotient of the quandle algebra Z[X] defined by
Andruskiewitsch and Grana. We give an example that demonstrates that the
enhanced invariant is stronger than the unenhanced kei counting invariant. As
an application, we use a quandle module over the Takasaki kei on Z_3 which is
not a Z_K[X]-module to detect the non-invertibility of a virtual knot.
