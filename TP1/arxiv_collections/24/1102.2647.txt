In this paper we derive, by means of $\Gamma$-convergence, the shallow shell
models starting from non linear three dimensional elasticity. We use the
approach analogous to the one for shells and plates. We start from the
minimization formulation of the general three dimensional elastic body which is
subjected to normal volume forces and free boundary conditions and do not
presuppose any constitutional behavior. To derive the model we need to propose
how is the order of magnitudes of the external loads related to the thickness
of the body $h$ as well as the order of the "geometry" of the shallow shell. We
analyze the situation when the external normal forces are of order $h^\alpha$,
where $\alpha>2$. For $\alpha=3$ we obtain the Marguerre-von K\'{a}rm\'{a}n
model and for $\alpha>3$ the linearized Marguerre-von K\'{a}rm\'{a}n model. For
$\alpha \in (2,3)$ we are able to obtain only the lower bound for the
$\Gamma$-limit. This is analogous to the recent results for the ordinary shell
models.
