Second Fourier harmonics of jet quenching have been thoroughly explored in
the literature and shown to be sensitive to the underlying jet path-length
dependence of energy loss and the differences between the mean eccentricity
predicted by Glauber and CGC/KLN models of initial conditions. We compute the
jet path-length dependence of energy-loss for higher azimuthal harmonics of
jet-fragments in a generalized model of energy-loss for RHIC energies and find,
however, that even the high-$p_T$ second moment is most sensitive to the poorly
known early-time evolution during the first fm/c. Moreover, we demonstrate that
higher-jet harmonics are remarkably insensitive to the initial conditions,
while the different $v_n(N_{part})$ vs. $v_n^{I_{AA}}(N_{part})$ correlations
between the moments of monojet and dijet nuclear modifications factors remain a
most sensitive probe to differentiate between Glauber and CGC/KLN initial state
sQGP geometries.
