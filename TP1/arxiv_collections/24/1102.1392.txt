The orientation of the magnetization of a Ni(110) surface was investigated
using techniques with different probing depths. By making use of electron
capture into excited states of fast He atoms, we found that the magnetization
of the topmost surface layer is not aligned along the easy axes of Ni. However,
for a 50 ML film Fe on Ni(110) we observed the magnetization of the topmost Fe
surface layer is along the easy axes of Fe.
