Transverse momentum distributions and yields for $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, $p$
and $\bar{p}$ in $p+p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=200 and 62.4 GeV at midrapidity
are measured by the PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
(RHIC). These data provide important baseline spectra for comparisons with
identified particle spectra in heavy ion collisions at RHIC. We present the
inverse slope parameter $T_{\rm inv}$, mean transverse momentum $<p_T>$ and
yield per unit rapidity $dN/dy$ at each energy, and compare them to other
measurements at different $\sqrt{s}$ in $p+p$ and $p+\bar{p}$ collisions. We
also present the scaling properties such as $m_T$ scaling, $x_T$ scaling on the
$p_T$ spectra between different energies. To discuss the mechanism of the
particle production in $p+p$ collisions, the measured spectra are compared to
next-to-leading-order or next-to-leading-logarithmic perturbative quantum
chromodynamics calculations.
