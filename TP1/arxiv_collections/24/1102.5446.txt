We study the properties of interacting electrons in a one-dimensional
conduction band coupled to bulk non-collinear ferromagnetic order. The specific
form of non-collinearity we consider is that of an extended domain wall. The
presence of ferromagnetic order breaks spin-charge separation and the domain
wall introduces a spin-dependent scatterer active over the length of the wall
l. Both forward and backward scattering off the domain wall can be relevant
perturbations of the Luttinger liquid and we discuss the possible low
temperature phases. Our main finding is that backward scattering, while
determining the ultimate low temperature physics, only becomes important at
temperatures T/J < exp(-l/l_+) with J being the magnetic exchange and l_+ the
backward scattering length scale. In physical realizations, l >> l_+ and the
physics will be dominated by forward scattering which can lead to a charge
conducting but spin insulating phase. In a perturbative regime at higher
temperatures we furthermore calculate the spin and charge densities around the
domain wall and quantitatively discuss the interaction induced changes.
