Supersymmetric collider phenomenology depends crucially on whether the
lightest observable-sector supersymmetric particle (LOSP) decays, and if so,
what the LOSP decay products are. For instance, in SUSY models where the
gravitino is lighter than the LOSP, the LOSP decays to its superpartner and a
longitudinal gravitino via supercurrent couplings. In this paper, we show that
LOSP decays can be substantially modified when there are multiple sectors that
break supersymmetry, where in addition to the gravitino there are light uneaten
goldstini. As a particularly striking example, a bino-like LOSP can have a near
100% branching fraction to a higgs boson and an uneaten goldstino, even if the
LOSP has negligible higgsino fraction. This occurs because the uneaten
goldstino is unconstrained by the supercurrent, allowing additional operators
to mediate LOSP decay. These operators can be enhanced in the presence of an R
symmetry, leading to copious boosted higgs production in SUSY cascade decays.
