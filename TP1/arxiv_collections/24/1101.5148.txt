I discuss several corrections to leading twist calculations of nucleon
structure functions which are needed to include experimental data at large
parton fractional momentum x and at low scales Q^2 in global fits of parton
distribution functions. In particular I discuss the results of the CTEQ6X
global fit, and some work in progress. Topics covered include the interplay of
target mass and higher-twist corrections, the importance of nuclear corrections
for deuterium target data, and applications to the study of quark-hadron
duality. Implications for collider physics are highlighted.
