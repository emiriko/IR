The real-time formalism at finite temperature and chemical potential for the
nonlocal Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model is developed in the presence of a Gaussian
covariant regulator. We construct the most general thermal propagator, by means
of the spectral function. As a result, the model involves the propagation of
massive quasiparticles. The appearance of complex poles is interpreted as a
confinement signal, and in this case we have unstable quasiparticles with a
finite decay width. An expression for the propagator along the critical line,
where complex poles start to appear, is also obtained. A generalization to
other covariant regulators is proposed.
