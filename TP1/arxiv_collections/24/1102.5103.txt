We show that, in the high-density limit, restricted M{\o}ller-Plesset (RMP)
perturbation theory yields $E_{\text{RMP}}^{(2)} = \pi^{-2}(1-\ln 2) \ln r_s +
O(r_s^0)$ for the correlation energy per electron in the uniform electron gas,
where $r_s$ is the Seitz radius. This contradicts an earlier derivation which
yielded $E_{\text{RMP}}^{(2)} = O(\ln|\ln r_s|)$. The reason for the
discrepancy is explained.
