The discrete memoryless interference channel is modelled as a conditional
probability distribution with two outputs depending on two inputs and has
widespread applications in practical communication scenarios. In this paper, we
introduce and study the quantum interference channel, a generalization of a
two-input, two-output memoryless channel to the setting of quantum Shannon
theory. We discuss three different coding strategies and obtain corresponding
achievable rate regions for quantum interference channels. We calculate the
capacity regions in the special cases of "very strong" and "strong"
interference. The achievability proof in the case of "strong" interference
exploits a novel quantum simultaneous decoder for two-sender quantum multiple
access channels. We formulate a conjecture regarding the existence of a quantum
simultaneous decoder in the three-sender case and use it to state the rates
achievable by a quantum Han-Kobayashi strategy.
