We present the first study of parametric amplification in hydrogenated
amorphous silicon waveguides. Broadband on/off amplification up to 26.5~dB at
telecom wavelength is reported. Measured nonlinear parameter is
770~$\textrm{W}^{-1} \textrm{m}^{-1}$, nonlinear absorption 28~$\textrm{W}^{-1}
\textrm{m}^{-1}$, bandgap $1.61$~eV.
