HiggsBounds 2.0.0 is a computer code which tests both neutral and charged
Higgs sectors of arbitrary models against the current exclusion bounds from the
Higgs searches at LEP and the Tevatron. As input, it requires a selection of
model predictions, such as Higgs masses, branching ratios, effective couplings
and total decay widths. HiggsBounds 2.0.0 then uses the expected and observed
topological cross section limits from the Higgs searches to determine whether a
given parameter scenario of a model is excluded at the 95% C.L. by those
searches. Version 2.0.0 represents a significant extension of the code since
its first release (1.0.0). It includes now 28/53 LEP/Tevatron Higgs search
analyses, compared to the 11/22 in the first release, of which many of the ones
from the Tevatron are replaced by updates. As a major extension, the code
allows now the predictions for (singly) charged Higgs bosons to be confronted
with LEP and Tevatron searches. Furthermore, the newly included analyses
contain LEP searches for neutral Higgs bosons (H) decaying invisibly or into
(non flavour tagged) hadrons as well as decay-mode independent searches for
neutral Higgs bosons, LEP searches via the production modes tau+ tau- H and b
b-bar H, and Tevatron searches via t t-bar H. Also, all Tevatron results
presented at the ICHEP'10 are included in version 2.0.0. As physics
applications of HiggsBounds 2.0.0 we study the allowed Higgs mass range for
model scenarios with invisible Higgs decays and we obtain exclusion results for
the scalar sector of the Randall-Sundrum model using up-to-date LEP and
Tevatron direct search results.
