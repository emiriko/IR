A series of stellar models of spectral type G is computed to study the
rotation laws resulting from mean-field equations. The rotation laws of the
slowly rotating Sun, the fast rotating MOST stars epsilon Eri and kappa1 Cet
and the rapid rotators R58 and LQ Lup can easily be reproduced. We also find
that differences in the depth of the convection zone cause large differences in
the surface rotation law and that the extreme surface shear of HD 171488 can
only be explained with a artificially shallow convection layer. We also check
the thermal wind equilibrium in fast-rotating G dwarfs and find that the polar
subrotation (dOmega/dz<0) is due to the barocline effect and that the
equatorial superrotation (dOmega/dr>0) is due to the Lambda effect as part of
the Reynolds stresses. In the bulk of the convection zones where the meridional
flow is slow and smooth the thermal wind equilibrium actually holds between the
centrifugal and the pressure forces. It does not hold, however, in the bounding
shear layers including the equatorial region where the Reynolds stresses
dominate.
