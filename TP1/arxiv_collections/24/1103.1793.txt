We report a comparative study of 63Cu Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spin lattice
relaxation rates, T_1^{-1}, on undoped SrCuO_2 and Ca doped
Sr_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}CuO_2 spin chain compounds. A temperature independent T_1^{-1}
is observed for SrCuO_2 as expected for an S=1/2 Heisenberg chain.
Surprisingly, we observe an exponential decrease of T_1^{-1} for T < 90,K in
the Ca-doped sample evidencing the opening of a spin gap. The data analysis
within the J_1-J_2 Heisenberg model employing density-matrix renormalization
group calculations suggests an impurity driven small alternation of the
J_2-exchange coupling as a possible cause of the spin gap.
