First principles FLAPW-GGA method was used for the comparative study of the
structural and electronic properties of three related tetragonal ThCr2Si2-type
phases KFe2Ch2, where Ch are S, Se, and Te. The main trends in electronic
bands, densities of states and Fermi surfaces for AFe2Ch2 are analyzed in
relation to their structural parameters. We found that at the anion
replacements (S<->Se<->Te) any critical changes in electronic structure of
KFe2Ch2 phases are absent. On the other hand, our analysis of structural and
electronic parameters for hypothetical KFe2Te2 allows to assume that this
system may be proposed as perspective parent phase for search of new
iron-chalcogenide superconducting materials.
