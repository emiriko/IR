Oblique propagation and head-on collisions of solitary structures is studied
in a dense magnetized plasma comprised of relativistic ultra-cold electrons and
positrons and positive dynamic ions using conventional extended multi-scales
technique, in the ground of quantum hydrodynamics model. The variations of
head-on collision phase-shift as well as the characteristic soliton amplitude
and width is evaluated numerically in terms of other plasma parameters such as
mass-density, normalized magnetic field strength, its angle with respect to the
soliton propagation and the relative positron number-density. The relevance of
current investigations, with appropriate plasma parameters for the
astrophysical dense magnetized objects such as white-dwarfs, is addressed.
