Two classes of turbo codes over high-order finite fields are introduced. The
codes are derived from a particular protograph sub-ensemble of the (dv=2,dc=3)
low-density parity-check code ensemble. A first construction is derived as a
parallel concatenation of two non-binary, time-variant accumulators. The second
construction is based on the serial concatenation of a non-binary, time-variant
differentiator and of a non-binary, time-variant accumulator, and provides a
highly-structured flexible encoding scheme for (dv=2,dc=4) ensemble codes. A
cycle graph representation is provided. The proposed codes can be decoded
efficiently either as low-density parity-check codes (via belief propagation
decoding over the codes bipartite graph) or as turbo codes (via the
forward-backward algorithm applied to the component codes trellis). The
forward-backward algorithm for symbol maximum a posteriori decoding of the
component codes is illustrated and simplified by means of the fast Fourier
transform. The proposed codes provide remarkable gains (~ 1 dB) over binary
low-density parity-check and turbo codes in the moderate-short block regimes.
