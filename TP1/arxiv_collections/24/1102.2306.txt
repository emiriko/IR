GaAs nanowires with a 100% wurtzite structure are synthesized by the
vapor-liquid-solid method in a molecular beam epitaxy system, using gold as a
catalyst. We use resonant Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence to determine
the position of the crystal-field split-off band of hexagonal wurtzite GaAs.
The temperature dependence of this transition enables us to extract the value
at 0 K, which is 1.982 eV. Our photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy
measurements are consistent with a band gap of GaAs wurtzite below 1.523 eV.
