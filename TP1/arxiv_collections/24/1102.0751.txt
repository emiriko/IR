The release of conduction-band electrons from a metal surface by a
sub-femtosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulse, and their propagation through
the solid, provokes a dielectric response in the solid that acts back on the
photoelectron wave packet. We calculated the (wake) potential associated with
this photoelectron self-interaction in terms of bulk and surface plasmon
excitations and show that it induces a considerable, XUV-frequency-dependent
temporal shift in laser-streaked XUV photoemission spectra, suggesting the
observation of the ultrafast solid-state dielectric response in contemporary
streaked photoemission experiments.
