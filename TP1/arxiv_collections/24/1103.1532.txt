We use Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics to simulate the formation of a massive
(10^6Msun) stellar cluster system formed from the gravitational collapse of a
turbulent molecular cloud. We investigate the hierarchical clustering
properties of our model system and we study the influence of the photoionizing
radiation produced by the system's multiple O-type stars on the evolution of
the protocluster. We find that dense gas near the ionizing sources prevents the
radiation from eroding the filaments in which most of the star formation occurs
and that instead, ionized gas fills pre-existing voids and bubbles originally
created by the turbulent velocity field.
