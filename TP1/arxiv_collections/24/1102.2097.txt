Quark--anti-quark (anti-q-q) potentials with finite quark masses are studied
from the anti-q-q Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter (NBS) wave functions in quenched lattice
QCD. With the use of a method which has been recently developed in the
derivation of nuclear forces from lattice QCD, we derive the anti-q-q
potentials from the NBS wave functions. We calculate the anti-q-q NBS wave
functions in pseudo-scalar and vector channels for several quark masses. The
derived potentials at each quark mass in both channels show linear plus Coulomb
form. We also discuss the quark-mass and channel dependence of the anti-q-q
potentials.
