The aim of this work is to prove existence and uniqueness of
$L^{2}-$solutions of stochastic fractional partial differential equations in
one spatial dimension. We prove also the equivalence between several notions of
$L^{2}-$solutions. The Fourier transform is used to give meaning to SFPDEs.
This method is valid also when the diffusion coefficient is random.
