We construct bi-local interpolating field operators for baryons consisting of
three quarks with two flavors, assuming good isospin symmetry. We use the
restrictions following from the Pauli principle to derive relations/identities
among the baryon operators with identical quantum numbers. Such relations that
follow from the combined spatial, Dirac, color, and isospin Fierz
transformations may be called the (total/complete) Fierz identities. These
relations reduce the number of independent baryon operators with any given spin
and isospin. We also study the Abelian and non-Abelian chiral transformation
properties of these fields and place them into baryon chiral multiplets. Thus
we derive the independent baryon interpolating fields with given values of spin
(Lorentz group representation), chiral symmetry ($U_L(2) \times U_R(2)$ group
representation) and isospin appropriate for the first angular excited states of
the nucleon.
