The morphology, dynamics and thermal X-ray emission of the superbubble N70 is
studied by means of 3D hydrodynamical simulations, carried out with the
{\sc{yguaz\'u-a}} code. We have considered different scenarios: the superbubble
being the product of a single supernova remnant, of the stellar winds from an
OB association, or the result of the joint action of stellar winds and a
supernova event. Our results show that, in spite that all scenarios produce
bubbles with the observed physical size, only those where the bubble is driven
by stellar winds and a SN event are successful to explain the general
morphology, dynamics and the X-ray luminosity of N70. Our models predict
temperatures in excess of $10^8 \mathrm{K}$ at the interior of the superbubble,
however the density is too low and the emission in thermal X-ray above $2
\mathrm{keV}$ is too faint to be detected.
