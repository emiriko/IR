We study the \textit{non-ideal} effects arising due to viscosity (both bulk
and shear), equation of state ($\epsilon\neq 3P$) and cavitation on thermal
dilepton production from QGP at RHIC energies. We calculate the first order
corrections to the dilepton production rates due to shear and bulk viscosities.
Ignoring the cavitation can lead to a wrong estimation of dilepton spectra. We
show that the shear viscosity can enhance the thermal dilepton spectra whereas
the bulk viscosity can suppress it. We present the combined effect of bulk and
shear viscosities on the dilepton spectra.
