Superconductivity is associated with spontaneously broken gauge symmetry. In
some exotic superconductors the time-reversal symmetry is broken as well,
accompanied with internal magnetic field. A time-reversal symmetry broken
(TRSB) superconductivity without internal magnetic field involved can be
induced by frustrated inter-component couplings, which becomes a realistic
issue recently due to the discovery of iron-pnictide superconductors. Here we
derive stability condition for this novel TRSB state using the Ginzburg-Landau
(GL) theory. We find that there are multiple divergent coherence lengths, and
that this novel superconductivity cannot be categorized by the GL number into
type I or type II. We reveal that the critical Josephson current of a
constriction junction between two bulk superconductors of different chiralities
is suppressed significantly from that for same chirality. This effect provides
a unique way to verify experimentally this brand new superconductivity.
