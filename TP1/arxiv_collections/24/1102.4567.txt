We study exact tunneling solutions in scalar field theory for potential
barriers composed of linear or quadratic patches. We analytically continue our
solutions to imaginary Euclidean radius in order to study the profile of the
scalar field inside the growing bubble. We find that generally there is a
non-trivial profile of the scalar field, generating a stress-energy tensor,
that depending on the form of the potential, can be a candidate for dark
energy.
