The renormalization method is specifically aimed at connecting theories
describing physical processes at different length scales and thereby connecting
different theories in the physical sciences.
  The renormalization method used today is the outgrowth of one hundred and
fifty years of scientific study of thermal physics and phase transitions.
Different phases of matter show qualitatively different behavior separated by
abrupt phase transitions. These qualitative differences seem to be present in
experimentally observed condensed-matter systems. However, the "extended
singularity theorem" in statistical mechanics shows that sharp changes can only
occur in infinitely large systems. Abrupt changes from one phase to another are
signaled by fluctuations that show correlation over infinitely long distances,
and are measured by correlation functions that show algebraic decay as well as
various kinds of singularities and infinities in thermodynamic derivatives and
in measured system parameters.
  Renormalization methods were first developed in field theory to get around
difficulties caused by apparent divergences at both small and large scales.
  The renormalization (semi-)group theory of phase transitions was put together
by Kenneth G. Wilson in 1971 based upon ideas of scaling and universality
developed earlier in the context of phase transitions and of couplings
dependent upon spatial scale coming from field theory. Correlations among
regions with fluctuations in their order underlie renormalization ideas.
Wilson's theory is the first approach to phase transitions to agree with the
extended singularity theorem.
  Some of the history of the study of these correlations and singularities is
recounted, along with the history of renormalization and related concepts of
scaling and universality. Applications are summarized.
