In this paper, the algebras, representations, and thermostatistics of four
types of fermionic q-oscillator models, called fermionic Newton (FN),
Chaichian-Kulish-Ng (CKN), Parthasarathy-Viswanathan-Chaichian (PVC),
Viswanathan-Parthasarathy-Jagannathan-Chaichian (VPJC), are discussed.
Similarities and differences among the properties of these models are revealed.
Particular emphasis is given to the VPJC-oscillators model so that its Fock
space representation is analyzed in detail. Possible physical applications of
these models are concisely pointed out.
