The Seminar "Dark Matter in Galaxies" was delivered, within the Dark Matter
Awareness Week (1-8 December 2010) at 140 institutes in 46 countries and it was
followed by 4200 people. A documentation of this worldwide initiative is at
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOBit8a-1Fw. A reference presentation, prepared
by a coordinated pool of leading scientists in the field, was available to
speakers. In response to feedbacks and suggestions, we upgraded it to a
"Presentation Review" of which we provide here the Explanatory Notes, the link
to the .pptx file, and some image of the slides. This Presentation Review is an
innovative scientific product to meet the request of information about the
phenomenology of the DM mystery at galactic scale. This Review concerns the
mass discrepancy phenomenon detected in galaxies, usually accounted by
postulating the presence of a non luminous non baryonic component. In the
theoretical framework of Newtonian Gravity we recall the properties of Dark
Matter halos as emerging from the state-of-the-art of numerical simulations
performed in the current $\Lambda CDM$ scenario. Then, the simple but
much-telling phenomenology of the distribution of dark and luminous matter in
Spirals, Ellipticals, and dwarf Spheroidals is reported. We show that a
coherent observational framework emerges from reliable data of different large
samples of objects and it is obtained by different methods of investigation. We
then highlight the impressive evidence that the distribution of dark and
luminous matter are closely correlated and that have universal features. Hints
on the cosmological role of this phenomenological scenario are then given.
Finally, we discuss the constraints on the elusive nature of the dark particle
that the actual distribution of DM around galaxies pose on its direct and
indirect searches.
