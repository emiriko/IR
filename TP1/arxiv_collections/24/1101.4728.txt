Mapping the QCD phase boundary and locating critical end point still remains
as an open problem in strong interaction physics. Predictions about the
co-ordinates of the critical point in the $(T, \mu_B)$ plane, from different
QCD motivated models show a wide variation. Lattice QCD calculations are also
available, that give an estimation of the critical point for chiral phase
transition, where the transition changes its nature from rapid cross over to
first order transition. Recently co-ordinates of the critical point for
deconfinement phase transition are claimed to be found as an endpoint of the
first order phase transition line, in Bag model scenario. In the present paper
we have shown that Bag model gives a complete first order phase transition line
in the $(T, \mu_B)$ plane, and one can not have any point where the transition
changes its nature.
