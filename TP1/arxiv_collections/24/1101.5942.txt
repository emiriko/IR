We are in the process of obtaining VLBA polarisation data for the 135
MOJAVE-I Active Galactic Nuclei at four wavelengths in the 18-22cm band. These
observations will enable studies of the evolution of the intensity and
magnetic-field structures of these AGN jets as they propagate from parsec to
kiloparsec scales, as well as studies of the thermal plasma present in the
vicinity of the jets on these scales, manifest via Faraday rotation. A wide
range of other multi-wavelength studies can also be carried out using these
data. Preliminary results for selected sources from the first 3 of 9 observing
sessions will be presented. We aim to have 18-cm intensity and polarisation
images available via the MOJAVE website within 18 months after the last
observing session.
