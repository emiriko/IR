We present an approximate solution to the minimally coupled Einstein-Dirac
equations. We interpret the solution as describing a massive fermion coexisting
with its own gravitational field. The solution is axisymmetric but is time
dependent. The metric approaches that of a flat spacetime at the spatial
infinity. We have calculated a variety of conserved quantities in the system.
