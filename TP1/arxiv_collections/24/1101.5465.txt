We propose the Kolmogorov stochasticity parameter, $\lambda$ for energy level
spectra to classify quantum systems with corresponding classical dynamics
ranging from integrable to chaotic. We also study the probability distribution
function (PDF) of $\lambda$. Remarkably, the PDF of all the integrable systems
studied here is the same and is found to be completely different from the PDF
of chaotic systems. We also note that $\lambda_n$ for $n$ energy levels scales
as $\lambda_n \sim n^{-\alpha}$. Furthermore, with $\alpha$, the stochastic
probability (calculated from PDF) is seen to jump by about an order of
magnitude as the systems turn chaotic.
