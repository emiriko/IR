Even though the second law of thermodynamics holds the supreme position among
the laws of nature, as stated by many distinguished scientists, notably
Eddington and Einstein, its position appears to be also quite peculiar. Given
the atomic nature of matter, whose behaviour is well described by statistical
physics, the second law could not hold unconditionally, but only statistically.
It is not an absolute law. As a result of this, in the present paper we try to
argue that we have not yet any truly cogent argument (known fundamental
physical laws) to exclude its possible macroscopic violation. Even Landauer's
information-theoretic principle seems to fall short of the initial expectations
of being the fundamental `physical' reason of all Maxwell's demons failure.
Here we propose a modified Szilard engine which operates without any steps in
the process resembling the creation or destruction of information. We argue
that the information-based exorcisms must be wrong, or at the very least
superfluous, and that the real physical reason why such engines cannot work
lies in the ubiquity of thermal fluctuations (and friction).
  We see in the above peculiar features the main motivation and rationale for
pursuing exploratory research to challenge the second law, which is still
ongoing and probably richer than ever. A quite thorough (and critical)
description of some of these challenges is also given.
