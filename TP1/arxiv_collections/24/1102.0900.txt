Transformational optics are shown to markedly enhance the control of the
electromagnetic wave trajectories within metamaterials with unconventional
functionalities such as a beam splitter, a toroidal carpet, a Luneburg lens and
a black hole, all of which are specially designed for surface plasmon
polaritons propagating on a metal plate
