X-ray diffraction with synchrotron radiation has been used for the first time
to study chemical interaction in the FeO-ZnO system at 4.8 GPa and temperatures
up to 1300 K. Above 750 K, the chemical reaction between FeO and ZnO has been
observed that resulted in the formation of rock salt (rs) Fe1-xZnxO solid
solutions (0.3 \leq x \leq 0.85). The lattice parameters of these solid
solutions have been in situ measured as a function of temperature under
pressure, and corresponding thermal expansion coefficients have been
calculated.
