In this paper we consider the class of truth-functional many-valued logics
with a finite set of truth-values. The main result of this paper is the
development of a new \emph{binary} sequent calculi (each sequent is a pair of
formulae) for many valued logic with a finite set of truth values, and of
Kripke-like semantics for it that is both sound and complete. We did not use
the logic entailment based on matrix with a strict subset of designated truth
values, but a different new kind of semantics based on the generalization of
the classic 2-valued truth-invariance entailment. In order to define this
non-matrix based sequent calculi, we transform many-valued logic into positive
2-valued multi-modal logic with classic conjunction, disjunction and finite set
of modal connectives. In this algebraic framework we define an uniquely
determined axiom system, by extending the classic 2-valued distributive lattice
logic (DLL) by a new set of sequent axioms for many-valued logic connectives.
Dually, in an autoreferential Kripke-style framework we obtain a uniquely
determined frame, where each possible world is an equivalence class of
Lindenbaum algebra for a many-valued logic as well, represented by a truth
value.
