We present experimental observations of the interference of spin-wave modes
propagating in opposite directions in micron-sized NiFe-waveguides. To monitor
the local spin-wave intensity distribution and phase of the formed interference
pattern, we use Brillouin light scattering microscopy. The two-dimensional
spin-wave intensity map can be understood by considering the interference of
several waveguide eigenmodes with different wavevectors quantized across the
width of the stripe. The phase shows a transition from linear dependence on the
space coordinate near the antennas characteristic for propagating waves to
discrete values in the center region characteristic for standing waves.
