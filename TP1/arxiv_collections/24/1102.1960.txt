The convergence properties of the Iterative water-filling (IWF) based
algorithms have been derived in the ideal situation where the transmitters in
the network are able to obtain the exact value of the interference plus noise
(IPN) experienced at the corresponding receivers in each iteration of the
algorithm. However, these algorithms are not robust because they diverge when
there is it time-varying estimation error of the IPN, a situation that arises
in real communication system. In this correspondence, we propose an algorithm
that possesses convergence guarantees in the presence of various forms of such
time-varying error. Moreover, we also show by simulation that in scenarios
where the interference is strong, the conventional IWF diverges while our
proposed algorithm still converges.
