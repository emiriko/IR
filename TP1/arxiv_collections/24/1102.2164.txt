In this paper the attractors synthesis algorithm for a class of dissipative
dynamical systems with hyperbolic equilibria, presented in [1], is applied to
generate any attractor of the Rikitake system. By switching periodically, or
even randomly, the control parameter inside a given set of values, during any
finite time interval while the attractor is numerically approximated, any
attractor can be generated. Beside the extension of the synthesis algorithm to
systems with non-hyperbolic equilibria, we have found for the Rikitake system,
a new intriguing transient which, occurring for a long time interval, is
difficult to be numerically found due to the known system instability along the
x3-axis.
