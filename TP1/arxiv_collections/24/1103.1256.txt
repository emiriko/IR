We extract all the XMM-Newton EPIC pn burst mode spectra of GX 339-4,
together with simultaneous/contemporaneous RXTE data. These include three disc
dominated and two soft intermediate spectra, and the combination of broad
bandpass/moderate spectral resolution gives some of the best data on these
bright soft states in black hole binaries. The disc dominated spectra span a
factor three in luminosity, and all show that the disc emission is broader than
the simplest multicolour disc model. This is consistent with the expected
relativistic smearing and changing colour temperature correction produced by
atomic features in the newest disc models. However, these models do not match
the data at the 5 per cent level as the predicted atomic features are not
present in the data, perhaps indicating that irradiation is important even when
the high energy tail is weak. Whatever the reason, this means that the data
have smaller errors than the best physical disc models, forcing use of more
phenomenological models for the disc emission. We use these for the soft
intermediate state data, where previous analysis using a simple disc continuum
found an extremely broad residual, identified as the red wing of the iron line
from reflection around a highly spinning black hole. However, the iron line
energy is close to where the disc and tail have equal fluxes, so using a
broader disc continuum changes the residual 'iron line' profile dramatically.
With a broader disc continuum model, the inferred line is formed outside of 30
${\rm{R_g}}$, so cannot constrain black hole spin. We caution that a robust
determination of black hole spin from the iron line profile is very difficult
where the disc makes a significant contribution at the iron line energy i.e. in
most bright black hole states.
