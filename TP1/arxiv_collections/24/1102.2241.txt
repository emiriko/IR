We report on the development of coatings for a CCD detector optimized for use
in a fixed dispersion UV spectrograph. Due to the rapidly changing index of
refraction of Si, single layer broadband anti-reflection coatings are not
suitable to increase quantum efficiency at all wavelengths of interest.
Instead, we describe a creative solution that provides excellent performance
over UV wavelengths. We describe progress in the development of a CCD detector
with theoretical quantum efficiencies (QE) of greater than 60% at wavelengths
from 120 to 300nm. This high efficiency may be reached by coating a backside
illuminated, thinned, delta-doped CCD with a series of thin film
anti-reflection coatings. The materials tested include MgF2 (optimized for
highest performance from 120-150nm), SiO2 (150-180nm), Al2O3(180-240nm), MgO
(200-250nm), and HfO2 (240-300nm). A variety of deposition techniques were
tested and a selection of coatings which minimized reflectance on a Si test
wafer were applied to live devices. We also discuss future uses and
improvements, including graded and multi-layer coatings.
