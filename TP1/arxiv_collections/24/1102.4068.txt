We calculate the electric-dipole and magnetic-quadrupole form factors of the
deuteron that arise as a low-energy manifestation of parity and time-reversal
violation in quark-gluon interactions of effective dimension four and six: the
QCD vacuum angle, the quark electric and chromo-electric dipole moments, and
the gluon chromo-electric dipole moment. Within the framework of two-flavor
chiral perturbation theory, we show that the relative sizes of the
corresponding moments allow an identification of the symmetry-breaking source.
