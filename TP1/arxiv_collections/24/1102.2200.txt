In this article we propose a general transformation for decorated spin
models. The advantage of this transformation is to perform a direct mapping of
a decorated spin model onto another effective spin thus simplifying algebraic
computations by avoiding the proliferation of unnecessary iterative
transformations and parameters that might otherwise lead to transcendental
equations. Direct mapping transformation is discussed in detail for decorated
Ising spin models as well as for decorated Ising-Heisenberg spin models, with
arbitrary coordination number and with some constrained Hamiltonian's parameter
for systems with coordination number larger than 4 (3) with (without) spin
inversion symmetry respectively. In order to illustrate this transformation we
give several examples of this mapping transformation, where most of them were
not explored yet.
