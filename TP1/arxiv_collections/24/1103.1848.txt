In this contribution we describe computational tools that permit the
evaluation of multi-loop scattering amplitudes in N=8 supergravity, in terms of
amplitudes in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory. We also discuss the remarkable
ultraviolet behavior of N=8 supergravity, which follows from these amplitudes,
and is as good as that of N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory through at least four
loops.
