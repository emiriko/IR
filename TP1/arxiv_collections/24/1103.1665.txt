In this article we study the frictionless cooling of atoms trapped in a
harmonic potential, while minimizing the transient energy of the system. We
show that in the case of unbounded control, this goal is achieved by a singular
control, which is also the time-minimal solution for a "dual" problem, where
the energy is held fixed. In addition, we examine briefly how the solution is
modified when there are bounds on the control. The results presented here have
a broad range of applications, from the cooling of a Bose-Einstein condensate
confined in a harmonic trap to adiabatic quantum computing and finite time
thermodynamic processes.
