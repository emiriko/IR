This paper concerns the consensus of discrete-time multi-agent systems with
linear or linearized dynamics. An observer-type protocol based on the relative
outputs of neighboring agents is proposed. The consensus of such a multi-agent
system with a directed communication topology can be cast into the stability of
a set of matrices with the same low dimension as that of a single agent. The
notion of discrete-time consensus region is then introduced and analyzed. For
neurally stable agents, it is shown that there exists an observer-type protocol
having a bounded consensus region in the form of an open unit disk, provided
that each agent is stabilizable and detectable. An algorithm is further
presented to construct a protocol to achieve consensus with respect to all the
communication topologies containing a spanning tree. Moreover, for the case
where the agents have no poles outside the unit circle,an algorithm is proposed
to construct a protocol having an origin-centered disk of radius $\delta$
($0<\delta<1$) as its consensus region, where $\delta$ has to further satisfy a
constraint related to the unstable eigenvalues of a single agent for the case
where each agent has a least one eigenvalue outside the unit circle. Finally,
the consensus algorithms are applied to solve formation control problems of
multi-agent systems.
