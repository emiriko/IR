We present near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy, and warm-Spitzer IRAC
photometry of the young very cool T dwarf Ross 458C, which we have typed as
T8.5p. By applying the fiducial age constraints (< 1Gyr) imposed by the
properties of the active M dwarf Ross 458A, we have used these data to
determine that Ross 458C has Teff = 695 \pm 60K, log g = 4.0 - 4.7 and an
inferred mass of 5-20 MJup. We have compared fits of the near-infrared spectrum
and IRAC photometry to the BT Settl and Saumon & Marley model grids, and have
found that both sets provide best fits that are consistent with our derived
properties, whilst the former provide a marginally closer match to the data for
all scenarios explored here. The main difference between the model grids arises
in the 4.5{\mu}m region, where the BT Settl models are able to better predict
the flux through the IRAC filter, suggesting that non-equilibrium effects on
the CO-CO2 ratio are important for shaping the mid-infrared spectra of very
cool T dwarfs. We have also revisited the issue of dust opacity in the spectra
of Ross 458C that was raised by Burgasser et al (2010). We have found that the
BT Settl models which also incorporate a condensate cloud model, provide a
better match to the near-infrared spectrum of this target than the Saumon &
Marley model with fsed = 2, and we briefly discuss the influence of condensate
clouds on T dwarf spectra.
