We study the evaporation of planets orbiting close to hot (extreme)
horizontal branch (EHB) stars. These planets survived the common envelope phase
inside the envelope of the reg giant star progenitor. We find that Jupiter-like
planets orbiting within 10Ro from an EHB star suffers a non-negligible
mass-loss during their 10^8 yr evolution on the horizontal branch. The
evaporated gas is ionized and becomes a source of Balmer lines. Such planets
might be detected by the periodic variation of the Doppler shift of the Balmer
lines.
