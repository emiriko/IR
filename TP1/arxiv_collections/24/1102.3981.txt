In this talk we report on selected topics on hadrons in nuclei. The first
topic is the renormalization of the width of the $\Lambda(1520)$ in a nuclear
medium. This is followed by a short update of the situation of the $\omega$ in
the medium. The investigation of the properties of $\bar{K}$ in the nuclear
medium from the study of the $(K_{flight},p)$ reaction is also addressed, as
well as properties of X,Y,Z charmed and hidden charm resonances in a nuclear
medium. Finally we address the novel issue of multimeson states.
