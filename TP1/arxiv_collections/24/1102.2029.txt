It is found that the scattering of the fragile nucleus $^6$Li from $^{12}$C
and $^{16}$O is unexpectedly transparent.
  It is shown that the internal-wave contribution is significantly large in the
scattering, which suggests that some transparency could persist in the
scattering involving the fragile nucleus $^6$He.
