Weak gravitational lensing is one of the key probes of the cosmological
model, dark energy, and dark matter, providing insight into both the cosmic
expansion history and large scale structure growth history. Taking into account
a broad spectrum of physics affecting growth - dynamical dark energy, extended
gravity, neutrino masses, and spatial curvature - we analyze the cosmological
constraints. Similarly we consider the effects of a range of systematic
uncertainties, in shear measurement, photometric redshifts, and the nonlinear
power spectrum, on cosmological parameter extraction. We also investigate, and
provide fitting formulas for, the influence of survey parameters such as
redshift depth, galaxy number densities, and sky area. Finally, we examine the
robustness of results for different fiducial cosmologies.
