The standard description of Fermi acceleration, developing in a class of
time-dependent billiards, is given in terms of a diffusion process taking place
in momentum space. Within this framework the evolution of the probability
density function (PDF) of the magnitude of particle velocities as a function of
the number of collisions $n$ is determined by the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE).
In the literature the FPE is constructed by identifying the transport
coefficients with the ensemble averages of the change of the magnitude of
particle velocity and its square in the course of one collision. Although this
treatment leads to the correct solution after a sufficiently large number of
collisions has been reached, the transient part of the evolution of the PDF is
not described. Moreover, in the case of the Fermi-Ulam model (FUM), if a
stadanrd simplification is employed, the solution of the FPE is even
inconsistent with the values of the transport coefficients used for its
derivation. The goal of our work is to provide a self-consistent methodology
for the treatment of Fermi acceleration in time-dependent billiards. The
proposed approach obviates any assumptions for the continuity of the random
process and the existence of the limits formally defining the transport
coefficients of the FPE. Specifically, we suggest, instead of the calculation
of ensemble averages, the derivation of the one-step transition probability
function and the use of the Chapman-Kolmogorov forward equation. This approach
is generic and can be applied to any time-dependent billiard for the treatment
of Fermi-acceleration. As a first step, we apply this methodology to the FUM,
being the archetype of time-dependent billiards to exhibit Fermi acceleration.
