Tempelmeier (2007) considers the problem of computing replenishment cycle
policy parameters under non-stationary stochastic demand and service level
constraints. He analyses two possible service level measures: the minimum no
stock-out probability per period ({\alpha}-service level) and the so called
"fill rate", that is the fraction of demand satisfied immediately from stock on
hand ({\beta}-service level). For each of these possible measures, he presents
a mixed integer programming (MIP) model to determine the optimal replenishment
cycles and corresponding order-up-to levels minimizing the expected total setup
and holding costs. His approach is essentially based on imposing service level
dependent lower bounds on cycle order-up-to levels. In this note, we argue that
Tempelmeier's strategy, in the {\beta}-service level case, while being an
interesting option for practitioners, does not comply with the standard
definition of "fill rate". By means of a simple numerical example we
demonstrate that, as a consequence, his formulation might yield sub-optimal
policies.
