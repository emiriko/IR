The relativistic problem of fermions subject to a PT-symmetric potential in
the presence of position-dependent mass is reinvestigated. The influence of the
PT-symmetric potential in the continuity equation and in the orthonormalization
condition are analyzed. In addition, a misconception diffused in the literature
on the interaction of neutral fermions is clarified.
