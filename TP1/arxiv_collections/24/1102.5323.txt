We report a new tetragonal ground-state for perovskite-structured PbCrO3 from
DFT+U calculations, and explain its anomalously large volume. The new structure
is stabilized due to orbital ordering of Cr-d in the presence of a large
tetragonal crystal field, mainly due to off-centering of the Pb atom. At higher
pressures (smaller volumes) there is a first-order transition to a cubic phase
where the Cr-d orbitals are orbitally liquid. This phase-transition is
accompanied by a ~11.5% volume collapse, one of the largest known for
transition-metal oxides. The large ferroelasticity and its strong coupling to
the orbital degrees of freedom could be exploited to form potentially useful
magnetostrictive materials
