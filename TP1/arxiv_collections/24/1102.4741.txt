We prove a central limit theorem applicable to one dimensional stochastic
approximation algorithms that converge to a point where the error terms of the
algorithm do not vanish. We show how this applies to a certain class of these
algorithms that in particular covers a generalized P\'olya urn model, which is
also discussed. In addition, we show how to scale these algorithms in some
cases where we cannot determine the limiting distribution but expect it to be
non-normal.
