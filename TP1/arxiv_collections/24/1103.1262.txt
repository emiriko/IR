We present observations of a failed eruption of a magnetic flux rope recorded
during the M6.2 flare of 14 July 2004. The observations were mainly made with
TRACE 171 {\AA} and 1600 {\AA} filters. The flare was accompanied by a
destabilization of a magnetic structure observed as a filament eruption. After
an initial acceleration the eruption slowed down and finally was stopped by the
overlying coronal loops. The observations suggest that the whole event is well
described by the quadrupole model of a solar flare. The failed eruption
stretched the loops lying above and then they were observed oscillating. We
were able to observe clear vertical polarization of the oscillatory motion in
TRACE images. The derived parameters of the oscillatory motion are the initial
amplitude of 9520 km, the period of 377 s, and the exponential damping time of
500 s. Differences between the existing models and the observations have been
found. The analyzed event is the second sample for global vertical kink waves
found besides the first by Wang and Solanki (2004).
