Using the projector-based renormalization method we investigate the formation
of the excitonic insulator phase in the two-dimensional (2D) spinless
Falicov-Kimball model with dispersive $f$ electrons and address the existence
of excitonic bound states at high temperatures on the semiconductor side of the
semimetal-semiconductor transition. To this end we calculate the imaginary part
of the dynamical electron-hole pair susceptibility and analyze the wave-vector
and energy dependence of excitonic resonances emerging in the band gap. We
thereby confirm the existence of the exciton insulator and its exciton
environment within a generic two-band lattice model with local Coulomb
attraction.
