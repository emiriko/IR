At large baryon number density, it is likely that the ground state of QCD is
a color-flavor-locked phase with a K0 condensate. The CFL+K0 phase is known to
support superconducting vortex strings, and it has been previously suggested
that it may also support vortons, which are superconducting vortex rings. We
reexamine the question of the stability of vortons, taking into account
electromagnetic effects, which make leading-order contributions to vorton
dynamics but were not investigated in previous work. We find that
current-carrying and electrically charged vortons can be stabilized either by
their angular momentum, by Coulomb repulsion, or by a combination of both
effects.
