Duality relations are explicitly established relating the Hamiltonians and
basis classification schemes associated with the number-conserving unitary and
number-nonconserving quasispin algebras for the two-level system with pairing
interactions. These relations are obtained in a unified formulation for both
bosonic and fermionic systems, with arbitrary and, in general, unequal
degeneracies for the two levels. Illustrative calculations are carried out
comparing the bosonic and fermionic quantum phase transitions.
