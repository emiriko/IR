We analyze two recently proposed measures of non-Markovianity: one based on
the concept of divisibility of the dynamical map and the other one based on
distinguishability of quantum states. We provide a toy model to show that these
two measures need not agree. In addition, we discuss possible generalizations
and intricate relations between these measures.
