On the verge of conclusive checks on the Standard Model by the LHC, we
discuss some of the basic assumptions. The reason for this analysis stems from
a recent proposal of an Electroweak Model based on a nonlinearly realized gauge
group SU(2) X U(1), where, in the perturbative approximation, there is no Higgs
boson. The model enjoys the Slavnov-Taylor identities and therefore the
perturbative unitarity. On the other hand, it is commonly believed that the
existence of the Higgs boson is entangled with the property of unitarity, when
high energy processes are considered. The argument is based mostly on the
Froissart bound and on the Equivalence Theorem. In this talk we briefly review
some of our objections on the validity of such arguments. Some open questions
are pointed out, in particular on the limit of zero mass for the vector mesons
and on the fate of the longitudinal polarizations.
