We present the results of magnetic properties and entanglement for kagome
lattice using Heisenberg model with two-, and three-site exchange interactions
in strong magnetic field. Kagome lattice correspond to the third layer of fluid
3He absorbed on the surface of graphite. The magnetic properties and
concurrence as a measure of pairwise thermal entanglement are studied by means
of variational mean-field like treatment based on Gibbs-Bogoliubov inequality.
The system exhibits different magnetic behaviors, depending on the values of
the exchange parameters (J2, J3). We have obtained the magnetization plateaus
at low temperatures. The central theme of the paper is the comparing the
entanglement and magnetic behavior for kagome lattice. We have found that in
the antiferromagnetic region behaviour of the concurrence coincides with the
magnetization one.
