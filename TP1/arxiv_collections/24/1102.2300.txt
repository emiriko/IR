We give a new algorithm for Unique Games which is based on purely {\em
spectral} techniques, in contrast to previous work in the area, which relies
heavily on semidefinite programming (SDP). Given a highly satisfiable instance
of Unique Games, our algorithm is able to recover a good assignment. The
approximation guarantee depends only on the completeness of the game, and not
on the alphabet size, while the running time depends on spectral properties of
the {\em Label-Extended} graph associated with the instance of Unique Games.
  We further show that on input the integrality gap instance of Khot and
Vishnoi, our algorithm runs in quasi-polynomial time and decides that the
instance if highly unsatisfiable. Notably, when run on this instance, the
standard SDP relaxation of Unique Games {\em fails}. As a special case, we also
re-derive a polynomial time algorithm for Unique Games on expander constraint
graphs.
  The main ingredient of our algorithm is a technique to effectively use the
full spectrum of the underlying graph instead of just the second eigenvalue,
which is of independent interest. The question of how to take advantage of the
full spectrum of a graph in the design of algorithms has been often studied,
but no significant progress was made prior to this work.
