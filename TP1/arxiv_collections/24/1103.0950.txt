It is shown that the electron coupling to photons in field-dressed
nanostructures can result in the ground electron-photon state with a nonzero
electric current. Since the current is associated with the ground state, it
flows without the Joule heating of the nanostructure and is nondissipative.
Such a dissipationless electron transport can be realized in strongly coupled
electron-photon systems with the broken time-reversal symmetry - particularly,
in quantum rings and chiral nanostructures dressed by circularly polarized
photons.
