Interdisciplinary collaboration is essential for the advance of research. As
domain subjects become more and more specialized, researchers need to cross
disciplines for insights from peers in other areas to have a broader and deeper
understand of a topic at micro- and macro-levels. We developed a 3D virtual
learning environment that served as a platform for faculty to plan curriculum,
share educational beliefs, and conduct cross-discipline research for effective
learning. Based upon the scripts designed by faculty from five disciplines,
virtual doctors, nurses, or patients interact in a 3D virtual hospital. The
teaching vignettes were then converted to video clips, allowing users to view,
pause, replay, or comment on the videos individually or in groups. Unlike many
existing platforms, we anticipated a value-added by adding a social networking
capacity to this virtual environment. The focus of this paper is on the
cost-efficiency and system design of the virtual learning environment.
