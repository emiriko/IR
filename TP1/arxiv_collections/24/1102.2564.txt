In this article we study quasilinear multipower systems of two equations of
two types, in a domain $\Omega$ of R^{N} : with absorption terms, or mixed
terms. Despite of the lack of comparison principle, we prove a priori estimates
of Keller-Osserman type. Concerning the mixed system, we show that one of the
solutions always satisfies Harnack inequality. In the case $\Omega$=B(0,1)\{0},
we also study the behaviour near 0 of the solutions of more general weighted
systems, giving a priori estimates and removability results. Finally we prove
the sharpness of the results.
