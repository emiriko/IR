Nanoantennas for visible and infrared radiation can strongly enhance the
interaction of light with nanoscale matter by their ability to efficiently link
propagating and spatially localized optical fields. This ability unlocks an
enormous potential for applications ranging from nanoscale optical microscopy
and spectroscopy over solar energy conversion, integrated optical
nanocircuitry, opto-electronics and density-ofstates engineering to
ultra-sensing as well as enhancement of optical nonlinearities. Here we review
the current understanding of optical antennas based on the background of both
well-developed radiowave antenna engineering and the emerging field of
plasmonics. In particular, we address the plasmonic behavior that emerges due
to the very high optical frequencies involved and the limitations in the choice
of antenna materials and geometrical parameters imposed by nanofabrication.
Finally, we give a brief account of the current status of the field and the
major established and emerging lines of investigation in this vivid area of
research.
