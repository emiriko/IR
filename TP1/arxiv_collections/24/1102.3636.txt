Highly polarized nuclear spins within a semiconductor quantum dot (QD) induce
effective magnetic (Overhauser) fields of up to several Tesla acting on the
electron spin or up to a few hundred mT for the hole spin. Recently this has
been recognized as a resource for intrinsic control of QD-based spin quantum
bits. However, only static long-lived Overhauser fields could be used. Here we
demonstrate fast redirection on the microsecond time-scale of Overhauser fields
of the order of 0.5 T experienced by a single electron spin in an optically
pumped GaAs quantum dot. This has been achieved using full coherent control of
an ensemble of 10^3-10^4 optically polarized nuclear spins by sequences of
short radio-frequency (rf) pulses. These results open the way to a new class of
experiments using rf techniques to achieve highly-correlated nuclear spins in
quantum dots, such as adiabatic demagnetization in the rotating frame leading
to sub-micro K nuclear spin temperatures, rapid adiabatic passage, and spin
squeezing.
