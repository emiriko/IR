This review is concerned with the motion of a point scalar charge, a point
electric charge, and a point mass in a specified background spacetime. In each
of the three cases the particle produces a field that behaves as outgoing
radiation in the wave zone, and therefore removes energy from the particle. In
the near zone the field acts on the particle and gives rise to a self-force
that prevents the particle from moving on a geodesic of the background
spacetime. The field's action on the particle is difficult to calculate because
of its singular nature: the field diverges at the position of the particle. But
it is possible to isolate the field's singular part and show that it exerts no
force on the particle. What remains after subtraction is a smooth field that is
fully responsible for the self-force. The mathematical tools required to derive
the equations of motion of a point scalar charge, a point electric charge, and
a point mass in a specified background spacetime are developed here from
scratch. The review begins with a discussion of the basic theory of bitensors.
It then applies the theory to the construction of convenient coordinate systems
to chart a neighbourhood of the particle's word line. It continues with a
thorough discussion of Green's functions in curved spacetime. The review
presents a detailed derivation of each of the three equations of motion.
Because the notion of a point mass is problematic in general relativity, the
review concludes with an alternative derivation of the equations of motion that
applies to a small body of arbitrary internal structure.
