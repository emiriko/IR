We present a possible extension of the usual relativistic nuclear mean field
models widely used to describe nuclear matter towards accounting for the
influence of possible intrinsic fluctuations caused by the environment. Rather
than individually identifying their particular causes we concentrate on the
fact that such effects can be summarily incorporated in the changing of the
statistical background used, from the usual (extensive) Boltzman-Gibbs one to
the nonextensive taken in the form proposed by Tsallis with a dimensionless
nonextensivity parameter $q$ responsible for the above mentioned effects (for
$q \rightarrow 1$ one recovers the usual BG case). We illustrate this
proposition on the example of the QCD-based Nambu - Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model of
a many-body field theory describing the behavior of strongly interacting matter
presenting its nonextensive version. We check the sensitivity of the usual NJL
model to a departure from the BG scenario expressed by the value of $| q - 1|$,
in particular in the vicinity of critical points.
