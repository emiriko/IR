The ATLAS detector is used to search for high-mass states, such as heavy
charged gauge bosons (W', W*) decaying to a charged lepton (electron or muon)
and a neutrino. Results are presented based on the analysis of pp collisions at
a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
36 pb-1. No excess beyond standard model expectations is observed. A W' with
sequential standard model couplings is excluded at 95% confidence level for
masses below 1.49 TeV, and a W*(charged chiral boson) for masses below 1.47
TeV.
