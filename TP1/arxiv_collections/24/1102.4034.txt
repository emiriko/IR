We present a novel hybrid CMOS-MQCA architecture using multi-layer Spintronic
devices as computing elements. A feasibility study is presented with 22nm CMOS
where new approaches for spin transfer torque induced clocking and read-out
scheme for variability-tolerance are introduced. A first-of-its-kind Spintronic
device model enables circuit simulation using existing CAD infrastructure.
Approximately 70% reduction in energy consumption is observed when compared
against conventional field-induced clocking scheme.
