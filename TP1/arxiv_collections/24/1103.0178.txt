We formulate and apply a theory of electron-phonon interactions for the
surface state of a strong topological insulator. Phonons are modelled using an
isotropic elastic continuum theory with stress-free boundary conditions and
interact with the Dirac surface fermions via the deformation potential. We
discuss the temperature dependence of the quasi-particle lifetime in
photoemission and of the surface resistivity.
