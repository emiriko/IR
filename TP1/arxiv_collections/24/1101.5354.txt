We theoretically study the properties of one-dimensional nonlinear saturable
photonic lattices exhibiting multiple mobility windows for stationary
solutions. The effective energy barrier decreases to a minimum in those power
regions where a new intermediate stationary solution appears. As an
application, we investigate the dynamics of high-power gaussian-like beams
finding several regions where the light transport is enhanced.
