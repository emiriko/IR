A controlled-NOT logic gate based on conditional spectroscopy has been
demonstrated recently for a pair of superconducting flux qubits [Plantenberg et
al., Nature 447, 836 (2007)]. Here we study the fidelity of this type of gate
applied to a phase qubit coupled to a resonator (or a pair of capacitively
coupled phase qubits). Our results show that an intrinsic fidelity of more than
99% is achievable in 45ns.
