We explore imprints of the solar wind interaction with the local interstellar
medium on spectral properties of the backscattered solar Ly-alpha radiation. We
employ newly developed effective model for the interstellar H atom velocity
distribution function in the heliosphere (Katushkina and Izmodenov 2010, 2011).
This model takes into account both global effects of H atom perturbations at
the heliospheric boundaries and local (i.e. within 10-20 AU from the Sun)
effects of the solar ionization, charge exchange, solar gravitation and
radiation pressure. Backscattered solar Ly-alpha profiles and their zero, first
and second moments were computed at 1 AU for the anti-solar directions of
line-of-sight. Then the moments are compared with the moments calculated by
using more simplified one-component and two-component hot models. The
comparison shows that the Ly-alpha intensities calculated in the frame of new
model are somewhat smaller than those calculated by means of the simplified
models. Small differences in the first moment (i.e. line-shift) are also
observed in the downwind direction. The largest difference between new model
and hot models is seen in the second moment of the backscattered Ly-alpha
profile. This moment is also called as line-of-sight temperature or line-width
of the backscattered spectra. The spectral width depends on the width of the H
atom velocity distribution function within few AU from the Sun. We show that
the line-widths calculated on the basis of the our model is qualitatively
different from those of simplified models.
