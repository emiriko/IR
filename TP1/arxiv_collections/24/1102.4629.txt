Transport in an ideal two-dimensional quantum spin Hall device is dominated
by the counterpropagating edge states of electrons with opposite spins, giving
the universal value of the conductance, $2e^2/h$. We study the effect on the
conductance of a magnetic impurity, which can backscatter an electron from one
edge state to the other. In the case of isotropic Kondo exchange we find that
the correction to the electrical conductance caused by such an impurity
vanishes in the dc limit, while the thermal conductance does acquire a finite
correction due to the spin-flip backscattering.
