We have realized a compact system to efficiently couple the fluorescent light
emitted by a single trapped ion to two opposing optical fibers. The fibers are
tightly integrated in the center electrodes of a miniature endcap trap. They
capture light from the ion with a numerical aperture of 0.34 each,
corresponding to 6% of the solid angle in total. The high collection efficiency
and high signal-to-background ratio make the setup an ideal quantum light
source. We have observed strong antibunching of the photons emitted from the
two fibers. The system has a range of applications from single-ion state
detection in quantum information processing to strong coupling cavity-QED with
ions.
