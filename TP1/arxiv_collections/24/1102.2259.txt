We study a modified version of the Ginzburg-Landau model suggested by Ward
and show that Hopfions exist in it as stable static solutions, for values of
the Hopf invariant up to at least 7. We also find that their properties closely
follow those of their counterparts in the Faddeev-Skyrme model. Finally, we
lend support to Babaev's conjecture that longer core lengths yield more stable
solitons and propose a possible mechanism for constructing Hopfions in pure
Ginzburg-Landau model.
