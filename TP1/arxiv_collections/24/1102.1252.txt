The electromagnetic field on the metal surface launched by a subwavelength
slit is analytically studied, for the case when the fundamental mode inside the
slit has a wavevector component along the slit axis (conical mount). Both
near-field and far-field regions are discussed, and the role of surface
plasmon-polaritons and Norton waves is revealed. It is shown that the distance
from the slit at which NW are more intense than surface plasmons decrease with
parallel wavevector, which could help experimental studies on Norton waves.
Additionally, it is found that the s-polarization component, while present for
any non-zero parallel wavevector, only weakly contributes to the NWs.
