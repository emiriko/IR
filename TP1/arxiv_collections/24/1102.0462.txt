The book is based largely on the author's researches presented at conferences
in the period 1992 onwards. It is a historically based exposition and an
extension of the hyperbolic version of special relativity first proposed by
Vari\'cak (1910 etc) and others not long after the appearance of the early
papers of Einstein and Minkowski. The book's approach puts emphasis on the
concept of hyperbolic velocity (scaled rapidity) and in this respect differs
markedly from the gyro theory of Ungar. New formulations are given in optics
relating hyperbolic velocity with logarithmic redshift and in dynamics
including a reformulation of Newton's 2nd law in terms of hyperbolic
acceleration so avoiding velocity-dependent mass. The concept of differential
Minkowski space is introduced and related to the hyperbolic theory and to
Carath\'eodory's axiomatic approach to the special theory.
