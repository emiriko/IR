We present a study on the clustering of a stellar mass selected sample of
galaxies with stellar masses M*>10^10Msol at redshifts 0.4<z<2.0, taken from
the Palomar Observatory Wide-field Infrared Survey. We examine the clustering
properties of these stellar mass selected samples as a function of redshift and
stellar mass, and find that galaxies with high stellar masses have a
progressively higher clustering strength than galaxies with lower stellar
masses. We also find that galaxies within a fixed stellar mass range have a
higher clustering strength at higher redshifts. We further estimate the average
total masses of the dark matter haloes hosting these stellar-mass selected
galaxies. For all galaxies in our sample the stellar-mass-to-total-mass ratio
is always lower than the universal baryonic mass fraction and the
stellar-mass-to-total-mass ratio is strongly correlated with the halo masses
for central galaxies, such that more massive haloes contain a lower fraction of
their mass in the form of stars. The remaining baryonic mass is included
partially in stars within satellite galaxies in these haloes, and as diffuse
hot and warm gas. We also find that, at a fixed stellar mass, the
stellar-to-total-mass ratio increases at lower redshifts. This suggests that
galaxies at a fixed stellar mass form later in lower mass dark matter haloes,
and earlier in massive haloes. We interpret this as a `halo downsizing' effect.
