Observations of quasar microlensing by Schild 1996 show the baryonic dark
matter BDM of galaxies is micro-brown-dwarfs, primordial hydrogen-helium
planets formed at the plasma to gas transition 10^13 seconds, in
trillion-planet clumps termed proto-globular-star-clusters PGCs. Large
photon-viscosity {\nu} of the plasma permits supercluster-mass gravitational
fragmentation at 10^12 seconds when the horizon scale L_H = ct is matched by
the Schwarz viscous scale L_SV of Gibson 1996. Voids begin expansion at sonic
speeds c/ 3^1/2, where c is light speed and t is time, explaining 10^25 meter
size regions observed to be devoid of all matter, either BDM or non-baryonic
NBDM. Most of the NBDM is weakly-collisional, strongly-diffusive, neutrino-like
particles. If cold NBDM (CDM) is assumed, it must soon become warm and diffuse
because it is weakly-collisional. It cannot clump and its clumps cannot clump.
CDM is ruled out with 99% confidence by local-group satellite observations of
Kroupa et al. 2010. The satellites are clusters of PGCs. PGCs are recaptured by
the Galaxy on an accretion disk as they freeze and diffuse from its core to
form its BDM halo. Stars form by viscous mergers of primordial gas planets
within PGCs. Stars die by overeating mBDs, making the first chemicals, oceans
and life at 2-8 Myr.
