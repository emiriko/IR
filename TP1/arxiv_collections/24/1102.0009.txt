We perform a study of the Standard Model (SM) fit to the mixing quantities
$\Delta M_{B_s}$, and $\Delta \Gamma_{B_s}/\Delta M_{B_s}$ in order to bound
contributions of New Physics to $B_s$ mixing. We then use this to explore the
branching fraction of $B_{s} \to \mu^+\mu^-$ in certain models of New Physics
(NP). In most cases, this constrains NP amplitudes for $B_{s} \to \mu^+\mu^-$
to lie below the SM component.
