We provide a thorough examination of the conditions for the existence of
back-reaction and an "effective" acceleration (in the context of Buchert's
averaging formalism) in regular generic spherically symmetric
Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) dust models. By considering arbitrary spherical
comoving domains, we verify rigorously the fulfillment of these conditions
expressed in terms of suitable scalar variables that are evaluated at the
boundary of every domain. Effective deceleration necessarily occurs in all
domains in: (a) the asymptotic radial range of models converging to a FLRW
background, (b) the asymptotic time range of non-vacuum hyperbolic models, (c)
LTB self-similar solutions and (d) near a simultaneous big bang. Accelerating
domains are proven to exist in the following scenarios: (i) central vacuum
regions, (ii) central (non-vacuum) density voids, (iii) the intermediate radial
range of models converging to a FLRW background, (iv) the asymptotic radial
range of models converging to a Minkowski vacuum and (v) domains near and/or
intersecting a non-simultaneous big bang. All these scenarios occur in
hyperbolic models with negative averaged and local spatial curvature, though
scenarios (iv) and (v) are also possible in low density regions of a class of
elliptic models in which local spatial curvature is negative but its average is
positive. Rough numerical estimates between -0.003 and -0.5 were found for the
effective deceleration parameter. While the existence of accelerating domains
cannot be ruled out in models converging to an Einstein de Sitter background
and in domains undergoing gravitational collapse, the conditions for this are
very restrictive. The results obtained may provide important theoretical clues
on the effects of back-reaction and averaging in more general non-spherical
models.
