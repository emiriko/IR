We consider the transfer of classical and quantum information through a
memory amplitude damping channel. Such a quantum channel is modeled as a damped
harmonic oscillator, the interaction between the information carriers - a train
of qubits - and the oscillator being of the Jaynes-Cummings kind. We prove that
this memory channel is forgetful, so that quantum coding theorems hold for its
capacities. We analyze entropic quantities relative to two uses of this
channel. We show that memory effects improve the channel aptitude to transmit
both classical and quantum information, and we investigate the mechanism by
which memory acts in changing the channel transmission properties.
