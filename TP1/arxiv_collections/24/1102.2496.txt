We present here the results of our relativistic many-body calculations of
various properties of the first six low-lying excited states of indium. The
calculations were performed using the relativistic coupled-cluster method in
the framework of the singles, doubles and partial triples approximation. We
obtain a large lifetime ~10s for the [4p^6]5s^2 5p_{3/2} state, which had not
been known earlier. Our precise results could be used to shed light on the
reliability of the lifetime measurements of the excited states of atomic indium
that we have considered in the present work.
