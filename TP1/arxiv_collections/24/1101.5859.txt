Spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric observations of the pre-main sequence
early-G star HD 141943 were obtained at four observing epochs (in 2006, 2007,
2009 and 2010). The observations were undertaken at the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian
Telescope using the UCLES echelle spectrograph and the SEMPOL
spectropolarimeter visitor instrument. Brightness and surface magnetic field
topologies were reconstructed for the star using the technique of least-squares
deconvolution to increase the signal-to-noise of the data.
  The reconstructed brightness maps show that HD 141943 had a weak polar spot
and a significant amount of low latitude features, with little change in the
latitude distribution of the spots over the 4 years of observations. The
surface magnetic field was reconstructed at three of the epochs from a high
order (l <= 30) spherical harmonic expansion of the spectropolarimetric
observations. The reconstructed magnetic topologies show that in 2007 and 2010
the surface magnetic field was reasonably balanced between poloidal and
toroidal components. However we find tentative evidence of a change in the
poloidal/toroidal ratio in 2009 with the poloidal component becoming more
dominant. At all epochs the radial magnetic field is predominantly
non-axisymmetric while the azimuthal field is predominantly axisymmetric with a
ring of positive azimuthal field around the pole similar to that seen on other
active stars.
