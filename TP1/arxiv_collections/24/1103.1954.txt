*First-principles derivation of the entropy production in erectric static
conduction. *The second-order (symmetric) density matrix contributes to the
entropy production. *New schemes of steady states formulated using a
relaxation-type von Neumann equation. *Stationary temperature is introduced to
characterize steady states. *The mechanism of the entropy production in steady
states is also clarified.
