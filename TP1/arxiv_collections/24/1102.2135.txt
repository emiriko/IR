A new experimental approach for the characterization of the lateral elastic
modulus of individual nanowires is demonstrated by implementing a micro/nano
scale diametrical compression test geometry, using a flat punch indenter inside
of a scanning electron microscope (SEM). A 250 nm diameter single crystal
silicon nanowire is tested. Since silicon is highly anisotropic, the
compression axis of the wire was determined by electron backscatter diffraction
(EBSD). A two dimensional analytical closed-form solution based on a Hertz
model is presented. The results of the analytical model are compared with those
of finite-element simulations and to the experimental diametral compression
results and show good agreement.
