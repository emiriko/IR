It is well known that the number of entanglement classes in SLOCC (stochastic
local operations and classical communication) classifications increases with
the number of qubits and is already infinite for four qubits. Bearing in mind
the rapid evolution of experimental technology, criteria for explicitly
discriminating and classifying pure states of four and more qubits are highly
desirable and therefore in the focus of intense theoretical research. In this
article we develop a general criterion for the discrimination of pure N-partite
entangled states in terms of polynomial SL(d,C) invariants. By means of this
criterion, existing SLOCC classifications of four-qubit entanglement are
reproduced. Based on this we propose a polynomial classification scheme in
which families are identified through 'tangle patterns', thus bringing together
qualitative and quantitative description of entanglement.
