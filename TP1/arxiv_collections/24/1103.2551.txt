We undertake a systematic numerical exploration of self-organized states in a
deterministic model of interacting self-propelled particles in two dimensions.
In the process, we identify various types of collective motion, namely,
disordered swarms, rings, and droplets. We construct a "phase diagram," which
summarizes our results as it delineates phase transitions ?all discontinuous?
between disordered swarms and vortical flocks on one hand and bound vortical
flocks and expanding formations on the other. One of the transition lines is
found to have a close analogy with the temperature-driven gas-liquid
transition, in finite clusters with the same interparticle potential.
Furthermore, we report on a type of flocking which takes place in the presence
of a uniform external driver. Altogether, our results set a rather firm stage
for experimental refinement and/or falsification of this class of models.
