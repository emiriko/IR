Modern medical wireless systems, such as wireless body area networks (WBANs),
are applications of wireless networks that can be used as a tool of data
transmission between patients and doctors. Accuracy of data transmission is an
important requirement for such systems. In this paper, we will propose a WBAN
which is robust against erasures and describe its properties using graph
theoretic techniques.
