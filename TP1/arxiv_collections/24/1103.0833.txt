The Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence claims that the Gromov-Witten
invariant of the quintic Calabi-Yau 3-fold should be related to the
Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten invariant of the associated Landau-Ginzburg model via
wall crossings. In this paper, we consider the stack of quasi-maps with a
cosection and introduce sequences of stability conditions which enable us to
interpolate between the moduli stack for Gromov-Witten invariants and the
moduli stack for Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten invariants.
