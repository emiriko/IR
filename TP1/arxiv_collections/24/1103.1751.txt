This thesis is about the designing and constructing a microwave ion source.
The ions are generated in a thermal and dense hydrogen plasma by microwave
induction. The plasma is generated by using a microwave source with a frequency
of 2.45 GHz and a power of 700 W. The generated microwave is pulsing with a
frequency of 50 Hz. The designed and constructed microwave system generates
hydrogen plasma in a pyrex plasma chamber. Moreover, an ion extraction unit is
designed and constructed in order to extract the ions from the generated
hydrogen plasma. The ion beam extraction is achieved and ion currents are
measured. The plasma parameters are determined by a double Langmuir probe and
the ion current is measured by a Faraday cup. The designed ion extraction unit
is simulated by using the dimensions of the designed and constructed ion
extraction unit in order to trace out the trajectories of the extracted ions.
