Single top quark production via four-fermion contact interactions associated
to flavour-changing neutral currents was searched for in data taken by the
DELPHI detector at LEP2. The data were accumulated at centre-of-mass energies
ranging from 189 to 209 GeV, with an integrated luminosity of 598.1 pb^-1. No
evidence for a signal was found. Limits on the energy scale Lambda, were set
for scalar-, vector- and tensor-like coupling scenarios.
