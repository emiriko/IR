We briefly introduce noise-based logic. After describing the main motivations
we outline classical, instantaneous (squeezed and non-squeezed), continuum,
spike and random-telegraph-signal based schemes with applications such as
circuits that emulate the brain functioning and string verification via a slow
communication channel.
