The electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking in the simplest supersymmetric (SUSY)
extensions of the standard model (SM), i.e. minimal and next-to-minimal
supersymmetric standard models (MSSM and NMSSM), is considered. The spectrum of
the Higgs particles, upper bound on the mass of the lightest Higgs boson and
little hierarchy problem are discussed. The breakdown of gauge symmetry and
Higgs phenomenology within the E6 inspired SUSY models with extra U(1)' factor
are briefly reviewed.
