The transport properties of finite nanotubes placed in a magnetic field
parallel to their axes are investigated. Upon including spin-orbit coupling and
curvature effects, two main phenomena are analyzed which crucially depend on
the tube's chirality: i) Finite carbon nanotubes in a parallel magnetic field
may present a suppression of current due to the localization at the edges of
otherwise conducting states. This phenomenon occurs due to the magnetic-field
dependent open boundary conditions obeyed by the carbon nanotube's wave
functions. The transport is fully suppressed above threshold values of the
magnetic field which depend on the nanotube chirality, length and on the
spin-orbit coupling. ii) Reversible spin polarized currents can be obtained
upon tuning the magnetic field, exploiting the curvature-induced spin-orbit
splitting.
