In this paper we deal with an invariant ergodic hyperbolic measure $\mu$ for
a diffeomorphism $f,$ assuming that $f$ it is either $C^{1+\alpha}$ or $f$ is
$C^1$ and the Oseledec splitting of $\mu$ is dominated. We show that this
system $(f,\mu)$ satisfies a weaker and non-uniform version of specification,
related with notions studied in several recent papers, including \cite{STV,Y,
PS, T,Var, Oli}.
  Our main results have several consequences: as corollaries, we are able to
improve the results about quantitative Poincar\'e recurrence, removing the
assumption of the non-uniform specification property in the main Theorem of
\cite{STV} that establishes an inequality between Lyapunov exponents and local
recurrence properties. Another consequence is the fact that any of such measure
is the weak limit of averages of Dirac measures at periodic points, as in
\cite{Sigmund}. Following \cite{Y} and \cite{PS}, one can show that the
topological pressure can be calculated by considering the convenient weighted
sums on periodic points, whenever the dynamics is positive expansive and every
measure with pressure close to the topological pressure is hyperbolic.
