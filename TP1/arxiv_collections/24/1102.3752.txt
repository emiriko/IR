Using rigorous solutions, we compare the ERE parameters obtained in three
different scenarios of EFT($\notpi$) in nonperturbative regime. A scenario with
unconventional power counting (like KSW) is shown to be disfavored by the PSA
data, while the one with elaborate prescription of renormalization but keeping
conventional power counting intact seems more promising.
