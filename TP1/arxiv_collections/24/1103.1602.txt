We present our results for the exclusive electroproduction of pions off
nucleons and nuclei at high values of $Q^2$. In electroproduction of nuclei
$A(e,e'\pi)$ we consider the Color Transparency (CT) effect recently observed
at JLAB. It is shown that the description of $\pi$ production off nucleons is
mandatory for the proof of the CT signal at JLAB. We further develop the models
for exclusive production of $\pi$ off nucleons at JLAB and HERMES. At first we
describe a model based on exclusive-inclusive connection. In the second
approach we combine a Regge pole approach with the residual effect of nucleon
resonances. The nucleon resonances are described using a dual connection
between the exclusive form factors and inclusive deep inelastic structure
functions. We present the results for the beam spin azimuthal asymmetries
measured at JLAB in exclusive electroproduction of charged and neutral pions.
