Novel techniques are presented, which identify the chiral power-counting
regime (PCR), and realize the existence of an intrinsic energy scale embedded
in lattice QCD results that extend outside the PCR. The nucleon mass is
considered as a benchmark for illustrating this new approach. Using
finite-range regularization, an optimal regularization scale can be extracted
from lattice simulation results by analyzing the renormalization of the low
energy coefficients. The optimal scale allows a description of lattice
simulation results that extend beyond the PCR by quantifying and thus handling
any scheme-dependence. Preliminary results for the nucleon magnetic moment are
also examined, and a consistent optimal regularization scale is obtained. This
indicates the existence of an intrinsic scale corresponding to the finite size
of the source of the pion cloud.
