When a fluid with a bulk liquid-vapor critical point is placed inside a
static external field with spatial periodic oscillations in one direction, the
bulk critical point splits into two new critical points and a triple point.
This phenomenon is called laser-induced condensation [Mol. Phys. Vol. 101, Pg.
1651 (2003)], and it occurs when the wavelength of the field is sufficiently
large. The critical points mark the end of two coexistence regions, namely
between (1) a vapor and stacked-fluid phase, and (2) a stacked-fluid and liquid
phase. The stacked-fluid or "zebra" phase is characterized by large density
oscillations along the field direction. We study the above phenomenon for a
mixture of colloids and polymers using density functional theory and computer
simulation. The theory predicts that the vapor-zebra and liquid-zebra surface
tensions are extremely small. Most strikingly, however, is the theoretical
finding that at their respective critical points, both tensions vanish, but not
according to any critical power law. The solution to this apparent paradox is
provided by the simulations. These show that the field divides the system into
effectively two-dimensional slabs, stacked on top of each other along the field
direction. Inside each slab, the system behaves as if it were two-dimensional,
while in the field direction the system resembles a one-dimensional Ising
chain.
