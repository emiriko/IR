In the framework of the theory of open systems based on completely positive
quantum dynamical semigroups, we give a description of the dynamics of
entanglement for a system consisting of two uncoupled modes interacting with a
thermal environment. Using Peres-Simon necessary and sufficient criterion of
separability for two-mode Gaussian states, we describe the evolution of
entanglement in terms of the covariance matrix for a Gaussian input state. We
determine the asymptotic Gaussian maximally entangled mixed states (GMEMS) and
their corresponding asymptotic maximal logarithmic negativity, which
characterizes the degree of entanglement. Using the symplectic eigenvalues of
the asymptotic covariance matrix, the expressions of von Neumann entropy and
mutual information of asymptotic GMEMS are obtained.
