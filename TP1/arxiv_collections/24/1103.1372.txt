Understanding exotic forms of magnetism in quantum mechanical systems is a
central goal of modern condensed matter physics, with implications from high
temperature superconductors to spintronic devices. Simulating magnetic
materials in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition is computationally
intractable on classical computers due to the extreme complexity arising from
quantum entanglement between the constituent magnetic spins. Here we employ a
degenerate Bose gas confined in an optical lattice to simulate a chain of
interacting quantum Ising spins as they undergo a phase transition. Strong spin
interactions are achieved through a site-occupation to pseudo-spin mapping. As
we vary an applied field, quantum fluctuations drive a phase transition from a
paramagnetic phase into an antiferromagnetic phase. In the paramagnetic phase
the interaction between the spins is overwhelmed by the applied field which
aligns the spins. In the antiferromagnetic phase the interaction dominates and
produces staggered magnetic ordering. Magnetic domain formation is observed
through both in-situ site-resolved imaging and noise correlation measurements.
By demonstrating a route to quantum magnetism in an optical lattice, this work
should facilitate further investigations of magnetic models using ultracold
atoms, improving our understanding of real magnetic materials.
