Distributed systems can be very large and complex. The various considerations
that influence their design can result in a substantial specification, which
requires a structured framework that has to be managed successfully. The
purpose of the RMODP is to define such a framework. The Reference Model for
Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) provides a framework within which support
of distribution, inter-working and portability can be integrated. It defines:
an object model, architectural concepts and architecture for the development of
ODP systems in terms of five viewpoints. Which include an information
viewpoint. Since the usage of Data bases management systems (DBMS) in complex
networks is increasing considerably, we are interested, in our work, in giving
DBMS specifications through the use of the three schemas (static, dynamic,
invariant). The present paper is organized as follows. After a literature
review, we will describe then the subset of concepts considered in this work
named the database management system (DBMS) object model. In the third section,
we will be interested in the engineering language and DMBS structure by
describing essentially DBMS objects. Finally, we will present DBMS engineering
specifications and makes the connection between models and their instances.
This introduces the basic form of the semantic approach we have described here.
