The paper formulates the concept of persistence of excitation for
discrete-time linear switched systems, and provides sufficient conditions for
an input signal to be persistently exciting. Persistence of excitation is
formulated as a property of the input signal, and it is not tied to any
specific identification algorithm. The results of the paper rely on realization
theory and on the notion of Markov-parameters for linear switched systems.
