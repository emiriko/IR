This paper introduces the FermiFab toolbox for many-particle quantum systems.
It is mainly concerned with the representation of (symbolic) fermionic
wavefunctions and the calculation of corresponding reduced density matrices
(RDMs). The toolbox transparently handles the inherent antisymmetrization of
wavefunctions and incorporates the creation/annihilation formalism. Thus, it
aims at providing a solid base for a broad audience to use fermionic
wavefunctions with the same ease as matrices in Matlab, say. Leveraging
symbolic computation, the toolbox can greatly simply tedious pen-and-paper
calculations for concrete quantum mechanical systems, and serves as "sandbox"
for theoretical hypothesis testing. FermiFab (including full source code) is
freely available as a plugin for both Matlab and Mathematica.
