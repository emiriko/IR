We discuss the size of isospin violating effects of both electromagnetic (e
\neq 0) and strong (m_u \neq m_d) origin in P_{\ell 2 (\gamma)} decays. Our
results are relevant for the extraction of |V_{us}/V_{ud}| from the measured
ratio of the K_{\mu 2 (\gamma)} and \pi_{\mu 2 (\gamma)} decay widths combined
with F_K/F_\pi obtained in lattice calculations in the isospin limit. We point
out that strong isospin-breaking corrections, neglected in previous studies,
enter at the same level as the electromagnetic effects. The updated value for
the ratio of CKM elements reads |V_{us}/V_{ud}| = 0.2316(12).
