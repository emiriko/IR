Let X be an affine normal variety with a C^*-action having only positive
weights. Assume that X_{reg} has a symplectic 2-form w of weight l. We prove
that, when l is not zero, the w is a unique symplectic 2-form of weight l up to
C^*-equivariant automorphism
  When $l = 0$, we have a counter-example to this statement.
  In the latter half of the article, we associate to X a projective variety
P(X) and prove that P(X) has a contact orbifold structure. Moreover, when X has
canonical singularities, the contact orbifold structure is rigid under a small
deformation. By using the contact structure on P(X), we discuss the equivalence
problem for (X, w) up to contant. In most examples the symplectic structures
turn out to be unique up to constant with very few exceptions.
