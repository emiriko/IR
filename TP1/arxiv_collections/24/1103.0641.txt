The Josephson current flowing through weak links containing ferromagnetic
elements is studied theoretically under the condition that the quasiparticle
distribution over energy states in the interlayer is spin-dependent. It is
shown that the interplay between the spin-dependent quasiparticle distribution
and the triplet superconducting correlations induced by the proximity effect
between the superconducting leads and ferromagnetic elements of the interlayer,
leads to the appearence of an additional contribution to the Josephson current.
This additional contribution $j_t$ can be extracted from the full Josephson
current in experiment. The features of the additional supercurrent $j_t$, which
are of main physical interest are the following: (i) We propose the
experimental setup, where the contributions given by the short-range (SRTC) and
long-range (LRTC) components of triplet superconducting correlations in the
interlayer can be measured separately. It can be realized on the basis of
S/N/F/N/S junction, where the interlayer is composed of two normal metal
regions with a spiral ferromagnet layer sandwiched between them. For the case
of tunnel junctions the measurement of $j_t$ in such a system can provide
direct information about the energy-resolved anomalous Green's function
components describing SRTC and LRTC. (ii) In some cases the exchange
field-suppressed supercurrent can be not only recovered but also enhanced with
respect to its value for non-magnetic junction with the same interface
resistances by the presence of spin-dependent quasiparticle distribution. This
effect is demonstrated for S/N/S junction with magnetic S/N interfaces. In
addition, it is also found that under the considered conditions the dependence
of the Josephson current on temperature can be nontrivial: at first the current
rises upon temperature increasing and only after that starts to decline.
