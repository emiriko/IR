We detected 2.8 bright points (BPs) per Mm$^2$ in the Quiet Sun (QS) with the
New Solar Telescope (NST) at Big Bear Solar Observatory; using the TiO 705.68
nm spectral line, at an angular resolution ~ 0.1'' to obtain 30 min data
sequence. Some BPs formed knots that were stable in time and influenced the
properties of the granulation pattern around them. The observed granulation
pattern within ~ 3'' of knots presents smaller granules than those observed in
a normal granulation pattern; i.e., around the knots a suppressed convection is
detected. Observed BPs covered ~ 5% of the solar surface and were not
homogeneously distributed. BPs had an average size of 0.22'', they were
detectable for 4.28 min in average, and had an averaged contrast of 0.1% in the
deep red TiO spectral line.
