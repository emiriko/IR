In Little Higgs models a collective symmetry prevents the higgs from
acquiring a quadratically divergent mass at one loop. We have previously shown
that the couplings in the Littlest Higgs model introduced to give the top quark
a mass do not naturally respect the collective symmetry. We extend our previous
work showing that the problem is generic: it arises from the fact that the
would be collective symmetry of any one top quark mass term is broken by gauge
interactions.
