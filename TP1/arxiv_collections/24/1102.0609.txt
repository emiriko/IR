The UT1 Intensives results heavily depend on the celestial pole offset (CPO)
model used during data processing. Since accurate CPO values are available with
delay from two to four weeks, CPO predictions are necessarily applied to the
UT1 intensive data analysis, and errors in predictions can influence the
operational UT1 accuracy. In this papers the real accuracy of CPO prediction is
assessed using the actual IERS and PUL predictions made in 2007-2009. Also,
results of operational processing was analyzed to investigate the actual impact
of EOP prediction errors on the rapid UT1 results. It was found that the impact
of CPO prediction errors is at a level of several microseconds, whereas the
impact of the inaccuracy in the polar motion prediction may be about one order
larger for ultra-rapid UT1 results. The situation can be amended if the IERS
Rapid solution will be updated more frequently.
