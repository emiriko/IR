Lattice dynamical methods used to predict phase transformations in crystals
typically deal with harmonic phonon spectra and are therefore not applicable in
important situations where one of the competing crystal structures is unstable
in the harmonic approximation, such as the bcc structure involved in the hcp to
bcc martensitic phase transformation in Ti, Zr and Hf. Here we present an
expression for the free energy that does not suffer from such shortcomings, and
we show by self consistent {\it ab initio} lattice dynamical calculations
(SCAILD), that the critical temperature for the hcp to bcc phase transformation
in Ti, Zr and Hf, can be effectively calculated from the free energy difference
between the two phases. This opens up the possibility to study quantitatively,
from first principles theory, temperature induced phase transitions.
