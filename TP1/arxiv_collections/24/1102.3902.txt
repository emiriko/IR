We analyze Linear Programming (LP) decoding of graphical binary codes
operating over soft-output, symmetric and log-concave channels. We show that
the error-surface, separating domain of the correct decoding from domain of the
erroneous decoding, is a polytope. We formulate the problem of finding the
lowest-weight pseudo-codeword as a non-convex optimization (maximization of a
convex function) over a polytope, with the cost function defined by the channel
and the polytope defined by the structure of the code. This formulation
suggests new provably convergent heuristics for finding the lowest weight
pseudo-codewords improving in quality upon previously discussed. The algorithm
performance is tested on the example of the Tanner [155, 64, 20] code over the
Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel.
