The complex interactions of localized vortices with waves is investigated
using a model of point vortices in the presence of a transverse or longitudinal
wave. This simple model shows a rich dynamical behavior including oscillations
of a dipole, splitting and merging of two like-circulation vortices, and chaos.
The analytical and numerical results of this model have been found to predict
under certain conditions, the behavior of more complex systems, such as the
vortices of the Charney-Hasegawa-Mima equation, where the presence of waves
strongly affects the evolution of large coherent structures.
