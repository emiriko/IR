We report on the realization and optical characterization of a
CMOS-compatible silicon-based microresonator/waveguide coupled system, fully
integrated on a silicon chip. The device uses a vertical coupling scheme
between the resonator and a buried strip waveguide. We demonstrate that its
high optical quality follows from the accurate planarization of the waveguide
topography. More importantly, we demonstrate a wafer-scale mass fabrication of
freestanding planar resonators suspended in air and coupled to the integrated
bus waveguides. A nanometer control of the coupling distances allows for a
precise and selective excitation of different mode families of the resonator.
This opens the door for the realization of stable all-integrated complex
resonator systems for optomechanical and metrological applications, with the
potential to substitute the nowadays intensive use of complicated fiber-taper
coupling schemes.
