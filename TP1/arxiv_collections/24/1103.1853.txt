The first LHC data on high transverse momentum hadron and dijet spectra in
PbPb collisions at center-of-mass energy 2.76 TeV per nucleon pair are analyzed
in the frameworks of PYQUEN jet quenching model. The presented studies for the
nuclear modification factor of high-pT hadrons and the imbalance in dijet
transverse energy support the supposition that the intensive wide-angular
("out-of-cone") medium-induced partonic energy loss is seen in central PbPb
collisions at the LHC.
