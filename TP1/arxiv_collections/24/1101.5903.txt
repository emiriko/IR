We investigated the photoexcited carrier dynamics in Si by using optical pump
and terahertz probe spectroscopy in an energy range between 2 meV and 25 meV.
The formation dynamics of excitons from unbound e-h pairs was studied through
the emergence of the 1s-2p transition of excitons at 12 meV (3 THz). We
revealed the thermalization mechanism of the photo-injected hot carriers
(electrons and holes) in the low temperature lattice system by taking account
of the interband and intraband scattering of carriers with acoustic and optical
phonons. The overall cooling rate of electrons and holes was numerically
calculated on the basis of a microscopic analysis of the phonon scattering
processes, and the results well account for the experimentally observed carrier
cooling dynamics. The long formation time of excitons in Si after the above-gap
photoexcitation is reasonably accounted for by the thermalization process of
photoexcited carriers.
