In this article we offer some modification of Monte-Carlo method for multiple
parametric integral computation and solving of a linear integral Fredholm
equation of a second kind (well posed problem).
  We prove that the rate of convergence of offered method is optimal under
natural conditions still in the uniform norm, and construct an asymptotical and
non-asymptotical confidence region, again in the uniform norm.
