A growing number of previously hidden Galactic X-ray sources are now detected
with recent surveys performed by the Integral and Swift satellites. Most of
these new sources eluded past surveys due to their large local X-ray extinction
and consequent low soft X-ray flux. The Swift-BAT performs daily monitoring of
the sky in an energy band (15-150 keV) which is only marginally affected by
X-ray extinction, thus allowing for the search of long periodicities in the
light curve and identification of the nature of the X-ray sources. We performed
a period search using the folding technique in the Swift-BAT light curves of
three Integral sources: IGR J05007-7047, IGR J13186-6257 and IGR J17354-3255.
Their periodograms show significant peaks at 30.77$\pm$0.01 d, 19.994$\pm$0.01
d and 8.448$\pm$0.002 d, respectively. We estimate the significance of these
features from the chi squared distribution of all the trials, finding a
probability less than 1.5$\times10^{-4}$ that the detections occurred due to
chance. We complement our analysis with the study of their broadband X-ray
emission. We identify the periodicities with the orbital periods of the
sources. The periods are typical for the wind accretors X-ray binaries and we
support this identification showing that also their energy spectra are
compatible with an X-ray spectral emission characteristic of high-mass X-ray
binaries. The spectrum of IGR J05007-704 that resides in the Large Magellanic
Cloud, does not show any intrinsic local absorption, whereas the spectra of the
Galactic sources IGR J17354-3255 and IGR J13186-6257 may be affected by a local
absorber. The folded light curve for IGR J13186-6257 suggests a possible Be
companion star.
