Recent observations of high energy cosmic-ray electrons by the Fermi-LAT and
the HESS experiments between $20$ GeV and $5$ TeV have found that the energy
spectrum closely follow a broken power-law with a break at around $1$ TeV. On
the other hand, measurements of cosmic-ray secondary-to-primary ratios like the
boron-to-carbon ratio seem to indicate a possible change in the slope at
energies around $100$ GeV/n. In this paper, we discuss one possible explanation
for the observed break in the electron spectrum and its possible correlation
with the flattening in the secondary-to-primary ratios at higher energies. In
our model, we assume that cosmic-rays after acceleration by supernova remnant
shock waves, escape downstream of the shock and remain confined within the
remnant until the shock slows down. During this time, the high-energy electrons
suffer from radiative energy losses and the cosmic-ray nuclei undergo nuclear
fragmentations due to their interactions with the matter. Once the cosmic-rays
are released from the supernova remnants, they follow diffusive propagation in
the Galaxy where they further suffer from radiative or fragmentation losses.
