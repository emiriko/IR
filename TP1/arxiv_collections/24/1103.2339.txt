Coherent transport by adiabatic passage has recently been suggested as a
high-fidelity technique to engineer the centre-of-mass state of single atoms in
inhomogenous environments. While the basic theory behind this process is well
understood, several conceptual challenges for its experimental observation have
still to be addressed. One of these is the difficulty that currently available
optical or magnetic micro-trap systems have in adjusting the tunneling rate
time-dependently while keeping resonance between the asymptotic trapping states
at all times. Here we suggest that both requirements can be fulfilled to a very
high degree in an experimentally realistic setup based on radio frequency traps
on atom chips. We show that operations with close to 100% fidelity can be
achieved and that these systems also allow significant improvements for
performing adiabatic passage with interacting atomic clouds.
