We give a direct and simple proof of Touchard's continued fraction, provide
an extension of it, and transform it into similar expansions related to Motzkin
and Schroeder numbers. Another proof is then given that uses only induction. We
use this machinery on two examples that appear in recent papers of
Josuat-Verges; with an additional parameter, these two can be treated
simultaneously.
