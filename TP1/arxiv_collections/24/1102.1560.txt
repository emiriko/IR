The parabolic trigonometric functions have recently been introduced as an
intermediate step between circular and hyperbolic functions. They have been
shown to be expressible in terms of irrational functions, linked to the
solution of third degree algebraic equations. We show the link of the parabolic
trigonometric functions with the Chebyshev radicals and also prove that further
generalized forms of trigonometric functions, providing the natural solutions
of the quintic algebraic equation, can be defined. We also discuss the link of
this family of functions with the modular elliptic functions. 1
