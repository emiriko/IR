The effect of the electron-phonon interaction on magnetization relaxation is
studied within the framework of first-principles scattering theory for Fe, Co,
and Ni by displacing atoms in the scattering region randomly with a thermal
distribution. This "frozen thermal lattice disorder" approach reproduces the
non-monotonic damping behaviour observed in ferromagnetic resonance
measurements and yields reasonable quantitative agreement between calculated
and experimental values. It can be readily applied to alloys and easily
extended by determining the atomic displacements from ab initio phonon spectra.
