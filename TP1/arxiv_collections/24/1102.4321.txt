Polariton formalism is applied for studying the propagation of a probe field
of light in a cloud of cold atoms influenced by two control laser beams of
larger intensity. The laser beams couple resonantly three hyperfine atomic
ground states to a common excited state thus forming a tripod configuration of
the atomic energy levels involved. The first control beam can have an optical
vortex with the intensity of the beam going to zero at the vortex core. The
second control beam without a vortex ensures the loseless (adiabatic)
propagation of the probe beam at a vortex core of the first control laser. We
investigate the storage of the probe pulse into atomic coherences by switching
off the control beams, as well as its subsequent retrieval by switching the
control beams on. The optical vortex is transferred from the control to the
probe fields during the storage or retrieval of the probe field. We analyze
conditions for the vortex to be transferred efficiently to the regenerated
probe beam and discuss possibilities of experimental implementation of the
proposed scheme using atoms like rubidium or sodium.
