The chemotaxis pathway in the bacterium Escherichia coli allows cells to
detect changes in external ligand concentration (e.g. nutrients). The pathway
regulates the flagellated rotary motors and hence the cells' swimming
behaviour, steering them towards more favourable environments. While the
molecular components are well characterised, the motor behaviour measured by
tethered cell experiments has been difficult to interpret. Here, we study the
effects of sensing and signalling noise on the motor behaviour. Specifically,
we consider fluctuations stemming from ligand concentration, receptor switching
between their signalling states, adaptation, modification of proteins by
phosphorylation, and motor switching between its two rotational states. We
develop a model which includes all signalling steps in the pathway, and discuss
a simplified version, which captures the essential features of the full model.
We find that the noise characteristics of the motor contain signatures from all
these processes, albeit with varying magnitudes. This allows us to address how
cell-to-cell variation affects motor behaviour and the question of optimal
pathway design. A similar comprehensive analysis can be applied to other
two-component signalling pathways.
