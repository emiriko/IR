We use spatially resolved long-slit spectroscopy from Magellan to investigate
the extent, kinematics, and ionization structure in the narrow-line regions of
15 luminous, obscured quasars with z<0.5. Increasing the dynamic range in
luminosity by an order of magnitude, as well as improving the depth of existing
observations by a similar factor, we revisit relations between narrow-line
region size and the luminosity and linewidth of the narrow emission lines. We
find a slope of 0.22 +/- 0.04 for the power-law relationship between size and
luminosity, suggesting that the nebulae are limited by availability of gas to
ionize at these luminosities. In fact, we find that the active galactic nucleus
is effectively ionizing the interstellar medium over the full extent of the
host galaxy. Broad (~300-1000 km/s) linewidths across the galaxies reveal that
the gas is kinematically disturbed. Furthermore, the rotation curves and
velocity dispersions of the ionized gas remain constant out to large distances,
in striking contrast to normal and starburst galaxies. We argue that the gas in
the entire host galaxy is significantly disturbed by the central active
galactic nucleus. While only ~10^7-10^8 M_sun worth of gas are directly
observed to be leaving the host galaxies at or above their escape velocities,
these estimates are likely lower limits because of the biases in both mass and
outflow velocity measurements and may in fact be in accord with expectations
from recent feedback models. Additionally, we report the discovery of two dual
obscured quasars, one of which is blowing a large-scale (~10 kpc) bubble of
ionized gas into the intergalactic medium.
