The linear-algebraic lambda-calculus and the algebraic lambda-calculus are
untyped lambda-calculi extended with arbitrary linear combinations of terms.
The former presents the axioms of linear algebra in the form of a rewrite
system, while the latter uses equalities. When given by rewrites, algebraic
lambda-calculi are not confluent unless further restrictions are added. We
provide a type system for the linear-algebraic lambda-calculus enforcing strong
normalisation, which gives back confluence. The type system allows an abstract
interpretation in System F.
