We introduce a new method to simulate the physics of rare events. The method,
an extension of the Temperature Accelerated Molecular Dynamics, comes in use
when the collective variables introduced to characterize the rare events are
either non-analytical or so complex that computing their derivative is not
practical. We illustrate the functioning of the method by studying the
homogeneous crystallization in a sample of Lennard-Jones particles. The process
is studied by introducing a new collective variable that we call Effective
Nucleus Size $\mathcal N$. We have computed the free energy barriers and the
size of critical nucleus, which result in agreement with data available in
literature. We have also performed simulations in the liquid domain of the
phase diagram. We found a free energy curve monotonically growing with the
nucleus size, consistent with the liquid domain.
