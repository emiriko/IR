The OPERA experiment is based on a hybrid technology combining electronic
detectors and nuclear emulsions. OPERA collected muon-neutrino interactions
during the 2008 and 2009 physics runs of the CNGS neutrino beam, produced at
CERN with an energy range of about 5-35 GeV. A total of $5.3 \times 10^{19}$
protons on target equivalent luminosity has been analysed with the OPERA
electronic detectors: scintillator strips target trackers and magnetic muon
spectrometers equipped with resistive plate gas chambers and drift tubes,
allowing a detailed reconstruction of muon-neutrino interactions. Charged
Current (CC) and Neutral Current (NC) interactions are identified, using the
measurements in the electronic detectors, and the NC/CC ratio is computed. The
momentum distribution and the charge of the muon tracks produced in CC
interactions are analysed. Calorimetric measurements of the visible energy are
performed for both the CC and NC samples. For CC events the Bjorken-$y$
distribution and the hadronic shower profile are computed. The results are
compared to a detailed Monte Carlo simulation of the electronic detectors'
response.
