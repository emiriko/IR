We collect some general results on graph limits associated to hereditary
classes of graphs. As examples, we consider some classes defined by forbidden
subgraphs and some classes of intersection graphs, including triangle-free
graphs, chordal graphs, cographs, interval graphs, unit interval graphs,
threshold graphs, and line graphs.
