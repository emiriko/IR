We have developed a radiative transfer code, CMFGEN, which allows us to model
the spectra of massive stars and supernovae. Using CMFGEN we can derive
fundamental parameters such as effective temperatures and surface gravities,
derive abundances, and place constraints on stellar wind properties. The last
of these is important since all massive stars are losing mass via a stellar
wind that is driven from the star by radiation pressure, and this mass loss can
substantially influence the spectral appearance and evolution of the star.
Recently we have extended CMFGEN to allow us to undertake time-dependent
radiative transfer calculations of supernovae. Such calculations will be used
to place constraints on the supernova progenitor, to place constraints on the
supernova explosion and nucleosynthesis, and to derive distances using a
physical approach called the "Expanding Photosphere Method". We describe the
assumptions underlying the code and the atomic processes involved. A crucial
ingredient in the code is the atomic data. For the modeling we require accurate
transition wavelengths, oscillator strengths, photoionization cross-sections,
collision strengths, autoionization rates, and charge exchange rates for
virtually all species up to, and including, cobalt. Presently, the available
atomic data varies substantially in both quantity and quality.
