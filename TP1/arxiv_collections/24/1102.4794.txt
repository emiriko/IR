In this work, conditional entropy is used to quantify the information loss
induced by passing a continuous random variable through a memoryless nonlinear
input-output system. We derive an expression for the information loss depending
on the input density and the nonlinearity and show that the result is strongly
related to the non-injectivity of the considered system. Tight upper bounds are
presented, which can be evaluated with less difficulty than a direct evaluation
of the information loss, which involves the logarithm of a sum. Application of
our results is illustrated on a set of examples.
