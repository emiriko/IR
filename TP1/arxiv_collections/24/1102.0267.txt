The capacity region of the 2-user multi-input multi-output (MIMO) Gaussian
interference channel (IC) is characterized to within a constant gap that is
independent of the channel matrices for the general case of the MIMO IC with an
arbitrary number of antennas at each node. An achievable rate region and an
outer bound to the capacity region of a class of interference channels were
obtained in previous work by Telatar and Tse as unions over all possible input
distributions. In contrast to that previous work on the MIMO IC, a simple and
an explicit achievable coding scheme are obtained here and shown to have the
constant-gap-to-capacity property and in which the sub-rates of the common and
private messages of each user are explicitly specified for each achievable rate
pair. The constant-gap-to-capacity results are thus proved in this work by
first establishing explicit upper and lower bounds to the capacity region. A
reciprocity result is also proved which is that the capacity of the reciprocal
MIMO IC is within a constant gap of the capacity region of the forward MIMO IC.
