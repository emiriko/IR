Recent observations have revealed that 8% of linear polarization patches in
the internetwork quiet Sun are fully embedded in downflows. These are not
easily explained with the typical scenarios for the source of internetwork
fields which rely on flux emergence from below. We explore using radiative MHD
simulations a scenario where magnetic flux is transported from the magnetic
canopy overlying the internetwork into the photosphere by means of downward
plumes associated with convective overshoot. We find that if a canopy-like
magnetic field is present in the simulation, the transport of flux from the
canopy is an important process for seeding the photospheric layers of the
internetwork with magnetic field. We propose that this mechanism is relevant
for the Sun as well, and it could naturally explain the observed internetwork
linear polarization patches entirely embedded in downflows.
