Light front form of the relativization of the deuteron wave function is
considered. Parametars of the wave function are extracted comparing theoretical
results with experimental data. Experimental data are obtained on the two-metre
propane bubble chamber of JINR (Dubna) bombarded by the deutron beam with
momentum of 4.2 GeV/c/nucleon
