We present an analysis of observations made with the Arcminute Microkelvin
Imager (AMI) and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) of six galaxy
clusters in a redshift range of 0.16--0.41. The cluster gas is modelled using
the Sunyaev--Zel'dovich (SZ) data provided by AMI, while the total mass is
modelled using the lensing data from the CFHT. In this paper, we: i) find very
good agreement between SZ measurements (assuming large-scale virialisation and
a gas-fraction prior) and lensing measurements of the total cluster masses out
to r_200; ii) perform the first multiple-component weak-lensing analysis of
A115; iii) confirm the unusual separation between the gas and mass components
in A1914; iv) jointly analyse the SZ and lensing data for the relaxed cluster
A611, confirming our use of a simulation-derived mass-temperature relation for
parameterizing measurements of the SZ effect.
