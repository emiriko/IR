The anisotropic phase-field crystal model recently proposed and used by
Prieler et al. [J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 21, 464110 (2009)] is derived from
microscopic density functional theory for anisotropic particles with fixed
orientation. Further its morphology diagram is explored. In particular we
investigated the influence of anisotropy and undercooling on the process of
nucleation and microstructure formation from atomic to the microscale. To that
end numerical simulations were performed varying those dimensionless parameters
which represent anisotropy and undercooling in our anisotropic phase-field
crystal (APFC) model. The results from these numerical simulations are
summarized in terms of a morphology diagram of the stable state phase. These
stable phases are also investigated with respect to their kinetics and
characteristic morphological features.
