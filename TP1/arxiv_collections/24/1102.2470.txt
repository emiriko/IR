We point out that in higher dimensions, in contrast to the one dimensional
case considered usually, Bloch oscillation driven by a static force can induce
transport of the wave packet. The wave packet oscillates constantly, but on a
larger time scale it drifts at a constant velocity permanently. As a noteworthy
feature, the net transport in the long run is always normal to the external
force and thus controlled by it. We verify this prediction numerically and
discuss its experimental realization both with cold atoms in optical lattices
and with two dimensional photonic lattices.
