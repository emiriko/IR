We investigate the effect that the usually large errors associated with
ground-based proper motion (PM) components have on the determination of a star
cluster's velocity dispersion (\sv). Rather than histograms, we work with PM
distribution functions (PMDFs), taking the $1\sigma$ uncertainties formally
into account. In this context, a cluster's intrinsic PMDF is broadened by the
error distribution function (eDF) that, given the average error amplitude, has
a width usually comparable to the cluster PMDF. Thus, we apply a
Richardson-Lucy (RL) deconvolution to the PMDFs of a set of relatively nearby
and populous open clusters (OCs), using the eDFs as point spread functions
(PSFs). The OCs are NGC\,1039 (M\,34), NGC\,2477, NGC\,2516, NGC\,2682 (M\,67),
and NGC\,7762. The deconvolved PMDFs are approximately Gaussian in shape, with
dispersions lower than the observed ones by a factor of 4-10. NGC\,1039 and
NGC\,2516, the nearest OCs of the sample, have deconvolved \sv\ compatible with
those of bound OCs of mass $\sim10^3$\,\ms. NGC\,2477 and NGC\,2682 have
deconvolved PMDFs with a secondary bump, shifted towards higher average
velocities, which may be an artefact of the RL deconvolution when applied to
asymmetric profiles. Alternatively, it may originate from cluster merger,
large-scale mass segregation or, least probably, binaries.
