Using an effective field theory approach, we study the new physics (NP)
corrections to muon and beta decays and their effects on the extractions of
V_ud and V_us. Assuming nearly flavor blind NP interactions we find that the
CKM-unitarity test is the only way to expose NP. The four short-distance
operators that can generate a deviation are strongly constrained by the
phenomenological bound |Vud|^2 + |Vus|^2 + |Vub|^2 - 1 = (-0.0001 \pm 0.0006),
corresponding to an effective scale > 11 TeV (90% CL). Depending on the
operator, this constraint is at the same level or better than that generated by
the Z pole observables.
