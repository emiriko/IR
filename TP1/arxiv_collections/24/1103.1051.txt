Using molecular dynamics simulation, we investigate the dynamics of stacking
faults in fcc crystals in uniaxial stretching in a Lennard-Jones binary mixture
composed of 4096 particles in three dimensions. We visualize stacking faults
using a disorder variable $D_j(t)$ for each particle $j$ constructed from local
bond order parameters based on spherical harmonics (Steinhardt order
parameters). Also introducing a method of bond breakage, we examine how
stacking faults are formed and removed by collective particle motions. These
processes are relevant in plasticity of fcc crystals.
