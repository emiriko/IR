The electric resistance between two arbitrary nodes on any infinite lattice
structure of resistors that is a periodic tiling of space is obtained. Our
general approach is based on the lattice Green's function of the Laplacian
matrix associated with the network. We present several non-trivial examples to
show how efficient our method is. Deriving explicit resistance formulas it is
shown that the Kagom\'e, the diced and the decorated lattice can be mapped to
the triangular and square lattice of resistors. Our work can be extended to the
random walk problem or to electron dynamics in condensed matter physics.
