Pair production due to the Schwinger mechanism is modeled in a
self-consistent approach taking into account the backreaction of the created
particles on the field. The model uses the Boltzmann kinetic equation for the
electrons and positrons and the Maxwell equations for the electromagnetic
field, which are solved numerically in a certain approximation for the case of
the linearly polarized plane wave collision. The results indicate three main
stages of the collision process: the acceleration of particles, the
deceleration of particles, and plasma oscillations. A linear equation
describing the oscillations is obtained, the oscillation frequency is related
to the frequency of the quasinormal mode of the plasma with the least damping.
It is also shown that the oscillation frequency is of the order of the plasma
frequency.
