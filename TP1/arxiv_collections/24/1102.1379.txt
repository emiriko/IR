Functional networks of complex systems are obtained from the analysis of the
temporal activity of their components, and are often used to infer their
unknown underlying connectivity. We obtain the equations relating topology and
function in a system of diffusively delay-coupled elements in complex networks.
We solve exactly the resulting equations in motifs (directed structures of
three nodes), and in directed networks. The mean-field solution for directed
uncorrelated networks shows that the clusterization of the activity is
dominated by the in-degree of the nodes, and that the locking frequency
decreases with increasing average degree. We find that the exponent of a power
law degree distribution of the structural topology, b, is related to the
exponent of the associated functional network as a =1/(2-b), for b < 2.
