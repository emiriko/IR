Mathieu Bouville's "Why is cheating wrong?" (Studies in Philosophy and
Education, 29(1), 67-76, 2010) misses the mark by failing to consider the
longer term consequences of cheating on student character development and
longer term societal consequences of undermining professional expertise and
trust in disciplines where an earned degree is an essential part of
professional certification and qualifications. Educators who turn a blind eye
to student cheating are cheating the public by failing to deliver on the
promise of graduates who genuinely earned their degrees.
