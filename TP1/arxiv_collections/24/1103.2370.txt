We report observations of two consecutive transits of the warm super-Earth
exoplanet GJ1214b at 3.6 and 4.5 microns with the Infrared Array Camera
instrument on-board the Spitzer Space Telescope. The two transit light curves
allow for the determination of the transit parameters for this system. We find
these paremeters to be consistent with the previously determined values and no
evidence for transit timing variations. The main investigation consists of
measuring the transit depths in each bandpass to constrain the planet's
transmission spectrum. Fixing the system scale and impact parameters, we
measure R_p/R_star=0.1176 (+0.0008/-0.0009) and 0.1163 (+0.0010/-0.0008) at 3.6
and 4.5 microns, respectively. Combining these data with the previously
reported MEarth Observatory measurements in the red optical yields constraints
on the GJ1214b's transmission spectrum and allows us to rule-out a cloud-free,
solar composition (i.e., hydrogen-dominated) atmosphere at 4.5 sigma
confidence. This independently confirms a recent finding that was based on a
measurement of the planet's transmission spectrum using the VLT. The Spitzer,
MEarth, and VLT observations together yield a remarkably flat transmission
spectrum over the large wavelength domain spanned by the data. Consequently,
cloud-free atmospheric models require more than 30% metals (assumed to be in
the form of H2O by volume to be consistent with all the observations.
