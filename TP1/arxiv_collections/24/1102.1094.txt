We analyze splitting algorithms for a class of two-dimensional fluid
equations, which includes the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the
surface quasi-geostrophic equation. Our main result is that the Godunov and
Strang splitting methods converge with the expected rates provided the initial
data are sufficiently regular.
