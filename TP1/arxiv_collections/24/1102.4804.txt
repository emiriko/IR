The Ehrhart ring of the edge polytope $\mathcal{P}_G$ for a connected simple
graph $G$ is known to coincide with the edge ring of the same graph if $G$
satisfies the odd cycle condition. This paper gives for a graph which does not
satisfy the condition, a generating set of the defining ideal of the Ehrhart
ring of the edge polytope, described by combinatorial information of the graph.
From this result, two factoring properties of the Ehrhart series are obtained;
the first one factors out bipartite biconnected components, and the second one
factors out a even cycle which shares only one edge with other part of the
graph. As an application of the factoring properties, the root distribution of
Ehrhart polynomials for bipartite polygon trees is determined.
