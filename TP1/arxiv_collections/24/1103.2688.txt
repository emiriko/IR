By using exclusively the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and X-ray surface
brightness data from 25 galaxy clusters in the redshift range 0.023< z < 0.784
we access cosmic acceleration employing a kinematic description. Such result is
fully independent on the validity of any metric gravity theory, the possible
matter-energy contents filling the Universe, as well as on the SNe Ia Hubble
diagram.
