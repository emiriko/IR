We calculate direct gaugino pair production at hadron colliders at
next-to-leading order of perturbative QCD, resumming simultaneously large
logarithms in the small transverse-momentum and threshold regions to
next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. Numerical predictions are presented for
transverse momentum and invariant mass spectra as well as for total cross
sections and compared to results obtained at fixed order and with pure
transverse-momentum and threshold resummation. We find that our new results are
in general in good agreement with the previous ones, but often even more
precise.
