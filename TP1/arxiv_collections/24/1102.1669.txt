The problem of self-trapping of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and a binary
BEC in an optical lattice (OL) and double well (DW) is studied using the
mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii equation. For both DW and OL, permanent
self-trapping occurs in a window of the repulsive nonlinearity $g$ of the GP
equation: $g_{c1}<g<g_{c2}$. In case of OL, the critical nonlinearities
$g_{c1}$ and $g_{c2}$ correspond to a window of chemical potentials
$\mu_{c1}<\mu<\mu_{c2}$ defining the band gap(s) of the periodic OL. The
permanent self-trapped BEC in an OL usually represents a breathing oscillation
of a stable stationary gap soliton. The permanent self-trapped BEC in a DW, on
the other hand, is a dynamically stabilized state without any stationary
counterpart. For a binary BEC with intraspecies nonlinearities outside this
window of nonlinearity, a permanent self trapping can be induced by tuning the
interspecies interaction such that the effective nonlinearities of the
components fall in the above window.
