The technicolor scenario replaces the Higgs sector of the standard model with
a strongly interacting sector. One candidate for a realization of such a sector
is two-technicolor Yang-Mills theory coupled to two degenerate flavors of
adjoint, massless techniquarks. Using lattice gauge theory the properties of
the technigluons in this scenario are investigated as a function of the
techniquark mass towards the massless limit. For that purpose the minimal
Landau gauge two-point and three-point correlation functions are determined,
including a detailed systematic error analysis. The results are, within the
relatively large systematic uncertainties, compatible with a behavior very
similar to QCD at finite techniquark mass. However, the limit of massless
techniquarks exhibits features which could be compatible with a
(quasi-)conformal behavior.
