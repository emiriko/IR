This paper develops a flexible methodology to analyze the effectiveness of
different variables on various dependent variables which all are times series
and especially shows how to use a time series regression on one of the most
important and primary index (page views per visit) on Google analytic and in
conjunction it shows how to use the most suitable data to gain a more accurate
result. Search engine visitors have a variety of impact on page views which
cannot be described by single regression. On one hand referral visitors are
well-fitted on linear regression with low impact. On the other hand, direct
visitors made a huge impact on page views. The higher connection speed does not
simply imply higher impact on page views and the content of web page and the
territory of visitors can help connection speed to describe user behavior.
Returning visitors have some similarities with direct visitors.
