In this paper, we give an explicit combinatorial realization of the crystal
B(\lambda) for an irreducible highest weight U_q(q(n))-module V(\lambda) in
terms of semistandard decomposition tableaux. We present an insertion scheme
for semistandard decomposition tableaux and give algorithms of decomposing the
tensor product of q(n)-crystals. Consequently, we obtain explicit combinatorial
descriptions of the shifted Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.
