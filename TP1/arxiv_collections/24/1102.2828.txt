Algebras axiomatized entirely by rank 1 axioms are algebras for a functor and
thus the free algebras can be obtained by a direct limit process. Dually, the
final coalgebras can be obtained by an inverse limit process. In order to
explore the limits of this method we look at Heyting algebras which have mixed
rank 0-1 axiomatizations. We will see that Heyting algebras are special in that
they are almost rank 1 axiomatized and can be handled by a slight variant of
the rank 1 coalgebraic methods.
