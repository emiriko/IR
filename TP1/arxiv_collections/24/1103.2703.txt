We extend standard Markovian open quantum systems (quantum channels) by
allowing for Hamiltonian controls and elucidate their geometry in terms of Lie
semigroups. For standard dissipative interactions with the environment and
different coherent controls, we particularly specify the tangent cones (Lie
wedges) of the respective Lie semigroups of quantum channels. These cones are
the counterpart of the infinitesimal generator of a single one-parameter
semigroup. They comprise all directions the underlying open quantum system can
be steered to and thus give insight into the geometry of controlled open
quantum dynamics. Such a differential characterisation is highly valuable for
approximating reachable sets of given initial quantum states in a plethora of
experimental implementations.
