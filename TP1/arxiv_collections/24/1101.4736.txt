We calculate the Wigner (quasi)probability distribution function of the
quantum optical elliptical vortex (QEV), generated by coupling squeezed vacuum
states of two modes. The coupling between the two modes is performed by using
beam splitter (BS) or a dual channel directional coupler (DCDC). The quantum
interference due to the coupling between the two modes promises the generation
of controlled entanglement for quantum computation and quantum tomography. We
compute the entanglement of such QEV formed by non-classical radiation field,
using Wigner function. We report a critical squeezing parameter above which the
entanglement is less for higher vorticity, which is counter intuitive.
