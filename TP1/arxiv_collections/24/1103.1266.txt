The forward-backward asymmetry $A_{FB}$ in top quark pair production,
measured at the Tevatron, is probably related to the contribution of new
particles. The Tevatron result is more than a $2\sigma$ deviation from the
standard model prediction and motivates the application of alternative models
introducing new states.
  However, as the standard model predictions for the total cross section
$\sigma_{tt}$ and invariant mass distribution $M_{tt}$ for this process are in
good agreement with experiments, any alternative model must reproduce these
predictions. These models can be placed into two categories: One introduces the
s-channel exchange of new vector bosons with chiral couplings to the light
quarks and to the top quark and another relies on the t-channel exchange of
particles with large flavor-violating couplings in the quark sector. In this
work we employ a model which introduces both s- and t-channel nonstandard
contributions for the top quark pair production in proton antiproton
collisions. We use the minimal version of the $SU(3)_C \otimes SU(3)_L \otimes
U (1)_X$ model (3-3-1 model) that predicts the existence of a new neutral gauge
boson, called $Z^\prime$. This gauge boson has both flavor-changing couplings
to up and top quarks and chiral coupling to the light quarks and to the top
quark. This very peculiar model coupling can correct the $A_{FB}$ for top quark
pair production for two ranges of $Z^\prime$ mass while leading to cross
section and invariant mass distribution quite similar to the standard model
ones. This result reinforces the role of the 3-3-1 model for any new physics
effect.
