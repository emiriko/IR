Large single crystals of the new compound SrMn$_2$V$_2$O$_8$ have been grown
by the floating-zone method. This transition-metal based oxide is isostructural
to SrNi$_2$V$_2$O$_8$, described by the tetragonal space group $I4_1cd$.
Magnetic properties were investigated by means of susceptibility,
magnetization, and specific heat measurements. The title compound behaves like
a one-dimensional magnetic system above the ordering temperature ($T_N$ = 43
K). The magnetic ground state can be described as a classical long-range
ordered antiferromagnet with weak anisotropy.
