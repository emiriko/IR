Simulation of arterial stenting procedures prior to intervention allows for
appropriate device selection as well as highlights potential complications. To
this end, we present a framework for facilitating virtual aortic stenting from
a contrast computer tomography (CT) scan. More specifically, we present a
method for both lumen and outer wall segmentation that may be employed in
determining both the appropriateness of intervention as well as the selection
and localization of the device. The more challenging recovery of the outer wall
is based on a novel minimal closure tracking algorithm. Our aortic segmentation
method has been validated on over 3000 multiplanar reformatting (MPR) planes
from 50 CT angiography data sets yielding a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC)
of 90.67%.
