A field-theory-based approach to pion photoproduction off the nucleon is used
to derive a microscopically consistent formulation of the fully dressed
electromagnetic nucleon current in an effective Lagrangian formalism. It is
shown how the rigorous implementation of local gauge invariance at all levels
of the reaction dynamics provides equations that lend themselves to practically
manageable truncations of the underlying nonlinearities of the problem. The
requirement of consistency also suggests a novel way of treating the pion
photoproduction problem. Guided by a phenomenological implementation of gauge
invariance for the truncated equations that has proved successful for pion
photoproduction, an expression for the fully dressed nucleon current is given
that satisfies the Ward-Takahashi identity for a fully dressed nucleon
propagator as a matter of course. Possible applications include meson photo-
and electroproduction processes, bremsstrahlung, Compton scattering, and $ee'$
processes off nucleons.
