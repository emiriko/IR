This is the first nontrivial construction to date of instantons over a
compact manifold with holonomy exactly $G_2$. The HYM connections on
asymptotically stable bundles over Kovalev's noncompact Calabi-Yau 3-folds,
obtained in the first article, are glued compatibly with a twisted connected
sum, to produce a $G_2-$instanton over the resulting compact 7-manifold. This
is accomplished under a nondegeneracy acyclic assumption on the bundle `at
infinity', which occurs e.g. over certain projective varieties $X_{22}$ in
$\mathbb{C}P^{13}$ equipped with an asymptotically rigid bundle.
