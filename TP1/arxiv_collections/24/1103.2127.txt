The forward-backward asymmetry $A_{FB}^{t\bar t}$ in top quark production at
the Tevatron has been observed to be anomalously large by both CDF and D0. It
has been suggested that a model with a $W'$ coupling to $td$ and $ub$ might
explain this anomaly, and other anomalies in $B$ mesons. Single-top-quark
production in this model is large, and arguably in conflict with Tevatron
measurements. However the model might still be viable if $A_{FB}^{t\bar t}$ is
somewhat smaller than its current measured central value. We show that even
with smaller couplings, the model can be discovered (or strongly excluded) at
the LHC using the 2010 data sets. We find that a suitable charge-asymmetry
measurement is a powerful tool that can be used to constrain this and other
sources of anomalous single-top production, and perhaps other new high-energy
charge-asymmetric processes.
