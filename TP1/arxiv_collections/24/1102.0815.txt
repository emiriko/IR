The annual modulation signal observed by the DAMA-LIBRA Collaboration (D-L)
may plausibly be explained as a consequence of energy deposited in the NaI(Tl)
crystals by cosmic ray muons penetrating the detector. Delayed pulses in the
approximate energy range of interest have been observed as a sequel to energy
deposited by UV irradiation. The same behavior may be reasonably expected to
occur for energy deposited by any source of ionization or excitation. D-L can
test this hypothesis by searching for time correlations between muon events and
pulses in modulation energy range in current data, and by renewed operation of
the array at a sufficiently low temperature that would freeze out the
phenomenon.
