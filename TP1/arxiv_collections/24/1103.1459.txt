We report clear observations of the magnetic Meissner effect in arrays of
superconducting 4 {\AA} carbon nanotubes grown in the linear channels of
AlPO4-5 (AFI) zeolite single crystals. Both bulk magnetization and magnetic
torque experiments show a clear signature of the lower critical Hc1 transition,
a pronounced difference in zero-field cooled and field cooled branches during
temperature sweeps below 6K, and signatures of 1D superconducting fluctuations
below ~15-18 K. These experiments extend the magnetic phase diagram we obtained
previously by resistive experiments [Z. Wang et al., Phys. Rev. B 81, 174530
(2010)] towards low magnetic fields and within the range of zero resistance.
