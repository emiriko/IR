Supermassive black holes have been detected in all galaxies that contain
bulge components when the galaxies observed were close enough so that the
searches were feasible. Together with the observation that bigger black holes
live in bigger bulges, this has led to the belief that black hole growth and
bulge formation regulate each other. That is, black holes and bulges
"coevolve". Therefore, reports of a similar correlation between black holes and
the dark matter halos in which visible galaxies are embedded have profound
implications. Dark matter is likely to be nonbaryonic, so these reports suggest
that unknown, exotic physics controls black hole growth. Here we show - based
in part on recent measurements of bulgeless galaxies - that there is almost no
correlation between dark matter and parameters that measure black holes unless
the galaxy also contains a bulge. We conclude that black holes do not correlate
directly with dark matter. They do not correlate with galaxy disks, either.
Therefore black holes coevolve only with bulges. This simplifies the puzzle of
their coevolution by focusing attention on purely baryonic processes in the
galaxy mergers that make bulges.
