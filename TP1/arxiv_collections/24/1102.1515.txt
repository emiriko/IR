Graphene oxide (GO) is one of chemically modified graphenes and has been
extensively investigated worldwide. A monolayer sheet of GO can be chemically
produced in solution and it has been expected to be adaptable to a wide variety
of applications. Most of works have focused on fabrication and reduction
processes of GO, while its intrinsic property has not been explored in detail.
We have succeeded in fabricating large scale GO nanosheets reproducibly. In the
present work, we observed GO nanosheets by conductive atomic force microscopy.
The current image is useful to monitor the GO thickness as well as wrinkles and
folds in the nanosheet with high contrast. In addition to the current images,
local I-V characteristics of the GO sheet were measured with the conductive
cantilever. Based on the applied electric filed dependence, the conduction
normal to the GO sheet could be described in terms of Poole Frenkel emission
mechanism and the relative permittivity of GO is evaluated to be 4.8.
