We study the method for generating the initial data of black hole systems in
Gauss-Bonnet (GB) gravity. The initial data are assumed to be momentarily
static and conformally flat. Although the equation for the conformal factor is
highly nonlinear, it is successfully solved by numerical relaxation for
one-black-hole and two-black-hole systems. The common apparent horizon is
studied in the two-black-hole initial data, and the result suggests that the
Penrose inequalities are satisfied in this system. This is the first step for
simulating black hole collisions in higher-curvature theories.
