We review some major open issues in the current modelling of low and
intermediate mass, main sequence stars based on seismological studies. The
solar case was discussed in a companion paper, here several issues specific to
other stars than the Sun are illustrated with a few stars observed with CoRoT
and expectations from Kepler data.
