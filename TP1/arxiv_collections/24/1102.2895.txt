We report the experimental realisation of a versatile ring trap for ultracold
atoms. The ring geometry is created by the time-averaged adiabatic potential
resulting from the application of an oscillating magnetic bias field to a rf
dressed quadrupole trap. Lifetimes for a Bose-Einstein condensate in the ring
exceed 11s and the ring radius was continuously varied from 50$\mu$m to
261$\mu$m. An efficient method of loading the ring from a conventional TOP trap
is presented together with a rotation scheme which introduces angular momentum
into the system. The ring presents an opportunity to study the superfluid
properties of a condensate in a multiply connected geometry and also has
applications for matter-wave interferometry.
