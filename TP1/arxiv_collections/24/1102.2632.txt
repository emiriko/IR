Fluorescent detection of proteins is a popular method of detection allying
sensitivity, linearity and compatibility with mass spectrometry. Among the
numerous methods described in the literature, staining with ruthenium II
tris(bathophenanthroline disulfonate) is particularly cost-effective, but
slightly cumbersome owing to difficulties in the preparation of the complex and
complexity of staining protocols. We describe here the modifications on both
aspects that allow to perform a higher contrast staining and offer a more
robust method of complex preparation, thereby maximizing the advantages of the
method.
