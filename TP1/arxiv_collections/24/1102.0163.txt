In order to find the selection rules that can be applied to the
electromagnetic transitions when the chiral geometry is achieved, a model for a
special configuration in triaxial odd-odd nuclei is constructed which exhibits
degenerate chiral bands with a sizable rotation. A quantum number obtained from
the invariance of the Hamiltonian is given and the selection rule for
electromagnetic transition probabilities in chiral bands is derived in terms of
this quantum number. Among the available candidates for chiral bands of odd-odd
nuclei, in which the near degeneracy of two $\Delta I = 1$ bands is observed,
the measured electromagnetic properties of the two bands in
$^{128}_{55}$Cs$_{73}$ and $^{126}_{55}$Cs$_{71}$ are consistent with the
rules, while those of $^{134}_{59}$Pr$_{75}$ and $^{132}_{57}$La$_{75}$ are
not.
