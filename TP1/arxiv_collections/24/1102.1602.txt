The use of Sonic Crystals as environmental noise barriers has certain
advantages from the acoustical and the constructive point of view with regard
to conventional ones. One aspect do not studied yet is the acoustic interaction
between the Sonic Crystals and the ground due to, up to now, this latter is not
included in the analytical models used to characterize these Sonic Crystals. We
present here an analytical model, based on multiple scattering theory, to study
this interaction considering the ground as a finite impedance surface. Using
this model we have obtained interesting conclusions that allow to design more
effectively noise screens based on Sonic Crystals. The obtained results have
been compared with experimental and numerical, finding a good agreement between
them.
