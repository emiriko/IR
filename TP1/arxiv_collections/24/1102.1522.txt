The Standard Model (SM) plus a real gauge-singlet scalar field dubbed darkon
(SM+D) is the simplest model possessing a weakly interacting massive particle
(WIMP) dark-matter candidate. In this model, the parameters are constrained
from dark matter relic density and direct searches. The fact that interaction
between darkon and SM particles is only mediated by Higgs boson exchange may
lead to significant modifications to the Higgs boson properties. If the dark
matter mass is smaller than a half of the Higgs boson mass, the Higgs boson can
decay into a pair of darkons resulting in a large invisible branching ratio.
The Higgs boson will be searched for at the LHC and may well be discovered in
the near future. If a Higgs boson with a small invisible decay width will be
found, the SM+D model with small dark matter mass will be in trouble. We find
that by extending the SM+D to a two-Higgs-doublet model plus a darkon (THDM+D)
it is possible to have a Higgs boson with a small invisible branching ratio and
at the same time the dark matter can have a low mass. We also comment on other
implications of this model.
