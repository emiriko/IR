We propose that neutron emission from Cen A dominates the cosmic ray sky at
the high end of the spectrum. Neutrons that are able to decay generate proton
diffusion fronts, whereas those that survive decay produce a spike in the
direction of the source. We use recent data reported by the Pierre Auger
Collaboration to normalize the injection spectrum and estimate the required
luminosity in cosmic rays. We find that such a luminosity, L_{CR} ~ 5 x 10^{40}
erg/s, is considerably smaller than the bolometric luminosity of Cen A, L_{bol}
~ 10^{43} erg/s. We compute the incoming current flux density as viewed by an
observer on Earth and show that the anisotropy amplitude is in agreement with
data at the 1\sigma level. Regardless of the underlying source model, our
results indicate that after a decade of data taking the Pierre Auger
Observatory will be able to test our proposal.
