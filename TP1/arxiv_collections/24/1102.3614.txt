Using a recent result of C. De Lellis and L. Sz\'{e}kelyhidi Jr. we show
that, in the case of periodic boundary conditions and for dimension greater or
equal 2, there exist infinitely many global weak solutions to the
incompressible Euler equations with initial data $v_0$, where $v_0$ may be any
solenoidal $L^2$-vectorfield. In addition, the energy of these solutions is
bounded in time.
