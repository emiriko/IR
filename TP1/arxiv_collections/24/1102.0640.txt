We study the rotational properties of a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate
confined in a quasi-two- dimensional anisotropic trap, for an arbitrary
orientation of the dipoles with respect to their plane of motion. Within the
mean-field approximation we find that the lowest-energy state of the system
depends strongly on the relative strength between the dipolar and the contact
interactions, as well as on the size and the orientation of the dipoles, and
the size and the orientation of the deformation of the trapping potential.
