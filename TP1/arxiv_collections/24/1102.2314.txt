The magnetotransport properties of high mobility two dimensional electron gas
have recently attracted a significant interest due to the discovery of
microwave induced zero resistance states. Here we show experimentally that
microwave irradiation with a photon energy much smaller than the spacing
between Landau levels can induce a strong decrease in the four terminal
resistance. This effect is not predicted by the bulk transport models
introduced to explain zero resistance states, but can be naturally explained by
an edge transport model. This highlights the importance of edge channels for
zero resistance state physics that was proposed recently.
