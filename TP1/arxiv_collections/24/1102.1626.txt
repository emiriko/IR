The geometric Spin Hall Effect of Light (geometric SHEL) amounts to a
polarization-dependent positional shift when a light beam is observed from a
reference frame tilted with respect to its direction of propagation. Motivated
by this intriguing phenomenon, the energy density of the light beam is
decomposed into its Cartesian components in the tilted reference frame. This
illustrates the occurrence of the characteristic shift and the significance of
the effective response function of the detector.
  We introduce the concept of a tilted polarizing interface and provide a
scheme for its experimental implementation. A light beam passing through such
an interface undergoes a shift resembling the original geometric SHEL in a
tilted reference frame. This displacement is generated at the polarizer and its
occurrence does not depend on the properties of the detection system. We give
explicit results for this novel type of geometric SHEL and show that at grazing
incidence this effect amounts to a displacement of multiple wavelengths, a
shift larger than the one introduced by Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov
effects.
