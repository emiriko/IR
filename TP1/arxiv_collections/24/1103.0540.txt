Multifarious image enhancement algorithms have been used in different
applications. Still, some algorithms or modules are imperfect for practical
use. When the image enhancement modules have been fixed or combined by a series
of algorithms, we need to repair them as a whole part without changing the
inside. This report aims to find an algorithm based on trained filters to
repair low-quality image enhancement modules. A brief review on basic image
enhancement techniques and pixel classification methods will be presented, and
the procedure of trained filters will be described step by step. The
experiments and result comparisons for this algorithm will be described in
detail.
