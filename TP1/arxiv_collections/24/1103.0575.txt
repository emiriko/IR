We introduce a notion of volatility uncertainty in discrete time and define
the corresponding analogue of Peng's G-expectation. In the continuous-time
limit, the resulting sublinear expectation converges weakly to the
G-expectation. This can be seen as a Donsker-type result for the G-Brownian
motion.
