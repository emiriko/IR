We present new 6 and 20 cm Very Large Array (VLA) observations of polarized
continuum emission of roughly 0.5 square degrees of the Galactic center (GC)
region. The 6 cm observations detect diffuse linearly-polarized emission
throughout the region with a brightness of roughly 1 mJy per 15"x10" beam. The
Faraday rotation measure (RM) toward this polarized emission has structure on
degree size scales and ranges from roughly +330 rad/m2 east of the dynamical
center (Sgr A) to -880 rad/m2 west of the dynamical center. This RM structure
is also seen toward several nonthermal radio filaments, which implies that they
have a similar magnetic field orientation and constrains models for their
origin. Modeling shows that the RM and its change with Galactic longitude are
best explained by the high electron density and strong magnetic field of the GC
region. Considering the emissivity of the GC plasma shows that while the
absolute RM values are indirect measures of the GC magnetic field, the RM
longitude structure directly traces the magnetic field in the central
kiloparsec of the Galaxy. Combining this result with previous work reveals a
larger RM structure covering the central ~2 degrees of the Galaxy. This RM
structure is similar to that proposed by Novak and coworkers, but is shifted
roughly 50 pc west of the dynamical center of the Galaxy. If this RM structure
originates in the GC region, it shows that the GC magnetic field is organized
on ~300 pc size scales. The pattern is consistent with a predominantly poloidal
field geometry, pointing from south to north, that is perturbed by the motion
of gas in the Galactic disk.
