The main goal of this work is to show that if two weighted homogeneous (but
not homogeneous) function-germs $(\C^2,0)\to(\C,0)$ are bi-Lipschitz
equivalent, in the sense that these function-germs can be included in a
strongly bi-Lipschitz trivial family of weighted homogeneous function-germs,
then they are analytically equivalent.
