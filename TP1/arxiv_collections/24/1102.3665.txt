We present a criterion for deciding which compact extra dimensional spaces
yield physically reliable Newton's law corrections. We study compact manifolds
with boundary and without boundary. The boundary conditions which we use on the
boundaries are Dirichlet or Neumann. We find that compact connected Riemannian
manifolds with Dirichlet boundaries are completely excluded as extra
dimensional spaces.
