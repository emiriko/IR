Using the Local Composite Operator formalism, we analytically study the
dimension two gluon condensate in the presence of instantons. We first use the
dilute gas approximation and partially solve the infrared problem of instanton
physics. In order to find quantitative results, however, we turn to an
instanton liquid model, where we find a two-component picture of the
condensate: one component comes from instantons, a second component is
non-perturbatively generated by quantum fluctuations around the instantons.
