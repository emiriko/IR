We generalize the work of Alberto, Fiolhais and Gil and solve the problem of
a Dirac particle confined in a 3-dimensional box. The non-relativistic and
ultra-relativistic limits are considered and it is shown that the size of the
box determines how relativistic the low-lying states are. The consequences for
the density of states of a relativistic fermion gas are briefly discussed.
