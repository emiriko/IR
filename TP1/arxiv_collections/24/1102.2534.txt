Consider a measurable space with a finite vector measure. This measure
defines a mapping of the $\sigma$-field into a Euclidean space. According to
Lyapunov's convexity theorem, the range of this mapping is compact and, if the
measure is atomless, this range is convex. Similar ranges are also defined for
measurable subsets of the space. We show that the union of the ranges of all
subsets having the same given vector measure is also compact and, if the
measure is atomless, it is convex. We further provide a geometrically
constructed convex compactum in the Euclidean space that contains this union.
The equality of these two sets, that holds for two-dimensional measures, can be
violated in higher dimensions.
