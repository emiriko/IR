It is suggested that a set of positive- and negative-energy oscillations can
be resonantly excited in the inner region of deformed (warped or eccentric)
relativistic disks. In this paper we examine how a dissipative process affects
on this wave excitation process. The results show that when the resonant
condition in frequency is roughly satisfied and thus the oscillations are
excited, introduction of a dissipative process works so as to decrease the
growth rate of the oscillations. When the frequency difference of the two
oscillations deviates more than a certain amount from that required by resonant
condition, however, the oscillations are excited by introduction of dissipative
process. This excitation by dissipative process can be understood as a special
example of the double-diffusive instability.
