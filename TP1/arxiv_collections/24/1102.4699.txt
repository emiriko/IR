We give a simpler proof, via query elimination, of a result due to O'Donnell,
Saks, Schramm and Servedio, which shows a lower bound on the zero-error
randomized query complexity of a function f in terms of the maximum influence
of any variable of f. Our lower bound also applies to the two-sided error
distributional query complexity of f, and it allows an immediate extension
which can be used to prove stronger lower bounds for some functions.
