In elaborating on the multiple-photon absorption attack on Ekert protocol
proposed in arXiv:1011.4740, we show that it can be used in other
entanglement-based protocols, in particular the BBM92 protocol. In this attack,
the eavesdropper (Eve) is assumed to be in control of the source, and she sends
pulses correlated in polarization (but not entangled) containing several
photons at frequencies for which only multiple-photon absorptions are possible
in Alice's and Bob's detectors. Whenever the photons stemming from one pulse
are dispatched in such a way that the number of photons is insufficient to
trigger a multiple-photon absorption in either channel, the pulse remains
undetected. We show that this simple feature is enough to reproduce the type of
statistics on the detected pulses that are considered as indicating a secure
quantum key distribution, even though the source is actually a mixture of
separable states. The violation of Bell inequalities measured by Alice and Bob
increases with the order of the multiple-photon absorption that Eve can drive
into their detectors, while the measured quantum bit error rate decreases as a
function of the same variable. We show that the attack can be successful even
in the simplest case of a two-photon absorption or three-photon absorption
attack, and we discuss possible countermeasures, in particular the use of a
fair sampling test.
