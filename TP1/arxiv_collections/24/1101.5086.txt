In the distrustful quantum cryptography model the different parties have
conflicting interests and do not trust one another. Nevertheless, they trust
the quantum devices in their labs. The aim of the device-independent approach
to cryptography is to do away with the necessity of making this assumption,
and, consequently, significantly increase security. In this paper we enquire
whether the scope of the device-independent approach can be extended to the
distrustful cryptography model, thereby rendering it `fully' distrustful. We
answer this question in the affirmative by presenting a device-independent
(imperfect) bit-commitment protocol, which we then use to construct a
device-independent coin flipping protocol.
