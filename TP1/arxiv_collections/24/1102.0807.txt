We have studied electron scattering by out-of-plane (flexural) phonons in
doped suspended bilayer graphene. We have found the bilayer membrane to follow
the qualitative behavior of the monolayer cousin. In the bilayer, different
electronic structure combine with different electron-phonon coupling to give
the same parametric dependence in resistivity, and in particular the same
temperature $T$ behavior. In parallel with the single layer, flexural phonons
dominate the phonon contribution to resistivity in the absence of strain, where
a density independent mobility is obtained. This contribution is strongly
suppressed by tension, and in-plane phonons become the dominant contribution in
strained samples. Among the quantitative differences an important one has been
identified: room $T$ mobility in bilayer graphene is substantially higher than
in monolayer. The origin of quantitative differences has been unveiled.
