The existing experimental data are examined under different assumptions about
the structure of the scattering amplitude of the proton-proton and
proton-antiproton elastic scattering at high energy to obtain the value of
rho(s,t), the ratio of the real to imaginary part of the scattering amplitude
in the Coulomb-hadron interference region. It is shown that the deviation of
rho(s,t) obtained from the experimental data of the proton-antiproton
scattering at 3.8 < P_L <6.2 GeV/c from the dispersion analysis is concern in
all examined assumptions.
