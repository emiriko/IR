An incomplete sky coverage poses difficulties in the extraction of the weak
lensing information from the CMB. We test the reconstruction of the weak
lensing convergence from CMB maps to which masks of point sources have been
applied. We use the quadratic estimator with a kernel with finite support
acting in real space for a Planck simulation. We recover the lensing signal
without significant loss of power or addition of spurious correlations, thus
showing that masking defected pixels does not affect the reconstruction of the
weak lensing convergence in real space.
