High biocompatibility, variable size ranging from ~ 5 nm, stable luminescence
from its color centers and simple carbon chemistry for biomolecule grafting
make nanodiamond (ND) particles an attractive alternative to molecular dyes for
drug-delivery. Here we present a novel method for remote monitoring of chemical
processes in biological environment based on color changes from
photo-luminescent NV centers in ND. We propose to drive the NV luminescence
chemically, by alternating the surface electric field developed by interacting
atoms and molecules with the diamond surface. Due to the small ND size, the
developed electric field penetrates into the bulk of the nanoparticle and
intermingles with the electronic NV states. This allows construction of optical
chemo-biosensors operating in cells, visible in classical confocal microscopes.
We demonstrate this phenomenon on oxidized and hydrogenated ND as well as
single crystal diamond containing engineered NV centers. Hydrogenation of NDs
leads to quenching of luminescence related to negatively charged (NV-) centers
and by this way produces color shifts from NV- (636 nm) to neutral NV0 (575nm)
luminescence. We model how the reduction of diamond size increases the
magnitude of NV color shift phenomena.
