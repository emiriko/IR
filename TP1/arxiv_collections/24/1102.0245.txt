We study the crossover from the one-dimensional to the two-dimensional
Hubbard model in the photoemission spectra of weakly coupled chains. The chains
with on-site repulsion are treated using the spin-charge factorized wave
function, that is known to provide an essentially exact description of the
chain in the strong coupling limit. The hoppings between the chains are
considered as a perturbation. We calculate the dynamical spectral function at
all energies in the random-phase approximation, by resuming an infinite set of
diagrams. Even though the hoppings drive the system from a fractionalized
Luttinger-liquid-like system to a Fermi-liquid-like system at low energies,
significant characteristics of the one-dimensional system remain in the
two-dimensional system. Furthermore, we find that introducing (frustrating)
hoppings beyond the nearest neighbor one, the interference effects increase the
energy and momentum range of the one--dimensional character.
