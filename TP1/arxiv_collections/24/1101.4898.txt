The immense increase in the generation of genomic scale data poses an unmet
analytical challenge, due to a lack of established methodology with the
required flexibility and power. We propose a first principled approach to
statistical analysis of sequence-level genomic information. We provide a
growing collection of generic biological investigations that query pairwise
relations between tracks, represented as mathematical objects, along the
genome. The Genomic HyperBrowser implements the approach and is available at
http://hyperbrowser.uio.no.
