A survey of known threshold excitations of mirror systems suggests a means to
estimate masses of nuclear systems that are uncertain or not known, as does a
trend in the relative energies of isobaric ground states. Using both studies
and known mirror-pair energy differences, we estimate the mass of the nucleus
17-Na and its energy relative to the p+16-Ne threshold. This model-free
estimate of the latter is larger than that suggested by recent structure
models.
