Focusing on B-emission stars, we investigated a set of H$\alpha$ equivalent
widths calculated from observed spectra acquired over a period of about 4 years
from 2003 to 2007. During this time, changes in equivalent width for our
program stars were monitored. We have found a simple statistical method to
quantify these changes in our observations. This statistical test, commonly
called the F ratio, involves calculating the ratio of the external and internal
error. We show that the application of this technique can be used to place
bounds on the degree of variability of Be stars. This observational tool
provides a quantitative way to find Be stars at particular stages of
variability requiring relatively little observational data.
