The peer review system as used in several computer science communities has
several flaws including long review times, overloaded reviewers, as well as
fostering of niche topics. These flaws decrease quality, lower impact, slowdown
the innovation process, and lead to frustration of authors, readers, and
reviewers. In order to fix this, we propose a new peer review system termed
paper bricks. Paper bricks has several advantages over the existing system
including shorter publications, better competition for new ideas, as well as an
accelerated innovation process. Furthermore, paper bricks may be implemented
with minimal change to the existing peer review systems.
