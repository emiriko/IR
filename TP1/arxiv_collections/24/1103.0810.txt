We reveal that the periodic radius modulation peculiar to one-dimensional
(1D) peanut-shaped fullerene (C$_{60}$) polymers exerts a strong influence on
their low-frequency phonon states and their interactions with mobile electrons.
The continuum approximation is employed to show the zone-folding of phonon
dispersion curves, which leads to fast relaxation of a radial breathing mode in
the 1D C$_{60}$ polymers. We also formulate the electron-phonon interaction
along the deformation potential theory, demonstrating that only a few set of
electron and phonon modes yields a significant magnitude of the interaction
relevant to the low-temperature physics of the system. The latter finding gives
an important implication for the possible Peierls instability of the C$_{60}$
polymers suggested in the earlier experiment.
