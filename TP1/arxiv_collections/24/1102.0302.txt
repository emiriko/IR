The LHC, with its seven-fold increase in energy over the Tevatron, is capable
of probing regions of SUSY parameter space exhibiting qualitatively new
collider phenomenology. Here we investigate one such region in which first
generation squarks are very heavy compared to the other superpartners. We find
that the production of these squarks, which is dominantly associative, only
becomes rate-limited at mSquark > 4(5) TeV for L~10(100) fb-1. However,
discovery of this scenario is complicated because heavy squarks decay primarily
into a jet and boosted gluino, yielding a dijet-like topology with missing
energy (MET) pointing along the direction of the second hardest jet. The result
is that many signal events are removed by standard jet/MET anti-alignment cuts
designed to guard against jet mismeasurement errors. We suggest replacing these
anti-alignment cuts with a measurement of jet substructure that can
significantly extend the reach of this channel while still removing much of the
background. We study a selection of benchmark points in detail, demonstrating
that mSquark= 4(5) TeV first generation squarks can be discovered at the LHC
with L~10(100)fb-1.
