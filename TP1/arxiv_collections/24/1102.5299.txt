We show that the tails of the asymptotic density distribution of a quantum
wave packet that localizes in the the presence of random or quasiperiodic
disorder can be described by the diagonal term of the projection over the
eingenstates of the disordered potential. This is equivalent of assuming a
phase randomization of the off-diagonal/interference terms. We demonstrate
these results through numerical calculations of the dynamics of ultracold atoms
in the one-dimensional speckle and quasiperiodic potentials used in the recent
experiments that lead to the observation of Anderson localization for matter
waves [Billy et al., Nature 453, 891 (2008); Roati et al., Nature 453, 895
(2008)]. For the quasiperiodic case, we also discuss the implications of using
continuos or discrete models.
