We study a frustrated 3D antiferromagnet of stacked $J_1 - J_2$ layers. The
intermediate 'quantum spin liquid' phase, present in the 2D case, narrows with
increasing interlayer coupling and vanishes at a triple point. Beyond this
there is a direct first-order transition from N{\' e}el to columnar order.
Possible applications to real materials are discussed.
