We study a class of rotation invariant determinantal ensembles in the complex
plane; examples include the eigenvalues of Gaussian random matrices and the
roots of certain families of random polynomials. The main result is a criteria
for a central limit theorem to hold for angular statistics of the points. The
proof exploits an exact formula relating the generating function of such
statistics to the determinant of a perturbed Toeplitz matrix.
