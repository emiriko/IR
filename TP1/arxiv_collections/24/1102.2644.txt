We study the case when solution of an ODE at a given initial condition fail
to be unique and investigate what are the possible time-1 sections of the
`solution funnel'. Along the way we give construction of a natural complete
metric on the space of Jordan curves and prove that the generic Jordan curve is
nowhere pierceable by arcs of finite length.
