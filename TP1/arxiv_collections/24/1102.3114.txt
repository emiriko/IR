Solid State Disk technologies are increasingly replacing high-speed hard
disks as the storage technology in high-random-I/O environments. There are
several potentially I/O bound services within the typical LHC Tier-2 - in the
back-end, with the trend towards many-core architectures continuing, worker
nodes running many single-threaded jobs and storage nodes delivering many
simultaneous files can both exhibit I/O limited efficiency. We estimate the
effectiveness of affordable SSDs in the context of worker nodes, on a large
Tier-2 production setup using both low level tools and real LHC I/O intensive
data analysis jobs comparing and contrasting with high performance spinning
disk based solutions. We consider the applicability of each solution in the
context of its price/performance metrics, with an eye on the pragmatic issues
facing Tier-2 provision and upgrades
