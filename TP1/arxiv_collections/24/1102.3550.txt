High-quality Pr0.7Ca0.3MnO3/SrRuO3 superlattices with ultrathin layers were
fabricated by pulsed laser deposition on SrTiO3 substrates. The superlattices
were studied by atomically resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy,
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, resistivity and
magnetoresistance measurements. The superlattices grew coherently without
growth defects. Viewed along the growth direction, SrRuO3 and Pr0.7Ca0.3MnO3
layers were terminated by RuO2 and MnO2, respectively, which imposes a unique
structure to their interfaces. Superlattices with a constant thickness of the
SrRuO3 layers, but varying thickness of the Pr0.7Ca0.3MnO3 layers showed a
change of crystalline symmetry of the SrRuO3 layers. At a low Pr0.7Ca0.3MnO3
layer thickness of 1.5 nm transmission electron microscopy proved the SrRuO3
layers to be orthorhombic, whereas these were non-orthorhombic for a
Pr0.7Ca0.3MnO3 layer thickness of 4.0 nm. Angular magnetoresistance
measurements showed orthorhombic (with small monoclinic distortion) symmetry in
the first case and tetragonal symmetry of the SrRuO3 layers in the second case.
Mechanisms driving this orthorhombic to tetragonal transition are briefly
discussed.
