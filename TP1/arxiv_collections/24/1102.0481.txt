We propose the formula for the number of pairs of consecutive primes $p_n,
p_{n+1}<x$ separated by gap $d=p_{n+1}-p_n$ expressed directly by the number of
all primes $<x$, i.e. by $\pi(x)$. As the application of this formula we
formulate 7 conjectures, among others for the maximal gap between two
consecutive primes smaller than $x$, for the generalized Brun's constants and
the first occurrence of a given gap $d$. Also the leading term $\log \log(x)$
in the prime harmonic sum is reproduced from our guesses correctly. These
conjectures are supported by the computer data.
