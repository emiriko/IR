Recent experiments conducted in water at ultrasonic frequencies showed the
possibility of overcoming the transmission loss provided by homogeneous plates
at certain frequencies by drilling periodically distributed holes on it. In
this letter, the feasibility of using slit arrays to increase the transmission
loss at certain frequencies for airborne sound is studied. Numerical results
predict a) very low transmission loss for a slit array in comparison with a
homogeneous plate in air and b) the transmission loss of a slit array can
overcome that of a homogeneous plate if the impedance mismatch is low enough.
