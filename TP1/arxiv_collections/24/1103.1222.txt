We present a numerical study on an interacting monomer-dimer model with
nearest neighbor repulsion on a square lattice, which possesses two symmetric
absorbing states. The model is observed to exhibit two nearby continuous
transitions: the $Z_2$ symmetry-breaking order-disorder transition and the
absorbing transition with directed percolation criticality. We find that the
symmetry-breaking transition shows a non-Ising critical behavior, and that the
absorbing phase becomes critical, in the sense that the critical decay of the
dimer density observed at the absorbing transition persists even within the
absorbing phase. Our findings call for further studies on the microscopic
models and corresponding continuum description belonging to the generalized
voter universality class.
