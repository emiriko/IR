We report a comprehensive 77Se NMR study of the structural, magnetic, and
superconducting properties of a single crystalline sample of the newly
discovered FeSe-based high temperature superconductor K(x)Fe(2-y)Se(2) (Tc=33K)
in a broad temperature range up to 290 K. We will compare our results with
those reported for FeSe (Tc=9K) and FeAs-based high Tc systems.
