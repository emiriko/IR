We experimentally investigate diffraction of a Rb-87 Bose-Einstein condensate
from a 1D optical lattice. We use a range of lattice periods and timescales,
including those beyond the Raman-Nath limit. We compare the results to quantum
mechanical and classical simulations, with quantitative and qualitative
agreement, respectively. The classical simulation predicts that the envelope of
the time-evolving diffraction pattern is shaped by caustics: singularities in
the phase space density of classical trajectories. This behavior becomes
increasingly clear as the lattice period grows.
