Ion Mobility Spectrometry (IMS) is a well-known, sensitive and rapid
technique to detect dangerous organic compounds. We propose a system in which a
crown type discharge generates a ionic flow that is swept towards an array of
collectors by a transverse electric field. The ions are separated as they enter
the cell according to their mobility. Thus, the distribution of the charge
deposited at the detector assembly constitutes a {\em fingerprint} for each
organic compound. Simulations of our cell and experiments were performed for
small amounts of acetone, ethanol and toluene. The dependence on the cell
parameters of the current and charge versus time of flight was analyzed. Our
simulation reproduces only qualitatively the experimental results. However, a
PCA statistical analysis of the results obtained by simulation of the proposed
design shows that the fingerprint is useful for a clear identification of such
compounds.
