Researchers have proposed a variety of Internet topology models. However
almost all of them focus on generating one graph based on one single static
source graph. On the other hand, Internet topology is evolving over time
continuously with the addition and deletion of nodes and edges. If a model is
based on all the topologies in the past, instead of one of them, it will be
more accurate and closer to the real world topology. In this paper, we study
the Internet As-level topology time-series from two different sources and find
that both of them obey four same dynamic graph patterns. Then we propose a mode
that can infer the topology in the future based on all the topologies in the
past. Through theoretical and experimental analysis, we prove the topology that
our model generates can match both the static and dynamic graph patterns. In
addition, the parameters in the model are meaningful. Finally, we theoretically
and experimentally prove that these parameters are directly related to some
important graph characteristics.
