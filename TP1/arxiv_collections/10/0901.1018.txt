The role of gravity is crucial in astrophysics. It determines the evolution
of any system, over an enormous range of time and space scales. Astronomical
stellar systems as composed by N interacting bodies represent examples of
self-gravitating systems, usually treatable with the aid of newtonian gravity
but for particular cases. In this note I will briefly discuss some of the open
problems in the dynamical study of classic self-gravitating N-body systems,
over the astronomical range of N. I will also point out how modern research in
this field compulsorily requires a heavy use of large scale computations, due
to the contemporary requirement of high precision and high computational speed.
