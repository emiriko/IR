We report on Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-Wave Astronomy (CARMA)
and James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) observations toward the Einstein
source 1E 1740.7-2942, a LMXB commonly known as the "Great Annihilator." The
Great Annihilator is known to be near a small, bright molecular cloud on the
sky in a region largely devoid of emission in 12-CO surveys of the Galactic
Center. The region is of interest because it is interior to the dust lanes
which may be the shock zones where atomic gas from HI nuclear disk is converted
into molecular gas. We find that the region is populated with a number of dense
(n ~ 10^5 cm^-3) regions of excited gas with small filling factors, and
estimate that up to 1-3 x 10^5 solar masses of gas can be seen in our maps. The
detection suggests that a significant amount of mass is transported from the
shock zones to the GC star-forming regions in the form of small, dense bundles.
