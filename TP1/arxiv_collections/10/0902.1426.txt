We construct optimal designs for estimating fetal malformation rate, prenatal
death rate and an overall toxicity index in a toxicology study under a broad
range of model assumptions. We use Weibull distributions to model these rates
and assume that the number of implants depend on the dose level. We study
properties of the optimal designs when the intra-litter correlation coefficient
depends on the dose levels in different ways. Locally optimal designs are
found, along with robustified versions of the designs that are less sensitive
to misspecification in the initial values of the model parameters. We also
report efficiencies of commonly used designs in toxicological experiments and
efficiencies of the proposed optimal designs when the true rates have
non-Weibull distributions. Optimal design strategies for finding
multiple-objective designs in toxicology studies are outlined as well.
