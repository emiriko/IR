We reevaluate electron-positron pair production from electromagnetic
interactions of muons in transit through materials. Our approach, through the
use of structure functions for inelastic and elastic scattering and including
hadronic recoil, make the formalism useful for tau pair production at high
energies. Our results for electron-positron pair production agree well with
prior evaluations. Tau pair production, has a significant contribution from
inelastic scattering in addition to the usual coherent scattering with the
nucleus and scattering with atomic electrons.
