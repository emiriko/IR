We present a time-dependent localized Hartree-Fock density-functional linear
response approach for the treatment of photoionization of atomic systems. This
approach employs a spin-dependent localized Hartree-Fock (SLHF) exchange
potential to calculate electron orbitals and kernel functions, and thus can be
used to study the photoionization from atomic excited states. We have applied
the approach to the calculation of photoionization cross sections of Ne ground
state. The results are in agreement with available experimental data and have
comparable accuracies with other ab initio theoretical results. We have also
extended the approach to explore the photoionization from Ne excited states and
obtained some new results for the photoionization from outer-shell and
inner-shell excited states.
