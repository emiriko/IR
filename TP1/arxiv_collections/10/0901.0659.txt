The resonance $\Delta(1232)$ with spin-parity ${3 \over 2}^+$, which
contributes dominantly to the reactions like $\gamma N \to \pi N$ and $NN \to
NN\pi$ at intermediate energies, may be expected to be produced in
characteristically different polarized spin states. As such an analysis of the
decay of polarized delta is presented, which may be utilized to probe
empirically the production mechanism. It is shown that measurements of the
angular distributions of the pion and the polarization of the nucleon arising
out of ${\vec{\Delta}}$ decay can determine empirically the Fano statistical
tensors characterizing the ${\vec{\Delta}}$.
