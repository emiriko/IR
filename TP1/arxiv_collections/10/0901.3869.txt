The discovery of the near infrared windows into the Venus deep atmosphere has
enabled the use of remote sensing techniques to study the composition of the
Venus atmosphere below the clouds. In particular, water vapor absorption lines
can be observed in a number of the near-infrared windows allowing measurement
of the H2O abundance at several different levels in the lower atmosphere.
Accurate determination of the abundance requires a good database of spectral
line parameters for the H2O absorption lines at the high temperatures (up to
~700 K) encountered in the Venus deep atmosphere. This paper presents a
comparison of a number of H2O line lists that have been, or that could
potentially be used, to analyze Venus deep atmosphere water abundances and
shows that there are substantial discrepancies between them. For example, the
early high-temperature list used by Meadows and Crisp (1996) had large
systematic errors in line intensities. When these are corrected for using the
more recent high-temperature BT2 list of Barber et al. (2006) their value of
45+/-10 ppm for the water vapor mixing ratio reduces to 27+/-6 ppm. The HITRAN
and GEISA lists used for most other studies of Venus are deficient in "hot"
lines that become important in the Venus deep atmosphere and also show evidence
of systematic errors in line intensities, particularly for the 8000 to 9500
cm-1 region that includes the 1.18 um window. Water vapor mixing ratios derived
from these lists may also be somewhat overestimated. The BT2 line list is
recommended as being the most complete and accurate current representation of
the H2O spectrum at Venus temperatures.
