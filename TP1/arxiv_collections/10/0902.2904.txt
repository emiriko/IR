A bitset is a set that encodes for a binary number. Bitsets are at the basis
of a beautiful theory of recombination with n-loci and here we begin from
scratch and advance to include the derivation of the fundamental results about
the evolution of gamete frequencies and of disequilibrium measures with and
without migration. All techniques have been illustrated and we have invested
moreover a great effort to make the mathematics of this work accessible even
for students in their first year at the university.
