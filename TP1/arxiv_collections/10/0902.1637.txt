An analysis of arrival directions of extensive air showers generated by
cosmic rays in the PeV energy range and registered with the EAS MSU and
EAS-1000 Prototype arrays reveals a considerable number of regions of excessive
flux of cosmic rays. We present results of comparative analysis of regions
found in the two data sets, estimate probabilities of their appearance, and
discuss correlation of their locations with coordinates of possible
astrophysical sources of PeV cosmic rays.
