We consider the pairing of electrons and holes due to their Coulomb
attraction in two parallel, independently gated graphene layers, separated by a
barrier. At weak coupling, there exist the BCS-like pair-condensed state.
Despite the fact that electrons and holes behave like massless Dirac fermions,
the problem of BCS-like electron-hole pairing in graphene bilayer turns out to
be rather similar to that in usual coupled semiconductor quantum wells. The
distinctions are due to Berry phase of electronic wave functions and different
screening properties. We estimate values of the gap in one-particle excitation
spectrum for different interlayer distances and carrier concentrations.
Influence of disorder is discussed. At large enough dielectric susceptibility
of surrounding medium, the weak coupling regime holds even at arbitrarily small
carrier concentrations. Localized electron-hole pairs are absent in graphene,
thus the behavior of the system versus coupling strength is cardinally
different from usual BCS-BEC crossover.
