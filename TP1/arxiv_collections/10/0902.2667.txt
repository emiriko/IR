A brief overview of the superconducting energy gap studies on 122-type family
of iron pnictides is given. It seems that the situation in the hole-doped
Ba1-xKxFe2As2 is well resolved. Most of the measurements including the
presented here point-contact Andreev reflection spectra agree on existence of
multiple nodeless gaps in the excitation spectrum of this multiband system. The
gaps have basically two sizes - the small one with a strength up to the BCS
weak coupling limit and the large one with a very strong coupling with
2Delta/kTc ~ 6 - 8. In the electron doped Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 the most of the
experiments including our point contact measurements reveal in quite broadened
spectra only a single gap with a strong coupling strength. The high precision
ARPES measurements on this system identified two gaps but very close to each
other, both showing a strong coupling with 2Delta/kTc ~ 5 and 6, respectively.
