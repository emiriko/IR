Classification of some objects in classes of concepts is an essential and
even breathtaking task in many applications. A solution is discussed here based
on Multi-Agent systems. A kernel of some expert agents in several classes is to
consult a central agent decide among the classification problem of a certain
object. This kernel is moderated with the center agent, trying to manage the
querying agents for any decision problem by means of a data-header like feature
set. Agents have cooperation among concepts related to the classes of this
classification decision-making; and may affect on each others' results on a
certain query object in a multi-agent learning approach. This leads to an
online feature learning via the consulting trend. The performance is discussed
to be much better in comparison to some other prior trends while system's
message passing overload is decreased to less agents and the expertism helps
the performance and operability of system win the comparison.
