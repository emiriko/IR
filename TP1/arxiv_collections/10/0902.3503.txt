In this paper, we propose a new operation, Generalised Sequential Crossover
(GSCO) of words, which in some sense an abstract model of crossing over of the
chromosomes in the living organisms. We extend GSCO over language $L$
iteratively ($GSCO^*(L)$ as well as iterated GSCO over two languages
$GSCO^*(L_1,L_2)$). Our study reveals that $GSCO^*(L)$ is subclass of regular
languages for any $L$. We compare the different classes of GSCO languages with
the prominent sub-regular classes.
