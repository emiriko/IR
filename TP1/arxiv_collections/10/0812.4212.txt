Direct frequency comb spectroscopy of trapped ions is demonstated for the
first time. It is shown that the 4s^2S_(1/2)-4p^2P_(3/2) transition in calcium
ions can be excited directly with a frequency comb laser that is upconverted to
393 nm. Detection of the transition is performed using a shelving scheme to
suppress background signal from non-resonant comb modes. The measured
transition frequency of f=761 905 012.7(0.5) MHz presents an improvement in
accuracy of more than two orders of magnitude.
