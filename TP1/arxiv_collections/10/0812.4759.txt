We consider the dynamics of a thin liquid film in the attractive substrate
potential and under the action of a longitudinal or a tilted vibration. Using a
multiscale technique we split the film motion into the oscillatory and the
averaged parts. The frequency of the vibration is assumed high enough for the
inertial effects to become essential for the oscillatory motion. Applying the
lubrication approximation for the averaged motion we obtain the amplitude
equation, which includes contributions from gravity, van der Waals attraction,
surface tension, and the vibration. We show that the longitudinal vibration
leads to destabilization of the initially planar film. Stable solutions
corresponding to the deflected free surface are possible in this case. Linear
analysis in the case of tilted vibration shows that either stabilization or
destabilization are possible. Stabilization of the dewetting film by mechanical
action (i.e., the vibration) was first reported by us in PRE 77, 036320 (2008).
This effect may be important for applications.
