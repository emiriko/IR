We present some of the results of a survey aimed at exploring the
asteroseismological potential of the newly-discovered carbon-atmosphere white
dwarfs. We show that, in certains regions of parameter space, carbon-atmosphere
white dwarfs may drive low-order gravity modes. We demonstrate that our
theoretical results are consistent with the recent exciting discovery of
luminosity variations in SDSS J1426+5752 and some null results obtained by a
team of scientists at McDonald Observatory. We also present follow-up
photometric observations carried out by ourselves at the Mount Bigelow 1.6-m
telescope using the new Mont4K camera. The results of follow-up spectroscopic
observations at the MMT are also briefly reported, including the surprising
discovery that SDSS J1426+5752 is not only a pulsating star but that it is also
a magnetic white dwarf with a surface field near 1.2 MG. The discovery of
$g$-mode pulsations in SDSS J1426+5752 is quite significant in itself as it
opens a fourth asteroseismological "window", after the GW Vir, V777 Her, and ZZ
Ceti families, through which one may study white dwarfs.
