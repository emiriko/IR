With a recently developed time evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, we
numerically study the ground state quantum phase diagram of fermi mixtures with
attractive inter-species interactions loaded in one-dimensional optical
lattices. For our study, we adopt a general asymmetric Hubbard model (AHM) with
species-dependent tunneling rates to incorporate the possibility of mass
imbalance in the mixtures. We find clear signatures for the existence of a
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase in this model in the presence of
population imbalance. Our simulation also reveals that in the presence of mass
imbalance, the parameter space for FFLO states shrinks or even completely
vanishes depending on the strength of the attractive interaction and the degree
of mass imbalance.
