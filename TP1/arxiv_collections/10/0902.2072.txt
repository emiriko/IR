Canonical models are of central importance in modal logic, in particular as
they witness strong completeness and hence compactness. While the canonical
model construction is well understood for Kripke semantics, non-normal modal
logics often present subtle difficulties - up to the point that canonical
models may fail to exist, as is the case e.g. in most probabilistic logics.
Here, we present a generic canonical model construction in the semantic
framework of coalgebraic modal logic, which pinpoints coherence conditions
between syntax and semantics of modal logics that guarantee strong
completeness. We apply this method to reconstruct canonical model theorems that
are either known or folklore, and moreover instantiate our method to obtain new
strong completeness results. In particular, we prove strong completeness of
graded modal logic with finite multiplicities, and of the modal logic of exact
probabilities.
