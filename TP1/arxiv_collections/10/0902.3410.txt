Three-body systems with large scattering length display universal phenomena
associated with a discrete scaling symmetry. These phenomena include resonant
enhancement of three-body loss rates when an Efimov three-body resonance is at
the scattering threshold. In particular, there can be resonant peaks in the
atom-dimer relaxation rate for large positive scattering length. We improve
upon earlier studies and calculate the atom-dimer relaxation rate as a function
of temperature using a Bose-Einstein distribution for the thermal average. As
input, we use calculations of the atom-dimer scattering phase shifts from
effective field theory.
