Supernovae and radio galaxy redshift data are fitted in an alternative
cosmology. The galaxies are assumed to recede with unchanging velocities in a
static Robertson-Walker metric with a(t) = 1. An exact fit is obtained with no
adjustable parameters. There is no indication that the recession velocities are
changing with time, so no call for "dark energy".
