This paper presents methods to provide an optimal evaluation of the nuclear
masses. The techniques used for this purpose come from data assimilation that
allows combining, in an optimal and consistent way, information coming from
experiment and from numerical model. Using all the available information, it
leads to improve not only masses evaluations, but also to decrease
uncertainties. Each newly evaluated mass value is associated with some accuracy
that is sensibly reduced with respect to the values given in tables, especially
in the case of the less well-known masses. In this paper, we first introduce a
useful tool of data assimilation, the Best Linear Unbiased Estimation (BLUE).
This BLUE method is applied to nuclear mass tables and some results of
improvement are shown.
