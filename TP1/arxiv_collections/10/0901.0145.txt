We report the first investigation of the piezoelectric response on a
nanoscale in the poled ferroelectric crystals with engineered configuration of
domains. Piezoresponse force microscopy of tetragonal 0.63PMN-0.37PT
relaxor-based ferroelectric crystals reviled that the d33 piezoelectric
coefficient is significantly reduced within the distance of about 1 um from the
uncharged engineered domain wall. This finding is essential for understanding
the mechanisms of the giant piezoresponse in relaxor-based crystals and for
designing new piezoelectric materials.
