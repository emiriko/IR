The flavor dependence of polarized and unpolarized quark distributions in the
nucleon can lead to insights into the formation of the sea. Drell-Yan
measurements have pointed to flavor asymmetries in the unpolarized
distributions. Collisions at sqrt{s}=500 GeV with polarized protons at RHIC
will soon allow investigations of the flavor separated polarized quark
distributions via W production to complement measurements from semi-inclusive
DIS. We report on STAR's current plans, tracking upgrade, and expected
sensitivities.
