We evaluate the impact of electroweak corrections of infrared origin on
longitudinal strongly interacting gauge bosons scattering, calculating all
order resummed expressions at the double log level. As a working example, we
consider the Standard model with a heavy Higgs. At energies typical of
forthcoming experiments (LHC,ILC,CLIC), the corrections are in the 10-40 %
range, the relative sign depending on the initial state considered and on
whether or not additional gauge bosons emission is included.
