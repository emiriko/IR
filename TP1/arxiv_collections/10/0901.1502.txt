We revisit here the effect of quantum dissipation on the much - studied
problem of Landau diamagnetism, and analyze the results in the light of the
third law of thermodynamics. The case of an additional parabolic potential is
separately assessed. We find that dissipation arising from strong coupling of
the system to its environment qualitatively alters the low-temperature
thermodynamic attributes such as the entropy and the specific heat.
