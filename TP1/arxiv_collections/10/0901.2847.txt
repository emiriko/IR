A sequence of reversals that takes a signed permutation to the identity is
perfect if at no step a common interval is broken. Determining a parsimonious
perfect sequence of reversals that sorts a signed permutation is NP-hard. Here
we show that, despite this worst-case analysis, with probability one, sorting
can be done in polynomial time. Further, we find asymptotic expressions for the
average length and number of reversals in commuting permutations, an
interesting sub-class of signed permutations.
