Heteronuclear molecules attract wide attention due to their permanent
electric dipole moments. Analogous to atoms with magnetic dipoles, the
existence of nonzero electric dipoles significantly enhance possibilities and
mechanisms for control and design of quantum degenerate molecule systems with
electric (E-) fields. This work proposes a vortex creation mechanism inside a
condensate of heteronuclear molecules through the adiabatic flipping of the
axial bias of an analogous E-field Ioffe-Pritchard trap (IPT), extending the
original protocol due to Ishoshima, {\it et al.}, [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{61},
063610 (2000)] for an atomic spinor condensate inside a magnetic (B-) field
IPT. We provide both analytic proof and numerical simulations to illustrate the
high fidelity operation of this vortex pump protocol. We hope our work provides
stimulating experimental possibilities for the active investigations in quantum
degenerate molecule systems.
