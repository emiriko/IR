We find that the polarization field, B_chi, obtained by scaling the
weak-parallel-field magnetoresistance at different electron densities in a
dilute two-dimensional electron system in (111) silicon, corresponds to the
spin susceptibility that grows strongly at low densities. The polarization
field, B_sat, determined by resistance saturation, turns out to deviate to
lower values than B_chi with increasing electron density, which can be
explained by filling of the upper electron subbands in the fully spin-polarized
regime.
