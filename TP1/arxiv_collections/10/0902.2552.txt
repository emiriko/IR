We study the possible collective plasma modes which can affect neutron-star
thermodynamics and different elementary processes in the baryonic density range
between nuclear saturation ($\rho_0$) and $3\rho_0$. In this region, the
expected constituents of neutron-star matter are mainly neutrons, protons,
electrons and muons ($npe\mu$ matter), under the constraint of beta
equilibrium. The elementary plasma excitations of the $pe\mu$ three-fluid
medium are studied in the RPA framework. We emphasize the relevance of the
Coulomb interaction among the three species, in particular the interplay of the
electron and muon screening in suppressing the possible proton plasma mode,
which is converted into a sound-like mode. The Coulomb interaction alone is
able to produce a variety of excitation branches and the full spectral function
shows a rich structure at different energy. The genuine plasmon mode is pushed
at high energy and it contains mainly an electron component with a substantial
muon component, which increases with density. The plasmon is undamped for not
too large momentum and is expected to be hardly affected by the nuclear
interaction. All the other branches, which fall below the plasmon, are damped
or over-damped.
