We report results of large-scale molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of
dynamic deformation under biaxial tensile strain of pre-strained
single-crystalline nanometer-scale-thick face-centered cubic (fcc) copper
films. Our results show that stacking faults, which are abundantly present in
fcc metals, may play a significant role in the dissociation, cross-slip, and
eventual annihilation of dislocations in small-volume structures of fcc metals.
The underlying mechanisms are mediated by interactions within and between
extended dislocations that lead to annihilation of Shockley partial
dislocations or formation of perfect dislocations. Our findings demonstrate
dislocation starvation in small-volume structures with ultra-thin film
geometry, governed by a mechanism other than dislocation escape to free
surfaces, and underline the significant role of geometry in determining the
mechanical response of metallic small-volume structures.
