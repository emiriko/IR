In usual superconductors the carriers form Cooper pairs that have zero total
momentum meaning that the superfluid density is homogeneous. We know for
decades that it is a priori possible to observe at high fields the
Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinikov (FFLO) state in which the superfluid density
exhibits a field dependent modulation. The search for such inhomogeneous
condensates in materials is the subject of tremendous excitement especially
after the discovery of a promising high-field superconducting (HFSC) phase in
CeCoIn$_5$. However, subsequent neutron and NMR experiments contradicted the
FFLO picture in CeCoIn$_5$ establishing a puzzling coupling of the distinct
HFSC state with a magnetic modulation. Here we show that, a novel type of
exotic state is observed at high fields in CeCoIn$_5$ in which a pattern of
coexisting condensates manifests. The specific pattern includes the d-wave
singlet SC state, the staggered $\pi$-triplet SC state and Spin Density Waves
(SDW). Because of particle-hole asymmetry these three condensates may either
appear separately or all three together providing a new perspective on
antiferromagnetic superconductors that may include high-$T_c$ cuprates and
pniktides. The field induced transition to the pattern state in CeCoIn$_5$ is
only a paradigm of a generic mechanism that prevents the elimination of the
dominating condensate by the field via the formation of a pattern of
condensates. This opens new avenues for the search of exotic states not only in
electronic systems, but also in other systems where inhomogeneous condensates
are actively discussed like trapped atomic fermi gases and dense quark matter.
