The paper considers, within the Standard Model, physical pictures of
combinations and interactions of elementary particles, which are allowed within
the isotopic Foldy-Wouthuysen representation. A hypothesis is suggested and
proved that the properties of the world of dark matter do not contradict the
two physical pictures considered in the paper.
