I give a summary of the progress made on using the elegant construction of
Alain Connes noncommutaive geometry to explore the nature of space-time at very
high energies. In particular I show that by making very few natural and weak
assumptions about the structure of the noncommutative space, one can deduce the
structure of all fundamental interactions at low energies.
