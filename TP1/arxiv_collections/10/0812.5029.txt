A new relativistic transformation in the velocity space (here named the
differential Lorentz transformation) is formulated solely from the principle of
relativity and the invariance of the speed of light. The differential Lorentz
transformation is via transforming physical quantities, instead of space-time
coordinates, to make laws of nature form-invariant. The differential Lorentz
transformation may provide a way to resolve the incompatibility of the theory
of special relativity and the quantum theory.
