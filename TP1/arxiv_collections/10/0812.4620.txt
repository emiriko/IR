Measurements of the cross sections for charged current deep inelastic
scattering in e-p collisions with longitudinally polarised electron beams are
presented. The measurements are based on a data sample with an integrated
luminosity of 175 pb-1 collected with the ZEUS detector at HERA at a
centre-of-mass energy of 318 GeV. The total cross section is given for
positively and negatively polarised electron beams. The differential
cross-sections dsigma/dQ2, dsigma/dx and dsigma/dy are presented for Q2>200
GeV2. The double-differential cross-section d2sigma/dxdQ2 is presented in the
kinematic range 280<Q2<30000 GeV2 and 0.015<x<0.65. The measured cross sections
are compared with the predictions of the Standard Model.
