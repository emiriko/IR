Photoionization of the Ce$^{3+}$ - Ce$^{4+}$ process has been studied using
the random phase approximation with exchange method in the energy region
100-150 eV. Comparison of our results with the recent measurement [M\"uller
{\it et al}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 101}, 133001 (2008)] confirms the
suppression effect of the carbon cage in the endohedral fullerene Ce@C$_{82}^+$
photoionization. The reasons for the cause of the confinement resonance and the
suppression effect are discussed.
