The contribution of Pauli exchange terms to the two--nucleon induced
non--mesonic weak decay of $^{12}_\Lambda$C hypernuclei, $\Lambda NN\to nNN$
($N=n$ or $p$), is studied within a nuclear matter formalism implemented in a
local density approximation. We have adopted a weak transition potential
including the exchange of the complete octets of pseudoscalar and vector mesons
as well as a residual strong interaction modeled on the Bonn potential. The
introduction of exchange terms turns out to reduce the two--nucleon induced
non--mesonic rate by 18% and, jointly with an increase in the one--nucleon
induced rate by the same magnitude, reveals to be significant for an accurate
determination of the full set of hypernuclear non--mesonic decay widths in
theoretical and experimental analyses.
