We analyze the peaks in the (Lambda p) and (Lambda d) invariant mass
distributions, observed in recent FINUDA experiments and claimed to be signals
of deeply bound kaonic states, and find them to be naturally explained in terms
of K- absorption by two or three nucleons leaving the rest of the original
nuclei as spectator. For reactions on heavy nuclei, the subsequent interactions
of the particles produced in the primary absorption process with the residual
nucleus play an important role. Thus at present there is no experimental
evidence of deeply bound K- states in nuclei. However some new physics can be
extracted from the data of FINUDA experiments.
