The importance of mutator clones in the adaptive evolution of asexual
populations is not fully understood. Here we address this problem by using an
ab initio microscopic model of living cells, whose fitness is derived directly
from their genomes using a biophysically realistic model of protein folding and
interactions in the cytoplasm. The model organisms contain replication
controlling genes (DCGs) and genes modeling the mismatch repair (MMR)
complexes. We find that adaptation occurs through the transient fixation of a
mutator phenotype, regardless of particular perturbations in the fitness
landscape. The microscopic pathway of adaptation follows a well-defined set of
events: stochastic switching to the mutator phenotype first, then mutation in
the MMR complex that hitchhikes with a beneficial mutation in the DCGs, and
finally a compensating mutation in the MMR complex returning the population to
a non-mutator phenotype. Similarity of these results to reported adaptation
events points out to robust universal physical principles of evolutionary
adaptation.
