We propose some kinetic models of wealth exchange and investigate their
behavior on directed networks though numerical simulations. We observe that
network topology and directedness yields a variety of interesting features in
these models. The nature of asset distribution in such directed networks show
varied results, the degree of asset inequality increased with the degree of
disorder in the graphs.
