We discuss the thermodynamic properties of dark energy (DE) with Quintom
matter in spinor scenario. (1).Using the Cardy-Verlinde formula, we investigate
the conditions of validity of the Generalized Second Law of thermodynamics
(GSL) in the four evolutionary phases of Spinor Quintom-B model. We also
clarify its relation with three cosmological entropy bounds. (2). We take
thermodynamic stability of the combination between Spinor Quintom DE and the
generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG) perfect fluid into account, and we find that in
the case of $\beta>0$ and $0<T<T_0$, the system we consider is
thermodynamically stable. (3) Making use of the Maxwell Relation and
integrability condition, we derive all thermal quantities as functions of
either entropy or volume, and present the relation with quantum perturbation
stability.
