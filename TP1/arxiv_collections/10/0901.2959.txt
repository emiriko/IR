Euler-Poincare equations are derived for the dynamical folding of charged
molecular strands (such as DNA) modeled as flexible continuous filamentary
distributions of interacting rigid charge conformations. The new feature is
that the equations of motion for the dynamics of such molecular strands are
nonlocal when the screened Coulomb interactions, or Lennard-Jones potentials
between pairs of charges are included. These nonlocal dynamical equations are
derived in the convective representation of continuum motion by using modified
Euler-Poincare and Hamilton-Pontryagin variational formulations that illuminate
the various approaches within the framework of symmetry reduction of Hamilton's
principle for exact geometric rods. In the absence of nonlocal interactions,
the equations recover the classical Kirchhoff theory of elastic rods in the
spatial representation. The motion equations in the convective representation
are shown to be affine Euler-Poincare equations relative to a certain cocycle.
This property relates the geometry of the molecular strands to that of complex
fluids. An elegant change of variables allows a direct passage from the
infinite dimensional point of view to the covariant formulation in terms of
Lagrange-Poincare equations. In another revealing perspective, the convective
representation of the nonlocal equations of molecular strand motion is
transformed into quaternionic form.
