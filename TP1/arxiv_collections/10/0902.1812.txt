We report the discovery of a T8.5 dwarf, which is a companion to the M4 dwarf
Wolf 940. At a distance of 12.50 (+0.75,-0.67) pc, the angular separation of
32arcsec corresponds to a projected separation of 400 AU. The M4 primary
displays no Halpha emission, and we apply the age-activity relations of West et
al. to place a lower limit on the age of the system of 3.5 Gyr. Weak Halpha
absorption suggests some residual activity and we estimate an upper age limit
of 6 Gyr. We apply the relations of Bonfils et al for V-Ks and M_Ks to
determine the metallicity, [Fe/H] = -0.06 +/- 0.20 for Wolf~940A, and by
extension the T8.5 secondary, Wolf 940B. We have obtained JHK NIRI spectroscopy
and JHKL' photometry of Wolf 940B, and use these data, in combination with
theoretical extensions, to determine its bolometric flux, Fbol = 1.75 +/- 0.18
E-16 Wm^-2 and thus its luminosity log(L*/Lsun) = -6.07 +/- 0.04. Using the age
constraints for the system, and evolutionary structural models of Baraffe et
al. we determine Teff = 570 +/- 25K and log g = 4.75-5.00 for Wolf940B, based
on its bolometric luminosity. This represents the first determination of these
properties for a T8+ dwarf that does not rely on the fitting of T-dwarf
spectral models. This object represents the first system containing a T8+ dwarf
for which fiducial constraints on its properties are available, and we compare
its spectra with those of the latest very cool BT-Settl models. This clearly
demonstrates that the use of the (W_J,K/J) spectral ratios (used previously to
constrain Teff and log g) would have over-estimated Teff by ~100K.
