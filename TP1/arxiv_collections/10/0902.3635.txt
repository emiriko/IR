Using a human-oriented formal example proof of the (lim+) theorem, i.e. that
the sum of limits is the limit of the sum, which is of value for reference on
its own, we exhibit a non-permutability of beta-steps and delta+-steps
(according to Smullyan's classification), which is not visible with
non-liberalized delta-rules and not serious with further liberalized
delta-rules, such as the delta++-rule. Besides a careful presentation of the
search for a proof of (lim+) with several pedagogical intentions, the main
subject is to explain why the order of beta-steps plays such a practically
important role in some calculi.
