Each transiting planet discovered is characterized by 7 measurable
quantities, that may or may not be linked together (planet mass, radius,
orbital period, and star mass, radius, effective temperature, and metallicity).
Correlations between planet mass and period, surface gravity and period, planet
radius and star temperature have been previously observed among the known
transiting giant planets. Two classes of planets have been previously
identified based on their Safronov number. We use the CoRoTlux code to compare
simulated events to the sample of discovered planets and test the statistical
significance of these correlations. We first generate a stellar field with
planetary companions based on radial velocity discoveries and a planetary
evolution model, then apply a detection criterion that includes both
statistical and red noise sources. We compare the yield of our simulated survey
with the ensemble of 31 well-characterized giant transiting planets, using a
multivariate logistic analysis to assess whether the simulated distribution
matches the known transiting planets. Our multivariate analysis shows that our
simulated sample and observations are consistent to 76%. The mass vs. period
correlation for giant planets first observed with radial velocity holds with
transiting planets. Our model naturally explains the correlation between planet
surface gravity and period and the one between planet radius and stellar
effective temperature. Finally, we are also able to reproduce the previously
observed apparent bimodal distribution of Safronov numbers in 10% of our
simulated cases, although our model predicts a continuous distribution. This
shows that the evidence for the existence of two groups of planets with
different intrinsic properties is not statistically significant.
