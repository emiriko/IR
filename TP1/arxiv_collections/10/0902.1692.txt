Ground-plane cloak designs are presented, which minimize scattering of
electromagnetic radiation from metallic objects in the visible spectrum. It is
showed that simplified ground-plane cloaks made from only a few blocks of
all-dielectric isotropic materials, either embedded in a background medium or
in free space, can provide considerable cloaking performance while maintaining
their broadband nature. A design which operates isolated in free space that
cloaks radiation originating from a specified direction is also analyzed. These
schemes should be much easier to be demonstrated experimentally compared to
full designs.
