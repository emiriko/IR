A dynamic model of the asymmetric Ising glass is presented: an Ising model
with antiferromagnet bonds with probabilities q arranged at random in a
ferromagnetic matrix. The dynamics is introduced by changing the arrangement of
the antiferromagnetic bonds after n Monte Carlo steps but keeping the same
value of q and spin configuration. In the region where there is a second order
transition between the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic states the dynamic
behaviour follows that expected for motional narrowing and reverts to the
static behaviour only for large n. There is a different dynamic behaviour where
there is a first order transition between the ferromagnetic and spin glass
states where it shows no effects of motional narrowing. The implications of
this are discussed. This model is devised to explain the properties of doped
ZnO where the magnetisation is reduced when the exchange interactions change
with time.
