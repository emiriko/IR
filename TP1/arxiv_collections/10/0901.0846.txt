OGLE III and MOA II are discovering 600-1000 Galactic Bulge microlens events
each year. This stretches the resources available for intensive follow-up
monitoring of the lightcurves in search of anomalies caused by planets near the
lens stars. We advocate optimizing microlens planet searches by using an
automatic prioritization algorithm based on the planet detection zone area
probed by each new data point. This optimization scheme takes account of the
telescope and detector characteristics, observing overheads, sky conditions,
and the time available for observing on each night. The predicted brightness
and magnification of each microlens target is estimated by fitting to available
data points. The optimisation scheme then yields a decision on which targets to
observe and which to skip, and a recommended exposure time for each target,
designed to maximize the planet detection capability of the observations. The
optimal strategy maximizes detection of planet anomalies, and must be coupled
with rapid data reduction to trigger continuous follow-up of anomalies that are
thereby found. A web interface makes the scheme available for use by human or
robotic observers at any telescope. We also outline a possible self-organising
scheme that may be suitable for coordination of microlens observations by a
heterogeneous telescope network.
