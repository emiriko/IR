Observational evidences point to a common explosion mechanism of Type Ia
supernovae based on a delayed detonation of a white dwarf. However, all
attempts to find a convincing ignition mechanism based on a delayed detonation
in a destabilized, expanding, white dwarf have been elusive so far. One of the
possibilities that has been invoked is that an inefficient deflagration leads
to pulsation of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf, followed by formation of an
accretion shock that confines a carbon-oxygen rich core, while transforming the
kinetic energy of the collapsing halo into thermal energy of the core, until an
inward moving detonation is formed. This chain of events has been termed
Pulsating Reverse Detonation (PRD). In this work we present three dimensional
numerical simulations of PRD models from the time of detonation initiation up
to homologous expansion. Different models characterized by the amount of mass
burned during the deflagration phase, M_defl, give explosions spanning a range
of kinetic energies, K ~ (1.0-1.2) foes, and 56Ni masses, M(56Ni) ~ 0.6-0.8
M_sun, which are compatible with what is expected for typical Type Ia
supernovae. Spectra and light curves of angle-averaged spherically symmetric
versions of the PRD models are discussed. Type Ia supernova spectra pose the
most stringent requirements on PRD models.
