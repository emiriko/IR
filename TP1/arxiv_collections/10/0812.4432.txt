We study the conductivity, susceptibility and diffusion of a strongly coupled
quark gluon plasma from the holographic perspective. We calculate general
expressions for these quantities in the presence of finite baryon density and
show that in this context, for the D3/D7 intersection the Einstein relation
holds, providing another non-trivial check of the holographic correspondence at
finite temperature.
