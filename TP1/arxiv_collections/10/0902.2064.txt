Efficient selection of emission line galaxies at z > 1 by photometric
information in wide field surveys is one of the keys for future spectroscopic
surveys to constrain dark energy using the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)
signature. Here we estimate the H alpha and [O II] line luminosity functions of
galaxies at z = 0.5-1.7 using a novel approach where multi-wavelength imaging
data is used to jointly estimate both photometric redshifts and star-formation
rates. These photometric estimates of line luminosities at high-redshift use
the large data sets of the Subaru Deep Field and Subaru XMM-Newton Deep Field
(covering \sim 1 deg^2) and are calibrated with the spectroscopic data of the
local Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies. The derived luminosity functions
(especially H alpha) are in reasonable agreement with the past estimates based
on spectroscopic or narrow-band-filter surveys. This dataset is useful for
examining the photometric selection of target galaxies for BAO surveys because
of the large cosmological volume covered and the large number of galaxies with
detailed photometric information. We use the sample to derive the photometric
and physical properties of emission line galaxies to assist planning for future
spectroscopic BAO surveys. We also show some examples of photometric selection
procedures which can efficiently select these emission line galaxies.
