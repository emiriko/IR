We analyze all possible extensions of the recently proposed minimal
renormalizable SUSY SU(5) grand unified model with the inclusion of an
additional A4 flavor symmetry. We find that there are five possible cases but
only one of them is phenomenologically interesting. We develop in detail such
case and we show how the fermion masses and mixing angles come out. As a
prediction we obtain the neutrino masses of order of 0.1 eV with an inverted
hierarchy.
