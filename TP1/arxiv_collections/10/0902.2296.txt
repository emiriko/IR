A sequential multiple testing procedure recently introduced by Heinrich, Bach
and Kornmeier allows to "zoom in" on, and thus identify regions with highly

state a cognate of this procedure in general form and to prove that it controls
the familywise error. Two possible applications are briefly indicated.
