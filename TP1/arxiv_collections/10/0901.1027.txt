The Italian gamma-ray satellite AGILE has recently reported the detection of
some variable high-energy sources likely of galactic origin. These sources do
not have any obvious counterpart at lower energies. We propose that these
sources are produced in proton-dominated jets of galactic microquasars. We
develop a model for microquasar jets that takes into account both primary
leptons and protons and all relevant radiative processes, including secondary
particle emission and gamma-ray attenuation due to pair creation in the jet. We
obtain spectral energy distributions that correspond to what is observed by
AGILE, with most of the power concentrated between 100 MeV and 10 GeV and
reaching luminosities of $10^{34-35}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We make detailed spectral
predictions that can be tested by the Fermi gamma-ray telescope in the
immediate future. We conclude that hadronic jets in galactic accreting sources
can be responsible for the variable unidentified gamma-ray sources detected by
AGILE.
