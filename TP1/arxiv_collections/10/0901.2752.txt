The foundations of QM can find a consistent and exhaustive explanation in a
new theoretical context. The Bridge Theory (BT) allows us to justify both
classic and quantum electromagnetic phenomenology by using classical concepts.
In this paper we review the bases of the BT originating from the role that the
transverse component of the Poynting vector plays in localising energy in the
neighbourhood of an electromagnetic source and we analyse the quantum
implications.
