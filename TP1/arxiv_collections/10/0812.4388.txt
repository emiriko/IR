These proceedings are based on lectures given at the Helmholtz International
Summer School Heavy Quark Physics at the Bogoliubov Laboratory of Theoretical
Physics, Dubna, Russia, during August 2008. I review the current status of CP
violation in B meson decays from the B factories. These results can be used,
along with measurements of the sides of the Unitarity Triangle, to test the CKM
mechanism. In addition I discuss experimental studies of B decays to final
states with `spin-one' particles.
