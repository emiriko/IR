We argue that the time measured by a light clock operating with photons
rather than classical light requires a refinement of the standard clock
postulate in general relativity. In the presence of a gravitational field,
already the one-loop quantum corrections to classical Maxwell theory affect
light propagation and the construction of observers' frames of reference.
Carefully taking into account these kinematic effects, a concise geometric
expression for the time shown by a light clock is obtained. This result has
far-reaching implications for physics in strong gravitational fields.
