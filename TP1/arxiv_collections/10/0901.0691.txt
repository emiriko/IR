We report shot noise cross correlation measurements in a four terminal beam
splitter configuration. By using two tunnel barriers as independent electron
sources with tunable statistics and energy, we can adjust the degree of quantum
interference that results when the electrons scatter at a beam splitter. Even
though quantum interference is only weakly affected by noise, it can be
strongly suppressed by detuning the energies of the interfering electrons. Our
results illustrate the importance of indistinguishability for quantum
interference, and its resilience to unsynchronized electron sources and noise.
