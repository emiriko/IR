We present high-speed optical photometry of the anomalous X-ray pulsar 1E
1048.1-5937 obtained with ULTRACAM on the 8.2-m Very Large Telescope in June
2007. We detect 1E 1048.1-5937 at a magnitude of i'=25.3+/-0.2, consistent with
the values found by Wang et al. (2008) and hence confirming their conclusion
that the source was approximately 1 mag brighter than in 2003-2006 due to an
on-going X-ray flare that started in March 2007. The increased source
brightness enabled us to detect optical pulsations with an identical period
(6.458 s) to the X-ray pulsations. The rms pulsed fraction in our data is
21+/-7%, approximately the same as the 2-10 keV X-ray rms pulsed fraction. The
optical and X-ray pulse profiles show similar morphologies and appear to be
approximately in phase with each other, the latter lagging the former by only
0.06+/-0.02 cycles. The optical pulsations in 1E 1048.1-5937 are very similar
in nature to those observed in 4U 0142+61. The implications of our observations
for models of anomalous X-ray pulsars are discussed.
