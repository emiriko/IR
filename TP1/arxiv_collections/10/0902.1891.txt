NTRU public key cryptosystem is well studied lattice-based Cryptosystem along
with Ajtai-Dwork and GGH systems. Underlying
  NTRU is a hard mathematical problem of finding short vectors in a certain
lattice. (Shamir 1997) presented a lattice-based attack by which he could find
the original secret key or alternate key. Shamir concluded if one designs a
variant of NTRU where the calculations involved during encryption and
decryption are non-commutative then the system will be secure against Lattice
based attack.This paper presents a new cryptosystem with above property and we
have proved that it is completely secure against Lattice based attack. It
operates in the non-commutative ring M=M_k Z[X]/(X^n - I_{k*k}, where M is a
matrix ring of k*k matrices of polynomials in R={Z}[X]/(X^n-1). Moreover We
have got speed improvement by a factor of O(k^{1.624) over NTRU for the same
bit of information.
