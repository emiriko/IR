The time-dependent Dirac equation is solved using the three-dimensional
Finite Difference-Time Domain (FDTD) method. The dynamics of the electron wave
packet in a scalar potential is studied in the arrangements associated with the
Klein paradox: potential step barriers and linear potentials. No Klein paradox
is observed.
