In the Israel-Stewart's theory of 2nd order dissipative hydrodynamics, we
have simulated $\phi$ production in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at
$\sqrt{s}_{NN}$=200 GeV. Evolution of QGP fluid with viscosity over the entropy
ratio $\eta/s$=0.25, thermalised at $\tau_i$=0.2 fm, with initial energy
density $\epsilon_i$=5.1 $GeV/fm^3$ explains the experimental data on $\phi$
multiplicity, integrated $v_2$, mean $p_T$, $p_T$ spectra and elliptic flow in
central and mid-central Au+Au collisions. $\eta/s$=0.25 is also consistent with
centrality dependence of $\phi$ $p_T$ spectra in Cu+Cu collisions. The central
energy density in Cu+Cu collisions is $\epsilon_i$=3.48 $GeV/fm^3$.
