The quark combination mechanism of QGP hadronization is applied to
nucleus-nucleus collisions at top SPS energy. The yields, rapidity and
transverse momentum distributions of identified hadrons in most central Pb+Pb
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 17.3$ GeV are systematically studied. The
calculated results are in agreement with the experimental data from NA49
Collaboration. The longitudinal and transverse collective flows and strangeness
of the hot and dense quark matter produced in nucleus-nucleus collisions at top
SPS energy are investigated. It is found that the collective flow of strange
quarks is stronger than light quarks, which is compatible with that at RHIC
energies, and the strangeness is almost the same as those at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$
62.4, 130, 200 GeV.
