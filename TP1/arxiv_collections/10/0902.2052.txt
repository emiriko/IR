In this paper we present a statistical study of edge fluctuations taken with
the Gas Puffing Imaging (GPI) diagnostics. We carry out a comparison of GPI
signal from an extensive database including four devices (two Tokamaks and two
Reversed Field Pinches). The data are analyzed in terms of their statistical
moments Skewness and Kurtosis, as done in [B. Labit, et al, Phys. Rev. Lett.
\textbf{98}, 255002 (2007)]. The data align along parabolic curves, although
different from machine to machine, with some spread around the best-fitting
curve. A discussion about the meaning of the parabolic trend as well as the
departure of real data from it is provided. A phenomenological model is finally
provided, attempting to accomodate experimental evidence.
