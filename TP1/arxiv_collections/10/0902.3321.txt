At many universities, astronomy is a popular way for non-science majors to
fulfill a general education requirement. Because general-education astronomy
may be the only college-level science course taken by these students, it is the
last chance to shape the science attitudes of these future journalists,
teachers, politicians, and voters. I report on an attempt to measure and induce
changes in science attitudes in my general-education astronomy course. I
describe construction of the attitude survey, classroom activities designed to
influence attitudes, and give numerical results indicating a significant
improvement. In contrast, the literature on attitudes in introductory physics
courses generally reports stagnation or decline. I briefly comment on some
plausible explanations for this difference.
