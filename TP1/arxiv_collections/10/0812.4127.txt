Flat or almost flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies can be explained by
logarithmic gravitational potentials. The field equations of GR admit of
spacetime metrics with such behaviors. The scenario can be interpreted either
as an alternative theory of gravitation or, equivalently, as a dark matter
paradigm. In the latter interpretation, one is led to assign a dark companion
to the baryonic matter who's size and distribution is determined by the mass of
the baryons. The formalism also opens up a way to support Milgrom's idea that
the acceleration of a test object in a gravitational field is not simply the
newtonian gravitational force $g_N$, but rather an involved function of
$(g_N/a_0)$, $a_0$ MOND's universal acceleration. Keywords: Dark matter;
