The effects of magnetic doping on a EuB_6 single crystal were investigated
based on magnetic and transport measurements. A modest 5% Sm substitution for
Eu changes the magnetic and transport properties dramatically and gives rise to
concurrent antiferromagnetic and metal-insulator transitions (MIT) from
ferromagnetic MIT for EuB6. Magnetic doping simultaneously changes the
itinerant carrier density and the magnetic interactions. We discuss the origin
of the concurrent magnetic MIT in (Eu,Sm)B_6.
