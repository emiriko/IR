We studied a response of Bi-2212 mesa type structures to 100 GHz microwave
radiation. We found that applying magnetic field of about 0.1 T across the
layers enables to observe collective Shapiro step response corresponding to a
synchronization of all 50 intrinsic Josephson junctions (IJJ) of the mesa. At
high microwave power we observed up to 10th harmonics of the fundamental
Shapiro step. Besides, we found microwave induced flux-flow step position of
which is proportional to the square root of microwave power and that can exceed
at high enough powers 1 THz operating frequency of IJJ oscillations.
