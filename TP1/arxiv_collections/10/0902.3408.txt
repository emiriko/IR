We define a two-dimensional noncommutative space as a limit of finite-matrix
spaces which have space-time dimension three. We show that on such space the
Grosse-Wulkenhaar (renormalizable) action has natural interpretation as the
action for the scalar field coupled to the curvature. We also discuss a natural
generalization to four dimensions.
