We demonstrate the coherent transport of two-dimensional (2D) arrays of small
ensembles of neutral atoms in a shift register architecture based on 2D arrays
of microlenses. We show the scalability of the transport process by presenting
the repeated hand-over of atoms from site to site. We prove the conservation of
coherence during transport, reloading, and a full shift register cycle. This
shows that the fundamental shift sequence can be cascaded and thus scaled to
complex and versatile 2D architectures for atom-based quantum information
processing, quantum simulation, and the investigation of quantum degenerate
gases.
