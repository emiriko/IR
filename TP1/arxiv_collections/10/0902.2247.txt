STEP (the Satellite Test of the Equivalence Principle) will advance
experimental limits on violations of Einstein's equivalence principle (EP) from
their present sensitivity of 2 parts in 10^13 to 1 part in 10^18 through
multiple comparison of the motions of four pairs of test masses of different
compositions in an earth-orbiting drag-free satellite. Dimensional arguments
suggest that violations, if they exist, should be found in this range, and they
are also suggested by leading attempts at unified theories of fundamental
interactions (e.g. string theory) and cosmological theories involving dynamical
dark energy. Discovery of a violation would constitute the discovery of a new
force of nature and provide a critical signpost toward unification. A null
result would be just as profound, because it would close off any possibility of
a natural-strength coupling between standard-model fields and the new light
degrees of freedom that such theories generically predict (e.g., dilatons,
moduli, quintessence). STEP should thus be seen as the intermediate-scale
component of an integrated strategy for fundamental physics experiments that
already includes particle accelerators (at the smallest scales) and supernova
probes (at the largest). The former may find indirect evidence for new fields
via their missing-energy signatures, and the latter may produce direct evidence
through changes in cosmological equation of state--but only a gravitational
experiment like STEP can go further and reveal how or whether such a field
couples to the rest of the standard model. It is at once complementary to the
other two kinds of tests, and a uniquely powerful probe of fundamental physics
in its own right.
