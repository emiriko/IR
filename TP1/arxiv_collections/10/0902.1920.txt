We calculate the spectra of charmonium and bottomium in an approximation
scheme which treats hard gluons perturbatively while soft gluons are expanded
in a set of localized wave functions. Quark-antiquark and quark-antiquark-gluon
sectors are included. Reasonable agreement with 2 parameters only is found but
the spectra are too coulombic. Despite large coupling constant the admixture of
the quark-antiquark-gluon sector is found to be remarkably small.
