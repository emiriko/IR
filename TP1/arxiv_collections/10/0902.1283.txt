We report magnetic and magnetoelectric studies on BiFeO3 and divalent cation
(A) suvtitute Bi0.7A0.3FeO3 (A = Sr,Ba, and Sr0.5Ba0.5). It is shown that the
rapid increase of magnetization at the Neel temperature (TN = 642 K) is
suppressed in the co-doped compound A = Sr0.5Ba0.5. All the divalent subtituted
compounds show enhanced magnetization and hysteresis loop. Both longitudinal
and transverse magnetoelectric coefficients were measured using the dynamical
lock-in technique. The co-doped compound shows the highest magnetoelectric
coefficient at room temperature although it is not the compound with the
highest saturation magnetization. It is found that as the size of the A-site
cation increses, the transverse magnetoelectric coeffient increases and exceeds
the longitudinal magnetoelectric coefficient. It is suggested that changes in
magnetic domain structure and magnetostriction are possible reasons for the
observed changes in the magnetoelectric coefficients.
