We discuss the calculation of disconnected diagrams needed for determining
the strange quark content of the nucleon on the lattice. We present results for
the strange scalar form factor and the related parameter f_Ts, which enters
into the cross-section for the scattering of dark matter off nuclei in
supersymmetric extensions of the standard model. In addition, we present
results for the strange contribution to the nucleon's axial and electromagnetic
form factors. The calculations were performed with two dynamical flavors of
Wilson fermions on a 24^3 x 64 anisotropic lattice with a_s = 3a_t = 0.11 fm
and M_pi ~ 400 MeV.
