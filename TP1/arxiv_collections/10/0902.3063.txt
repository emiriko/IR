Although reliable models may predict the detection efficiency of
semiconductor detectors, measurements are needed to check the parameters
supplied by the manufacturers namely the thicknesses of dead layer, beryllium
window and crystal active area. The efficiency of three silicon detectors has
been precisely investigated in their entire photon energy range of detection.
In the 0 to a few keV range, we have developed a new method based on the
detection of the 2E1 decay of the metastable Ar17+ 2s -> 1s transition. Very
good theoretical knowledge of the energetic distribution of the 2E1 decay mode
enables precise characterization of the absorbing layers in front of the
detectors. In the high-energy range (> 10 keV), the detector crystal thickness
plays a major role in the detection efficiency and has been determined using a
241Am source.
