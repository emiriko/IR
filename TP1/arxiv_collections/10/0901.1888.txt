We use an analytic model to study how inhomogeneous hydrogen reionization
affects the temperature distribution of the intergalactic medium (IGM). During
this process, the residual energy of each ionizing photon is deposited in the
IGM as heat, increasing its temperature to 20,000-30,000 K; subsequent
expansion of the Universe then cools the gas. Because reionization most likely
proceeds from high to low densities, underdense voids are ionized last, have
less time to cool, and are (on average) warmer than mean-density gas
immediately after reionization is complete (an "inverted" equation of state).
  From this initial configuration, the low-density gas cools quickly and
eventually returns to a more normal equation of state. The rapidly evolving
temperature introduces systematic uncertainties in measurements of the ionizing
background at z~6. For example, late reionization implies rapid cooling, so
that the ionizing background would have to evolve even more rapidly at z ~5-6
than typically claimed. This degeneracy is difficult to disentangle, because
the Lyman-alpha forest probes only a narrow range in densities (over which the
gas is nearly isothermal). However, higher Lyman-series transitions probe wider
density ranges, sampling different effective temperatures, and offer a new way
to measure the IGM equation of state that should work where nearly saturated
absorption precludes other methods. This will help to separate evolution in
temperature from that in the ionizing background. While more detailed study
with hydrodynamic simulations is needed, we show that such measurements could
potentially distinguish early and late reionization using only a handful of
lines of sight.
