We explore the Ziptronix Direct Bond Interconnect technology for the
integration of sensors and readout integrated circuits (ROICs) for high energy
physics. The technology utilizes an oxide bond to form a robust mechanical
connection between layers which serves to assist with the formation of metallic
interlayer connections. We report on testing results of sample sensors bonded
to ROICs and thinned to 100 microns.
