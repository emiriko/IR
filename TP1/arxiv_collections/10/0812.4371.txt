The impact-parameter representation of the spin-flip amplitude of hadron
elastic scattering is examined in different unitarisation schemes, taking the
Born term of the spin-flip amplitude from the Dubna Dynamical Model (DDM). It
is shown that the basic properties of the unitarisation schemes are independent
of the functional form used for unitarisation but heavily depend on the
asymptotic value of the unitarised amplitude.
