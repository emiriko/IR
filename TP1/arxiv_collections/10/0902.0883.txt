A simple and computationally efficient scheme to calculate approximate
imaginary-frequency dependent polarizability, hence asymptotic van der Waals
coefficient, within density functional theory is proposed. The dynamical
dipolar polarizabilities of atoms and molecules are calculated starting from
the Thomas-Fermi-von Weizs\"acker (TFvW) approximation for the
independent-electron kinetic energy functional. The van der Waals coefficients
for a number of closed-shell ions and a few molecules are hence calculated and
compared with available values obtained by fully first-principles calculations.
The success in these test cases shows the potential of the proposed TFvW
approximate response function in capturing the essence of long range
correlations and may give useful information for constructing a functional
which naturally includes van der Waals interactions.
