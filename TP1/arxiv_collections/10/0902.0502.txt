We study the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with large gluino
mass m_{\tilde{g}} >> 1 TeV. In particular, we discuss the LHC supersymmetry
discovery signatures with n leptons + jets + E^{miss}_T, n >= 0 for the MSSM
with large gluino mass. We show that for some relations among squark and
neutralino masses leptonic signatures with n leptons + jets + E^{miss}_T, n >=
1 do not allow to discover supersymmetry at the LHC and the only supersymmetry
discovery signature remains the signature with no leptons + jets + E^{miss}_T.
Moreover, for LSP mass close to squark masses the LHC discovery potential for
this signature is strongly reduced.
