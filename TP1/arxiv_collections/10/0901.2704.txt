The evolution of a spin-wave packet trapped between two direct
current-carrying wires placed on the surface of a ferrite film is observed by
Brillouin light scattering. The wires act as semi-transparent mirrors confining
the packet. Because the spin-wave energy partially passes through these
mirrors, trains of spin-wave packets are generated outside the trap. A
numerical model of this process is presented and applied to the case when the
current in the wires is dynamically controlled. This dynamical control of the
mirror reflectivity provides new functionalities interesting for the field of
spin-wave logic like that of a spin-wave memory cell.
