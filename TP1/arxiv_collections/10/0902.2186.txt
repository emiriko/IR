This technical report is designed to serve as a citable reference for the
original prioritized object list that the Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia
Tech released on its website in September of 2008. It is also expected to serve
as the primary citable reference for the research associated with this list
until the publication of a detailed, peer-reviewed paper.
  The original prioritized list of object classes resulted from a needs
assessment involving 8 motor-impaired patients with amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS) and targeted, in-person interviews of 15 motor-impaired ALS
patients. All of these participants were drawn from the Emory ALS Center.
  The prioritized object list consists of 43 object classes ranked by how
important the participants considered each class to be for retrieval by an
assistive robot. We intend for this list to be used by researchers to inform
the design and benchmarking of robotic systems, especially research related to
autonomous mobile manipulation.
