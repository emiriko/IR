This paper summarizes some of the major calibration and image reconstruction
techniques used in radio interferometry and describes them in a common
mathematical framework. The use of this framework has a number of benefits,
ranging from clarification of the fundamentals, use of standard numerical
optimization techniques, and generalization or specialization to new
algorithms.
