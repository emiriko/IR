We formulate an existence theorem that states that given localized scalar and
vector time-dependent sources satisfying the continuity equation, there exist
two retarded fields that satisfy a set of four field equations. If the theorem
is applied to the usual electromagnetic charge and current densities, the
retarded fields are identified with the electric and magnetic fields and the
associated field equations with Maxwell's equations. This application of the
theorem suggests that charge conservation can be considered to be the
fundamental assumption underlying Maxwell's equations.
