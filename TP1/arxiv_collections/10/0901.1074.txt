The mathematical apparatus of quantum--mechanical angular momentum
(re)coupling, developed originally to describe spectroscopic phenomena in
atomic, molecular, optical and nuclear physics, is embedded in modern algebraic
settings which emphasize the underlying combinational aspects. SU(2) recoupling
theory, involving Wigner's 3nj symbols, as well as the related problems of
their calculations, general properties, asymptotic limits for large entries,
play nowadays a prominent role also in quantum gravity and quantum computing
applications. We refer to the ingredients of this theory -and of its extension
to other Lie and quantum group- by using the collective term of `spin
networks'. Recent progress is recorded about the already established
connections with the mathematical theory of discrete orthogonal polynomials
(the so-called Askey Scheme), providing powerful tools based on asymptotic
expansions, which correspond on the physical side to various levels of
semi-classical limits. These results are useful not only in theoretical
molecular physics but also in motivating algorithms for the computationally
demanding problems of molecular dynamics and chemical reaction theory, where
large angular momenta are typically involved. As for quantum chemistry,
applications of these techniques include selection and classification of
complete orthogonal basis sets in atomic and molecular problems, either in
configuration space (Sturmian orbitals) or in momentum space. In this paper we
list and discuss some aspects of these developments -such as for instance the
hyperquantization algorithm- as well as a few applications to quantum gravity
and topology, thus providing evidence of a unifying background structure.
