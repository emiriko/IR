We develop a pseudo-differential Weyl calculus on nilpotent Lie groups which
allows one to deal with magnetic perturbations of right invariant vector
fields. For this purpose we investigate an infinite-dimensional Lie group
constructed as the semidirect product of a nilpotent Lie grup and an
appropriate function space thereon. We single out an appropriate coadjoint
orbit in the semidirect product and construct our pseudo-differential calculus
as a Weyl quantization of that orbit.
