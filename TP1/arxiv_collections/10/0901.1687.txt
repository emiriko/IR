Previous studies have suggested complementary models of the elementary
particles as (a) quantum knots and (b) preonic nuclei that are field and
particle descriptions, respectively, of the same particles. This earlier work,
carried out in the context of standard electroweak (SU(2) x U(1)) physics, is
here extended to the strong interactions by the introduction of color (SU(3))
charges.
