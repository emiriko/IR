An original experimental procedure is presented to measure the mechanical
interaction between tongue and teeth and palate during speech production. It
consists in using edentulous people as subjects and to insert pressure sensors
in the structure of a replication of their dental prosthesis. This is assumed
to induce no speech production perturbation for subjects who are used to speak
with their prosthesis. Data collected from 4 subjects of French demonstrate the
usability of the system.
