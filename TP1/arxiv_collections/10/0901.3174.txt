Correlations among pulse properties in the prompt emission of long GRBs can
potentially be used as cosmological distance indicators to estimate redshifts
of GRBs to which these pulses belong. We demonstrate application of this
technique to a sample of GRBs for which redshifts are not known. We also study
the scatter of predicted redshifts of pulses found within individual bursts. We
explore the characteristics of this scatter in hopes of identifying systematic
corrections and/or pulse subsets that can be used to increase the technique's
reliability.
