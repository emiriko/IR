A combination of several sources including: radiogenic heating, processes of
mantle and core formation and differentiation, delayed radiogenic heating,
earthquakes, and tidal friction account for the surface heat flux in the Earth.
Radiogenic heating is of much interest in various fields of geosciences.
Inferences from recent experiments with reactor antineutrinos and solar
neutrinos showed that the age of geoneutrinos is at hand for constraining
radiogenic heat. Because of the deep penetrating properties of the neutrinos
this type of radiation in the decay of the heat producing elements (HPE) is
ideally suited for the investigation of the deep interiors of the Earth
compared to conventional radiometric methods for HPE employing alpha-, beta-
and gamma rays. This presentation will address the considerations for a
dedicated geoneutrino detector to be set up for investigating the interior
regions all the way to the center of the Earth.
