Forward physics with CMS at the LHC covers a wide range of physics subjects,
including very low-x_Bj QCD, underlying event and multiple interactions
characteristics, gamma-mediated processes, shower development at the energy
scale of primary cosmic ray interactions with the atmosphere, diffraction in
the presence of a hard scale and even MSSM Higgs discovery in central exclusive
production. Selected feasibility studies to illustrate the forward physics
potential of CMS are presented.
