We study a quantum double model whose degrees of freedom are Ising anyons.
The terms of the Hamiltonian of this system give rise to a competition between
single and double topologies. By studying the energy spectra of the Hamiltonian
at different values of the coupling constants, we find extended gapless regions
which include a large number of critical points described by conformal field
theories with central charge c=1. These theories are part of the Z_2 orbifold
of the bosonic theory compactified on a circle. We observe that the Hilbert
space of our anyonic model can be associated with extended Dynkin diagrams of
affine Lie algebras which yields exact solutions at some critical points. In
certain special regimes, our model corresponds to the Hamiltonian limit of the
Ashkin-Teller model, and hence integrability over a wide range of coupling
parameters is established.
