We compare the properties of galaxies that form in a cosmological simulation
without strong feedback to observations at z=0. We confirm previous findings
that models without strong feedback overproduce the observed galaxy baryonic
mass function, especially at the low and high mass extremes. Through
post-processing we investigate what kinds of feedback would be required to
reproduce observed galaxy masses and star formation rates. To mimic an extreme
form of "preventive" feedback (e.g., AGN radio mode) we remove all baryonic
mass that was originally accreted via "hot mode" from shock-heated gas. This
does not bring the high mass end of the galaxy mass function into agreement
with observations because much of the stellar mass in these systems formed at
high redshift from baryons that originally accreted via "cold mode" onto lower
mass progenitors. An efficient "ejective" feedback mechanism, such as supernova
driven winds, must reduce the masses of these progenitors. Feedback must also
reduce the masses of lower mass z=0 galaxies, which assemble at lower redshifts
and have much lower star formation rates. If we monotonically re-map galaxy
masses to reproduce the observed mass function, but retain the simulation's
predicted star formation rates, we obtain fairly good agreement with the
observed sequence of star-forming galaxies but fail to recover the observed
population of passive, low star formation rate galaxies. Suppressing all hot
mode accretion improves agreement for high mass galaxies but worsens the
agreement at intermediate masses. Reproducing these z=0 observations requires a
feedback mechanism that dramatically suppresses star formation in a fraction of
galaxies, increasing with mass, while leaving star formation rates of other
galaxies essentially unchanged.
