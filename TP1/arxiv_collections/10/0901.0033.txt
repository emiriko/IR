Extracting market expectations has always been an important issue when making
national policies and investment decisions in financial markets. In option
markets, the most popular way has been to extract implied volatilities to
assess the future variability of the underlying with the use of the Black and
Scholes formula. In this manuscript, we propose a novel way to extract the
whole time varying distribution of the market implied asset price from option
prices. We use a Bayesian nonparametric method that makes use of the Sethuraman
representation for Dirichlet processes to take into account the evolution of
distributions in time. As an illustration, we present the analysis of options
on the SP500 index.
