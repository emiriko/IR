In the framework of standard static space times, we state a family of
sufficient or necessary conditions for a set of physically reasonable energy
and convergence conditions in relativity and related theories. We concentrate
our study on questions about the sub-harmonicity of the warping function, the
scalar curvature map, conformal hyperbolicity, conjugate points and the
time-like diameter of this class of space-times.
