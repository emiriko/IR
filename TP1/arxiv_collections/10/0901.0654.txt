The behavior of a heavy tagged intruder immersed in a bath of particles
evolving under ballistic annihilation dynamics is investigated. The
Fokker-Planck equation for this system is derived and the peculiarities of the
corresponding diffusive behavior are worked out. In the long time limit, the
intruder velocity distribution function approaches a Gaussian form, but with a
different temperature from its bath counterpart. As a consequence of the
continuous decay of particles in the bath, the mean squared displacement
increases exponentially in the collision per particle time scale. Analytical
results are finally successfully tested against Monte Carlo numerical
simulations.
