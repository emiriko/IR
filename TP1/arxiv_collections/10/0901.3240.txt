The far-IR spectral window plays host to a wide range of both spectroscopic
and photometric diagnostics with which to open the protoplanetary disks and
exoplanet research to wavelengths completely blocked by the Earth's atmosphere.
These include some of the key atomic (e.g., oxygen) and molecular (e.g., water)
cooling lines, the dust thermal emission, the water ice features as well as
many other key chemical tracers. Most of these features can not be observed
from ground-based telescopes but play a critical diagnostic in a number of key
areas including the early stages of planet formation and potentially
exoplanets. The proposed Japanese-led IR space telescope SPICA, with its 3.5m
cooled mirror will be the next step in sensitivity after Herschel. SPICA has
been recently selected to go to the next stage of the ESA's Cosmic Vision
2015-2025 process. This contribution summarizes the design concept behind
SAFARI: an imaging far-IR spectrometer covering the ~30-210um waveband that is
one of a suite of instruments for SPICA; it also highlights some of the science
questions that it will be possible to address in the field of exoplanets and
planet formation.
