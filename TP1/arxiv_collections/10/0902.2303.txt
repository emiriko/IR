We consider topological solitons in the CP^n sigma models in two space
dimensions. In particular, we study "kinks", which are independent of one
coordinate up to a rotation of the target space, and "chains", which are
periodic in one coordinate up to a rotation of the target space. Kinks and
chains both exhibit constituents, similar to monopoles and calorons in SU(n)
Yang-Mills-Higgs and Yang-Mills theories. We examine the constituent structure
using Lie algebras.
