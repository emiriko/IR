Graph transformation is concerned with the manipulation of graphs by means of
rules. Graph grammars have been traditionally studied using techniques from
category theory. In previous works, we introduced Matrix Graph Grammars (MGGs)
as a purely algebraic approach for the study of graph grammars and graph
dynamics, based on the representation of graphs by means of their adjacency
matrices. MGGs have been succesfully applied to problems such as applicability
of rule sequences, sequentialization and reachability, providing new analysis
techniques and generalizing and improving previous results.
  Our next objective is to generalize MGGs in order to approach computational
complexity theory and "static" properties of graphs out of the "dynamics" of
certain grammars. In the present work, we start building bridges between MGGs
and complexity by introducing what we call "Monotone Complex Logic", which
allows establishing a (bijective) link between MGGs and complex analysis. We
use this logic to recast the formulation and basic building blocks of MGGs as
more proper geometric and analytic concepts (scalar products, norms,
distances). MGG rules can also be interpreted - via operators - as complex
numbers. Interestingly, the subset they define can be characterized as the
Sierpinski gasket.
