We review the present state of understanding of the Barkhausen effect in soft
ferromagnetic materials. Barkhausen noise (BN) is generated by the
discontinuous motion of magnetic domains as they interact with impurities and
defects. BN is one of the many examples of crackling noise, arising in a
variety of contexts with remarkably similar features, and occurring when a
system responds in a jerky manner to a smooth external forcing. Among all
crackling system, we focus on BN, where a complete and consistent picture
emerges thanks to an exactly solvable model of avalanche dynamics, known as the
ABBM model, which ultimately describes the system in terms of a Langevin
equation for the velocity of the avalanche front. Despite its simplicity, the
ABBM model is able to accurately reproduce the phenomenology observed in the
experiments on a large class of magnetic materials, as long as universal
properties are involved. To complete the picture and to understand the
long-standing discrepancy between the ABBM theory and the experiments, which
otherwise agree exceptionally well, consisting of the puzzling asymmetric shape
of the noise pulses, microscopic details must be taken into account, namely the
effects of eddy current retardation. These effects can be incorporated in the
model, and result, to a first-order approximation, in a negative effective mass
associated with the wall. The progress made in understanding BN is potentially
relevant for other crackling systems: on the one hand, the ABBM model turns out
to be a paradigmatic model for the universal behaviour of avalanche dynamics;
on the other hand, the microscopic explanation of the asymmetry in the noise
pulses suggests that inertial effects may also be at the origin of pulses
asymmetry observed in other crackling systems.
