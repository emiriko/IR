We construct a family of Markov processes with continuous sample trajectories
on an infinite-dimensional space, the Thoma simplex. The family depends on
three continuous parameters, one of which, the Jack parameter, is similar to
the beta parameter in random matrix theory. The processes arise in a scaling
limit transition from certain finite Markov chains, the so called up-down
chains on the Young graph with the Jack edge multiplicities. Each of the limit
Markov processes is ergodic and its stationary distribution is a symmetrizing
measure. The infinitesimal generators of the processes are explicitly computed;
viewed as selfadjoint operators in the L^2 spaces over the symmetrizing
measures, the generators have purely discrete spectrum which is explicitly
described.
  For the special value 1 of the Jack parameter, the limit Markov processes
coincide with those of the recent work by Borodin and the author (Prob. Theory
Rel. Fields 144 (2009), 281--318; arXiv:0706.1034). In the limit as the Jack
parameter goes to 0, our family of processes degenerates to the one-parameter
family of diffusions on the Kingman simplex studied long ago by Ethier and
Kurtz in connection with some models of population genetics.
  The techniques of the paper are essentially algebraic. The main computations
are performed in the algebra of shifted symmetric functions with the Jack
parameter and rely on the concept of anisotropic Young diagrams due to Kerov.
