We model the large kinematic data sets for the four Milky Way dwarf
spheroidal (dSph) satellites: Carina, Fornax, Sculptor and Sextans, recently
published by Walker et al. The member stars are selected using a reliable
dynamical interloper removal scheme tested on simulated data. Our member
selection is more restrictive than the one based on metallicity indicators as
it removes not only contamination due to Milky Way stars but also the unbound
stars from the tidal tails. We model the cleaned data sets by adjusting the
solutions of the Jeans equations to the profiles of the projected velocity
dispersion and kurtosis. The data are well reproduced by models where mass
follows light and the best-fitting stellar orbits are isotropic to weakly
tangential, as expected from the tidal stirring scenario. The Fornax dwarf,
with more than 2400 member stars, is a dSph galaxy with the most accurately
determined mass to date: its 1 sigma error following from the sampling errors
of the velocity moments is below 5 percent. With mass-to-light ratio of 97
solar units, Sextans seems to be the most dark matter dominated of the four
dSph galaxies.
