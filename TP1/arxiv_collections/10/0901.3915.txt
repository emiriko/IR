The recently developed chiral nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) potential by Epelbaum
\emph{et al.} has been employed to study the two-nucleon bound and scattering
states. Chiral $NN$ potential up to next-to-next-to-next-to leading order
(N$^3$LO) is used to calculated the np differential cross section and deuteron
binding energy in a realistic three dimensional approach. The obtained results
based on this helicity representation are compared to the standard partial wave
(PW) results. This comparison shows that the 3D approach provides the same
accuracy in the description of $NN$ observables and the results are in close
agreement with available experimental data.
