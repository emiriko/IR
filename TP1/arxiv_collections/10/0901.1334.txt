Recent observatons of high-energy positrons and electrons by the PAMELA and
ATIC experiments may be an indication of the annihilation of dark matter into
leptons and not quarks. This leptonic connection was foreseen already some
years ago in two different models of radiative neutrino mass. We discuss here
the generic interactions (nu eta^0 - l eta^+) chi and l^c zeta^- chi^c which
allow this to happen, where chi and/or chi^c are fermionic dark-matter
candidates. We point out in particular the importance of chi chi to l^+ l^-
gamma to both positron and gamma-ray signals within this framework.
