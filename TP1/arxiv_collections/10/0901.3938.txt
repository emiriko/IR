The single-photon transport in a single-mode waveguide, coupled to a cavity
embedded with a two-leval atom is analyzed. The single-photon transmission and
reflection amplitudes, as well as the cavity and the atom excitation
amplitudes, are solved exactly via a real-space approach. It is shown that the
dissipation of the cavity and of the atom respectively affects distinctively on
the transport properties of the photons, and on the relative phase between the
excitation amplitudes of the cavity mode and the atom.
