The properties of pristine, free-standing graphene monolayers prepared by
mechanical exfoliation of graphite are investigated. The graphene monolayers,
suspended over open trenches, are examined by means of spatially resolved Raman
spectroscopy of the G-, D-, and 2D-phonon modes. The G-mode phonons exhibit
reduced energies (1580 cm-1) and increased widths (14 cm-1) compared to the
response of graphene monolayers supported on the SiO2 covered substrate. From
analysis of the G-mode Raman spectra, we deduce that the free-standing graphene
monolayers are essentially undoped, with an upper bound of 2x10^11 cm-2 for the
residual carrier concentration. On the supported regions, significantly higher
and spatially inhomogeneous doping is observed. The free-standing graphene
monolayers show little local disorder, based on the very weak Raman D-mode
response. The two-phonon 2D mode of the free-standing graphene monolayers is
downshifted in frequency compared to that of the supported region of the
samples and exhibits a narrowed, positively skewed line shape.
