In this talk, we point out that curvature-regular asymptotically flat
solitons with negative mass are contained in the Myers-Perry family in five
dimensions. These solitons do not have horizon, but instead a conical NUT
singularity of quasi-regular nature surrounded by naked CTCs. We show that this
quasi-regular singularity can be made regular for a set of discrete values of
angular momentum by introducing some periodic identifications, at least in the
case in which two angular momentum parameters are equal. Although the spatial
infinity of the solitons is diffeomorphic to S^1xS^3/R_n (n>2), the
corresponding spacetime is simply connected and asymptotically flat.
