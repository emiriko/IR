In this talk I review recent advances on the structure of the meson and
baryon resonances which can be dynamically generated from the interaction of
mesons or mesons and baryons. Particular emphasis is put on results involving
vector mesons, which bring new light into the nature of some of the observed
higher mass mesons and baryons and make predictions for new states.
