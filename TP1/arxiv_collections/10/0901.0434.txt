Motivated by the need for parametric families of rich and yet tractable
distributions in financial mathematics, both in pricing and risk management
settings, but also considering wider statistical applications, we investigate a
novel technique for introducing skewness or kurtosis into a symmetric or other
distribution. We use a "transmutation" map, which is the functional composition
of the cumulative distribution function of one distribution with the inverse
cumulative distribution (quantile) function of another. In contrast to the
Gram-Charlier approach, this is done without resorting to an asymptotic
expansion, and so avoids the pathologies that are often associated with it.
Examples of parametric distributions that we can generate in this way include
the skew-uniform, skew-exponential, skew-normal, and skew-kurtotic-normal.
