We discuss the phenomenology of Supercritical String Cosmology (SSC) in the
context of Dark Matter constraints on supersymmetric particle physics models at
LHC. We also link our results with recent findings of the MAGIC, H.E.S.S. and
Fermi Telescopes on delayed arrival of highly energetic photons from the
distant Galaxies and GRBs. The link is provided by a concrete model of
space-time foam in (supercritical) string theory, involving space-time defects
and their interaction with matter in a brane world scenario.
