We discuss the feasibility of negative refraction with reduced absorption in
coherently driven atomic media. Coherent coupling of an electric and a magnetic
dipole transition by laser fields induces magneto-electric cross-coupling and
negative refraction at dipole densities which are considerably smaller than
necessary to achieve a negative permeability. At the same time the absorption
gets minimized due to destructive quantum interference and the ratio of
negative refraction index to absorption becomes orders of magnitude larger than
in systems without coherent cross-coupling. The proposed scheme allows for a
fine-tuning of the refractive index. We derive a generalized expression for the
impedance of a medium with magneto-electric cross coupling and show that
impedance matching to vacuum can easily be achieved. Finally we discuss the
tensorial properties of the medium response and derive expressions for the
dependence of the refractive index on the propagation direction.
