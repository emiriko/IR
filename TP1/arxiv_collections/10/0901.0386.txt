One of the two existing strategies of resolving singularities of multifold
Mellin-Barnes integrals in the dimensional regularization parameter, or a
parameter of the analytic regularization, is formulated in a modified form. The
corresponding algorithm is implemented as a Mathematica code MBresolve.m
