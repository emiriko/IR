We report measurements of the temperature dependence of the electrical
resistivity, \rho(T), and magnetic penetration depth, \lambda(T), for
polycrystalline samples of Eu_0.5K_0.5Fe_2As_2 with Tc=31 K. $\rho(T)$ follows
a linear temperature dependence above T_c and bends over to a weaker
temperature dependence around 150 K. The magnetic penetration depth, determined
by radio frequency technique displays an unusual minimum around 4 K which is
associated with short-range ordering of localized Eu3+ moments.
