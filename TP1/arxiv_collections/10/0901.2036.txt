We explore the abundance of light clusters in asymmetric nuclear matter at
subsaturation density. With increasing density, binding energies and wave
functions are modified due to medium effects. The method of Albergo, Costa,
Costanzo and Rubbino (ACCR) for determining the temperature and free nucleon
density of a disassembling hot nuclear source from fragment yields is modified
to include, in addition to Coulomb effects and flow, also effects of medium
modifications of cluster properties, which become of importance when the
nuclear matter density is above 10$^{-3}$ fm$^{-3}$. We show how the analysis
of cluster yields, to infer temperature and nucleon densities, is modified if
the shifts in binding energies of in medium clusters are included. While, at
low densities, the temperature calculated from given yields changes only
modestly if medium effects are taken into account, larger discrepancies are
observed when the nucleon densities are determined from measured yields.
