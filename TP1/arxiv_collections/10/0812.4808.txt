In present work we study informational measures for the problem of
interference of quantum particles. We demonstrate that diffraction picture in
the far field, which is given by probability density of particle momentum
distribution, represents a mixture of probability densities of corresponding
Schmidt modes, while the number of modes is equal to the number of slits at the
screen. Also, for the first time we introduce informational measures to study
the quality of interference picture and analyze the relation between visibility
of interference picture and Schmidt number. Furthermore, we consider
interference aspects of the problem of a quantum particle tunneling between two
potential wells. This framework is applied to describing various isotopic
modifications of ammonia molecule. Finally, we calculate limits on the maximum
possible degree of entanglement between quantum system and its environment,
which is imposed by measurements
