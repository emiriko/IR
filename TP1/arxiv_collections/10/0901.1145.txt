We begin a systematic study of how gaugino mass unification can be probed at
the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in a quasi-model independent manner. As a
first step in that direction we focus our attention on the theoretically
well-motivated mirage pattern of gaugino masses, a one-parameter family of
models of which universal (high scale) gaugino masses are a limiting case. We
improve on previous methods to define an analytic expression for the metric on
signature space and use it to study one-parameter deviations from universality
in the gaugino sector, randomizing over other soft supersymmetry-breaking
parameters. We put forward three ensembles of observables targeted at the
physics of the gaugino sector, allowing for a determination of this
non-universality parameter without reconstructing individual mass eigenvalues
or the soft supersymmetry-breaking gaugino masses themselves. In this
controlled environment we find that approximately 80% of the supersymmetric
parameter space would give rise to a model for which our method will detect
non-universality in the gaugino mass sector at the 10% level with an integrated
luminosity of order 10 inverse femptobarns. We discuss strategies for improving
the method and for adding more realism in dealing with the actual experimental
circumstances of the LHC.
