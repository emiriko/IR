The properties of the ices that form in dense molecular clouds represent an
important set of initial conditions in the evolution of interstellar and
preplanetary matter in regions of active star formation. Of the various
spectral features available for study, the bending mode of solid CO2 near 15
microns has proven to be a particularly sensitive probe of physical conditions,
especially temperature. We present new observations of this absorption feature
in the spectrum of Q21-1, a background field star located behind a dark
filament in the Cocoon Nebula (IC5146). We show the profile of the feature be
consistent with a two-component (polar + nonpolar) model for the ices, based on
spectra of laboratory analogs with temperatures in the range 10-20K. The polar
component accounts for 85% of the CO2 in the line of sight. We compare for the
first time 15 micron profiles in three widely separated dark clouds (Taurus,
Serpens and IC5146), and show that they are indistinguishable to within
observational scatter. Systematic differences in the observed CO2/H2O ratio in
the three clouds have little or no effect on the 15 micron profile. The
abundance of elemental oxygen in the ices appears to be a unifying factor,
displaying consistent behavior in the three clouds. We conclude that the ice
formation process is robust and uniformly efficient, notwithstanding
compositional variations arising from differences in how the O is distributed
between the primary species (H2O, CO2 and CO) in the ices.
