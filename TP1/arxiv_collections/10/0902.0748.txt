We present evidence from three student interactions in which two types of
common solution methods for solving simple first-order differential equations
are used. We describe these using the language of resources, considering
epistemic games as particular pathways of solutions along resource graphs
containing linked procedural and conceptual resources. Using transcript data,
we define several procedural resources, show how they can be organized into two
facets of a previously described epistemic game, and produce a resource graph
that allows visualization of this portion of the epistemic games. By
representing two correct mathematical procedures in terms of shared resources,
we help clarify the types of thinking in which students engage when learning to
apply mathematical reasoning to physics and illustrate how a "failure to
connect" two ideas often hinders students' successful problem solving.
