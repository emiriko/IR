In this paper, we demonstrate a source of photon pairs based on
four-wave-mixing in photonic crystal fibres. Careful engineering of the phase
matching conditions in the fibres enables us to create photon pairs at 597 nm
and 860 nm in an intrinsically factorable state showing no spectral
correlations. This allows for heralding one photon in a pure state and hence
renders narrow band filtering obsolete. The source is narrow band, bright and
achieves an overall detection efficiency of up to 21% per photon. For the first
time, a Hong-Ou-Mandel interference with unfiltered photons from separate fibre
sources is presented.
