In this letter, we show efficient electrical spin injection into a SiGe based
\textit{p-i-n} light emitting diode from the remanent state of a
perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnetic contact. Electron spin injection is
carried out through an alumina tunnel barrier from a Co/Pt thin film exhibiting
a strong out-of-plane anisotropy. The electrons spin polarization is then
analysed through the circular polarization of emitted light. All the light
polarization measurements are performed without an external applied magnetic
field \textit{i.e.} in remanent magnetic states. The light polarization as a
function of the magnetic field closely traces the out-of-plane magnetization of
the Co/Pt injector. We could achieve a circular polarization degree of the
emitted light of 3 % at 5 K. Moreover this light polarization remains almost
constant at least up to 200 K.
