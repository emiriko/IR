We find a new integration transformation which can convert a chirplet
function to fractional Fourier transformation kernel, this new transformation
is invertible and obeys Parseval theorem. Under this transformation a new
relationship between a phase space function and its Weyl-Wigner quantum
correspondence operator is revealed.
