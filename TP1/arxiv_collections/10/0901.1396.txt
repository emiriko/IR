We report the formation of sub-5 nm ultrashallow junctions in 4 inch Si
wafers enabled by the molecular monolayer doping of phosphorous and boron atoms
and the use of conventional spike annealing. The junctions are characterized by
secondary ion mass spectrometry and non-contact sheet resistance measurements.
It is found that the majority (~70%) of the incorporated dopants are
electrically active, therefore, enabling a low sheet resistance for a given
dopant areal dose. The wafer-scale uniformity is investigated and found to be
limited by the temperature homogeneity of the spike anneal tool used in the
experiments. Notably, minimal junction leakage currents (<1 uA/cm2) are
observed which highlights the quality of the junctions formed by this process.
The results clearly demonstrate the versatility and potency of the monolayer
doping approach for enabling controlled, molecular-scale ultrashallow junction
formation without introducing defects in the semiconductor.
