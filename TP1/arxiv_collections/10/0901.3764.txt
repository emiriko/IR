We develop a linear systems theory that coincides with the existing theories
for continuous and discrete dynamical systems, but that also extends to linear
systems defined on nonuniform time domains. The approach here is based on
generalized Laplace transform methods (e.g. shifts and convolution) from our
recent work \cite{DaGrJaMaRa}. We study controllability in terms of the
controllability Gramian and various rank conditions (including Kalman's) in
both the time invariant and time varying settings and compare the results. We
also explore observability in terms of both Gramian and rank conditions as well
as realizability results. We conclude by applying this systems theory to
connect exponential and BIBO stability problems in this general setting.
Numerous examples are included to show the utility of these results.
