Puzzling observations of both thermal and dielectric responses in
multi-silicate glasses at low temperatures $T$ to static magnetic fields $B$
have been reported in the last decade and call for an extension of the standard
two-level systems tunneling model. An explanation is proposed, capable of
capturing at the same time the $T$- and $B$-dependence of the specific heat
$C_p$ and of the dielectric constant $\epsilon$ in these glasses. This theory
points to the existence of anomalous multi-welled tunneling systems in the
glasses -- alongside the standard two-level systems -- and indications are
given for glasses which should achieve larger electric magnetocapacitive
enhancements.
