In these proceedings, we summarize recent results from our "SINS" VLT/SINFONI
integral-field survey, focusing on the 52 detected UV/optically-selected
star-forming galaxies at z~2. Our H-alpha emission-line imaging and kinematic
data of these systems illustrates that a substantial fraction (> 1/3) of these
galaxies are large, rotating disks and that these disks are clumpy, thick, and
forming stars rapidly. We compare these systems to local disk scaling relations
and find that the backbones of these relations are already in place at z~2.
Detailed analysis of the large disks in our sample provides strong evidence
that this population cannot result from a merger-dominated formation history
and instead must be assembled by the smooth but rapid inflow of gas along
filaments. These systems will then secularly evolve from clump-dominated disks
to bulge-dominated disks on short timescales, a phenomenon that is observed in
our SINS observations and is consistent with predictions from numerical
simulations. These results provide new and exciting insights into the formation
of bulge-dominated galaxies in the local Universe.
