We give new examples of hyperbolic and relatively hyperbolic groups of
cohomological dimension $d$ for all $d\geq 4$. These examples result from
applying CAT$(0)$/CAT$(-1)$ filling constructions (based on singular doubly
warped products) to finite volume hyperbolic manifolds with toral cusps.
  The groups obtained have a number of interesting properties, which are
established by analyzing their boundaries at infinity by a kind of
Morse-theoretic technique, related to but distinct from ordinary and
combinatorial Morse theory.
