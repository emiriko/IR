Controlled doping of SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, a faithful realization of the
Heisenberg spin-1/2 antiferromagnet on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice, with
non-magnetic impurities generates bound-states below the spin gap. These
bound-states and their symmetry properties are investigated by exact
diagonalisation of small clusters and within a simple effective model
describing a spinon submitted to an attractive extended potential. It is shown
that Raman spectroscopy is a unique technique to probe these bound-states.
Quantitative theoretical Raman spectra are numerically obtained.
