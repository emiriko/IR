If the dark matter (DM) consists of a weakly interacting massive particle
(WIMP), it can be produced and studied at future collider experiments like
those at the LHC. The production of collider-stable WIMPs is characterized by
hard scattering events with large missing transverse energy. Here we point out
that the discovery of this well-characterized DM signal may turn out to be a
red herring. We explore an alternative explanation -- fake dark matter -- where
the only sources of missing transverse energy are standard model neutrinos. We
present examples of such models, focusing on supersymmetric models with
R-parity violation. We also briefly discuss means of differentiating fake dark
matter from the production of new collider-stable particles.
