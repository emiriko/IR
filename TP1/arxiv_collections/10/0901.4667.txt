We study the Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting state in
the disordered systems. We analyze the microscopic model, in which the d-wave
superconductivity is stabilized near the antiferromagnetic quantum critical
point, and investigate two kinds of disorder, namely, box disorder and point
disorder, on the basis of the Bogoliubov-deGennes (BdG) equation. The spatial
structure of modulated superconducting order parameter and the magnetic
properties in the disordered FFLO state are investigated. We point out the
possibility of "FFLO glass" state in the presence of strong point disorders,
which arises from the configurational degree of freedom of FFLO nodal plane.
The distribution function of local spin susceptibility is calculated and its
relation to the FFLO nodal plane is clarified. We discuss the NMR measurements
for CeCoIn_5.
