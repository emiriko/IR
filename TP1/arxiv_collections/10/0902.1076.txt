Paramagnetic solutions of the ionic Hubbard model at half-filling in
dimensions $D>2$ indicate that the band and the Mott insulator phases are
separated by a metallic phase. We present zero-temperature dynamical mean-field
theory solutions, which include antiferromagnetic long-range order, and show
that the one-particle spectral functions always possess an energy gap and
therefore the system is insulating for all interaction strengths. The staggered
charge density modulation coexists with antiferromagnetic long-range order of
N\'eel type.
