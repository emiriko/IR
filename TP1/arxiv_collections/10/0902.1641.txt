The glacial cycles are attributed to the climatic response of the orbital
changes in the irradiance to the Earth. These changes in the forcing are to
small to explain the observed climate variations as simple linear responses.
Non-linear amplifications are necessary to account for the glacial cycles. Here
an empirical model of the non-linear response is presented. From the model it
is possible to assess the role of stochastic noise in comparison to the
deterministic orbital forcing of the ice ages. The model is based on the
bifurcation structure derived from the climate history. It indicates the
dynamical origin of the Mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT) from the '41 kyr
world' to the '100 kyr world'. The dominant forcing in the latter is still the
41 kyr obliquity cycle, but the bifurcation structure of the climate system is
changed. The model indicates that transitions between glacial and interglacial
climate are assisted by internal stochastic noise in the period prior to the
last five glacial cycles, while the last five cycles are deterministic
responses to the orbital forcing.
