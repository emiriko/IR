We performed Raman experiments on superconducting ${\rm Bi_2 Sr_2 (Ca_{1-x}
Y_x) Cu_2 O_{8+\delta}}$ (Bi-2212) and ${\rm YBa_{2} Cu_{3}O_{6+x}}$ (Y-123)
single crystals. These results in combination with earlier ones enable us to
analyze systematically the spectral features in the doping range $0.07 \le p
\le 0.23$. In $B_{2g}$ ($xy$) symmetry we find universal spectra and the
maximal gap energy $\Delta_0$ to follow the superconducting transition
temperature $T_c$. The $B_{1g}$ ($x^2-y^2$) spectra in Bi-2212 show an
anomalous increase of the intensity towards overdoping, indicating that the
corresponding energy scale is neither related to the pairing energy nor to the
pseudogap, but possibly stems from a symmetry breaking transition at the onset
point of superconductivity at $p_{\rm sc2} \simeq 0.27$.
