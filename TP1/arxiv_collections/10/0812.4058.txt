The aim of this paper is to introduce $n$-ary Hom-algebra structures
generalizing the $n$-ary algebras of Lie type enclosing $n$-ary Nambu algebras,
$n$-ary Nambu-Lie algebras, $n$-ary Lie algebras, and $n$-ary algebras of
associative type enclosing $n$-ary totally associative and $n$-ary partially
associative algebras. Also, we provide a way to construct examples starting
from an $n$-ary algebra and an $n$-ary algebras endomorphism. Several examples
could be derived using this process.
