Antagonistic symmetries of superconducting polygons and their induced
multi-vortex states in a homogeneous magnetic field may lead to appearance of
antivortices in the vicinity of the superconducting/normal state boundary
(where mesoscopic confinement is particularly strong). Resulting
vortex-antivortex (V-Av) molecules match the sample symmetry, but are extremely
sensitive to defects and fluctuations and remain undetected experimentally.
Here we show that V-Av states can re-appear deep in the superconducting state
due to an array of perforations in a polygonal setting, surrounding a central
hole. Such states are no longer caused by the symmetry of the sample but rather
by pinning itself, which prevents the vortex-antivortex annihilation. As a
result, even micron-size, clearly spaced V-Av molecules can be stabilized in
large mesoscopic samples.
