Using 58$\times 10^{6}$ $\jpsi$ events collected with the Beijing
Spectrometer (BESII) at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider (BEPC), the
branching fractions of $\jpsi$ to $p\bar{p}\eta$ and $p\bar{p}\etap$ are
determined. The ratio $\frac{\Gamma(\jpsi\rar\ppb\eta)}{\Gamma(\jpsi\rar\ppb)}$
obtained by this analysis agrees with expectations based on soft-pion theorem
calculations.
