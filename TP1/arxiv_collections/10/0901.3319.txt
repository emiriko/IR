We present the results of the continuation of our magnetic survey with FORS1
at the VLT of a sample of B-type stars consisting of confirmed or candidate
beta Cephei stars and Slowly Pulsating B stars. Roughly one third of the
studied beta Cephei stars have detected magnetic fields. The fraction of
magnetic Slowly Pulsating B and candidate Slowly Pulsating B stars is found to
be higher, up to 50%. We find that the domains of magnetic and non-magnetic
pulsating stars in the H-R diagram largely overlap, and no clear picture
emerges as to the possible evolution of the magnetic field across the main
sequence.
