The Large Hadron Collider promises to discover new physics beyond the
Standard Model. An exciting possibility is the formation of string resonances
at the TeV scale. In this article, we show how string resonances may be
detected at the LHC in the $pp\to\gamma+jet$ channel. Our study is based on
event shape variables, missing energy and momentum, maximum transverse momentum
of photons and dijet invariant mass. These observables provide interesting
signatures which enable us to discriminate string events from the Standard
Model background.
