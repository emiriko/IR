Photons emitted by transition between the discrete levels of single molecular
magnets might obay the elementary condition for Dicke's super-radiance. We
investigate this possibility in the Fe8 molecule where magnetization jumps are
known to occur at discreet magnetic field values. We found energy bursts each
time the molecule undergoes a magnetization jump, confirming their quantum
nature. A series of tests indicated that photons carry out the energy, and that
indeed these photons obey the elementary conditions for super-radiance.
