We find R^4 correction to the non-extremal D1D5P solution of the supergravity
by exactly solving the differential equations of motion and by using the
entropy function formalism. In both cases, we find the same correction to the
supergravity solution. We then calculate the correction to the entropy using
the free energy method and the entropy function formalism. The results are the
same.
