Present photoionization experiments cannot measure molecular frame
photoelectron angular distributions (MFPAD) from the outermost valence
electrons of molecules. We show that details of the MFPAD can be retrieved with
high-order harmonics generated by infrared lasers from aligned molecules. Using
accurately calculated photoionization transition dipole moments for
fixed-in-space molecules, we show that the dependence of the magnitude and
phase of the high-order harmonics on the alignment angle of the molecules
observed in recent experiments can be quantitatively reproduced. This result
provides the needed theoretical basis for ultrafast dynamic chemical imaging
using infrared laser pulses.
