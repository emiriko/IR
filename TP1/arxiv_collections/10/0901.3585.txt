We introduce a resource adaptive agent mechanism which supports the user in
interactive theorem proving. The mechanism uses a two layered architecture of
agent societies to suggest appropriate commands together with possible command
argument instantiations. Experiments with this approach show that its
effectiveness can be further improved by introducing a resource concept. In
this paper we provide an abstract view on the overall mechanism, motivate the
necessity of an appropriate resource concept and discuss its realization within
the agent architecture.
