The $B\mu/\mu$ solution in GMSB via the hidden sector dynamics is simple and
natural. However, it has some obstacles to be physical. To circumvent this
situation, we introduce the visible and the hidden branes, each of which has
its own U(1) symmetry, in a five dimensional setup. In the bulk we allow
Chern-Simons coupling between the visible and the hidden U(1)s which gives an
enhancement of the mass of bino. If this gives a considerable contribution to
the mass of bino, we can get a proper radiative electro weak symmetry breaking
with the boundary conditions, in which $B\mu$ and squared scalar masses are
suppressed at the scale, where the hidden sector is integrated out.
