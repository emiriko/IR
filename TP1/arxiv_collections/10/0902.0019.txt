Configurable software verification is a recent concept for expressing
different program analysis and model checking approaches in one single
formalism. This paper presents CPAchecker, a tool and framework that aims at
easy integration of new verification components. Every abstract domain,
together with the corresponding operations, is required to implement the
interface of configurable program analysis (CPA). The main algorithm is
configurable to perform a reachability analysis on arbitrary combinations of
existing CPAs. The major design goal during the development was to provide a
framework for developers that is flexible and easy to extend. We hope that
researchers find it convenient and productive to implement new verification
ideas and algorithms using this platform and that it advances the field by
making it easier to perform practical experiments. The tool is implemented in
Java and runs as command-line tool or as Eclipse plug-in. We evaluate the
efficiency of our tool on benchmarks from the software model checker BLAST. The
first released version of CPAchecker implements CPAs for predicate abstraction,
octagon, and explicit-value domains. Binaries and the source code of CPAchecker
are publicly available as free software.
