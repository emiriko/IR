We discuss the angular resolution obtained for events registered with the
surface detector alone and for hybrid events, i.e., those observed
simultaneously by both the surface and fluorescence detectors. The angular
accuracy of the surface detector is directly extracted from the data itself and
on an event by event basis, and is given as a function of the number of
stations triggered by the event and of the zenith angle of the shower. We
compare the angular resolution of the surface detector obtained from hybrid
events with the one obtained from the surface detector alone.
