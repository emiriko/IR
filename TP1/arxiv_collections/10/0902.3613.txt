We argue that three-quark excited states naturally group into quartets, split
into two parity doublets, and that the mass splittings between these parity
partners decrease higher up in the baryon spectrum. This decreasing mass
difference can be used to probe the running quark mass in the mid-infrared
power-law regime. A measurement of masses of high-partial wave Delta*
resonances should be sufficient to unambiguously establish the approximate
degeneracy. We test this concept with the first computation of excited high-j
baryon masses in a chirally invariant quark model.
