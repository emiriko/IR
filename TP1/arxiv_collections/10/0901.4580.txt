We modify the Relative State Interpretation (RSI) of Quantum Mechanics so
that it does not imply many worlds and parallel realities. We drop the
assumption that probability amplitudes correspond one-to-one with reality: Not
all information is contained in amplitudes, and not all amplitudes need be
realized. Amplitudes do not "collapse" after a measurement, but evolve
continuously, including unrealized ones. After each "event" only one possible
outcome is realized. Therefore, if a value is measured, that value is real, all
others are not; there is only one reality and one world. Reality content is
"quantized" : unity for realized outcomes, zero for all others. It is
"conserved": can move along any possible sequence of events, but only one at a
time. The modified RSI is is strictly deterministic in the sense that the
"global" probability amplitudes of the universe are determined for all times by
the laws of physics and the initial conditions. They guide all events. But it
is not deterministic in the sense that from the amplitudes one can not predict
which outcome actually happens; that represents new information that
accumulates as history unfolds. To the extent that information is part of the
physical world, the coming into being of the universe is ongoing, even after
the Big Bang. All predictions of the two versions agree, except possibly in
esoteric, untested cases.
