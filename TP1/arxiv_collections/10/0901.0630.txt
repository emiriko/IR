We report measurements of viscoelastic properties of thin polymer films of
10-100 nm at the MHz range. These thin films are confined between a quartz
crystal resonator and a millimetric bead layer, producing an increase of both
resonance frequency and dissipation of the quartz resonator. The shear modulus
and dynamic viscosity of thin films extracted from these measurements are
consistent with the bulk values of the polymer. This modified quartz resonator
provides an easily realizable and effective tool for probing the rheological
properties of thin films at ambient environment.
