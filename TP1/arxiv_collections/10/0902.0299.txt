Recently, it has been reported that as one goes from oxygen to fluorine, just
the addition of one more proton, provides extraordinary stability to fluorine
which can bind six more neutrons beyond what oxygen can. It is shown here that
this surprising stability can be understood if neutron rich nuclei, $^{24}O$
and $^{27}F$ are treated as bound states of eight and nine-tritons
respectively. Also the recently discovered $^{42}Si$ is predicted to have a
bound state structure of fourteen tritons.
