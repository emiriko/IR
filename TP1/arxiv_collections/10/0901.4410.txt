The sensitivity of entanglement to the thermal and squeezed reservoirs'
parameters is investigated regarding entanglement decay and what is called
sudden-death of entanglement, ESD, for a system of two qubit pairs. The
dynamics of information is investigated by means of the information disturbance
and exchange information. We show that for squeezed reservoir, we can keep both
of the entanglement and information survival for a long time. The sudden death
of information is seen in the case of thermal reservoir.
