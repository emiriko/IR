We present dust features and masses observed in young supernova remnants
(SNRs) with Spitzer IRS mapping and staring observations of four youngest
supernova remnants: SNR 1E102.2-7219 (E0102) in the SMC, Cas A and G11.2-0.3 in
our Galaxy, and N132D in the LMC. The spectral mapping data revealed a number
of dust features which include 21 micron-peak dust and featureless dust in Cas
A and 18-micron peak dust in E0102 and N132D. The 18 micron-peak feature is
fitted by a mix of MgSiO$_3$ and solid Si dust grains, while the 21-micron peak
dust is by a mix of silicates and FeO; we also explore dust fitting using
Continuous Distribution of Ellipsoid grain models. We report detection of CO
fundamental band from Cas A in near-infrared. We review dust features observed
and identified in other SNRs. The dust emission is spatially correlated with
the ejecta emission, showing dust is formed in SN ejecta. The spectra of E0102
show rich gas lines from ejecta including strong ejecta lines of Ne and O,
including two [Ne III] lines and two [Ne V] lines which allow us to diagnostic
density and temperature of the ejecta and measure the ejecta masses. E0102 and
N132D show weak or lacking Ar, Si, and Fe ejecta, whereas the young Galactic
SNR Cas A show strong Ar, Si, and S and weak Fe. We discuss compositions and
masses of dust and association with those of ejecta and finally, dust
contribution from SNe to early Universe.
