Context: Red super-giant (RSG) stars exhibit significant mass loss through a
slow and dense wind. They are often considered to be the more massive counter
parts of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars. While the AGB mass loss is linked
to their strong pulsations, the RSG are often only weakly variable. Aim: To
study the conditions at the base of the wind, by determining the dust
composition in a sample of RSG. The dust composition is thought to be sensitive
to the density, temperature and acceleration at the base of the wind. Method:
We compile a sample of 27 RSG infrared spectra (ISO-SWS) and supplement these
with photometric measurements to obtain the full spectral energy distribution
(SED). These data are modelled using a dust radiative transfer code. The
results are scrutinised for correlations. Results: We find (1) strong
correlations between dust composition, mass-loss rate and stellar luminosity,
roughly in agreement with the theoretical dust condensation sequence, (2) the
need for a continuous (near-)IR dust opacity and tentatively propose amorphous
carbon, and (3) significant differences with AGB star winds: presence of PAHs,
absence of 'the' 13 micron band, and a lack of strong water bands. Conclusions:
Dust condensation in RSG is found to experience a similar freeze-out process as
in AGB stars. Together with the positive effect of the stellar luminosity on
the mass-loss rate, this suggests that radiation pressure on dust grains is an
important ingredient in the driving mechanism. Still, differences with AGB
stars are manifold and thus the winds of RSG deserve separate studies.
