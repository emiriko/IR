It was recently suggested that the magnetic component of Gravitational Waves
(GWs) is relevant in the evaluation of frequency response functions of
gravitational interferometers. In this paper we extend the analysis to the
magnetic component of the scalar mode of GWs which arise from scalar-tensor
gravity theory. In the low-frequency approximation, the response function of
ground-based interferometers is calculated. The angular dependence of the
electric and magnetic contributions to the response function is discussed.
Finally, for an arbitrary frequency range, the proper distance between two test
masses is calculated and its usefulness in the high-frequency limit for
space-based interferometers is briefly considered.
