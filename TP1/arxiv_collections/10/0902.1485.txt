We give a representation-theoretic interpretation of the Langlands character
duality of Frenkel and Hernandez, and show that the "Langlands branching
multiplicities" for symmetrizable Kac-Moody Lie algebras are equal to certain
tensor product multiplicities. For finite type quantum groups, the connection
with tensor products can be explained in terms of tilting modules.
