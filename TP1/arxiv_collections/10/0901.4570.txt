We study the Andreev edge states with different pairing symmetries and
boundary topologies on semi-infinite triangular lattice of Na_xCoO_2.yH_2O. A
general mapping from the two dimensional lattice to the one dimensional
tight-binding model is developed. It is shown that the phase diagram of the
Andreev edge states depends on the pairing symmetry and also the boundary
topology. Surprisingly, the structure of the phase diagram crucially relies on
the nodal points on the Fermi surface and can be explained by an elegant gauge
argument. We compute the momentum-resolved local density of states near the
edge and predict the hot spots which are measurable in Fourier-transformed
scanning tunneling spectroscopy.
