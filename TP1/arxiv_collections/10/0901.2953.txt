This paper deals with well-known higher-order generalizations of Hankel
operators. We show that higher-order Hankel operators can be written explicitly
as linear differential operators, and give the exact form of these differential
operators. We also intoduce a novel Lie-theoretic perspective from which to
study higher-order Hankel operators.
