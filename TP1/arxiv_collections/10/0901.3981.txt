The out-of-equilibrium electron transport of carbon nanotube semiconducting
quantum dot placed in a magnetic field is studied in the Kondo regime by means
of the non-equilibrium Green functions. The equation of motion method is used.
For parallel magnetic field the Kondo peak splits in four peaks, following the
simultaneous splitting of the orbital and spin states. For perpendicular field
orientation the triple peak structure of density of states is observed with the
central peak corresponding to orbital Kondo effect and the satellites
reflecting the spin and spin-orbital fluctuations.
