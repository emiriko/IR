We study dark matter production at CERN LHC from black hole remnants (BHR).
We find that the typical mass of these BHR at LHC is ~ 5-10 TeV which is
heavier than other dark matter candidates such as: axion, axino, neutralino
etc. We propose the detection of this dark matter via single jet production in
the process pp -> jet +BHR(dark matter) at CERN LHC. We find that for zero
impact parameter partonic collisions, the monojet cross section is not
negligible in comparison to the standard model background and is much higher
than the other dark matter scenarios studied so far. We also find that
d\sigma/dp_T of jet production in this process increases as p_T increases,
whereas in all other dark matter scenarios the d\sigma/dp_T decreases at CERN
LHC. This may provide an useful signature for dark matter detection at LHC.
However, we find that when the impact parameter dependent effect of
inelasticity is included, the monojet cross section from the above process
becomes much smaller than the standard model background and may not be
detectable at LHC.
