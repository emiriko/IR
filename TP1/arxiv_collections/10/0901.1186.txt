We have computed a series of realistic and self-consistent models that have
been shown to be able to reproduce the emitted spectra of HII galaxies in a
star bursting scenario (Martin-Majon et al. 2008). Our models combine different
codes of chemical evolution, evolutionary population synthesis and
photoionization. The emitted spectrum of HII galaxies is reproduced by means of
the photoionization code CLOUDY (Ferland, 1998), using as ionizing spectrum the
spectral energy distribution (SED) of the modelled HII galaxy, calculated using
the new and updated stellar population models PopStar (Molla & Garcia-Vargas
2009, in prep.).This, in turn, is calculated according to a star formation
history and a metallicity evolution given by a chemical evolution model. Each
model is characterized by three parameters which are going to determine the
evolution of the modeled galaxy: an initial efficiency of star formation, the
way in which burst take place, and the time of separation between these bursts.
Some model results emerging from the combination of different values for these
three parameters are shown here. Our technique reproduces observed abundances,
diagnostic diagrams and equivalent width-colour relations for local HII
galaxies.
