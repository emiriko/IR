Quantum computers could potentially simulate the dynamics of systems such as
polyatomic molecules on a much larger scale than classical computers. We
investigate a general quantum computational algorithm that simulates the time
evolution of an arbitrary non-relativistic, Coulombic many-body system in three
dimensions, considering only spatial degrees of freedom. We use a simple
discretized model of Schrodinger evolution and discuss detailed constructions
of the operators necessary to realize the scheme of Wiesner and Zalka. The
algorithm is simulated numerically for small test cases, and its outputs are
found to be in good agreement with analytical solutions.
