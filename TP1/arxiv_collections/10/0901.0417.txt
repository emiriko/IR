In quantum field theory it is generally known that the energy density may be
negative at a given point in spacetime. A number of papers have shown that
there is a restriction on this energy density which is called a quantum
inequality (QI). A QI is the lower bound to the "weighted average" of the
energy density at a given point integrated over a time dependent sampling
function. In this paper we give an example of a sampling function for which
there is no QI.
