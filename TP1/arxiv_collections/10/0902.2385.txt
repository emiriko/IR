We investigate the existence and stability of gap vortices and multi-pole gap
solitons in a Kagome lattice with a defocusing nonlinearity both in a discrete
case and in a continuum one with periodic external modulation. In particular,
predictions are made based on expansion around a simple and analytically
tractable anti-continuum (zero coupling) limit. These predictions are then
confirmed for a continuum model of an optically-induced Kagome lattice in a
photorefractive crystal obtained by a continuous transformation of a honeycomb
lattice.
