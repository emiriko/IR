The Mori's memory function approach to spin dynamics in doped
antiferromagnetic insulator combined with the assumption of temperature
independent static spin correlations and constant collective mode damping leads
to w/T scaling in a broad range. The theory involving a nonuniversal scaling
parameter is used to analyze recent inelastic neutron scattering results for
underdoped cuprates. Adopting modified damping function also the emerging
central peak in low-doped cuprates at low temperatures can be explained within
the same framework.
