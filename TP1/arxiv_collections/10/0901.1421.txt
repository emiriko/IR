We calculate the shear viscosity of field theories with gravity duals of
Gauss-Bonnet gravity with a non-trivial dilaton using AdS/CFT. We find that the
dilaton filed has a non-trivial contribution to the ratio of shear viscosity
over entropy density and after imposing causal constraint for the boundary
field theory, the new lower bound $4/25\pi$, obtained from pure Gauss-Bonnet
gravity, may have a small violation.
