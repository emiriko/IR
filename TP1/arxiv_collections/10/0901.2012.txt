The reflection coefficient of bulk spin waves from multilayer ferromagnetic
structure with periodically modulated parameters of exchange interaction,
uniaxial and rhombic magnetic anisotropy and saturation magnetization is
calculated with a non-ideal coupling between layers. The strong dependence of
spin-wave reflection coefficient on frequency, magnetic field and parameter of
interfacial coupling is revealed. It allows changing the reflection intensity
from 0 to 1 by changing either only external magnetic field value or frequency.
The proposed model of boundary conditions gives the opportunity to take into
account the quality of interfaces when studying the reflection processes of
spin waves in multilayer structures.
