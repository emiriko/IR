When a charged heterotic string is placed in a constant magnetic field B, we
show that this system can be solved exactly by using the cyclotron frequency.
We then calculate anomalies of the super Virasoro algebra, and give the
corresponding spectrum-generating algebra for this system. They differ from the
free case by the cyclotron frequency. It is remarkable that our system is
equivalent to the completely free system when B takes integral values.
