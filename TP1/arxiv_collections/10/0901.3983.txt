Aims. To establish the X-ray properties of the intermediate polar candidate
IGR J15094-6649 and therefore confirm its inclusion into the class.
  Methods. 42 856 s of X-ray data from RXTE was analysed. Frequency analysis
was used to constrain temporal variations and spectral analysis used to
characterise the emission and absorption properties.
  Results. A spin period of 809.7+-0.6 s is present, revealed as a complex
pulse profile whose modulation depth decreases with increasing X-ray energy.
The spectrum is well fitted by either a 19+-4 keV Bremsstrahlung or
Gamma=1.8+-0.1 power law, with an iron emission line feature and significant
absorption in each case.
  Conclusions. IGR J15094-6649 is confirmed to be an intermediate polar.
