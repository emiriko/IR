Predictions for LHC physics are worked out for a two-Higgs-doublet model
having four generalized CP symmetries. In this maximally-CP-symmetric model
(MCPM) the first fermion family is, at tree level, uncoupled to the Higgs
fields and thus massless. The second and third fermion families have a very
symmetric coupling to the Higgs fields. But through the electroweak symmetry
breaking a large mass hierarchy is generated between these fermion families.
Thus, the fermion mass spectrum of the model presents a rough approximation to
what is observed in Nature. In the MCPM there are, as in every
two-Higgs-doublet model, five physical Higgs bosons, three neutral ones and a
charged pair. In the MCPM the couplings of the Higgs bosons to the fermions are
completely fixed. This allows us to present clear predictions for the
production at the LHC and for the decays of the physical Higgs bosons. As
salient feature we find rather large cross sections for Higgs-boson production
via Drell-Yan type processes. With experiments at the LHC it should be possible
to check these predictions.
