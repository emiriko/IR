We study the use of viral marketing strategies on social networks to maximize
revenue from the sale of a single product. We propose a model in which the
decision of a buyer to buy the product is influenced by friends that own the
product and the price at which the product is offered. The influence model we
analyze is quite general, naturally extending both the Linear Threshold model
and the Independent Cascade model, while also incorporating price information.
We consider sales proceeding in a cascading manner through the network, i.e. a
buyer is offered the product via recommendations from its neighbors who own the
product. In this setting, the seller influences events by offering a cashback
to recommenders and by setting prices (via coupons or discounts) for each buyer
in the social network.
  Finding a seller strategy which maximizes the expected revenue in this
setting turns out to be NP-hard. However, we propose a seller strategy that
generates revenue guaranteed to be within a constant factor of the optimal
strategy in a wide variety of models. The strategy is based on an
influence-and-exploit idea, and it consists of finding the right trade-off at
each time step between: generating revenue from the current user versus
offering the product for free and using the influence generated from this sale
later in the process. We also show how local search can be used to improve the
performance of this technique in practice.
