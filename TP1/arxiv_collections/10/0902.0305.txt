HIP96515A is a double-lined spectroscopic binary with a visual companion
(HIP96515B) at 8.6 arcsec. It is included in the SACY catalog as a potential
young star and classified as an eclipsing binary in the ASAS Catalog. We have
analyzed spectroscopic and photometric observations of the triple system. The
high-resolution optical spectrum of HIP96515A has been used to derive a mass
ratio, M_2/M_1, close to 0.9, with the SB2 components showing spectral types of
M1 and M2. The ASAS and Hipparcos light-curves of HIP96515A show periodic
variations with P=2.3456 days, confirming that HIP96515A is an eclipsing binary
with preliminary parameters of i=89, M_Aa=0.59+-0.03 Msun and M_Ab=0.54+-0.03
Msun, for the primary and secondary, respectively, at an estimated distance of
42+-3 pc. This is a new eclipsing binary with component masses below 0.6 Msun.
Multi-epoch observations of HIP 96515 A&B show that the system is a common
proper motion pair. The optical spectrum of HIP 96515B is consistent with a
pure helium atmosphere (DB) white dwarf. We estimate a total age (main-sequence
lifetime plus cooling age) of 400 Myr for the white dwarf. If HIP 96515 A&B are
coeval, and assuming a common age of 400 Myr, the comparison of the masses of
the eclipsing binary members with evolutionary tracks shows that they are
underestimated by ~15% and ~10%, for the primary and secondary, respectively.
