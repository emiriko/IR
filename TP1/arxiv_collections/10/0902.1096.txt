We probe Penrose's five-fold symmetry and fractal behavior for atom H. With
radius r(H) derived from H mass m(H), H symmetry is governed by Euclid's golden
ratio phi=0,5(sqrt(5)-1), as proved with accurate H terms. A Hund-type Mexican
hat curve in the natural H spectrum points to mirrored antihydrogen Hbar. We
predict that term H 1S-3S, to be measured soon, is 2 922 743 278 654 kHz.
