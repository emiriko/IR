The Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) is a new generation of electronic radio
telescope based on aperture array technology. The telescope is being developed
by ASTRON, and currently being rolled out across the Netherlands and other
countries in Europe. I present the current status of the project, and its
relation to high resolution instruments such as the European VLBI Network (EVN)
and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). In particular, I present recent VLBI
results at 327 MHz associated with: (i) a shallow survey based on VLBA archive
data and (ii) a deep, wide-field Global VLBI survey centred on two in-beam
calibrators, B0218+357 and J0226+3421. The results suggest that there will be
no shortage of relatively bright primary calibrators that remain unresolved by
LOFAR even on the longest European baselines. The sky density of fainter
in-beam calibrators should also be more than adequate to permit the generation
of high fidelity images over a large fraction of the sky, especially in the
high-band observing band (120-240 MHz). Extending LOFAR via international
stations to baseline lengths of several thousand kilometres is certainly
practical and should significantly enhance the scientific output and
capabilities of the array.
