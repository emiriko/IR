Tidal disruption by massive black holes is a phenomenon, during which a large
part of gravitational energy can be released on a very short time-scale. The
time-scales and energies involved during X-ray and IR flares observed in
Galactic centre suggest that they may be related to tidal disruption events.
Furthermore, aftermath of a tidal disruption of a star by super-massive black
hole has been observed in some galaxies, e.g. RX J1242.6-1119A. All these
discoveries increased the demand for tools for tidal disruption study in curved
space-time. Here we summarise our study of general relativistic effects on
tidal deformation of stars and compact objects.
