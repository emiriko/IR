Cellular cargo can be bound to cytoskeletal filaments by one or multiple
active or passive molecular motors. Recent experiments have shown that the
presence of auxiliary, nondriving motors, results in an enhanced processivity
of the cargo, compared to the case of a single active motor alone. We model the
observed cooperative transport process using a stochastic model that describes
the dynamics of two molecular motors, an active one that moves cargo
unidirectionally along a filament track and a passive one that acts as a
tether. Analytical expressions obtained from our analysis are fit to
experimental data to estimate the microscopic kinetic parameters of our model.
Our analysis reveals two qualitatively distinct processivity-enhancing
mechanisms: the passive tether can decrease the typical detachment rate of the
active motor from the filament track or it can increase the corresponding
reattachment rate. Our estimates unambiguously show that in the case of
microtubular transport, a higher average run length arises mainly from the
ability of the passive motor to keep the cargo close to the filament, enhancing
the reattachment rate of an active kinesin motor that has recently detached.
Instead, for myosin-driven transport along actin, the passive motor tightly
tethers the cargo to the filament, suppressing the detachment rate of the
active myosin.
