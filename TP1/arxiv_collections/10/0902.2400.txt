We propose new mechanisms for ameliorating the constraints on the
Kaluza-Klein (KK) mass scale from charged lepton flavor violation in the
framework of the Standard Model (SM) fields propagating in a warped extra
dimension, especially in models accounting for neutrino data. These mechanisms
utilize the extended five-dimensional (5D) electroweak gauge symmetry [SU(2)_L
x SU(2)_R x U(1)_X] which is already strongly motivated in order to satisfy
electroweak precision tests in this framework. New choices of representations
for leptons under this symmetry (naturally) can allow small mixing angles for
left-handed (LH) charged leptons and simultaneously large mixing angles for
their SU(2)_L partners, i.e., the LH neutrinos, with the neutrino data being
accounted for by the latter mixings. Enhancement of charged lepton flavor
violation by the large mixing angle observed in leptonic charged currents,
which is present for the minimal choice of representations where the LH charged
lepton and neutrino mixing angles are similar, can thus be avoided in these
models. This idea might also be useful for suppressing the contributions to
B_{d, s} mixing in this framework and in order to suppress flavor violation
from superpartners (instead of from KK modes) in 5D "flavorful supersymmetry"
models. Additionally, the less minimal representations can provide custodial
protection for shifts in couplings of fermions to Z and, in turn, further
suppress charged lepton flavor-violation from tree-level Z exchange in the
warped extra-dimensional scenario. As a result, ~O(3) TeV KK mass scale can be
simultaneously consistent with charged lepton flavor violation and neutrino
data, even without any particular structure in the 5D flavor parameters in the
framework of a warped extra dimension.
