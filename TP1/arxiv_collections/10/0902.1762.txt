In particle-based algorithms, the effect of binary collisions is commonly
described in a statistical way, using Monte Carlo techniques. It is shown that,
in the relativistic regime, stringent constraints should be considered on the
sampling of particle pairs for collision, which are critical to ensure
physically meaningful results, and that nonrelativistic sampling criteria
(e.g., uniform random pairing) yield qualitatively wrong results, including
equilibrium distributions that differ from the theoretical J\"uttner
distribution. A general procedure for relativistically consistent algorithms is
provided, and verified with three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations, thus
opening the way to the numerical exploration of the statistical properties of
collisional relativistic systems.
