By either performing a Taylor expansion or making a polynomial approximation,
the Bethe equation for charged particle stopping power in matter can be
integrated analytically to obtain the range of charged particles in the
continuous deceleration approximation. Ranges match reference data to the
expected accuracy of the Bethe model. In the non-relativistic limit, the energy
deposition rate was also found analytically. The analytic relations can be used
to complement and validate numerical solutions including more detailed physics.
