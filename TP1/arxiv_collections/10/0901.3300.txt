Gersten has shown how Maxwell equations can be derived from first principles,
similar to those which have been used to obtain the Dirac relativistic electron
equation. We show how Proca equations can be also deduced from first
principles, similar to those which have been used to find Dirac and Maxwell
equations. Contrary to Maxwell equations, it is necessary to introduce a
potential in order to transform a second order differential equation, as the
Klein-Gordon equation, into a first order differential equation, like Proca
equations.
