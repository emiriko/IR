Bridge Theory was born in 1979 from a simple idea. An observer of a dipolar
source cannot measure instantaneously all the energy and momentum effectively
produced along the own line of view because the source has not a spherical
symmetry. This physical circumstance has as consequence that the energy and
momentum localised inside the source zone is equivalent to one of a photon. The
new approach to quantisation appears to be a bridge between quantum mechanics
and electromagnetic theory with many intriguing future develops.
