A 2004 paper of Anderson and Ong calculated the asymmetric coherent spectrum
of point-contact tunneling into a Gutzwiller-projected superconductor. We here
correct some details of that paper and present recipes for the
manyquasiparticle, incoherent spectrum, the major portion of which results from
the spin-flip decay of the injected quasiparticle. An illustrative example is
shown.
