The phenomenon of matter wave interference lies at the heart of quantum
physics. It has been observed in various contexts in the limit of
non-interacting particles as a single particle effect. Here we observe and
control matter wave interference whose evolution is driven by interparticle
interactions. In a multi-path matter wave interferometer, the macroscopic
many-body wave function of an interacting atomic Bose-Einstein condensate
develops a regular interference pattern, allowing us to detect and directly
visualize the effect of interaction-induced phase shifts. We demonstrate
control over the phase evolution by inhibiting interaction-induced dephasing
and by refocusing a dephased macroscopic matter wave in a spin-echo type
experiment. Our results show that interactions in a many-body system lead to a
surprisingly coherent evolution, possibly enabling narrow-band and
high-brightness matter wave interferometers based on atom lasers.
