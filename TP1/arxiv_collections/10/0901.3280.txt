Supernatural inflation is an attractive model based just on a flat direction
with soft SUSY breaking mass terms in the framework of supersymmetry. The
beauty of the model is inferred from its name that the model needs no
fine-tuning. However, the prediction of the spectral index is $n_s \gae 1$, in
contrast to experimental data. In this paper, we show that the beauty of
supernatural inflation with the spectral index reduced to $n_s=0.96$ without
any fine-tuning, by considering the general feature that a flat direction is
lifted by a non-renormalizable term with an A-term.
