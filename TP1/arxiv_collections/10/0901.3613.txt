We introduce a general class of models for charaterizing the non-Gaussian
properties of foreground contaminants in the cosmic microwave background with
view towards the removal of the non-primordial non-Gaussian signal from the
primordial one. This is important not only for treating temperature maps but
also for characterizing the nature and origin of the primordial cosmological
perturbations and thus establishing a theory of the early universe.
