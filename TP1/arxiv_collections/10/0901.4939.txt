We apply the ring-diagram technique to high resolution Dopplergrams in order
to estimate the variation in oscillation mode parameters between active and
quiet regions. We demonstrate that the difference in mode parameters between
two quiet regions can be as large as those between a pair of active and quiet
region. This leads us to conclude that the results derived on the basis of a
single quiet region could be biased.
