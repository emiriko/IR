AIM: To investigate several partially-erupting prominences to study their
relationship with other CME-associated phenomena and to compare these
observations with observables predicted by a model of partially-expelled flux
ropes (Gibson & Fan, 2006a, b).
  METHODS: We have studied 6 selected events with partially-erupting
prominences using multi wavelength observations recorded by the
Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT), Transition Region and Coronal
Explorer (TRACE), Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO), Big Bear Solar
Observatory (BBSO) and soft X-ray telescope (SXT). The observational features
associated with partially-erupting prominences were then compared with the
predicted observables from the model.
  RESULTS: The partially-expelled-flux-rope (PEFR) model of Gibson & Fan
(2006a, b) can explain the partial eruption of these prominences, and in
addition predicts a variety of other CME-related observables that provide
evidence for internal reconnection during eruption. We find that all of the
partially-erupting prominences studied in this paper exhibit indirect evidence
for internal reconnection. Moreover, all cases showed evidence of at least one
observable unique to the PEFR model, e.g., dimmings external to the source
region, and/or a soft X-ray cusp overlying a reformed sigmoid.
  CONCLUSIONS: The PEFR model provides a plausible mechanism to explain the
observed evolution of partially-erupting-prominence-associated CMEs in our
study.
