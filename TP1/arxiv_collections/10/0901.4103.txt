I survey theoretical advances in our understanding of the quantum phases and
phase transitions of Mott insulators, and of allied conducting systems obtained
by doping charge carriers. A number of new experimental examples of Mott
insulators have appeared in recent years, and I critically compare their
observed properties with the theoretical expectations.
