In this paper we have investigated the electronic properties of Fe(OH)2
hydroxide by using the LSDA+U as well as the generalized gradient
approximation. Our calculations for the iron-hydroxide show that the LSDA
results are greatly at variance with experimental findings. On the other hand
we have shown that LSDA+U is capable of opening a gap at the Fermi level
resulting in insulating ground state in agreement with experimental
observations.
