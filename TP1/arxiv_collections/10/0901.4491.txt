For every $2 < p < 3$, we show that $u \in W^{1,p}(B^3; S^2)$ can be strongly
approximated by maps in $C^\infty(\Bar{B}^3; S^2)$ if, and only if, the
distributional Jacobian of $u$ vanishes identically. This result was originally
proved by Bethuel-Coron-Demengel-Helein, but we present a different strategy
which is motivated by the $W^{2,p}$-case.
