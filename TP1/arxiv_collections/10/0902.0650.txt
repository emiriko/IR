In the first part of the talk, we discuss non-geometric twists and shifts and
briefly review asymmetric orbifolds and free fermion constructions. These allow
us to build Type IIB models with N = 1_L + 1_R and N = 1_L + 0_R models having
few or no moduli. We then consider unoriented projections of the former and
(`exotic') D-branes in the latter. In the second part, devoted to L-R
asymmetric D-branes, we review how extended supergravity vacua in D=4 can be
embedded in Type II superstrings. We then identify bound states of D-branes
with residual susy and non-trivial R-R couplings. We discuss the N = 6 = 2_L +
4_R case in detail and sketch other extended susy cases. Finally we describe
the resulting open string excitations. We conclude with some speculations and
possible interesting developments.
