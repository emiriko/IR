The climate version Eta CCS, prepared from the NCEP Eta forecast model, was
integrated over South America for the period from January 1979 to December
1983. The model was driven by the two sets of boundary conditions derived from
the reanalysis and outputs of HadAM3P atmospheric global model. The mean output
fields of precipitation, precipitation frequency, and near surface air
temperature, simulated by the Eta model, were compared with the observational
data of the CRU and GPCP projects. This comparison shows that the Eta model
reproduces well the main patterns of the summer and winter observed
precipitation fields over South America. But the magnitude of precipitation is
underestimated by the ETA CCS model in the regions of strong convection
activity in summer. This underestimation of observed precipitation is larger
for the Eta model driven by HadAM3P than by the reanalysis. The observed number
of wet days is overestimated by HadAM3P. The number of wet days in both runs of
the Eta model is closer to observations. The main summer and winter patterns of
near surface air temperature are reproduced well by both HadAM3P and the Eta
model. The Eta model overestimates the observed surface temperature over the
central part of the continent due to the lack of convective cloudiness in this
region. The Eta model captures observed annual cycle of precipitation in six
selected regions over South America. On the whole, these results support the
conclusion that the Eta model with some improvements can be used for
downscaling of the HadAM3P output fields.
