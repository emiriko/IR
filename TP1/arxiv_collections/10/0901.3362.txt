Light vector mesons are among the most informative probes to understand the
strongly coupled Quark Gluon Plasma created at RHIC. The suppression of light
mesons at high transverse momentum, compared to expectations from scaled $p+p$
results, reflects the properties of the strongly interacting matter formed. The
$\phi$-meson is one of the probes whose systematic measurement in $p+p$, $d+Au$
and $Au+Au$ collisions can provide useful information about initial and final
state effects on particle production. The mass, width and branching ratio of
the $\phi$-meson decay in the di-kaon and di-electron decay channels could be
modified in \au collisions due to the restoration of chiral symmetry in the
QGP. The PHENIX experiment at RHIC has measured $\phi$-meson production in
various systems ranging form $p+p$, $d+Au$ to $Au+Au$ collisions via both its
di-electron and di-kaon decay modes. A summary of PHENIX results on invariant
spectra, nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow of the $\phi$-meson are
presented here.
