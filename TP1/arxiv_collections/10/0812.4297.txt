We study the effect of a strong static homogeneous electric field on the
highly excited rovibrational levels of the LiCs dimer in its electronic ground
state. Our full rovibrational investigation of the system includes the
interaction with the field due to the permanent electric dipole moment and the
polarizability of the molecule. We explore the evolution of the states next to
the dissociation threshold as the field strength is increased. The rotational
and vibrational dynamics are influenced by the field; effects such as
orientation, angular motion hybridization and squeezing of the vibrational
motion are demonstrated and analyzed. The field also induces avoided crossings
causing a strong mixing of the electrically dressed rovibrational states.
Importantly, we show how some of these highly excited levels can be shifted to
the continuum as the field strength is increased, and reversely how two atoms
in the continuum can be brought into a bound state by lowering the electric
field strength.
