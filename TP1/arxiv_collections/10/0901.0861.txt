A binary embedded-atom method (EAM) potential is optimized for Cu on Ag(111)
by fitting to ab initio data. The fitting database consists of DFT calculations
of Cu monomers and dimers on Ag(111), specifically their relative energies,
adatom heights, and dimer separations. We start from the Mishin Cu-Ag EAM
potential and first modify the Cu-Ag pair potential to match the FCC/HCP site
energy difference then include Cu-Cu pair potential optimization for the entire
database. The optimized EAM potential reproduce DFT monomer and dimer relative
energies and geometries correctly. In trimer calculations, the potential
produces the DFT relative energy between FCC and HCP trimers, though a
different ground state is predicted. We use the optimized potential to
calculate diffusion barriers for Cu monomers, dimers, and trimers. The
predicted monomer barrier is the same as DFT, while experimental barriers for
monomers and dimers are both lower than predicted here. We attribute the
difference with experiment to the overestimation of surface adsorption energies
by DFT and a simple correction is presented. Our results show that the
optimized Cu-Ag EAM can be applied in the study of larger Cu islands on
Ag(111).
