The magnetic ground state phase diagram of the ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice
model is constructed by calculating internal energies of all possible bipartite
magnetic configurations of the simple cubic lattice explicitly. This is done in
one dimension (1D), 2D and 3D for a local moment of S = 3/2. By assuming
saturation in the local moment system we are able to treat all appearing higher
local correlation functions within an equation of motion approach exactly. A
simple explanation for the obtained phase diagram in terms of bandwidth
reduction is given. Regions of phase separation are determined from the
internal energy curves by an explicit Maxwell construction.
