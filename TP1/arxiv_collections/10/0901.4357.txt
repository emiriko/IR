In this paper, we give an analytical treatment to study the behavior of the
collapse and the revival of the Rabi oscillations in the Jaynes-Cummings model
(JCM). The JCM is an exactly soluble quantum mechanical model, which describes
the interaction between a two-level atom and a single cavity mode of the
electromagnetic field. If we prepare the atom in the ground state and the
cavity mode in a coherent state initially, the JCM causes the collapse and the
revival of the Rabi oscillations many times in a complicated pattern in its
time-evolution. In this phenomenon, the atomic population inversion is
described with an intractable infinite series. (When the electromagnetic field
is resonant with the atom, the $n$th term of this infinite series is given by a
trigonometric function for $\sqrt{n}t$, where $t$ is a variable of the time.)
According to Klimov and Chumakov's method, using the Abel-Plana formula, we
rewrite this infinite series as a sum of two integrals. We examine the physical
meanings of these two integrals and find that the first one represents the
initial collapse (the semi-classical limit) and the second one represents the
revival (the quantum correction) in the JCM. Furthermore, we evaluate the first
and second-order perturbations for the time-evolution of the JCM with an
initial thermal coherent state for the cavity mode at low temperature, and
write down their correction terms as sums of integrals by making use of the
Abel-Plana formula.
