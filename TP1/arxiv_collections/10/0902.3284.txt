Heavy-ion reactions especially those induced by radioactive beams provide
useful information about the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy,
thus the Equation of State of neutron-rich nuclear matter, relevant for many
astrophysical studies. The latest developments in constraining the symmetry
energy at both sub- and supra-saturation densities from analyses of the isopsin
diffusion and the $\pi^-/\pi^+$ ratio in heavy-ion collisions using the IBUU04
transport model are discussed. Astrophysical ramifications of the partially
constrained symmetry energy on properties of neutron star crusts, gravitational
waves emitted by deformed pulsars and the w-mode oscillations of neutron stars
are presented briefly.
