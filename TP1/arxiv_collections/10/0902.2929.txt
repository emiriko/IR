The radial thermal expansion coefficient (a)r of pure and Xe-saturated
bundles of single-walled carbon nanotubes has been measured in the interval
2.2-120 K. The coefficient is positive above T = 5.5 K and negative at lower
temperatures. The experiment was made using a low temperature capacitance
dilatometer with a sensitivity of 2x10-9 cm and the sample was prepared by
compacting a CNT powder such that the pressure applied oriented the nanotube
axes perpendicular to the axis of the cylindrical sample. The data show that
individual nanotubes have a negative thermal expansion while the solid
compacted material has a positive expansion coefficient due to expansion of the
intertube volume in the bundles. Doping the nanotubes with Xe caused a sharp
increase in the magnitude of (a)r in the whole range of temperatures used, and
a peak in the dependence (a)r (T) in the interval 50-65 K. A subsequent
decrease in the Xe concentration lowered the peak considerably but had little
effect on the thermal expansion coefficient of the sample outside the region of
the peak. The features revealed have been explained qualitatively.
