We introduce a positive Hermitian operator, the Fisher operator, and use it
to examine a measurement process incorporating unitary dynamics and complete
measurements. We develop the idea of information complement, the minimization
of which establishes the optimal precision for a fixed input. The formalism
demonstrates that, in general, the classical Fisher Information has the
Hamiltonian semi-norm as an upper bound. This is achievable with a qubit probe
and only projective measurements, and is independent of the true value of the
estimated parameter. In an interferometry context, we show that an optimal
measurement scheme can be constructed from linear optics and photon counting,
without recourse to generalised measurements or exotic unitaries outside of
SU(2).
