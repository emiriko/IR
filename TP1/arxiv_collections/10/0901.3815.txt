A neutral Dirac fermion is supplied as a singlet within the context of the
standard model (SM) and is considered as a dark matter (DM) candidate near
electroweak scale (10-1000 GeV) with nonzero magnetic dipole moment. The Dirac
particles have four different types of electromagnetic couplings (four form
factors) in general. We predict that the candidate mainly interacts with SM
particles through magnetic dipole moment (MDM), since MDM conserves the
discrete symmetries like parity (P), time reversal (T), and charge conjugation
(C) or its combination CP. The magnetic dipole moment constrained by the relic
density may be as large as 10^(-18)-10^(-17)e cm. We show that the elastic
scattering is due to a spin-spin interaction for the direct detection, and the
candidate with mass near electroweak scale is under experimental limits of the
current direct detectors, XENON10 and CDMS II. We also consider the possibility
of WIMP detection in near future.
