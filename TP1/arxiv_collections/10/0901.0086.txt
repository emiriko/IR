We incorporate hydrodynamic interactions (HI) in a coarse-grained and
structure-based model of proteins by employing the Rotne-Prager hydrodynamic
tensor. We study several small proteins and demonstrate that HI facilitate
folding. We also study HIV-1 protease and show that HI make the flap closing
dynamics faster. The HI are found to affect time correlation functions in the
vicinity of the native state even though they have no impact on same time
characteristics of the structure fluctuations around the native state.
