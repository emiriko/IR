We first describe how the Kashiwara involution on crystals of affine type $A$
is encoded by the combinatorics of aperiodic multisegments. This yields a
simple relation between this involution and the Zelevinsky involution on the
set of simple modules for the affine Hecke algebras. We then give efficient
procedures for computing these involutions. Remarkably, these procedures do not
use the underlying crystal structure. They also permit to match explicitly the
Ginzburg and Ariki parametrizations of the simple modules associated to affine
and cyclotomic Hecke algebras, respectively .
