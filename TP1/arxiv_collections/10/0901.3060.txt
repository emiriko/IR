Fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities are fundamental for the study of the
QGP phase transition. The ALICE experiment is well suited for precise
event-by-event measurements of various quantities. In this article, we review
the capabilities of ALICE to study the fluctuations of several key observables
such as the net charge, the temperature, and the particle ratios. Among the
observables related to correlations, we review the balance functions and the
long range correlations.
