Isolated horizon conditions enforce the time invariance of both the intrinsic
and the extrinsic geometry of a (quasilocal) black hole horizon. Nonexpanding
horizons, only requiring the invariance of the intrinsic geometry, have been
successfully employed in the (excision) initial data of black holes in
instantaneous equilibrium. Here we propose the use of the full isolated horizon
structure when solving the elliptic system resulting from the complete set of
conformal 3+1 Einstein equations under a quasiequilibrium ansatz prescription.
We argue that a set of geometric inner boundary conditions for this extended
elliptic system then follows, determining the shape of the excision surface.
