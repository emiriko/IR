In this contribution the status of the flavour tagging performance for the
LDCPrime detector model and studies of the track selection parameters and
effects from beam backgrounds in flavour tagging using the LCFIVertex package
are presented. This work is part of an effort towards a default configuration
for the ILD detector optimisation.
