We extend the hadronic SU(3) non-linear sigma model to include quark degrees
of freedom. The choice of potential for the Polyakov loop as a function of
temperature and chemical potential allows us to construct a realistic phase
diagram from the analysis of the order parameters of the system. These
parameters are the chiral condensate, for the chiral symmetry restoration and
the Polyakov loop, for the deconfinement to quark matter. Besides reproducing
lattice QCD results, for zero and low chemical potential, we are in agreement
with neutron star observations for zero temperature.
