The host galaxy of the quasar SDSS J114816.64+525150.3 (at redshift z=6.42,
when the Universe was <1 billion years old) has an infrared luminosity of
2.2x10^13 L_sun, presumably significantly powered by a massive burst of star
formation. In local examples of extremely luminous galaxies such as Arp220, the
burst of star formation is concentrated in the relatively small central region
of <100pc radius. It is unknown on which scales stars are forming in active
galaxies in the early Universe, which are likely undergoing their initial burst
of star formation. We do know that at some early point structures comparable to
the spheroidal bulge of the Milky Way must have formed. Here we report a
spatially resolved image of [CII] emission of the host galaxy of
J114816.64+525150.3 that demonstrates that its star forming gas is distributed
over a radius of ~750pc around the centre. The surface density of the star
formation rate averaged over this region is ~1000 M_sun/yr/kpc^2. This surface
density is comparable to the peak in Arp220, though ~2 orders of magnitudes
larger in area. This vigorous star forming event will likely give rise to a
massive spheroidal component in this system.
