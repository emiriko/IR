The new parameterization of the generalized parton distributions t-dependence
is proposed. It allows one to reproduce sufficiently well the electromagnetic
form factors of the proton and neutron at small and large momentum transfer.
The description of the data obtained by the Rosenbluth method and the
polarization method are compared. The results obtained by the latter method are
shown to be compatible with the correspondent neutron data. The impact
parameter dependence of the neutron charge density is examined. The quark
contributions to gravitational form factors of the nucleons are obtained.
