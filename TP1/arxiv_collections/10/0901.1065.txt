We determine dynamical response functions of the S=1/2 Heisenberg quantum
antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice based on large-scale exact
diagonalizations combined with a continued fraction technique. The dynamical
spin structure factor has important spectral weight predominantly along the
boundary of the extended Brillouin zone and energy scans reveal broad response
extending over a range of 2 \sim 3J concomitant with pronounced intensity at
lowest available energies. Dispersive features are largely absent. Dynamical
singlet correlations -- which are relevant for inelastic light probes -- reveal
a similar broad response, with a high intensity at low frequencies omega/J
\lesssim 0.2J. These low energy singlet excitations do however not seem to
favor a specific valence bond crystal, but instead spread over many symmetry
allowed eigenstates.
