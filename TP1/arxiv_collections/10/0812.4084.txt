We examine theoretically the role of spin-waves on current-induced domain
wall dynamics in a ferromagnetic wire. At room temperature, we find that an
interaction between the domain wall and the spin waves appears when there is a
finite difference between the domain wall velocity $\dot{x}_0$ and the spin
current $u$. Three important consequences of this interaction are found.
Firstly, spin-wave emission leads to a Landau-type damping of the
current-induced domain wall motion towards restoring the solution $\dot{x}_0 =
u$, where spin angular momentum is perfectly transfered from the conduction
electrons to the domain wall. Secondly, the interaction leads to a modification
of the domain wall width and mass, proportional to the kinetic energy of the
domain wall. Thirdly, the coupling by the electrical current between the domain
wall and the spin waves leads to temperature-dependent effective wall mass.
