We perform a linear analysis to investigate the dynamical response of a
non-synchronized hot Jupiter to stellar irradiation. In this work, we consider
the diurnal Fourier harmonic of the stellar irradiation acting at the top of a
radiative layer of a hot Jupiter with no clouds and winds. In the absence of
the Coriolis force, the diurnal thermal forcing can excite internal waves
propagating into the planet's interior when the thermal forcing period is
longer than the sound crossing time of the planet's surface. When the Coriolis
effect is taken into consideration, the latitude-dependent stellar heating can
excite weak internal waves (g modes) and/or strong baroclinic Rossby waves
(buoyant r modes) depending on the asynchrony of the planet. When the planet
spins faster than its orbital motion (i.e. retrograde thermal forcing), these
waves carry negative angular momentum and are damped by radiative loss as they
propagate downwards from the upper layer of the radiative zone. As a result,
angular momentum is transferred from the lower layer of the radiative zone to
the upper layer and generates a vertical shear. We estimate the resulting
internal torques for different rotation periods based on the parameters of HD
209458b.
