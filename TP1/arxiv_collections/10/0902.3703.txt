Chemically derived graphene sheets were found to self-assemble onto patterned
gold structures via electrostatic interactions between noncovalent functional
groups on GS and gold. This afforded regular arrays of single graphene sheets
on large substrates, characterized by scanning electron and Auger microscopy
imaging and Raman spectroscopy. Self assembly was used for the first time to
produce on-substrate and fully-suspended graphene electrical devices. Molecular
coatings on the GS were removed by high current electrical annealing, which
recovered the high electrical conductance and Dirac point of the GS. Molecular
sensors for highly sensitive gas detections are demonstrated with
self-assembled GS devices.
