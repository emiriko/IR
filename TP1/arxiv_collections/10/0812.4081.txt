We have studied the relations between the neutron-triton scattering lengths
and effective ranges and the corresponding quantities for the p --$^{3}$He
scattering in the framework of the potential model with an effective
nucleon-nucleus interaction in the form of a $\delta $-shell potential. It is
shown that the Coulomb renormalization of the pure nuclear scattering lengths
does not change the relation well established for the n + $^{3}$H system
between the lengths: $A^{1} < A^{0}$. We have predicted the p--$^{3}$He
scattering lengths which give preference to set I of the phase analysis
performed by E.A. George et al. (2003), which corresponds to the inequality
$A^{1}_{nc} < A^{0}_{nc}$ for the scattering lengths.
