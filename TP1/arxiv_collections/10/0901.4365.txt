What is going on (as of August 2008) at the interface between theoretical
general relativity, string-inspired models, and observational astrophysics?
Quite a lot. In this mini-survey I will make a personal choice and focus on
four specific questions: Do black holes "exist"? (For selected values of the
word "exist".) Is black hole formation and evaporation unitary? Can one mimic a
black hole to arbitrary accuracy? Can one detect the presence of a horizon
using local physics?
