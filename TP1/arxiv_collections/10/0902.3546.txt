We study intersecting D6-branes in Calabi-Yau manifolds that are smooth
hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces. We develop the techniques for
calculating intersection numbers between special Lagrangian sub-manifolds
defined as fixed loci of anti-holomorphic involutions. We present global
Pati-Salam and MSSM-like models that are supersymmetric up to a decoupled
hidden sector.
