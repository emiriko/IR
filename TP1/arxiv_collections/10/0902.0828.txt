We present a new algorithm for reconstructing an exact algebraic number from
its approximate value using an improved parameterized integer relation
construction method. Our result is consistent with the existence of error
controlling on obtaining an exact rational number from its approximation. The
algorithm is applicable for finding exact minimal polynomial by its approximate
root. This also enables us to provide an efficient method of converting the
rational approximation representation to the minimal polynomial representation,
and devise a simple algorithm to factor multivariate polynomials with rational
coefficients.
  Compared with other methods, this method has the numerical computation
advantage of high efficiency. The experimental results show that the method is
more efficient than \emph{identify} in \emph{Maple} 11 for obtaining an exact
algebraic number from its approximation. In this paper, we completely implement
how to obtain exact results by numerical approximate computations.
