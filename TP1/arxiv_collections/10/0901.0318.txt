Artificial Chemistries (ACs) are symbolic chemical metaphors for the
exploration of Artificial Life, with specific focus on the problem of
biogenesis or the origin of life. This paper presents authors thoughts towards
defining a unified framework to characterize and classify symbolic artificial
chemistries by devising appropriate formalism to capture semantic and
organizational information. We identify three basic high level abstractions in
initial proposal for this framework viz., information, computation, and
communication. We present an analysis of two important notions of information,
namely, Shannon's Entropy and Algorithmic Information, and discuss inductive
and deductive approaches for defining the framework.
