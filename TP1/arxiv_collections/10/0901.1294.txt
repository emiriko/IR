We review the current status of small x resummation of evolution of parton
distributions and of deep-inelastic coefficient functions. We show that the
resummed perturbative expansion is stable, robust upon different treatments of
subleading terms, and that it matches smoothly to the unresummed perturbative
expansions, with corrections which are of the same order as the typical NNLO
ones in the HERA kinematic region. We discuss different approaches to small x
resummation: we show that the ambiguities in the resummation procedure are
small, provided all parametrically enhanced terms are included in the
resummation and properly matched.
