We investigate the stability of incompressible, exact, non-ideal
magnetorotational (MRI) modes against parasitic instabilities. Both
Kelvin-Helmholtz and tearing-mode parasitic instabilities may occur in the
dissipative regimes accessible to current numerical simulations. We suppose
that a primary MRI mode saturates at an amplitude such that its fastest
parasite has a growth rate comparable to its own. The predicted alpha parameter
then depends critically on whether the fastest primary and parasitic modes fit
within the computational domain and whether non-axisymmetric parasitic modes
are allowed. Hence even simulations that resolve viscous and resistive scales
may not saturate properly unless the numerical domain is large enough to allow
the free evolution of both MRI and parasitic modes. To minimally satisfy these
requirements in simulations with vertical background fields, the vertical
extent of the domain should accommodate the fastest growing MRI mode while the
radial and azimuthal extents must be twice as large. The fastest parasites have
horizontal wavelengths roughly twice as long as the vertical wavelength of the
primary.
