We study the configuration of magnetic moments on triangular lattices of
single-domain ferromagnetic islands, examining the consequences of
magnetostatic interactions in this frustrated geometry. By varying the
island-island distance along one direction, we are able to tune the ratio of
different interactions between neighboring islands, resulting in a
corresponding variation in the local correlations between the island moments.
Unlike other artificial frustrated magnets, this lattice geometry displays
regions of ordered moment orientation, possibly resulting from a higher degree
of anisotropy leading to a reduced level of frustration.
