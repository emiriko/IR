The use of conventional neutrino telescope methods and technology for
detecting neutrinos with energies above 1 EeV from astrophysical sources would
be prohibitively expensive and may turn out to be technically not feasible.
Acoustic detection is a promising alternative for future deep-sea neutrino
telescopes operating in this energy regime. It utilises the effect that the
energy deposit of the particle cascade evolving from a neutrino interaction in
water generates a coherently emitted sound wave with frequency components in
the range between about 1 and 50 kHz. The AMADEUS (Antares Modules for Acoustic
DEtection Under the Sea) project is integrated into the ANTARES neutrino
telescope and aims at the investigation of techniques for acoustic particle
detection in sea water. The acoustic sensors of AMADEUS are using piezo
elements and are recording a broad-band signal with frequencies ranging up to
125 kHz. After an introduction to acoustic neutrino detection it will be shown
how an acoustic array similar to AMADEUS can be used for positioning as well as
acoustic particle detection. Experience from AMADEUS and possibilities for a
future large scale neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea will be
discussed.
