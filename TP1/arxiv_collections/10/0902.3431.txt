We present the update of the Unitarity Triangle (UT) analysis within the
Standard Model (SM) and beyond. Within the SM, combining the direct
measurements on sides and angles, the UT turns out to be overconstraint in a
consistent way, showing that the CKM matrix is the dominant source of flavour
mixing and CP-violation and that New Physics (NP) effects can appear at most as
small corrections to the CKM picture. Generalizing the UT analysis to
investigate NP effects, constraints on b -> s transitions are also included and
both CKM and NP parameters are fitted simultaneously. While no evidence of NP
effects is found in K-\bar K and B_d-\bar B_d mixing, in the B_s-\bar B_s
mixing an hint of NP is found at the 2.9 \sigma level. The UT analysis beyond
the SM also allows us to derive bounds on the coefficients of the most general
\Delta F=2 effective Hamiltonian, that can be translated into bounds on the NP
scale.
