There are innumerable 'biological complexity measure's. While some patterns
emerge from these attempts to represent biological complexity, a single measure
to encompass the seemingly countless features of biological systems, still
eludes the students of Biology. It is the pursuit of this paper to discuss the
feasibility of finding one complete and objective measure for biological
complexity. A theoretical construct (the 'Thread-Mesh model') is proposed here
to describe biological reality. It segments the entire biological space-time in
a series of different biological organizations before modeling the property
space of each of these organizations with computational and topological
constructs. Acknowledging emergence as a key biological property, it has been
proved here that the quest for an objective and all-encompassing biological
complexity measure would necessarily end up in failure. Since any study of
biological complexity is rooted in the knowledge of biological reality, an
expression for possible limit of human knowledge about ontological biological
reality, in the form of an uncertainty principle, is proposed here. Two
theorems are proposed to model the fundamental limitation, owing to observer
dependent nature of description of biological reality. They explain the reasons
behind failures to construct a single and complete biological complexity
measure. This model finds support in various experimental results and therefore
provides a reliable and general way to study biological complexity and
biological reality.
