We report the discovery of a minor planet (2006 SQ372) on an orbit with a
perihelion of 24 AU and a semimajor axis of 796 AU. Dynamical simulations show
that this is a transient orbit and is unstable on a timescale of 200 Myrs.
Falling near the upper semimajor axis range of the scattered disk and the lower
semimajor axis range of the Oort Cloud, previous membership in either class is
possible. By modeling the production of similar orbits from the Oort Cloud as
well as from the scattered disk, we find that the Oort Cloud produces 16 times
as many objects on SQ372-like orbits as the scattered disk. Given this result,
we believe this to be the most distant long-period comet ever discovered.
Furthermore, our simulation results also indicate that 2000 OO67 has had a
similar dynamical history. Unaffected by the "Jupiter-Saturn Barrier," these
two objects are most likely long-period comets from the inner Oort Cloud.
