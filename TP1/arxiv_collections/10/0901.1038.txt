This paper presents a novel study on gas-like models for economic systems.
The interacting agents and the amount of exchanged money at each trade are
selected with different levels of randomness, from a purely random way to a
more chaotic one. Depending on the interaction rules, these statistical models
can present different asymptotic distributions of money in a community of
individuals with a closed economy.
