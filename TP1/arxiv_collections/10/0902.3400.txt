The precise nature of unconventional superconductivity in Iron Pnictides is
presently a hotly debated issue. Here, using insights from normal state
electronic structure and symmetry arguments, we show how an unconventional SC
emerges from the bad metal "normal" state. Short-ranged, multi-band spin- and
charge correlations generates nodeless SC in the active planar $d_{xz,yz}$
bands, and an inter-band proximity effect induces out-of-plane gap nodes in the
passive $d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ band. While very good quantitative agreement with
various key observations in the SC state and reconciliation with NMR and
penetration depth data in the same picture are particularly attractive features
of our proposal, clinching evidence would be an experimental confirmation of
c-axis nodes in future work.
