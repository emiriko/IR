We investigate the low temperature phase of three-dimensional
Edwards-Anderson model with Bernoulli random couplings. We show that at a fixed
value $Q$ of the overlap the model fulfills the clustering property: the
connected correlation functions between two local overlaps decay as a power
whose exponent is independent of $Q$ for all $0\le |Q| < q_{EA}$. Our findings
are in agreement with the RSB theory and show that the overlap is a good order
parameter.
