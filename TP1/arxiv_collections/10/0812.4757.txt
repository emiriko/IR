The mechanisms by which blast pressure waves cause mild to moderate traumatic
brain injury (mTBI) are an open question. Possibilities include acceleration of
the head, direct passage of the blast wave via the cranium, and propagation of
the blast wave to the brain via a thoracic mechanism. The hypothesis that the
blast pressure wave reaches the brain via a thoracic mechanism is considered in
light of ballistic and blast pressure wave research. Ballistic pressure waves,
caused by penetrating ballistic projectiles or ballistic impacts to body armor,
can only reach the brain via an internal mechanism and have been shown to cause
cerebral effects. Similar effects have been documented when a blast pressure
wave has been applied to the whole body or focused on the thorax in animal
models. While vagotomy reduces apnea and bradycardia due to ballistic or blast
pressure waves, it does not eliminate neural damage in the brain, suggesting
that the pressure wave directly affects the brain cells via a thoracic
mechanism. An experiment is proposed which isolates the thoracic mechanism from
cranial mechanisms of mTBI due to blast wave exposure. Results have
implications for evaluating risk of mTBI due to blast exposure and for
developing effective protection.
