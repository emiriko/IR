Convergence of the ensemble Kalman filter in the limit for large ensembles to
the Kalman filter is proved. In each step of the filter, convergence of the
ensemble sample covariance follows from a weak law of large numbers for
exchangeable random variables, the continuous mapping theorem gives convergence
in probability of the ensemble members, and $L^p$ bounds on the ensemble then
give $L^p$ convergence.
