Aims. In this paper we model, in a self-consistent way, polarimetric,
photometric, spectrophotometric and interferometric observations of the
classical Be star $\zeta$ Tauri. Our primary goal is to conduct a critical
quantitative test of the global oscillation scenario. Methods. We have carried
out detailed three-dimensional, NLTE radiative transfer calculations using the
radiative transfer code HDUST. For the input for the code we have used the most
up-to-date research on Be stars to include a physically realistic description
for the central star and the circumstellar disc. We adopt a rotationally
deformed, gravity darkened central star, surrounded by a disc whose unperturbed
state is given by a steady-state viscous decretion disc model. We further
assume that disc is in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. Results. By adopting a
viscous decretion disc model for $\zeta$ Tauri and a rigorous solution of the
radiative transfer, we have obtained a very good fit of the time-average
properties of the disc. This provides strong theoretical evidence that the
viscous decretion disc model is the mechanism responsible for disc formation.
With the global oscillation model we have successfully fitted spatially
resolved VLTI/AMBER observations and the temporal V/R variations of the
H$\alpha$ and Br$\gamma$ lines. This result convincingly demonstrates that the
oscillation pattern in the disc is a one-armed spiral. Possible model
shortcomings, as well as suggestions for future improvements, are also
discussed.
