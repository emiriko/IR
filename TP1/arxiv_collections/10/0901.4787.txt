We present multi-band photometry of 185 type-Ia supernovae (SN Ia), with over
11500 observations. These were acquired between 2001 and 2008 at the F. L.
Whipple Observatory of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA).
This sample contains the largest number of homogeneously-observed and reduced
nearby SN Ia (z < 0.08) published to date. It more than doubles the nearby
sample, bringing SN Ia cosmology to the point where systematic uncertainties
dominate. Our natural system photometry has a precision of 0.02 mag or better
in BVRIr'i' and roughly 0.04 mag in U for points brighter than 17.5 mag. We
also estimate a systematic uncertainty of 0.03 mag in our SN Ia standard system
BVRIr'i' photometry and 0.07 mag for U. Comparisons of our standard system
photometry with published SN Ia light curves and comparison stars, where
available for the same SN, reveal agreement at the level of a few hundredths
mag in most cases. We find that 1991bg-like SN Ia are sufficiently distinct
from other SN Ia in their color and light-curve-shape/luminosity relation that
they should be treated separately in light-curve/distance fitter training
samples. The CfA3 sample will contribute to the development of better
light-curve/distance fitters, particularly in the few dozen cases where
near-infrared photometry has been obtained and, together, can help disentangle
host-galaxy reddening from intrinsic supernova color, reducing the systematic
uncertainty in SN Ia distances due to dust.
