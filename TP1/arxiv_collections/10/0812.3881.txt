We derive and analyze predictions of both the hard-wall and dilaton soft-wall
AdS/QCD approximations for the scalar glueball correlator and decay constants.
We confront the results with QCD information from the lattice, the operator
product expansion (OPE), a hypothetical UV gluon mass associated with the
short-distance behavior of the heavy-quark potential, and a low-energy theorem
based on the anomalous dilatational Ward identity. Both duals turn out to
encode complementary aspects of the above, nonperturbative QCD physics. The OPE
Wilson coefficients, in particular, are shown to provide a challenging testing
ground for the impact of the strongly coupled holographic UV dynamics on dual
gravity predictions.
