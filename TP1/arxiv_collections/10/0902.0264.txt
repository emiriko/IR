The No-Cloning property in Quantum Computation is known not to depend on the
unitarity of the operators involved, but only on their linearity. Based on that
fact, here it is shown that the No-Cloning property remains valid when Quantum
Mechanics is re-formulated within far wider frameworks of {\it scalars},
namely, one or the other of the infinitely many {\it reduced power algebras}
which can replace the usual real numbers $\mathbb{R}$, or complex numbers
$\mathbb{C}$.
