It is argued that the natural kinematics of the pilot-wave theory is
Aristotelian. Despite appearances, Galilean invariance is not a fundamental
symmetry of the low-energy theory. Instead, it is a fictitious symmetry that
has been artificially imposed. It is concluded that the search for a
Lorentz-invariant extension is physically misguided.
