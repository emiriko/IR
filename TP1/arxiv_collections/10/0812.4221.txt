We investigate the classical limit of a type of semiclassical evolution, the
pertinent system representing the interaction between matter and a given field.
On using as a quantifier of the ensuing dynamics Tsallis q-entropy, we
encounter that it not only appropriately describes the quantum-classical
transition, but that the associated deformation-parameter q itself
characterizes the different regimes involved in the process, detecting the most
salient fine details of the changeover.
