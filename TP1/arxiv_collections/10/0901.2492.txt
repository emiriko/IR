The Standard Model (SM) of Particle Physics was tested to great precision by
experiments at the highest energy colliders (LEP, Hera, Tevatron, SLAC). The
only missing particle is the Higgs boson, which will be the first particle to
be searched for at the new Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The SM
anticipated that there are 3 types of left handed neutrinos. Experiments on
atmospheric and solar neutrinos (made in Japan, Italy, Canada, Russia and the
US) have shown the existence of neutrino oscillations, which imply that
neutrinos have very small mass differences and violate the conservation of
individual leptonic numbers. Neutrino oscillations were verified in long
baseline neutrino experiments (in Japan and in the USA); and cosmology has
given reasonably precise indications on the sum of the neutrino masses. In this
general lecture will be summarized some of the main properties of the SM and
some of the main results obtained in the field and the experiments in
preparation. Some of the main open questions will be briefly discussed.
