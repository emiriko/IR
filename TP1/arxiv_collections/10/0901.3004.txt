Generalizing results of our previous work (where classical kinetic energy has
been used) in this work (where ultra-relativistic kinetic energy is used) we
suggest an original variant of the determination of minimal length
(corresponding to Plank length) by formation of a microscopic (tiny) black
hole. Like to some previous authors we use Heisenberg coordinate-momentum
uncertainty relation, on the one hand. But, instead of metric fluctuation
(obtained by second derivative in Einstein equations) that generalizes
uncertainty relation by an additional term, used by previous authors, we use
Hawking temperature of the black hole and standard Heisenberg
coordinate-momentum uncertainty relation.
