We employ a straightforward relation between mutually unbiased and Bell bases
to extend the latter in terms of a direct construction for the former. We
analyze in detail the properties of these new generalized Bell states, showing
that they constitute an appropriate tool for testing entanglement in bipartite
multiqudit systems.
