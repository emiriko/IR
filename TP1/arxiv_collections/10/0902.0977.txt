We present the results of numerical simulations of wave-induced magnetic
reconnection in a model of the solar atmosphere. In the magnetic field geometry
we study in this article, the waves, driven by a monochromatic piston and a
driver taken from Hinode observations, induce periodic reconnection of the
magnetic field, and this reconnection appears to help drive long-period
chromospheric jets. By synthesizing observations for a variety of wavelengths
that are sensitive to a wide range of temperatures, we shed light on the often
confusing relationship between the plethora of jet-like phenomena in the solar
atmosphere, e.g., explosive events, spicules, blinkers, and other phenomena
thought to be caused by reconnection.
