Recent magnetic susceptibility measurements for polycrystalline samples of
binuclear nitrosyl iron complexes [Fe_2(C_3H_3N_2S)_2(NO)_4] (I) and
[Fe_2(SC_3H_5N_2)_2(NO)_4] (II), suggest that quantum-mechanical entanglement
of the spin degrees of freedom exists in these compounds. Entanglement E exists
below the temperature T_E that we have estimated for complexes I and II to be
80-90 and 110-120 K, respectively. Using an expression of entanglement in terms
of magnetic susceptibility for a Heisenberg dimer, we find the temperature
dependence of the entanglement for complex II. Having arisen at the temperature
T_E, the entanglement increases monotonically with decreasing temperature and
reaches 90-95% in this complex at T=25 K, when the subordinate effects are
still small.
