In this review paper, we consider the fundamental nature of time and
causality, most particularly, in the context of the theories of special and
general relativity. We also discuss the issue of closed timelike curves in the
context of general relativity, and the associated paradoxes, the question of
directionality of the time flow and, rather briefly, the problem of time in
quantum gravity.
