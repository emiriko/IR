Third-order nonlinear optical effects in photonic microcavities are studied.
Significant light defocusing in the thin nonlinear microcavity spacer was
observed. The polarization self-action effect was detected, when the large
nonlinear polarization rotation angle arises when exciting the microcavity
mode, being proportional to the radiation intensity.
