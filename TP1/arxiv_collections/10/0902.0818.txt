We explore how the Jaynes-Cummings ladder transpires in the emitted spectra
of a two-level system in strong coupling with a single mode of light. We focus
on the case of very strong coupling, that would be achieved with systems of
exceedingly good quality (very long lifetimes for both the emitter and the
cavity). We consider the incoherent regime of excitation, that is realized with
semiconductors quantum dots in microcavities, and discuss how reasonable is the
understanding of the systems in terms of transitions between dressed states of
the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian.
