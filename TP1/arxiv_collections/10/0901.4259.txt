X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the Eu L-edge (2p->5d) in two
compounds exhibiting valence fluctuation, namely EuNi2(Si0.18Ge0.82)2 and
EuNi2P2, has been investigated at pulsed high magnetic fields of up to 40 T. A
distinct XMCD peak corresponding to the trivalent state (Eu3+; f6), whose
ground state is nonmagnetic (J=0), was observed in addition to the main XMCD
peak corresponding to the magnetic (J=7/2) divalent state (Eu2+; f7). This
result indicates that the 5d electrons belonging to both valence states are
magnetically polarized. It was also found that the ratio P5d(3+)/P5d(2+)
between the polarization of 5d electrons (P5d) in the Eu3+ state and that of
Eu2+ is ~ 0.1 in EuNi2(Si0.18Ge0.82)2 and ~ 0.3 in EuNi2P2 at magnetic fields
where their macroscopic magnetization values are the same. The possible origin
of the XMCD of the Eu3+ state and an explanation of the dependence of
P5d(3+)/P5d(2+) on the material are discussed in terms of hybridization between
the conduction electrons and the f electrons.
