We show that in s-wave superfluids of cold fermionic atoms with
laser-field-generated effective spin-orbit interactions, a topological phase
with gapless edge states and Majorana fermion quasiparticles obeying the
non-Abelian statistics is realized in the case with a large Zeeman magnetic
field. Our scenario provides a promising approach for quantum computation
manipulating non-Abelian anyons via an s-wave Feshbach resonance.
