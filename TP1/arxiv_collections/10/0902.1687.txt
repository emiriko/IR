Au/Co/Au nanopillars fabricated by colloidal lithography of continuous
trilayers exhibit and enhanced coercive field and the appearance of an exchange
bias field with respect to the continuous layers. This is attributed to the
lateral oxidation of the Co interlayer that appears upon disc fabrication. The
dependence of the exchange bias field on the Co nanodots size and on the
oxidation degree is analyzed and its microscopic origin clarified by means of
Monte Carlo simulations based on a model of a cylindrical dot with lateral
core/shell structure.
