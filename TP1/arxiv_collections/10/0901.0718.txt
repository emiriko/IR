Abreg: By combining HST/UDF imagery with kinematics from VLT/GIRAFFE we
derive a physical model of distant galaxy J033245.11-274724.0 in a way similar
to what can be done in the nearby Universe. Here we study the properties of a
distant compact LIRGs galaxy. Given the photometric and spectro photometric
accuracies, we can decompose the galaxy in sub components and correct them for
reddening. The galaxy is dominated by a dust enshrouded disk revealed by UDF
imagery. The disk radius is half that of the Milky Way and the galaxy have a
SFR=20Mo/yr. Morphology and kinematics show that gas and stars together spiral
inwards rapidly to feed the disk and the central regions. A combined system of
a bar and two non rotating spiral arms regulates the material accretion,
induces large sigma, with sigma larger than 100 km/s and redistributes the
angular momentum (AM). The detailed physical properties resemble to the
expectations from modeling a merger of two equal mass, gaseous rich galaxies,
0.5 Gyr after the merger. In its later evolution, this galaxy could become a
late type galaxy which falls on the T-F relation, with an AM mostly induced by
the orbital AM of the merger.
