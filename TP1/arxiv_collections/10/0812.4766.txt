The applicability of the Principle of Corresponding States (PCS) for the
noble fluids is discussed. We give the thermodynamic evidences for the
dimerization of the liquid phase in heavy noble gases like argon, krypton etc.
which manifest itself in deviation from the PCS. The behavior of the
rectilinear diameter of the entropy and the density is analyzed. It is shown
that these characteristics are very sensitive to the dimerization process which
takes place in the liquid phase of heavy noble gases.
