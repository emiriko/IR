The Polya number of a classical random walk on a regular lattice is known to
depend solely on the dimension of the lattice. For one and two dimensions it
equals one, meaning unit probability to return to the origin. This result is
extremely sensitive to the directional symmetry, any deviation from the equal
probability to travel in each direction results in a change of the character of
the walk from recurrent to transient. Applying our definition of the Polya
number to quantum walks on a line we show that the recurrence character of
quantum walks is more stable against bias. We determine the range of parameters
for which biased quantum walks remain recurrent. We find that there exist
genuine biased quantum walks which are recurrent.
