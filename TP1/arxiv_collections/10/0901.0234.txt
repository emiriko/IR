We use the Wa\'zewski topological principle to establish a number of new
sufficient conditions for the existence of proper (defined on the entire time
axis) solutions of essentially nonlinear nonautonomous systems. The systems
under consideration are characterized by the monotonicity property with respect
to a certain auxiliary guiding function $W(t,x)$ depending on time and phase
coordinates. Another auxiliary function $V(t,x)$, which is positively defined
in the phase variables $x$ for any $t$, is used to estimate the deviation of
the proper solutions from the origin.
