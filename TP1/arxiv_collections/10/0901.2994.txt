In this paper we explore the connection between semi-classical and quantum
Birkhoff canonical forms (BCF) for Schrodinger operators. In particular we give
a "non-symbolic" operator theoretic derivation of the quantum Birkhoff
canonical form and provide an explicit recipe for expressing the quantum BCF in
terms of the semi-classical BCF.
