The fundamental nature of mass is one of the greatest mysteries in physics.
The Higgs mechanism is a theoretically appealing way to account for the
different masses of elementary particles and implies the existence of a new,
yet unseen particle, the Higgs boson. We search for evidence of a light scalar
(e.g. a Higgs boson) in the radiative decays of the narrow Y(3S) resonance:
Y(3S)->gamma A0, A0->mu+mu-. Such an object appears in extensions of the
Standard Model, where a light CP-odd Higgs boson naturally couples strongly to
b-quarks. We find no evidence for such processes in a sample of 122*10^6 Y(3S)
decays collected by the BABAR collaboration at the PEP-II B-factory, and set
90% C.L. upper limits on the branching fraction product B(Y(3S)-> gamma
A0)*B(A0->mu+mu-) at (0.25-5.2)*10^{-6} in the mass range 0.212<= m(A0)<=9.3
GeV. We also set a limit on the dimuon branching fraction of the eta_b meson
B(eta_b->mu+mu-)<0.8% at 90% C.L. The results are preliminary.
