The spin-orbit interaction generally leads to spin splitting (SS) of electron
and hole energy states in solids, a splitting that is characterized by a
scaling with the wavevector $\bf k$. Whereas for {\it 3D bulk zincblende}
solids the electron (heavy hole) SS exhibits a cubic (linear) scaling with $k$,
in {\it 2D quantum-wells} the electron (heavy hole) SS is currently believed to
have a mostly linear (cubic) scaling. Such expectations are based on using a
small 3D envelope function basis set to describe 2D physics. By treating
instead the 2D system explicitly in a multi-band many-body approach we discover
a large linear scaling of hole states in 2D. This scaling emerges from hole
bands coupling that would be unsuspected by the standard model that judges
coupling by energy proximity. This discovery of a linear Dresselhaus k-scaling
for holes in 2D implies a different understanding of hole-physics in
low-dimensions.
