We demonstrate electronic cooling of 1D phonon modes in suspended nanowires
for the first time, using normal metal--insulator--superconductor (NIS) tunnel
junctions. Simultaneous cooling of both electrons and phonons to a common
temperature was achieved. In comparison with non-suspended devices, better
cooling performance is achieved in the whole operating range of bath
temperatures between 0.1-0.7 K. The observed low-temperature thermal transport
characteristics are consistent with scattering of ballistic phonons at the
nanowire-bulk contact as being the mechanism limiting thermal transport. At the
lowest bath temperature of the experiment $\sim$ 100 mK, both phonons and
electrons in the beam were cooled down to 42 mK, which is below the
refrigerator bath temperature.
