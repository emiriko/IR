The nuclear physics experiments at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator
Facility often require longitudinally polarized electrons to be simultaneously
delivered to three experimental halls. The degree of longitudinal polarization
to each hall varies as function of the accelerator settings, making it
challenging in certain situations to deliver a high degree of longitudinal
polarization to all the halls simultaneously. Normally, the degree of
longitudinal polarization the halls receive is optimized by changing the
initial spin direction at the beginning of the machine with a Wien filter.
Herein, it is shown that it is possible to further improve the degree of
longitudinal polarization for multiple experimental halls by redistributing the
energy gain of the CEBAF linacs while keeping the total energy gain fixed.
