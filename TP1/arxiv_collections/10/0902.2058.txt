We analyze the spinor dynamics of a Rb-87 F=2 condensate initially prepared
in the m_F=0 Zeeman sublevel. We show that this dynamics, characterized by the
creation of correlated atomic pairs in m_F=+/-1, presents an intriguing
multi-resonant magnetic field dependence induced by the trap inhomogeneity.
This dependence is directly linked to the most unstable Bogoliubov spin
excitations of the initial m_F = 0 condensate, showing that, in general, even a
qualitative understanding of the pair creation efficiency in a spinor
condensate requires a careful consideration of the confinement.
