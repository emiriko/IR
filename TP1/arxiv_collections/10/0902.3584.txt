The quantum Zakharov system in three-spatial dimensions and an associated
Lagrangian description, as well as its basic conservation laws are derived. In
the adiabatic and semiclassical case, the quantum Zakharov system reduces to a
quantum modified vector nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation for the envelope
electric field. The Lagrangian structure for the resulting vector NLS equation
is used to investigate the time-dependence of the Gaussian shaped localized
solutions, via the Rayleigh-Ritz variational method. The formal classical limit
is considered in detail. The quantum corrections are shown to prevent the
collapse of localized Langmuir envelope fields, in both two and three-spatial
dimensions. Moreover, the quantum terms can produce an oscillatory behavior of
the width of the approximate Gaussian solutions. The variational method is
shown to preserve the essential conservation laws of the quantum modified
vector NLS equation.
