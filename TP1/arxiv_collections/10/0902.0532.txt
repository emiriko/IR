Here, we report an overview of the phase diagram of single layered and double
layered Fe arsenide superconductors at high magnetic fields. Our systematic
magnetotransport measurements of polycrystalline SmFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$ at
different doping levels confirm the upward curvature of the upper critical
magnetic field $H_{c2}(T)$ as a function of temperature $T$ defining the phase
boundary between the superconducting and metallic states for crystallites with
the ab planes oriented nearly perpendicular to the magnetic field. We further
show from measurements on single crystals that this feature, which was
interpreted in terms of the existence of two superconducting gaps, is
ubiquitous among both series of single and double layered compounds. In all
compounds explored by us the zero temperature upper critical field $H_{c2}(0)$,
estimated either through the Ginzburg-Landau or the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg
single gap theories, strongly surpasses the weak coupling Pauli paramagnetic
limiting field. This clearly indicates the strong coupling nature of the
superconducting state and the importance of magnetic correlations for these
materials. Our measurements indicate that the superconducting anisotropy, as
estimated through the ratio of the effective masses $\gamma =
(m_c/m_{ab})^{1/2}$ for carriers moving along the c-axis and the ab planes,
respectively, is relatively modest as compared to the high-$T_c$ cuprates, but
it is temperature, field and even doping dependent. Finally, our preliminary
estimations of the irreversibility field $H_m(T)$, separating the vortex-solid
from the vortex-liquid phase in the single layered compounds, indicates that it
is well described by the melting of a vortex lattice in a moderately
anisotropic uniaxial superconductor.
