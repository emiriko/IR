We consider a very asymmetric system of Fermions with an interaction
characterized by a positive scattering length only. The minority atoms pair and
form a BEC of dimers, while the surplus fermions interact only indirectly
through the exchange of Bogoliubov sound modes. This interaction has a finite
range, the retardation effects are significant and the surplus fermions will
form a P-wave superfluid. We compute the P-wave pairing gap in the BCS and
Eliashberg with only energy dependence approximations, and demonstrate their
inadequacy in comparison with a full treatment of the momentum and energy
dependence of the induced interaction. The pairing gap computed with a full
momentum and energy dependence is significantly larger in magnitude and that
makes it more likely that this new exotic paired phase could be put in evidence
in atomic trap experiments.
