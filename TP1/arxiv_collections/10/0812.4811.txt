We consider dynamics of hidden variables for measurements in a generalized
bell-type model for a single spin using natural assumptions. The evolution of
the system, which can be expressed as dynamic chaos is studied. The equilibrium
state that the system evolves to asymptotically is consistent with the
predictions of quantum theory. The thesis of incompleteness of quantum
mechanics in dynamic interpretation and completeness in statistical
interpretation are developed. Conceptual problems of quantum mechanics such as
violations of Bell inequalities, negative probabilities, complementarity
principle, Einstein's locality and others are discussed.
