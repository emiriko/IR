A theoretical approach with a microscopic model is proposed for the observed
"high temperature superconductivity" in the Iron-based compounds. The above
scheme takes into account two important aspects viz. (i) superconducting
transition close to magnetic ordering and (ii) the layered structure. From the
calculation of the superconducting transition temperature, it is shown that in
the Fe-based superconductors the magnetic mechanism for superconductivity,
operating through the effective attractive Coulomb interaction within the
framework of the Fermi Liquid theory, is highly plausible.
