The temperature dependance of the action in the thin-wall and thick-wall
limits is obtained analytically for the $\phi^6$ scalar potential. The nature
of the phase transition is investigated from the quantum tunnelling regime at
low temperatures to the thermal hopping regime at high temperatures. It is
first-order for the case of a thin wall while for the thick wall it is second-
order.
