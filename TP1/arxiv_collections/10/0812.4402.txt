We calculate the decay rate ratios for OZI allowed decays of Upsilon(5S) to
two B mesons by using the decay amplitudes which incorporate the wave function
of the Upsilon(5S) state. We obtain the results that the branching ratio of the
Upsilon(5S) decay to Bs* Bs*bar is much larger than the branching ratio to Bs
Bs*bar or Bsbar Bs*, in good agreement with recent experimental results of CLEO
and BELLE. This agreement with the experimental results is made possible since
the nodes of the Upsilon(5S) radial wave function induce the nodes of the decay
amplitude. We find that the results for the Upsilon(5S) decays to Bu(*)
Bu(*)bar or Bd(*) Bd(*)bar pairs are dependent on the parameter values used for
the potential between heavy quarks.
