Let $\F$ a finite field. We show that the universal characteristic factor for
the Gowers-Host-Kra uniformity seminorm $U^k(\X)$ for an ergodic action
$(T_g)_{g \in \F^\omega}$ of the infinite abelian group $\F^\omega$ on a
probability space $X = (X,\B,\mu)$ is generated by phase polynomials $\phi: X
\to S^1$ of degree less than $C(k)$ on $X$, where $C(k)$ depends only on $k$.
In the case where $k \leq \charac(\F)$ we obtain the sharp result $C(k)=k$.
This is a finite field counterpart of an analogous result for $\Z$ by Host and
Kra. In a companion paper to this paper, we shall combine this result with a
correspondence principle to establish the inverse theorem for the Gowers norm
in finite fields in the high characteristic case $k \leq \charac(\F)$, with a
partial result in low characteristic.
