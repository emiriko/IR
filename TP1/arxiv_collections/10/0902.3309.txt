The light transmission through a dispersive plasmonic circular hole is
numerically investigated with an emphasis on its subwavelength guidance. For a
better understanding of the effect of the hole diameter on the guided
dispersion characteristics, the guided modes, including both the surface
plasmon polariton mode and the circular waveguide mode, are studied for several
hole diameters, especially when the metal cladding has a plasmonic frequency
dependency. A brief comparison is also made with the guided dispersion
characteristics of a dispersive plasmonic gap [K. Y. Kim, et al., Opt. Express
14, 320-330 (2006)], which is a planar version of the present structure, and a
circular waveguide with perfect electric conductor cladding. Finally, the modal
behavior of the first three TM-like principal modes with varied hole diameters
is examined for the same operating mode.
