Analytical calculations show that the mean-motion of a quantum particle
trapped by a rapidly oscillating potential can be significantly manipulated by
inducing phase hops, i.e., by instantaneously changing the potential's phase. A
phase hop can be visualized as being the result of a collision with an
imaginary particle which can be controlled. Several phase hops can have
accumulating effects on the particle's mean-motion, even if they transform the
particle's Hamiltonian into its initial one. The theoretical predictions are
verified by numerical simulations for the one-dimensional Paul-trap.
