It is proposed that the 50-70 meV dispersion anomaly (kink) in electron-doped
cuprates revealed by recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
experiments is caused by coupling with the spin fluctuation. We elaborate that
the kink exists both along nodal and antinodal directions, and both in the
superconducting and normal state. The renormalized effect for the density of
states is also studied and the hump feature outside the superconducting
coherent peak is established, consistent with recent scanning tunnelling
microscopy experiments.
