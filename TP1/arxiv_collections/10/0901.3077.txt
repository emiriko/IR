We consider the diffusion of independent particles experiencing random
accelerations by a space- and time-dependent force as well as viscous damping.
This model can exhibit several asymptotic behaviours, depending upon the
limiting cases which are considered, some of which have been discussed in
earlier work. Here we explore the full space of dimensionless parameters, and
introduce an "asymptotic phase diagram" which delineates the limiting regimes.
