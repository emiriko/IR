We have developed a model accounting for the photo-excitation dynamics and
the photoluminescence of strongly coupled J-aggregate microcavities. Our model
is based on a description of the J-aggregate film as a disordered Frenkel
exciton system in which relaxation occurs due to the presence of a thermal bath
of molecular vibrations. In a strongly coupled microcavity exciton-polaritons
are formed, mixing superradiant excitons and cavity photons. The calculation of
the microcavity steady-state photoluminescence, following a CW non resonant
pumping, is carried out. The experimental photoluminescence intensity ratio
between upper and lower polariton branches is accurately reproduced. In
particular both thermal activation of the photoluminescence intensity ratio and
its Rabi splitting dependence are a consequence of the bottleneck in the
relaxation, occurring at the bottom of the excitonic reservoir. The effects due
to radiative channels of decay of excitons and to the presence of a
paritticular set of discrete optical molecular vibrations active in relaxation
processes are investigared.
