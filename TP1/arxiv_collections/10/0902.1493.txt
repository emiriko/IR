The category of character D-modules is realized as Drinfeld center of the
abelian monoidal category of Harish-Chandra bimodules. Tensor product of
Harish-Chandra bimodules is related to convolution of D-modules via the long
intertwining functor (Radon transform) by a result of Beilinson and Ginzburg.
Exactness property of the long intertwining functor on a cell subquotient of
the Harish-Chandra bimodules category shows that the truncated convolution
category can be realized as a subquotient of the category of Harish-Chandra
bimodules. Together with the description of the truncated convolution category
arXiv:math/0605628v3 this allows us to derive classification of irreducible
character sheaves over $\mathbb C$ obtained by Lusztig by a different method.
  We also give a simple description for the top cohomology of convolution of
character sheaves over $\mathbb C$ in a given cell modulo smaller cells and
relate the so-called Harish-Chandra functor to Verdier specialization in the De
Concini-Procesi compactification.
