A well-motivated extension of higher order holonomy corrections in loop
quantum cosmology (LQC) for the $k=0$ Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model is
investigated at the level of heuristic effective dynamics. It reveals that the
quantum bounce is generic, regardless of the order of corrections, and the
matter density remains finite, bounded from above by an upper bound in the
regime of the Planckian density, even if all orders of corrections are
included. This observation provides further evidence that the quantum bounce is
essentially a consequence of the loopy nature (i.e. intrinsic discreteness) of
LQC and LQC is fundamentally different from the Wheeler-DeWitt theory; it also
encourages one to construct the quantum theory of LQC with the higher order
holonomy corrections, which might be understood as related to the higher $j$
representations in the Hamiltonian operator of loop quantum gravity.
