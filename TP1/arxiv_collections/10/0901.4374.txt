We study planar gluon scattering amplitudes and Wilson loops in
non-commutative gauge theory. Our main results are:
  1. We find the map between observables in non-commutative gauge theory and
their holographic dual. In that map, the region near the boundary of the
gravitational dual describes the physics in terms of T-dual variables.
  2. We show that in the presence of a large magnetic background and a UV
regulator, a planar gluon scattering amplitude reduces to a complex polygon
Wilson loop expectation value, dressed by a tractable polarization dependent
factor.
