In late 2003, the young eruptive variable star V1647 Orionis optically
brightened by over 5 magnitudes, stayed bright for around 26 months, and then
decline to its pre-outburst level. In August 2008 the star was reported to have
unexpectedly brightened yet again and we herein present the first detailed
observations of this new outburst. Photometrically, the star is now as bright
as it ever was following the 2003 eruption. Spectroscopically, a pronounced P
Cygni profile is again seen in Halpha with an absorption trough extending to
-700 km/s. In the near-infrared, the spectrum now possesses very weak CO
overtone bandhead absorption in contrast to the strong bandhead emission seen
soon after the 2003 event. Water vapor absorption is also much stronger than
previously seen. We discuss the current outburst below and relate it to the
earlier event.
