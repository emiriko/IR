In type A, the q,t-Fuss-Catalan numbers can be defined as a bigraded Hilbert
series of a module associated to the symmetric group. We generalize this
construction to (finite) complex reflection groups and, based on computer
experiments, we exhibit several conjectured algebraic and combinatorial
properties of these polynomials with non-negative integer coefficients. We
prove the conjectures for the dihedral groups and for the cyclic groups.
Finally, we present several ideas how the q,t-Fuss-Catalan numbers could be
related to some graded Hilbert series of modules arising in the context of
rational Cherednik algebras and thereby generalize known connections.
