Superconducting quantum circuits are promising systems for experiments
testing fundamental quantum mechanics on a macroscopic scale and for
applications in quantum information processing. We report on the fabrication
and characterization of superconducting flux qubits, readout dc SQUIDs, on-chip
shunting capacitors, and high-quality coplanar waveguide resonators.
Furthermore, we discuss the tunability and fundamental symmetry aspects
inherent to all superconducting qubits, which can be regarded as artificial
solid-state atoms. Comparing them to their natural counterparts, we discuss
first and second-order energy shifts due to static control fields.
Additionally, we present an intuitive derivation of the first- and second-order
matrix elements for level transitions in the presence of a coherent microwave
driving.
