A model of generalised hybrid inflation in a supersymmetric QCD theory is
proposed whose parameters are the gauge coupling and quark masses. Its
gravitational coupling to another SQCD sector induces a metastable
supersymmetry breaking vacuum of the ISS type as ISS quarks become massive at
the end of inflation. Using a known mechanism with a gravitational breaking of
the baryon number and the gauging of flavour symmetries, we find that gauge
mediation of supersymmetry breaking is compatible with the dynamics of the
inflation sector. Reheating proceeds via the thermalization of the ISS
messengers into the standard model states. This setup contains a single
dimensionful parameter in the form of a quark mass term in the inflationary
sector, i.e. all other scales involved are either related to this single mass
parameter or dynamically generated.
