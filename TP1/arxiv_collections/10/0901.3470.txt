Interpretation of the recently discovered very high energy (VHE) pulsed
emission from the Crab pulsar is presented. By taking into account the fact
that Crab pulsar's radiation for the optical and VHE spectrum peak at the same
phases, we argue that the source of this broad band emission is spatially
localized. It is shown that the only mechanism providing the results of the
MAGIC Cherenkov telescope, should be the synchrotron radiation. We find that in
the magnetospheric electron-positron plasma, due to the cyclotron instability,
the pitch angle becomes non-vanishing, which leads to the efficient synchrotron
mechanism, intensifying on the light cylinder lengthscales. We also estimate
the VHE radiation spectral index to be equal to -1/2.
