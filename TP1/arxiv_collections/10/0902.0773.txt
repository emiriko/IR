In this paper, we compare the branching ratio and rate difference of electron
channel to muon channel of $B \rar K_0^\ast (1430) \ell^+ \ell^-$ and $B \rar
K^\ast \ell^+ \ell^-$decays, where $K_0^\ast (1430)$ is the p--wave scalar
meson, in the supersymmetric models. MSSM with $R$ parity is considered since
considerable deviation from the standard model predictions can be obtained in
$B\rightarrow X_s \ell^-\ell^+$. Taking $C_{Q1}$ and $C_{Q2}$ about one which
is consistent with the $B\to K^\ast\mu^+\mu^-$ rate at low dileptonic invariant
mass region($1\leq q^2\leq 6$GeV$^2$). It is found that, firstly, the $B \rar
K_0^\ast (1430) \ell^+ \ell^-$ $(\ell = \mu,\, \tau)$ decay is measurable at
LHC, secondly, in comparison with $B \rar K^\ast \ell^+ \ell^-$ decay a greater
deviation in the $B \rar K_0^\ast (1430) \ell^+ \ell^-$ decay can be seen.
Measurement of these observables for the semileptonic rare $B \rar K_0^\ast
(1430) \ell^+ \ell^-$, in particular, at low $q^2$ region can give valuable
information about the nature of interactions within Standard Model or beyond.
