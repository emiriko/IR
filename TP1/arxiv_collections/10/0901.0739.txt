First measurements of the differential cross sections for the inclusive
production of a photon in association with a heavy quark (c, b) jet are
presented, covering photon transverse momenta 30-150 GeV, photon rapidities |
y_gamma| < 1.0, jet rapidities |y_jet| < 0.8, and jet transverse momenta pT_jet
> 15 GeV. The results are based on an integrated luminosity of 1 fb^-1 in ppbar
collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV recorded with the D0 detector at the Fermilab
Tevatron Collider. The results are compared with next-to-leading order
perturbative QCD predictions.
