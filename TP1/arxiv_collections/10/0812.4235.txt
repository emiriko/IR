A client-server architecture to simultaneously solve multiple learning tasks
from distributed datasets is described. In such architecture, each client is
associated with an individual learning task and the associated dataset of
examples. The goal of the architecture is to perform information fusion from
multiple datasets while preserving privacy of individual data. The role of the
server is to collect data in real-time from the clients and codify the
information in a common database. The information coded in this database can be
used by all the clients to solve their individual learning task, so that each
client can exploit the informative content of all the datasets without actually
having access to private data of others. The proposed algorithmic framework,
based on regularization theory and kernel methods, uses a suitable class of
mixed effect kernels. The new method is illustrated through a simulated music
recommendation system.
