Observations of magnetic fields of stars at the pre-main sequence phase can
provide important new insights into the complex physics of the late stages of
star formation. This is especially true at intermediate stellar masses, where
magnetic fields are strong and globally organised, and therefore most amenable
to direct study. Recent circularly-polarised spectroscopic observations of
pre-main sequence Herbig Ae/Be stars have revealed the presence of organised
magnetic fields in the photospheres of a small fraction of these objects. To
date, 9 magnetic HAeBe stars have been detected, and those detections confirmed
by repeated observations. The morphology and variability of their Stokes V
signatures indicates that their magnetic fields have important dipole
components of kG strength, and that the dipole is stable on timescales ofat
least years. These magnetic stars exhibit a large range of stellar mass, from
about 2-13 solar masses, and diverse rotational properties, with vsini from a
few km/s to 200 km/s. Most magnetic HAeBe stars show approximately solar
abundances; they clearly do not generally exhibit the strong and systematic
peculiarities of the magnetic main sequence A and B type stars (the Ap/Bp
stars). The observed fractional bulk incidence of magnetic HAeBe stars is about
7%, a value compatible with the incidence of magnetic intermediate-mass stars
on the main sequence. This low incidence is at odds with formation scenarios
generally involving magnetically-mediated accretion. The similarily between the
magnetic properties of the pre-main sequence and main sequence
intermediate-mass stars appears compatible with the hypothesis of a fossil
origin of magnetism in these objects.
