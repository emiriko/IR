We present the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) discovery potential in the $Z'$
and heavy neutrino sectors of a $U(1)_{B-L}$ enlarged Standard Model also
encompassing three heavy Majorana neutrinos. This model exhibits novel
signatures at the LHC, the most interesting arising from a $Z'$ decay chain
involving heavy neutrinos, eventually decaying into leptons and jets. In
particular, this signature allows one to measure the $Z'$ and heavy neutrino
masses involved. In addition, over a large region of parameter space, the heavy
neutrinos are rather long-lived particles producing distinctive displaced
vertices that can be seen in the detectors. Lastly, the simultaneous
measurement of both the heavy neutrino mass and decay length enables an
estimate of the absolute mass of the parent light neutrino.
