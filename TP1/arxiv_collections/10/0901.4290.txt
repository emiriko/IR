By patterning mesoscopic crystals of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 (BSCCO) into
electromagnetic resonators the oscillations of a large number of intrinsic
Josephson junctions can be synchronized into a macroscopic coherent state
accompanied by the emission of strong continuous wave THz-radiation. The
temperature dependence of the emission is governed by the interplay of
self-heating in the resonator and by re-trapping of intrinsic Josephson
junctions which can yield a strongly nonmonotonic temperature dependence of the
emission power. Furthermore, proper shaping of the resonators yields THzsources
with voltage-tunable emission frequencies.
