Full nucleation control for deposited functional molecules on pre-patterned
surfaces is of major technological relevance. To understand the nucleation
behavior we combine the numerical solution for the evolution of the adatom
concentration with standard nucleation theory. From the qualitative change in
nucleation behavior upon variation of the pattern spacing and coverage we show
why the quality of nucleation control can vary significantly in different
parameter regimes. In some limits analytical expressions can be formulated for
the nucleation control. Our analysis provides a theoretical explanation for
previous experimental observations [Wang et al, PRL 98, 225504 (2007)].
