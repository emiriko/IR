The identification of dark matter in our particle physics model is still a
very open question. Here we will argue that axinos can be successful dark
matter candidates in models with supersymmetry and the axion solution of the
strong CP problem. Axinos can be the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), or
can be heavier than the LSP. Axinos can be produced in the right abundance by
thermal scatterings and if they are the LSP also by out of equilibrium decays
of the lightest superpartner of SM fields (LSPSMs). On the other hand heavier
(not LSP) axinos can generate a part of the neutralino LSP dark matter.
Depending on the nature of the supersymmetric spectrum, and if R-parity is
strictly conserved or slightly broken, very different signals of the LSP axino
scenario can arise at colliders and in astrophysics.
