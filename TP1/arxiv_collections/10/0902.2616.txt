The nuclear thermodynamic observables like the temperature, volume and the
specific heat as obtained from isotopic ratios in hot disassembled nuclear
matter are examined in the light of the S-matrix approach to the nuclear
equation of state. The values of the observables, as extracted without
inclusion of scattering effects are found to be modified appreciably in some
cases when scattering between the fragment species is taken care of.
