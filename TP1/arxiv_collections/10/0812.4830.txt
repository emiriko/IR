We have studied the eta->pi+pi-e+e-(gamma) decay using about 1.7 fb^-1
collected by the KLOE experiment at the DAFNE phi-factory. This corresponds to
about 72 millions eta mesons produced in phi radiative decays. We have measured
the branching ratio, inclusive of radiative effects, with 4% accuracy:
BR(eta->pi+pi-e+e-(gamma)) = (26.8 +/- 0.9_Stat. +/- 0.7_Syst.) x 10^-5. We
have obtained the first measurement of the CP-odd pipi-ee decay planes angular
asymmetry, A_phi = (-0.6 +/- 2.5_Stat. +/- 1.8_Syst.) x 10^-2.
