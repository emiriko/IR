Based on the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) technique and the
Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker theory, the possibility of a molecular spin-electronic
device, which consists of a single C$_{60}$ molecule attached to two
ferromagnetic electrodes with finite cross sections, is investigated. By
studying the coherent spin-dependent transport through the energy levels of the
molecule, it is shown that the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) of the molecular
junction depends on the applied voltages and the number of contact points
between the device electrodes and the molecule. The TMR values more than 60%
are obtained by adjusting the related parameters.
