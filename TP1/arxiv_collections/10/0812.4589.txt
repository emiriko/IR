We consider a hyperbolic surface bundle over the circle with the smallest
known volume among hyperbolic manifolds having 3 cusps, so called "the magic
manifold". We compute the entropy function on the fiber face of the unit ball
with respect to the Thurston norm, determine homology classes whose
representatives are genus 0 fiber surfaces, and describe their monodromies by
braids. Among such homology classes whose representatives have n punctures, we
decide which one realizes the minimal entropy. It turns out that all the braids
with smallest known entropy are derived from monodromies for such homology
classes.
