The paper introduces external ellipsoidal and external sphero-conal
$h$-harmonics for the Dunkl-Laplacian. These external $h$-harmonics admit
integral representations, and they are connected by a formula of Niven's type.
External $h$-harmonics in the plane are expressed in terms of Jacobi
polynomials $P_n^{\alpha,\beta}$ and Jacobi's functions $Q_n^{\alpha,\beta}$ of
the second kind.
