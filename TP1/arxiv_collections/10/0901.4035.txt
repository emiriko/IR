We solve two-dimensional large-N QCD in the presence of a nonzero baryon
number B, and for arbitrary quark mass m and volume L. We fully treat the
dynamics of the gluonic zero modes and check how this affects results from
previous studies of the B=0 and B=1 systems. For a finite density of baryons,
and for any m>0, we find that the ground state contains a baryon crystal with
expectation values for psi-bar gamma_mu psi that have a helix-like spatial
structure. We study how these evolve with B and see that the volume integral of
psi-bar psi strongly changes with the baryon density. We compare this emerging
crystal structure with the sine-Gordon crystal, which is expected to be a good
approximation for light quarks, and find that it is a very good approximation
for surprisingly heavy quarks. We also calculate the way the ground state
energy E changes as a function of the baryon number B, and find that for
sufficiently large densities the function E(B) is well described by the
equation of state for free massless quarks, thus suggesting a quark-Hadron
continuity. From dE(B)/dB we calculate the quark chemical potential mu as a
function of B and see that the baryons repel each other. The way mu depends on
B also allows us to translate our findings to the grand-canonical ensemble. The
resulting phase structure along the mu-axis contains a phase transition that
occurs at a value of mu equal to the baryon mass divided in N, and that
separates a mu-independent phase with intact translation symmetry from a
mu-dependent phase with spontaneously broken translation symmetry. Finally, our
calculations confirm the presence of a partial large-N Eguchi-Kawai volume
independence, as described in Phys.Rev.D79:105021, that arises only if one
treats the gluonic zero modes correctly.
