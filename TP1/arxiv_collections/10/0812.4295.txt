Replicator equations (RE) are among the basic tools in mathematical theory of
selection and evolution. We develop a method for reducing a wide class of the
RE, which in general are systems of differential equations in Banach space to
escort systems of ODEs that in many cases can be explored analytically. The
method has potential for different applications; some examples are given.
