Last and nearest GRB-XRF 080109 has been an exceptional lesson on GRB nature.
After a decade (since 25 April 08) we know that Supernovae may often contain a
Jet. Its persistent activity may shine on axis as a GRBs. Such a persistent,
thin beamed gamma jet may be powered by either a BH (Black Holes) or Pulsars.
Late stages of these jets may loose the SN traces and appear as a short GRB or
a long orphan GRB (depending on jet angular velocity and view angle). XRF are
peripherical viewing of the jets. These precessing and spinning gamma jet are
originated by Inverse Compton and-or Synchrotron Radiation at pulsars or
micro-quasars sources, by ultra-relativistic electrons. These Jets are most
powerful at Supernova birth, blazing, once on axis, to us and flashing GRB
detector. The trembling of the thin jet explains naturally the observed erratic
multi-explosive structure of different GRBs. The jets are precessing (by binary
companion or inner disk asymmetry) and decaying by power on time scales of few
hours, but they keep staying inside the observer cone view only a few seconds
duration times (GRB); the jet is thinner in gamma and wider in X band. This
explain the wider and longer X GRB afterglow duration and the rare presence of
X-ray precursors.
