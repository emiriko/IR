We recently demonstrated a connection between the random phase approximation
(RPA) and coupled cluster theory [J. Chem. Phys. 129, 231101 (2008)]. Based on
this result, we here propose and test a simple scheme for introducing
long-range RPA correlation into density functional theory. Our method provides
good thermochemical results and models van derWaals interactions accurately.
