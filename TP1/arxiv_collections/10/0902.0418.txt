We study effects of the scale invariant hidden sector, unparticle, proposed
by Georgi, on top spin correlation at the Large Hadron Collider. Assuming no
flavor changing interaction between the unparticles and the Standard Model
particles, there arises the top-antitop quark pair production process through
virtual unparticle exchanges in the s-channel in addition to the Standard Model
processes. In particular, we consider contributions of scalar and vector
unparticles and find that these make sizable deviations of the top spin
correlation from the Standard Model one.
