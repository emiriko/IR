We theoretically study the linear propagation of a stepwise pulse through a
dilute dispersive medium when the frequency of the optical carrier coincides
with the center of a natural or electromagnetically induced transparency window
of the medium (slow-light systems). We obtain fully analytical expressions of
the entirety of the step response and show that, for parameters representative
of real experiments, Sommerfeld-Brillouin precursors, main field and second
precursors "postcursors" can be distinctly observed, all with amplitudes
comparable to that of the incident step. This behavior strongly contrasts with
that of the systems generally considered up to now.
