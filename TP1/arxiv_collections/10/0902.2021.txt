By means of computer simulations we study how droplets of hard, rod-like
particles optimize their shape and internal structure under the influence of
the osmotic compression caused by the presence of spherical particles that act
as depletion agents. At sufficiently high osmotic pressures the rods that make
up the drops spontaneously align to turn them into uniaxial nematic liquid
crystalline droplets. The nematic droplets or "tactoids" that are formed this
way are not spherical but elongated, resulting from the competition between the
anisotropic surface tension and the elastic deformation of the director field.
In agreement with recent theoretical predictions we find that sufficiently
small tactoids have a uniform director field, whilst large ones are
characterized by a bipolar director field. From the shape and director-field
transformation of the droplets we are able to estimate the surface anchoring
strength and an average of the elastic constants of the hard-rod nematic.
