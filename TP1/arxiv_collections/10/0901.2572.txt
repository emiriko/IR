We have applied the optimal estimator for f_{NL}^{local} to the 5 year WMAP
data. Marginalizing over the amplitude of foreground templates we get -4 <
f_{NL}^{local} < 80 at 95% CL. Error bars of previous (sub-optimal) analyses
are roughly 40% larger than these. The probability that a Gaussian simulation,
analyzed using our estimator, gives a result larger in magnitude than the one
we find is 7%. Our pipeline gives consistent results when applied to the three
and five year WMAP data releases and agrees well with the results from our own
sub-optimal pipeline. We find no evidence of any residual foreground
contamination.
