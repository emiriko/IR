The scientific goals of the AMIGA project are based on the analysis of a
significant amount of spectroscopic 3D data. In order to perform this work we
present an initiative to develop a new VO compliant package, including present
core applications and tasks offered by the Groningen Image Processing System
(GIPSY), and new ones based on use cases elaborated in collaboration with ad-
vanced users. One of the main goals is to provide local interoperability
between GIPSY (visualization and data analysis) and other VO software. The
connectivity with the Virtual Observatory environment will provide general
access to 3D data VO archives and services, maximizing the potential for
scientific discovery.
