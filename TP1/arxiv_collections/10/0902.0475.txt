Multipole radiofrequency ion traps are a highly versatile tool to study
molecular ions and their interactions in a well-controllable environment. In
particular the cryogenic 22-pole ion trap configuration is used to study
ion-molecule reactions and complex molecular spectroscopy at temperatures
between few Kelvin and room temperatures. This article presents a tutorial on
radiofrequency ion trapping in multipole electrode configurations. Stable
trapping conditions and buffer gas cooling, as well as important heating
mechanisms, are discussed. In addition, selected experimental studies on cation
and anion-molecule reactions and on spectroscopy of trapped ions are reviewed.
Starting from these studies an outlook on the future of multipole ion trap
research is given.
