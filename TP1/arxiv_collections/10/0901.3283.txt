It is common practice to approximate a weakly nonlinear wave equation through
a kinetic transport equation, thus raising the issue of controlling the
validity of the kinetic limit for a suitable choice of the random initial data.
While for the general case a proof of the kinetic limit remains open, we report
on first progress. As wave equation we consider the nonlinear Schrodinger
equation discretized on a hypercubic lattice. Since this is a Hamiltonian
system, a natural choice of random initial data is distributing them according
to the corresponding Gibbs measure with a chemical potential chosen so that the
Gibbs field has exponential mixing. The solution psi_t(x) of the nonlinear
Schrodinger equation yields then a stochastic process stationary in x in Z^d
and t in R. If lambda denotes the strength of the nonlinearity, we prove that
the space-time covariance of psi_t(x) has a limit as lambda -> 0 for
t=lambda^(-2)*tau, with tau fixed and |tau| sufficiently small. The limit
agrees with the prediction from kinetic theory.
