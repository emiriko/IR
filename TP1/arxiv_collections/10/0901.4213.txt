A dynamic decision-making system that includes a mass of indistinguishable
agents could manifest impressive heterogeneity. This kind of nonhomogeneity is
postulated to result from macroscopic behavioral tactics employed by almost all
involved agents. A State-Space Based (SSB) mass event-history model is
developed here to explore the potential existence of such macroscopic
behaviors. By imposing an unobserved internal state-space variable into the
system, each individual's event-history is made into a composition of a common
state duration and an individual specific time to action. With the common state
modeling of the macroscopic behavior, parametric statistical inferences are
derived under the current-status data structure and conditional independence
assumptions. Identifiability and computation related problems are also
addressed. From the dynamic perspectives of system-wise heterogeneity, this SSB
mass event-history model is shown to be very distinct from a random effect
model via the Principle Component Analysis (PCA) in a numerical experiment.
Real data showing the mass invasion by two species of parasitic nematode into
two species of host larvae are also analyzed. The analysis results not only are
found coherent in the context of the biology of the nematode as a parasite, but
also include new quantitative interpretations.
