The Stoner-Wohlfarth astroid is a fundamental object in magnetism. It
separates regions of the magnetic field space with two stable magnetization
equilibria from those with only one stable equilibrium and it characterizes the
magnetization reversal of nano-magnets induced by applied magnetic fields. On
the other hand, it was recently demonstrated that transfer of spin angular
momentum from a spin-polarized current provides an alternative way of switching
the magnetization. Here, we examine the astroid of a nano-magnet with uniaxial
magnetic anisotropy under the combined influence of applied fields and
spin-transfer torques. We find that spin-transfer is most efficient at
modifying the astroid when the external field is applied along the easy-axis of
magnetization. On departing from this situation, a threshold current appears
below which spin-transfer becomes ineffective yielding a current-induced dip in
the astroid along the easy-axis direction. An extension of the Stoner-Wohlfarth
model is outlined which accounts for this phenomenon.
