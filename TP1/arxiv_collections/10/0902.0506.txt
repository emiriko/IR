This paper describes an R package implementing large sample tests and
confidence intervals (based on the central limit theorem) for various
parameters. The one and two sample mean and variance contexts are considered.
The statistics for all the tests are expressed in the same form, which
facilitates their presentation. In the variance parameter cases, the asymptotic
robustness of the classical tests depends on the departure of the data
distribution from normality measured in terms of the kurtosis of the
distribution.
