We present observational results of the [Fe II] 1.644 um emission from the
jets of L1551 IRS 5. The data sets were obtained through 13 fully sampled slits
aimed at the base of the jets. These sets are used to construct a
three-dimensional cube. The field of view was 5."8 X 4."2. We confirmed that
the position of the knot PHK1 coincides with a stationary, point-like x-ray
source within 0."3. The northern and southern jets are distinguished from each
other at a point 0."6 away from their driving sources. We also confirmed that
the northern jet consists of well-separated high- and low-velocity components
(HVC and LVC, respectively). The HVC has a terminal velocity of ~400 km/s and
shows a consistently narrow velocity width of 40 km/s. The LVC covers the
velocity range from V_LSR = 0 to -240 km/s and has broad velocity widths of
~150-180 km/s. These decrease with distance from the driving sources. The
spatial width of the LVC varies from 0."6-0."7 at V_LSR ~ -200 km/s to
0."8-0."9 at V_LSR ~ -30 km/s. These characteristics are well understood in
terms of the two types of outflow mechanisms that are working simultaneously:
one is the HVC, which is launched in a narrow, inner radial region at 0.04-0.05
AU, and the other is the LVC, which is launched in a wider, outer radial region
from within 0.1-4.5 AU of the accretion disk. Part of the LVC emission could
arise in the gas entrained or shocked by the HVC. We also discuss the
possibility that part of the HVC gas is thermalized at PHK1 to produce the
x-ray emission and LVC.
