This is the third of a series of papers devoted to develop a microscopical
approach to the dipole emission process and its relation to coherent transport
in random media. In this paper, we compute the power emitted by an induced
dipole and the spontaneous decay rate of a Lorentzian-type dipole. In both
cases, the emitter is placed at the center of a real cavity drilled in a
continuous medium.
