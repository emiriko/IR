Current research in biology heavily depends on the availability and efficient
use of information. In order to build new knowledge, various sources of
biological data must often be combined. Semantic Web technologies, which
provide a common framework allowing data to be shared and reused between
applications, can be applied to the management of disseminated biological data.
However, due to some specificities of biological data, the application of these
technologies to life science constitutes a real challenge. Through a use case
of biological data integration, we show in this paper that current Semantic Web
technologies start to become mature and can be applied for the development of
large applications. However, in order to get the best from these technologies,
improvements are needed both at the level of tool performance and knowledge
modeling.
