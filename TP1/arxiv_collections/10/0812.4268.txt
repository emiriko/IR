We show that the strong Nernst signal observed recently in amorphous
superconducting films far above the critical temperature is caused by the
fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter. We demonstrate a striking
agreement between our theoretical calculations and the experimental data at
various temperatures and magnetic fields. Besides, the Nernst effect is
interesting not only in the context of superconductivity. We discuss some
subtle issues in the theoretical study of thermal phenomena that we have
encountered while calculating the Nernst coefficient. In particular, we explain
how the Nernst theorem (the third law of thermodynamics) imposes a strict
constraint on the magnitude of the Nernst effect.
