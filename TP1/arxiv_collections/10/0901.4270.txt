The lower branch of the dispersion relation of exciton polaritons in
semiconductor microcavities, operating in the strong-coupling regime, contains
sections of both positive and negative curvature along one spatial direction.
We show that this leads to the existence of stable one-dimensional bright
microcavity solitons supported by the repulsive polariton nonlinearity. To
achieve localization along the second transverse direction we propose to create
a special soliton waveguide by changing the cavity detuning and hence the
boundary of the soliton existence in such a way that the solitons are allowed
only within the stripe of the desired width.
