We present high-resolution spectroscopic mid-infrared observations of the
circumstellar disk around the Herbig Ae star HD97048 obtained with the VLT
Imager and Spectrometer for the mid-InfraRed (VISIR). We conducted observations
of mid-infrared pure rotational lines of molecular hydrogen (H2) as a tracer of
warm gas in the disk surface layers. In a previous paper, we reported the
detection of the S(1) pure rotational line of H2 at 17.035 microns and argued
it is arising from the inner regions of the disk around the star. We used VISIR
on the VLT for a more comprehensive study based on complementary observations
of the other mid-infrared molecular transitions, namely S(2) and S(4) at 12.278
microns and 8.025 microns respectively, to investigate the physical properties
of the molecular gas in the circumstellar disk around HD97048. We do not detect
neither the S(2) line nor the S(4) H2 line from the disk of HD97048, but we
derive upper limits on the integrated line fluxes which allows us to estimate
an upper limit on the gas excitation temperature, T_ex < 570 K. This limit on
the temperature is consistent with the assumptions previously used in the
analysis of the S(1) line, and allows us to set stronger contraints on the mass
of warm gas in the inner regions of the disk. Indeed, we estimate the mass of
warm gas to be lower than 0.1 M_Jup. We also discuss the probable physical
mechanisms which could be responsible of the excitation of H2 in the disk of
HD97048.
