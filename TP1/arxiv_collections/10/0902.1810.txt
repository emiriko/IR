We introduce the notion of a chopped and sliced cone in combinatorial
geometry and prove two structure theorems for the number of integral points in
the individual slices of such a cone. We observe that this notion applies to
weight multiplicities of Kac-Moody algebras and Littlewood-Richardson
coefficients of semisimple Lie algebras, where we obtain the corresponding
results.
