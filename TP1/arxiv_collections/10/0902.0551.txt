Chapter 1 gives a brief history of the field of holography along with an
overview of this thesis. A more detailed description of holography is provided
in Chapter 2 along with a discussion of digital holography. Chapter 3 examines
the design of a one-step monochromatic hologram printer capable producing
white-light viewable transmission holograms created with the aid of an LCOS
display system and printed in a dot-matrix sequence. The lens system employed
includes a microlens array and an afocal relay telescope which are both
quantitatively examined in order to maximise the contrast, diffraction
efficiency and depth of view of the final hologram image. A brief overview of
speckle reduction techniques and their applicability to pulsed digital
holography is presented along with experimental results of the use of a
microlens array to reduce speckle effects. Chapter 4 presents an analysis of
the unwanted side effects of the angular intensity distribution of a hologram
pixel, using a case study for analysis. Chapter 5 examines methods for
increasing both the printing speed and resolution of the hologram printer.
Chapter 6 describes the analysis and design of a temperature-energy feedback
system to correct for pulsed laser instabilities arising from mode beating due
to temperature variations. Chapter 7 provides a conclusion to the work and
discusses possible future developments.
