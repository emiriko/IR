Recently formulated integrable theory of quantum transport [Osipov and
Kanzieper, Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 176804 (2008); arXiv:0806.2784] is extended to
describe sample-to-sample fluctuations of the noise power in chaotic cavities
with broken time-reversal symmetry. Concentrating on the universal transport
regime, we determine dependence of the noise power cumulants on the
temperature, applied bias voltage, and the number of propagating modes in the
leads. Intrinsic connection between statistics of thermal to shot noise
crossover and statistics of Landauer conductance is revealed and briefly
discussed.
