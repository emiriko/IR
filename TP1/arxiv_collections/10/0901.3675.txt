Sorkin has introduced a new, observer independent, interpretation of quantum
mechanics that can give a successful realist account of the 'quantum
microworld' as well as explaining how classicality emerges at the level of
observable events for a range of systems including single time 'Copenhagen
measurements'. This 'co-event interpretation' presents us with a new ontology,
in which a single 'co-event' is real. A new ontology necessitates a review of
the dynamical & predictive mechanism of a theory, and in this paper we begin
the process by exploring means of expressing the dynamical and predictive
content of histories theories in terms of co-events.
