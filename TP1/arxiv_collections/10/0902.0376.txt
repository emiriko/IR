Recent measurements of the positron/electron ratio in the cosmic ray (CR)
flux exhibits an apparent anomaly, whereby this ratio increases between 10 and
100 GeV. We show that inhomogeneity of CR sources on a scale of order a kpc,
can naturally explain this anomaly. If the nearest major CR source is about a
kpc away, then low energy electrons ($\sim 1$ GeV) can easily reach us. At
higher energies ($\gtrsim 10$ GeV), the source electrons cool via synchrotron
and inverse-Compton before reaching Earth. Pairs formed in the local vicinity
through the proton/ISM interactions can reach Earth also at high energies, thus
increasing the positron/electron ratio. A natural origin of source
inhomogeneity is the strong concentration of supernovae in the galactic spiral
arms. Assuming supernova remnants (SNRs) as the sole primary source of CRs, and
taking into account their concentration near the galactic spiral arms, we
consistently recover the observed positron fraction between 1 and 100 GeV.
ATIC's electron excess at $\sim 600$ GeV is explained, in this picture, as the
contribution of a few known nearby SNRs. The apparent coincident similarity
between the cooling time of electrons at 10 GeV (where the positron/electron
ratio upturn), $\sim 10$ Myr, and the CRs protons cosmogenic age at the same
energy is predicted by this model.
