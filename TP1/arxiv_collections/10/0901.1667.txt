We study the rate at which stars spiral into a massive black hole (MBH) due
to the emission of gravitational waves (GWs), as a function of the mass M of
the MBH. In the context of our model, it is shown analytically that the rate
approximately depends on the MBH mass as M^{-1/4}. Numerical simulations
confirm this result, and show that for all MBH masses, the event rate is
highest for stellar black holes, followed by white dwarfs, and lowest for
neutron stars. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to see
hundreds of these extreme mass ratio inspirals per year. Since the event rate
derived here formally diverges as M->0, the model presented here cannot hold
for MBHs of masses that are too low, and we discuss what the limitations of the
model are.
