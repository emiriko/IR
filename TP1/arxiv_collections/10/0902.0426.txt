In the catalytic addition of water to propyne the Au(III) catalyst is not
stable under non-relativistic conditions and dissociates into a Au(I) compound
and Cl2. This implies that one link in the chain of events in the catalytic
cycle is broken and relativity may well be seen as the reason why Au(III)
compounds are effective catalysts.
