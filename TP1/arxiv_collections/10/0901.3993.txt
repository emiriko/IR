Searches for radio pulsars are becoming increasingly difficult because of a
rise in impulsive man-made terrestrial radio-frequency interference. Here we
present a new technique, zero-DM filtering, which can significantly reduce the
effects of such signals in pulsar search data. The technique has already been
applied to a small portion of the data from the Parkes multi-beam pulsar
survey, resulting in the discovery of four new pulsars, so illustrating its
efficacy.
