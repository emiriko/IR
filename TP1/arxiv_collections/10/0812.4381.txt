We analyze the developing of bipartite and multipartite entanglement through
the Mott-Insulator - Superfluid quantum phase transition. Starting from a Mott
insulator state, where a filling factor $\nu = N/M = 1$ per lattice site is
considered, we derive an exact expression for a completely connected graph
configuration of bosons and show how bipartite and multipartite entanglement
signals the phase transition predicted in previous works. Moreover, through the
transition bipartite entanglement shows to be monogamous.
