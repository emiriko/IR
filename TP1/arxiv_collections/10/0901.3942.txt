Formulas are presented for the recursive generation of four-body integrals in
which the integrand consists of arbitrary integer powers (>= -1) of all the
interparticle distances r_ij, multiplied by an exponential containing an
arbitrary linear combination of all the r_ij. These integrals are
generalizations of those encountered using Hylleraas basis functions, and
include all that are needed to make energy computations on the Li atom and
other four-body systems with a fully exponentially correlated Slater-type basis
of arbitrary quantum numbers. The only quantities needed to start the recursion
are the basic four-body integral first evaluated by Fromm and Hill, plus some
easily evaluated three-body "boundary" integrals. The computational labor in
constructing integral sets for practical computations is less than when the
integrals are generated using explicit formulas obtained by differentiating the
basic integral with respect to its parameters. Computations are facilitated by
using a symbolic algebra program (MAPLE) to compute array index pointers and
present syntactically correct FORTRAN source code as output; in this way it is
possible to obtain error-free high-speed evaluations with minimal effort. The
work can be checked by verifying sum rules the integrals must satisfy.
