The electronic Raman scattering in overdoped (Y,Ca)Ba2Cu3Oy was investigated
with changing hole concentration in the superconducting state. It was found
that the superconducting responses such as the pair-breaking peaks in the A1g
and B1g spectra and the anisotropy of the pair-breaking peak in XX and YY
polarizations radically change at around the carrier doping p=0.19. Since both
a- and c-axis resistivities strongly suggest the closing of pseudogap at
p~0.18, the observed change at p=0.19 in superconducting Raman response is
attributed to the electronic crossover due to the collapse of the pseudogap.
