We present a study of the angular dependence of the resistivity tensor up to
35 T in elemental bismuth complemented by torque magnetometry measurements in a
similar configuration. For at least two particular field orientations a few
degrees off the trigonal axis, the Hall resistivity was found to become
field-independent within experimental resolution in a finite field window
corresponding to a field which is roughly three times the frequency of quantum
oscillations. The Hall plateaus rapidly vanish as the field is tilted off
theses magic angles. We identify two distinct particularities of these specific
orientations, which may play a role in the emergence of the Hall plateaus.
