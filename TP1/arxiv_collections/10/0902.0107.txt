We study Anderson localization of ultracold atoms in weak, one-dimensional
speckle potentials, using perturbation theory beyond Born approximation. We
show the existence of a series of sharp crossovers (effective mobility edges)
between energy regions where localization lengths differ by orders of
magnitude. We also point out that the correction to the Born term explicitly
depends on the sign of the potential. Our results are in agreement with
numerical calculations in a regime relevant for experiments. Finally, we
analyze our findings in the light of a diagrammatic approach.
