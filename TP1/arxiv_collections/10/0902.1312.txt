We prove that for any finite group G, the sum across non-identity elements of
the squared absolute value of any generalized character of G which does not
vanish on all non-identity elements of G is at least |G|/d -1, where d is the
maximal degree of a complex irreducible character of G, and we identify all
cases where this minimum possible value is attained.
