We propose a model of dark matter identified with a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone
boson in the dynamical supersymmetry breaking sector in a gauge mediation
scenario. The dark matter particles annihilate via a below-threshold narrow
resonance into a pair of R-axions each of which subsequently decays into a pair
of light leptons. The Breit-Wigner enhancement explains the excess electron and
positron fluxes reported in the recent cosmic ray experiments PAMELA, ATIC and
PPB-BETS without postulating an overdensity in halo, and the limit on
anti-proton flux from PAMELA is naturally evaded.
