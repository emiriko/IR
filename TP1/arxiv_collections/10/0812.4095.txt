We have developed a simple method to solve anharmonic oscillators equations.
The idea of our method is mainly based on the partitioning of the potential
curve into (n+1) small intervals, solving the Schr\"odinger equation in each
subintervals, and writing the continuity conditions of each solutions at each
subintervals boundary, which leads to the energy quantification condition, so
to the energy levels, and finally, one can calculate the exact wave function
associated to each energy level. Our method has been applied to three examples:
the well-known square well, the bounded and unbounded harmonic oscillators, the
Morse potential, and some anharmonic oscillators bounded by two infinite walls.
Our method is more realistic, simpler, with high degree of accuracy, both
satisfactory and not computationally complicated, and applicable for any forms
of potential. Our results agree very well with the preceding ones.
