The exactly solvable Keldysh model of disordered electron system in a random
scattering field with extremely long correlation length is converted to the
time-dependent model with extremely long relaxation. The dynamical problem is
solved for the ensemble of two-level systems (TLS) with fluctuating well depths
having the discrete Z_2 symmetry. It is shown also that the symmetric TLS with
fluctuating barrier transparency may be described in terms of the planar
Keldysh model with dime-dependent random planar rotations in xy plane having
continuous SO(2) symmetry. The case of simultaneous fluctuations of the well
depth and barrier transparency is subject to non-abelian algebra. Application
of this model to description of dynamic fluctuations in quantum dots and
optical lattices is discussed.
