The resistivity as a function of temperature, magnetic field and its
orientation for atomically flat SrTiO3\LaAlO3 interfaces with carrier densities
of ~3*10^13 cm^-2 is reported. At low magnetic fields superconductivity is
observed below 130mK. The temperature dependence of the high field
magnetoresistance and its strong anisotropy suggest possible magnetic ordering
below 35K. The origin of this ordering and its possible relation to
superconductivity are discussed.
