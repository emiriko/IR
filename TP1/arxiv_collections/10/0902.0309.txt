We calculate the equal-time transverse gluon propagator in Coulomb gauge QCD
using a SU(3) quenched lattice gauge simulation on large lattices, up to 11
[fm$^4$]. We find that the equal-time gluon propagator shows scaling violation;
namely, the data for different lattice spacings do not fall on top of one
curve. This problem is cured by discarding data at large momenta, which suffer
from discretization errors. In the infrared region, the transverse gluon
propagator is strongly suppressed and shows a turnover at about 500 [MeV].
Fitting the power law ansatz to the data at small momenta predicts the
vanishing gluon propagator at zero momentum, indicating the confinement of
gluons.
