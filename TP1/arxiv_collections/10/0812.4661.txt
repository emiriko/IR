COSY-ANKE data on the cross section of the reactions $pp\to \{pp\}_s\pi^0$
and $pp\to \{pp\}_s\gamma$, where $\{pp\}_s$ is the proton pair in the $^1S_0$
state at small excitation energy $E_{pp}<3$ MeV, are analyzed at beam energies
$0.5 - 2.0$ GeV within the one-pion exchange model. The model includes the
subprocesses $\pi^0 p\to \pi^0 p$ and $\pi^0 p\to \gamma p$ for the pion- and
photo-production, respectively, and accounts for the final state
pp-interaction. A broad maximum in the energy dependence of the $\pi^0$
production at $\sim 0.5 -0.6$ GeV and fast increase of the $\gamma$-production
cross section at $0.3 - 0.55$ GeV observed in the data are explained by the
$\Delta$-isobar contribution. An analogy with the dynamics of the deuteron
breakup reaction $pd\to \{pp\}_sn$ in the $\Delta$-region is outlined.
