In this work we give an explicit isomorphism between the usual spin network
basis and the direct quantization of the reduced phase space of tetrahedra. The
main outcome is a formula that describes the space of SU(2) invariant states by
an integral over coherent states satisfying the closure constraint exactly, or
equivalently, as an integral over the space of classical tetrahedra. This
provides an explicit realization of theorems by Guillemin--Sternberg and Hall
that describe the commutation of quantization and reduction. In the final part
of the paper, we use our result to express the FK spin foam model as an
integral over classical tetrahedra and the asymptotics of the vertex amplitude
is determined.
