For an initially well designed but imperfect quantum information system, the
process matrix is almost sparse in an appropriate basis. Existing theory and
associated computational methods (L1-norm minimization) for reconstructing
sparse signals establish conditions under which the sparse signal can be
perfectly reconstructed from a very limited number of measurements (resources).
Although a direct extension to quantum process tomography of the L1-norm
minimization theory has not yet emerged, the numerical examples presented here,
which apply L1-norm minimization to quantum process tomography, show a
significant reduction in resources to achieve a desired estimation accuracy
over existing methods.
