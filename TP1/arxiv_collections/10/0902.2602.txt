We have obtained H-band interferometric observations of three galactic red
supergiant stars using the MIRC instrument on the CHARA array. The targets
include AZ Cyg, a field RSG and two members of the Per OB1 association, RS Per
and T Per. We find evidence of departures from circular symmetry in all cases,
which can be modelled with the presence of hotspots. This is the first
detection of these features in the $H$-band. The measured mean diameters and
the spectral energy distributions were combined to determine effective
temperatures. The results give further support to the recently derived hotter
temperature scale of red supergiant stars by Levesque et al. (2005), which has
been evoked to reconcile the empirically determined physical parameters and
stellar evolutionary theories. We see a possible correlation between
spottedness and mid-IR emission of the circumstellar dust, suggesting a
connection between mass-loss and the mechanism that generates the spots.
