Transformation of the spin and orbital angular momentum of Hermite-Gaussian
beams of a complex and real argument propagating through a uniaxial crystal is
considered. We revealed that the spin and orbital angular momentum of the
complex argument HG beam experience a sharp splashes whereas such an intense
conversion process is not inherent in a real argument HG beams. The reasons and
conditions of the resonance effect are brought to light.
