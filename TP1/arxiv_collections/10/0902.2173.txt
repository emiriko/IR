We consider random walks on random graphs, focusing on return probabilities
and hitting times for sparse Erdos-Renyi graphs. Using the tree approach which
is expected to be exact in the large graph limit, we show how to solve for the
distribution of these quantities and we find that these distributions exhibit a
form of self-similarity.
