The absorption of gamma-rays in the intergalactic medium due to the EBL
(Extragalactic Background Light) causes the observed blazar spectrum to be
fainter and softer than their intrinsic state. It could thus be expected to see
an effective spectral-softening trend with redshift. No such trend is evident
in the sample of VHE blazars currently observed.
  To check which distributions of the properties of the parent blazar
population could reproduce the observations, various simulations are done. The
resulting subsamples that satisfy a generic detection criterion for the current
generation of ACTs (Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope) are checked to identify
whether any inherent correlations (of spectral properties with redshift) are
required to explain the current observations.
