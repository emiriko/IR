Excitation transfer through interacting systems plays an important role in
many areas of physics, chemistry, and biology. The uncontrollable interaction
of the transmission network with a noisy environment is usually assumed to
deteriorate its transport capacity, especially so when the system is
fundamentally quantum mechanical. Here we identify key mechanisms through which
noise such as dephasing, perhaps counter intuitively, may actually aid
transport through a dissipative network by opening up additional pathways for
excitation transfer. We show that these are processes that lead to the
inhibition of destructive interference and exploitation of line broadening
effects. We illustrate how these mechanisms operate on a fully connected
network by developing a powerful analytical technique that identifies the
invariant (excitation trapping) subspaces of a given Hamiltonian. Finally, we
show how these principles can explain the remarkable efficiency and robustness
of excitation energy transfer from the light-harvesting chlorosomes to the
bacterial reaction center in photosynthetic complexes and present a numerical
analysis of excitation transport across the Fenna-Matthew-Olson (FMO) complex
together with a brief analysis of its entanglement properties. Our results show
that, in general, it is the careful interplay of quantum mechanical features
and the unavoidable environmental noise that will lead to an optimal system
performance.
