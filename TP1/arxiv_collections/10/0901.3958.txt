To illuminate how electroweak symmetry breaking shapes the physical world, we
investigate toy models in which no Higgs fields or other constructs are
introduced to induce spontaneous symmetry breaking. Two models incorporate the
standard SU(3)_c x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y gauge symmetry and fermion content similar
to that of the standard model. The first class--like the standard electroweak
theory--contains no bare mass terms, so the spontaneous breaking of chiral
symmetry within quantum chromodynamics is the only source of electroweak
symmetry breaking. The second class adds bare fermion masses sufficiently small
that QCD remains the dominant source of electroweak symmetry breaking and the
model can serve as a well-behaved low-energy effective field theory to energies
somewhat above the hadronic scale. A third class of models is based on the
left-right--symmetric SU(3)_c x SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x U(1)_{B-L} gauge group. In
a fourth class of models, built on SU(4)_{PS} x SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R gauge
symmetry, lepton number is treated as a fourth color. Many interesting
characteristics of the models stem from the fact that the effective strength of
the weak interactions is much closer to that of the residual strong
interactions than in the real world. The Higgs-free models not only provide
informative contrasts to the real world, but also lead us to consider
intriguing issues in the application of field theory to the real world.
