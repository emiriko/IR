We have for the first time calculated low-energy electronic structure both in
paramagnetic and magnetic state as well as zero-temperature properties and
thermodynamics. We consistently described magnetic properties of CoO in
agreement with its insulating ground state. The orbital moment of 1.42 mu_B
gives 35 contribution to the total moment of 4.04 mu_B at T =0 K. We have
calculated from this low-energy electronic structure the temperature dependence
of the specific heat being in nice agreement with experimental data. In our
approach CoO is an insulator independently on distortions and the magnetic
order.
