The status of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff and pair-production
dip in Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) is discussed.They are the features
in the spectrum of protons propagating through CMB radiation in extragalactic
space, and discovery of these features implies that primary particles are
mostly extragalactic protons. The spectra measured by AGASA, Yakutsk, HiRes and
Auger detectors are in good agreement with the pair-production dip, and HiRes
data have strong evidences for the GZK cutoff. The Auger spectrum,as presented
at the 30th ICRC 2007, agrees with the GZK cutoff, too. The AGASA data agree
well with the beginning of the GZK cutoff at E \leq 80 EeV, but show the excess
of events at higher energies, the origin of which is not understood. The
difference in the absolute fluxes measured by different detectors disappears
after energy shift within the systematic errors of each experiment.
