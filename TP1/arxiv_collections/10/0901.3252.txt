In this paper we study cosmological application of holographic dark energy
density in the modified gravity framework. We employ the holographic model of
dark energy to obtain the equation of state for the holographic energy density
in spatially flat universe. Our calculation show, taking
$\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.73$ for the present time, it is possible to have $w_{\rm
\Lambda}$ crossing -1. This implies that one can generate phantom-like equation
of state from a holographic dark energy model in flat universe in the modified
gravity cosmology framework. Also we develop a reconstruction scheme for the
modified gravity with $f(R)$ action.
