Data on the magneto-thermopower and specific heat of three compounds
belonging to '1111' oxypnictides family are reported. One specimen
(SmAsFeO0.8F0.2) is a superconductor with Tc = 53 K, while two others (SmAsFeO
and NdAsFeO) are nonsuperconducting parent compounds. Our results confirm that
spin density wave (SDW) order is present in SmAsFeO and NdAsFeO. In these two
samples a strict connection between the thermoelectric power and electronic
specific heat is found in the vicinity of SDW transition, what indicates that
the chemical potential of charge carriers strongly depends on temperature in
this region. Low temperature data suggest presence of significant contribution
magnon-drag to the thermoelectric power.
