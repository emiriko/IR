In this report, we present our recent studies on the
Lambda(1405,1/2-)=Lambda* photoproduction via the gamma p -> K+ pi Sigma
scattering process, employing a coupled-channel formalism, i.e., the chiral
unitary model, which respects chiral dynamics in terms of the Weinberg-Tomozawa
meson baryon interaction. In addition to the dynamically generated s-wave
resonance, Lambda*, we include the p-wave resonance contribution from
Sigma(1385,3/2+). We observe that the p-wave contribution provides considerable
effects on the pi-Sigma invariant-mass spectrum. It also turns out that, within
the present level of calculations, we can reproduce hardly the recent Lambda*
photoproduction experiment by LEPS collaboration at SPring-8.
