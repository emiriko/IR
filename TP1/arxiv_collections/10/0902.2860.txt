It is shown that cosmological equations for homogeneous isotropic models
deduced in the framework of the Poincar\'e gauge theory of gravity by certain
restrictions on indefinite parameters of gravitational Lagrangian take at
asymptotics the same form as cosmological equations of general relativity
theory for $\Lambda CDM$-model. Terms related to dark matter and dark energy in
cosmological equations of standard theory for $\Lambda CDM$-model are connected
in considered theory with the change of gravitational interaction provoked by
spacetime torsion.
