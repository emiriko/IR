We extend the notion of Fermi coordinates to a generalized definition in
which the highest orders are described by arbitrary functions. From this
definition rises a formalism that naturally gives coordinate transformation
formulae. Some examples are developped in which the extended Fermi coordinates
simplify the metric components.
