We study electron transport properties of some molecular wires and a
unconventional disordered thin film within the tight-binding framework using
Green's function technique. We show that electron transport is significantly
affected by quantum interference of electronic wave functions,
molecule-to-electrode coupling strengths, length of the molecular wire and
disorder strength. Our model calculations provide a physical insight to the
behavior of electron conduction across a bridge system.
