We present a nonlinear partial difference equation defined on a square which
is obtained by combining the Miura transformations between the Volterra and the
modified Volterra differential-difference equations. This equation is not
symmetric with respect to the exchange of the two discrete variables and does
not satisfy the 3D-consistency condition necessary to belong to the
Adler-Bobenko-Suris classification. Its integrability is proved by constructing
its Lax pair.
