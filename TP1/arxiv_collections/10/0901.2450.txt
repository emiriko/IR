The interplay between two-dimensional percolation growth models and
one-dimensional particle processes has been a fruitful source of interesting
mathematical phenomena. In this paper we develop a connection between the
construction of Busemann functions in the Hammersley last-passage percolation
model with i.i.d. random weights, and the existence, ergodicity and uniqueness
of equilibrium (or time-invariant) measures for the related (multi-class)
interacting fluid system. As we shall see, in the classical Hammersley model,
where each point has weight one, this approach brings a new and rather
geometrical solution of the longest increasing subsequence problem, as well as
a central limit theorem for the Busemann function.
