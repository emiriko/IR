We present a study of the proximity effect and the inverse proximity effect
in a superconductor$\mid$ferromagnet bilayer, taking into account several
important factors which mostly have been ignored in the literature so far.
These include spin-dependent interfacial phase shifts (spin-DIPS) and
inhomogeneous textures of the magnetization in the ferromagnetic layer, both of
which are expected to be present in real experimental samples. Our approach is
numerical, allowing us to access the full proximity effect regime. In Part I of
this work, we study the superconducting proximity effect and the resulting
local density of states in an inhomogeneous ferromagnet with a non-trivial
magnetic texture.
  Our two main results in Part I are a study of how Bloch and N\'eel domain
walls affect the proximity-induced superconducting correlations and a study of
the superconducting proximity effect in a conical ferromagnet. The latter topic
should be relevant for the ferromagnet Ho, which was recently used in an
experiment to demonstrate the possibility to generate and sustain long-range
triplet superconducting correlations. In Part II of this work, we investigate
the inverse proximity effect with emphasis on the induced magnetization in the
superconducting region as a result of the "leakage" from the ferromagnetic
region. It is shown that the presence of spin-DIPS modify conclusions obtained
previously in the literature with regard to the induced magnetization in the
superconducting region. In particular, we find that the spin-DIPS can trigger
an anti-screening effect of the magnetization, leading to an induced
magnetization in the superconducting region with \textit{the same sign} as in
the proximity ferromagnet.
