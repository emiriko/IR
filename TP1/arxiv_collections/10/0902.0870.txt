We consider the statistical irreversibility and its compatibility with the
reversible dynamics. The role played by the observation is analyzed in detail.
It makes our previous proof for the second law of thermodynamics clearer. On
this basis, we emphasize the importance and wide applicability for the second
law of thermodynamics. A new form of physics with this law being substituted by
the principle of information conservation is suggested. By the way, we also
solve the paradox of Schr\"odinger cat, and show that the universe will not go
to the so-called heat death spontaneously.
