We study the contributions to CP violation in right-handed sneutrino decays
induced by soft supersymmetry-breaking gaugino masses including flavour effects
and paying special attention to the role of thermal corrections. Using a
field-theoretical as well as a quantum mechanical approach we compute the CP
asymmetries and we conclude that for all the soft-supersymmetry breaking
sources of CP violation considered, an exact cancellation between the
asymmetries produced in the fermionic and bosonic channels occurs at T=0 up to
second order in soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters. Once thermal effects
are included the new sources of CP violation induced by supersymmetry-breaking
gaugino masses can be sizeable and they can produce the observed baryon
asymmetry for conventional values of the B parameter.
