This paper critically reviews the entropy model proposed by Adam and Gibbs in
1965 for explaining the dramatic temperature dependence of glass-forming
liquids' average relaxation time, one of the most influential models during the
last three decades. We discuss the Adam-Gibbs model's theoretical bases as well
as the reported experimental model confirmations; in the process of doing this
a number of problems with the model are identified.
