We elaborate the problem of energy-momentum in general relativity by
energy-momentum prescriptions theory. In this regard, we calculate
M\oller,Landau-Lifshitz, Papapetrou, Einstein, Bergman, Tolman, and Weinberg's
energy-momentum complexes in static and nonstatic cosmic string space-times. We
obtain strong coincidences between the results. These coincidences can be
considered as an extension of Virbhadra's viewpoint that different
energy-momentum prescriptions may provide some basis to define a unique
quantity. In addition, our results disagree with Lessner's belief about
M\oller's prescription and support the Virbhadra's conclusion about the power
of Einstein's prescription.
