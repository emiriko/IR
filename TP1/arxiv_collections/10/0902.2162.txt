Information sources used for communication purposes usually are assumed to be
i.i.d. type, especially as far as entanglement or nonlocality properties are
concerned. Here we proposed simple scheme for detection of nonlocality of non
i.i.d. sources based on the program idea which can be useful in communication
tasks including quantum cryptography and communication complexity reduction.
The principle of the scheme is rather general and can be applied to other
problems like detection of entanglement coming from non-i.i.d sources.
