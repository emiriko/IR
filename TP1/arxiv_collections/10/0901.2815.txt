We report the realization of a new polarization entangled photon-pair source
based on a titanium-indiffused waveguide integrated on periodically poled
lithium niobate pumped by a CW laser at $655 nm$. The paired photons are
emitted at the telecom wavelength of $1310 nm$ within a bandwidth of $0.7 nm$.
The quantum properties of the pairs are measured using a two-photon coalescence
experiment showing a visibility of 85%. The evaluated source brightness, on the
order of $10^5$ pairs $s^{-1} GHz^{-1} mW^{-1}$, associated with its
compactness and reliability, demonstrates the source's high potential for
long-distance quantum communication.
