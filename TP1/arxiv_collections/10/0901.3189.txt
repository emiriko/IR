It is well known that the discrete Sierpinski triangle can be defined as the
nonzero residues modulo 2 of Pascal's triangle, and that from this definition
one can easily construct a tileset with which the discrete Sierpinski triangle
self-assembles in Winfree's tile assembly model. In this paper we introduce an
infinite class of discrete self-similar fractals that are defined by the
residues modulo a prime p of the entries in a two-dimensional matrix obtained
from a simple recursive equation. We prove that every fractal in this class
self-assembles using a uniformly constructed tileset. As a special case we show
that the discrete Sierpinski carpet self-assembles using a set of 30 tiles.
