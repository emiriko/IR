In the paper [arXiv:0809.1554], the scalar particles' Hawking radiation from
the apparent horizon of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker(FRW) universe was
investigated by using the tunneling formalism. They obtained the Hawking
temperature associated with the apparent horizon, which was extensively applied
in investigating the relationship between the first law of thermodynamics and
Friedmann equations. In this paper, we calculate Fermions' Hawking radiation
from the apparent horizon of FRW universe via tunneling formalism. Applying WKB
approximation to the general covariant Dirac equation in FRW spacetime
background, the radiation spectrum and Hawking temperature of apparent horizon
are correctly recovered, which supports the arguments presented in the paper
[arXiv:0809.1554].
