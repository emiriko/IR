This article is the continued version of the analytical solutions for the
pressureless Navier-Stokes equations with density-dependent viscosity in "M.W.
Yuen, Analyitcal Solutions to the Navier-Stokes Equations, J. Math. Phys., 49
(2008) No. 11, 113102, 10pp". We are able to extend the similar solutions
structure to the case with pressure under some restriction for $\gamma$ and
$\theta$.
