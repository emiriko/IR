A universality ansatz for the contact values of a multicomponent mixture of
additive hard spheres is used to propose new formulae for the case of
disparate-size binary mixtures. A comparison with simulation data and with a
recent proposal by Alawneh and Henderson for binary mixtures shows reasonably
good agreement with the predictions for the contact values of the large-large
radial distribution functions. A discussion on the usefulness and limitations
of the new proposals is also presented.
