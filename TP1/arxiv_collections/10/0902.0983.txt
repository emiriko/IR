We compare the spectral properties of 79 short and 79 long Gamma-Ray Bursts
(GRBs) detected by BATSE and selected with the same limiting peak flux. Short
GRBs have a low-energy spectral component harder and a peak energy slightly
higher than long GRBs, but no difference is found when comparing short GRB
spectra with those of the first 1-2 sec emission of long GRBs. These results
confirm earlier findings for brighter GRBs. The bolometric peak flux of short
GRBs correlates with their peak energy in a similar way to long bursts. Short
and long GRBs populate different regions of the bolometric fluence-peak energy
plane, short bursts being less energetic by a factor similar to the ratio of
their durations. If short and long GRBs had similar redshift distributions,
they would have similar luminosities yet different energies, which correlate
with the peak energy E_peak for the population of long GRBs. We also test
whether short GRBs are consistent with the E_peak-E_iso and E_peak-L_iso
correlations for the available sample of short (6 events) and long (92 events)
GRBs with measured redshifts and E_peak,obs: while short GRBs are inconsistent
with the E_peak-E_iso correlation of long GRBs, they could follow the
E_peak-L_iso correlation of long bursts. All the above indications point to
short GRBs being similar to the first phases of long bursts. This suggests that
a similar central engine (except for its duration) operates in GRBs of
different durations.
