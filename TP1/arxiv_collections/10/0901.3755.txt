The use of the isoconfigurational ensemble to explore structure-dynamic
correlations in supercooled liquids is examined. The statistical error of the
dynamic propensity and its spatial distribution are determined. The authors
present the spatial distribution of the particle non-Gaussian parameter as a
measure of the intermittency with which particles exhibit their propensity for
motion. The ensemble average of the direction of particle motion is introduced
to establish the anisotropy of the dynamic propensity.
