We report on antiferroelectriclike double polarization hysteresis loops in
multiferroic HoMnO3 thin films below the ferroelectric Curie temperature. This
intriguing phenomenon is attributed to the domain pinning by defect dipoles
which were introduced unintentionally during film growth process. Electron
paramagnetic resonance suggests the existence of Fe1+ defects in thin films and
first principles calculations reveal that the defect dipoles would be composed
of oxygen vacancy and Fe1+ defect. We discuss migration of charged point
defects during film growth process and formation of defect dipoles along
ferroelectric polarization direction, based on the site preference of point
defects. Due to a high-temperature low-symmetry structure of HoMnO3, aging is
not required to form the defect dipoles in contrast to other ferroelectrics
(e.g., BaTiO3).
