We study theoretically the contribution of fluctuating Cooper pairs to the
persistent current in superconducting rings threaded by a magnetic flux. For
sufficiently small rings, in which the coherence length $\xi$ exceeds the
radius $R$, mean field theory predicts a full reduction of the transition
temperature to zero near half-integer flux. We find that nevertheless a very
large current is expected to persist in the ring as a consequence of Cooper
pair fluctuations that do not condense. For larger rings with $R\gg \xi$ we
calculate analytically the susceptibility in the critical region of strong
fluctuations and show that it reflects competition of two interacting complex
order parameters.
