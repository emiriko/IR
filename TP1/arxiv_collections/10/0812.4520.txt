We have successfully synthesized Ce based oxypnictide with fluorine doping
(CeO_{1-x}F_xFeAs) by a two step solid state reaction method. Detailed XRD and
EDX confirm the crystal structure and chemical compositions. We observe that an
extremely high Hc2(0) of 94 T can be achieved in the x = 0.1 composition. This
increase in Hc2(0) is accompanied by a decrease in transition temperature (38.4
K in x = 0.1 composition) from 42.5 K for the x = 0.2 phase. The in-plane
Ginzburg-Landau coherence length is estimated to be ~ 27 A at x = 0.2
suggesting a moderate anisotropy in this class of superconductors. The Seebeck
coefficient confirms the majority carrier to be electrons and strong dominance
of electron-electron correlations in this multiband superconductor.
