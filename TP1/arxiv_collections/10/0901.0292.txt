We describe the tensor products of two irreducible linear complex
representations of the finite general linear group G = GL(3,q) in terms of
induced representations by linear characters of maximal torii and also in terms
of Gelfand-Graev representations. Our results include MacDonald's conjectures
for G and at the same time they are extensions to G of finite counterparts to
classical results on tensor products of holomorphic and anti-holomorphic
representations of the group SL(2, R). Moreover they provide an easy way to
decompose these tensor products, with the help of Frobenius reciprocity. We
also state some conjectures for the general case of GL(n,q).
