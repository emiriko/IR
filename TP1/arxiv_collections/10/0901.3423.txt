The times required for reaching the power-law-in-time growth of the droplet
radius after nucleation of a markedly supercritical binary droplet, are found
analytically and estimated at diffusion-controlled or free-molecular regimes of
isothermal binary vapor condensation. The process of setting steady
concentration in the binary solution within the growing droplet at the same
regimes of binary condensation has been analyzed. It has been shown that
setting the steady droplet concentration has also a power-law character in
time. The parameters of the power law are specified for each regime of binary
condensation and are linked to thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of
condensing vapors and to the steady concentration established in a binary
droplet.
