Input from QCD and string theory is used in order to elucidate basic features
of the string theory dual of QCD, It is argued that the relevant string theory
is a five-dimensional version of the type-0 superstring. The vacuum solution is
asymptotically AdS$_5$, and the geometry near the boundary is stringy. The
structure of YM perturbation theory however emerges near the boundary. In the
IR, the theory is argued to be well-approximated by a two-derivative truncation
that takes into account strong coupling effects. This explains the success of
previously proposed five-dimensional Eistein-dilaton gravity with an
appropriate potential to describe salient features of the strong YM dynamics.
