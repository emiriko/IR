We observe multiple stable states of nuclear polarization in a double quantum
dot under conditions of electron spin resonance. The stable states can be
understood within an elaborated theoretical rate equation model for the
polarization in each of the dots, in the limit of strong driving. This model
also captures unusual features of the data, such as fast switching and a
`wrong' sign of polarization. The results reported enable applications of this
polarization effect, including manipulation and control of nuclear fields.
