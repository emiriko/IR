These notes are the write-up of my 2008 PCMI lectures on multiplier ideals.
They aim to give an introduction to the algebro-geometric side of the theory,
with an emphasis on its global aspects. The focus is on concrete examples and
applications. The lectures take into account a number of recent perspectives,
including adjoint ideals and the resulting simplifications in Siu's theorem on
plurigenera in the general type case. While the notes refer to my book [PAG]
and other sources for some technical points, the conscientious reader should
arrive at a reasonable grasp of the machinery after working through these
lectures.
