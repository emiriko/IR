In this letter, we study bosonic atoms at large scattering lengths using a
variational method where the condensation amplitude is a variational parameter.
We further examine momentum distribution functions, chemical potentials and
speed of sound, and spatial density profiles of cold bosonic atoms in a trap in
this limit. The later two properties turn out to bear similarities of those of
Fermi gases. Estimates obtained here are applicable near Feshbach resonances,
particularly when the fraction of atoms forming three-body structures is small
and can be tested in future cold atom experiments.
