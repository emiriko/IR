We investigated vortex dynamics in a single-crystal sample of type-II
superconductor NbSe$_{2}$ using scanning tunneling microscopy at 4.2 K. The
decay of the magnetic field at a few nT/s in our superconducting magnet induced
the corresponding motion of vortices at a few pm/s. Starting with an initial
magnetic field of 0.5 T, we continued to observe motion of vortices within a
field of view of 400$\times$400 nm$^2$ subject to decay of the magnetic field
over a week. Vortices moved collectively, and maintained triangular lattices
due to strong vortex-vortex interactions during the motion. However, we
observed two peculiar characteristics of vortex dynamics in this
superconductor. First, the speed and direction of the vortex lattice motion
were not uniform in time. Second, despite the non-uniform motion, we also found
that there exists an energetically favored configuration of the moving vortices
in the single-crystal sample of NbSe$_{2}$ based on the overlaid trajectories
and their suppressed speeds. We model the system with weak bulk pinning, strong
bulk pinning, and edge barrier effects.
