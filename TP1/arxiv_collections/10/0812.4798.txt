Let $\Gamma$ be directed strongly connected finite graph of uniform outdegree
(constant outdegree of any vertex) and let some coloring of edges of $\Gamma$
turn the graph into deterministic complete automaton. Let the word $s$ be a
word in the alphabet of colors (considered also as letters) on the edges of
$\Gamma$ and let $\Gamma s$ be a mapping of vertices $\Gamma$.
