There has been tremendous research activity in the field of magneto-electric
(ME) multiferroics after Kimura et al. [1] showed that antiferromagnetic and
ferroelectric order coexist in orthorhom- bically distorted perovskite TbMnO3
and are strongly coupled. It is now generally accepted that ferroelectricity in
TbMnO3 is induced by magnetic long range order that breaks the symmetry of the
crystal and creates a polar axis [2]. One remaining key question is whether
magnetic order can induce ferroelectric polarization that is as large as that
of technologically useful materials. We show that ferroelectricity in
orthorhombic (o) TmMnO3 is induced by collinear magnetic order, and that the
lower limit for its electric polarization is larger than in previously
investigated orthorhombic heavy rare-earth manganites. The temperature
dependence of the lattice constants provides fur- ther evidence of large
spin-lattice coupling effects. Our experiments suggest that the ferroelectric
polarization in the orthorhombic perovskites with commensurate magnetic ground
states could pass the 1 microC/cm2 threshold, as suggested by theory [3, 4].
