We present Chandra observations of the hybrid morphology radio sources 3C 433
and 4C 65.15, two members of the rare class of objects possessing an FR I jet
on one side of the core and an FR II lobe on the other. The X-ray spectrum of
3C 433 shows intrinsic absorption (with a column density of N_H=8e22 cm-2),
such as is typical of FR II narrow-line radio galaxies. There is excess X-ray
emission below 2 keV containing contributions from diffuse soft X-ray emission
(likely hot gas with kT~1.2 keV) as well as from the nucleus. The core of 3C
433 is extended in hard X-rays, presumably due to X-ray emission from the
inner-jet knot on the FR I side that is apparent in the radio map. It is
possible that the X-ray emission from this inner-jet knot is absorbed by the
dust known to be present in the host galaxy. The spectrum of 4C 65.15 can be
modeled with a simple power law with perhaps mild intrinsic absorption
(N_H=1.3e21 cm-2). X-ray emission is detected at the bend in the FR I jet. This
X-ray jet emission lies above the extrapolation from the high-frequency radio
synchrotron emission and has a spectral slope flatter than alpha_rx, indicating
that the jet spectral energy distribution is concave as with other FR II quasar
jets. Both 3C 433 and 4C 65.15 have unabsorbed X-ray luminosities, radio
luminosities, and optical spectra typically seen in comparable sources with FR
II morphologies. Presumably the FR I structure seen on one side in these hybrid
sources is generated by a powerful jet interacting with a relatively dense
environment.
