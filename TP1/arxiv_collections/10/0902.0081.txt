We study, using the language of log schemes, the problem of extending
biextensions of smooth commutative group schemes by the multiplicative group.
This was first considered by Grothendieck in SGA 7. We show that this problem
admits a solution in the category of sheaves for Kato's log flat topology, in
contradistinction to what can be observed using the fppf topology, for which
monodromic obstructions were defined by Grothendieck. In particular, in the
case of an abelian variety and its dual, it is possible to extend the Weil
biextension to the whole N\'eron model. This allows us to define a pairing on
the points which combines the class group pairing defined by Mazur and Tate and
Grothendieck's monodromy pairing.
