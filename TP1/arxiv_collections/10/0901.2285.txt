The present status of the longitudinal polarized parton densities (PDFs) and
the contribution of their first moments to the nucleon spin is discussed.
Special attention is paid to the role of higher twist effects in determining
the PDFs and to the polarized strange quark and gluon densities, which are
still not well determined from the present data.
