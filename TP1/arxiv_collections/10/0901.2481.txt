We performed astrometric observations with the VLBA of WB89-437, an H2O maser
source in the Outer spiral arm of the Galaxy. We measure an annual parallax of
0.167 +/- 0.006 mas, corresponding to a heliocentric distance of 6.0 +/- 0.2
kpc or a Galactocentric distance of 13.4 +/- 0.2 kpc. This value for the
heliocentric distance is considerably smaller than the kinematic distance of
8.6 kpc. This confirms the presence of a faint Outer arm toward l = 135
degrees. We also measured the full space motion of the object and find a large
peculiar motion of ~20 km/s toward the Galactic center. This peculiar motion
explains the large error in the kinematic distance estimate. We also find that
WB89-437 has the same rotation speed as the LSR, providing more evidence for a
flat rotation curve and thus the presence of dark matter in the outer Galaxy.
