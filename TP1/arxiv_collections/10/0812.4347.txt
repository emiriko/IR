We show that at certain values of QCD condensates the nucleon QCD sum rules
with "pole+continuum" model for the hadron spectrum obtain an unphysical
solution. This provides constrains for the values of condensates to be
consistent with existence of a physical solutions. The constrains become much
weaker if the radiative corrections are included perturbatively. We demonstrate
that the most important dependence of nucleon mass on the quark scalar
condensate becomes much weaker under factorization assumption for the
four-quark and six-quark condensates.
