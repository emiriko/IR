We discuss the notion of reduction of a special type of explicit solutions
which generalize the solutions appearing in the classical Laplace cascade
method of integration of hyperbolic equations of the second order in the plane.
We give algorithms of reduction and prove that different natural precise
definitions of reduction are equivalent.
  Keywords: cascade integration method, integrable systems, Euler integrals.
