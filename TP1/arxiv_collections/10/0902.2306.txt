We present for static density functional theory and time-dependent density
functional theory calculations an all-electron method which employs high-order
hierarchical finite element bases. Our mesh generation scheme, in which
structured atomic meshes are merged to an unstructured molecular mesh, allows a
highly nonuniform discretization of the space. Thus it is possible to represent
the core and valence states using the same discretization scheme, i.e., no
pseudopotentials or similar treatments are required. The nonuniform
discretization also allows the use of large simulation cells, and therefore
avoids any boundary effects.
