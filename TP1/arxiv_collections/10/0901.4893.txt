Precision measurements of SM Higgs recoil mass and cross-section are
performed with the Higgs-Strahlung process ee -> Zh, with Z -> mumu and Z -> ee
at 230 GeV and 250 GeV center of mass energies, presuming Mh=120GeV, assuming
the integrated luminosity is 500 1/fb, based on full simulations of several
detector models for the ILC. Results are given and compared in this article, of
the two center of mass energies, and of several detector models. According to
the studies, the Higgs mass can be determined with a statistical error of 39
MeV and 3.6% statistical error for the cross-section.
