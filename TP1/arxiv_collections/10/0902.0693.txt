Continuously symmetric solutions of the Adler-Bobenko-Suris class of discrete
integrable equations are presented. Initially defined by their invariance under
the action of both of the extended three point generalized symmetries admitted
by the corresponding equations, these solutions are shown to be determined by
an integrable system of partial differential equations. The connection of this
system to the Nijhoff-Hone-Joshi "generating partial differential equations" is
established and an auto-Backlund transformation and a Lax pair for it are
constructed. Applied to the H1 and Q1$_{\delta=0}$ members of the
Adler-Bobenko-Suris family, the method of continuously symmetric reductions
yields explicit solutions determined by the Painleve trancendents.
