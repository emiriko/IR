We consider the scalar sector of the most general renormalizable
two-Higgs-doublet model at non-zero temperature. We calculate the largest
finite temperature corrections to the free-energy density and study thermal
evolution of the ground state. Within the approximation chosen, we establish
all possible sequences of thermal phase transitions and study their relation
with the symmetries of the model. We show, in particular, that a
charge-breaking or a CP-violating vacuum can arise at intermediate stages of
thermal evolution, and that the first-order phase transition is associated with
a discrete symmetry of the potential, but not of the entire scalar lagrangian.
