We demonstrate that in the case of Schwarzschild spacetime the Doppler shift
is partially factorized into terms representing relativistic, kinematical and
the gravitational contributions. The condition for the complete factorization
is derived. Application of these results to the simplest cases and possible
implementation in the framework of GPS is briefly discussed.
