We review the free field realization of the deformed Virasoro algebra
$Vir_{q,t}$ and the deformed $W$ algebra $W_{q,t}(\hat{gl_N})$. We explicitly
construct two classes of infinitly many commutative operators ${\cal I}_m$,
${\cal G}_m$, $(m \in {\mathbb N})$, in terms of these algebras. They can be
regarded as the elliptic deformation of the local and nonlocal integrals of
motion for the conformal field theory.
