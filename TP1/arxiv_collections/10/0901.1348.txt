Tunneling spectra of near optimally doped, submicron
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ intrinsic Josephson junctions are presented,
and examined in the region where the superconducting gap evolves into
pseudogap. The spectra are analyzed using a self-energy model, proposed by
Norman {\it et al.}, in which both quasiparticle scattering rate $\Gamma$ and
pair decay rate $\Gamma_{\Delta}$ are considered. The density of states derived
from the model has the familiar Dynes' form with a simple replacement of
$\Gamma$ by $\gamma_+$ = ($\Gamma$ + $\Gamma_{\Delta}$)/2. The $\gamma_+$
parameter obtained from fitting the experimental spectra shows a roughly linear
temperature dependence, which puts a strong constraint on the relation between
$\Gamma$ and $\Gamma_{\Delta}$. We discuss and compare the Fermi arc behavior
in the pseudogap phase from the tunneling and angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy experiments. Our results indicate an excellent agreement between
the two experiments, which is in favor of the precursor pairing view of the
pseudogap.
