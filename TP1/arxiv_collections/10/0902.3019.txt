We present coherent reflection spectroscopy on a charge and DC Stark tunable
quantum dot embedded in a high-quality and externally mode-matched microcavity.
The addition of an exciton to a single-electron charged quantum dot forms a
trion that interacts with the microcavity just below strong coupling regime of
cavity quantum electrodynamics. Such an integrated, monolithic system is a
crucial step towards the implementation of scalable hybrid quantum information
schemes that are based on an efficient interaction between a single photon and
a confined electron spin.
