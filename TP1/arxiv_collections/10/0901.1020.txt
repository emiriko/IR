Unparticles are realized by deconstruction in higher extra dimensions. It is
shown that in this framework when the scale invariance is broken, the
corresponding spectral function of the unparticle is shifted by an amount of
the breaking scale. The result strongly supports the conventional ansatz for
the spectral function of the unparticle in the literature.
