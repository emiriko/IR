Analysis of aggregate Web traffic has shown that PageRank is a poor model of
how people actually navigate the Web. Using the empirical traffic patterns
generated by a thousand users over the course of two months, we characterize
the properties of Web traffic that cannot be reproduced by Markovian models, in
which destinations are independent of past decisions. In particular, we show
that the diversity of sites visited by individual users is smaller and more
broadly distributed than predicted by the PageRank model; that link traffic is
more broadly distributed than predicted; and that the time between consecutive
visits to the same site by a user is less broadly distributed than predicted.
To account for these discrepancies, we introduce a more realistic navigation
model in which agents maintain individual lists of bookmarks that are used as
teleportation targets. The model can also account for branching, a traffic
property caused by browser features such as tabs and the back button. The model
reproduces aggregate traffic patterns such as site popularity, while also
generating more accurate predictions of diversity, link traffic, and return
time distributions. This model for the first time allows us to capture the
extreme heterogeneity of aggregate traffic measurements while explaining the
more narrowly focused browsing patterns of individual users.
