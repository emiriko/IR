Using Monte Carlo simulations we investigate some new aspects of the phase
diagram and the behavior of the diffusion coefficient in an associating lattice
gas (ALG) model on different regions of the phase diagram. The ALG model
combines a two dimensional lattice gas where particles interact through a soft
core potential and orientational degrees of freedom. The competition between
soft core potential and directional attractive forces results in a high density
liquid phase, a low density liquid phase, and a gas phase. Besides anomalies in
the behavior of the density with the temperature at constant pressure and of
the diffusion coefficient with density at constant temperature are also found.
The two liquid phases are separated by a coexistence line that ends in a
bicritical point. The low density liquid phase is separated from the gas phase
by a coexistence line that ends in tricritical point. The bicritical and
tricritical points are linked by a critical $\lambda$-line. The high density
liquid phase and the fluid phases are separated by a second $\tau$ critical
line. We then investigate how the diffusion coefficient behaves on different
regions of the chemical potential-temperature phase diagram. We find that
diffusivity undergoes two types of dynamic transitions: a fragile-to-strong
trans ition when the critical $\lambda$-line is crossed by decreasing the
temperature at a constant chemical potential; and a strong-to-strong transition
when the $\tau$-critical line is crossed by decreasing the temperature at a
constant chemical potential.
