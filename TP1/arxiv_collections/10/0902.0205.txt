We perceive the dimension of physical spacetime we live in through physical
experiments and hence it is pertinent to probe the dimension in which the
fundamental physical forces exist and act? In this context we shall investigate
the two classical fields of gravitation and electromagnetism and argue that
four dimension is necessary for spacetime but may not be sufficient. Some
motivation for higher dimension would also be discussed.
