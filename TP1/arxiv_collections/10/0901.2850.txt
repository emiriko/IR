Disjunctive finitary programs are a class of logic programs admitting
function symbols and hence infinite domains. They have very good computational
properties, for example ground queries are decidable while in the general case
the stable model semantics is highly undecidable. In this paper we prove that a
larger class of programs, called finitely recursive programs, preserves most of
the good properties of finitary programs under the stable model semantics,
namely: (i) finitely recursive programs enjoy a compactness property; (ii)
inconsistency checking and skeptical reasoning are semidecidable; (iii)
skeptical resolution is complete for normal finitely recursive programs.
Moreover, we show how to check inconsistency and answer skeptical queries using
finite subsets of the ground program instantiation. We achieve this by
extending the splitting sequence theorem by Lifschitz and Turner: We prove that
if the input program P is finitely recursive, then the partial stable models
determined by any smooth splitting omega-sequence converge to a stable model of
P.
