Discussed is the structure of classical and quantum excitations of internal
degrees of freedom of multiparticle objects like molecules, fullerens, atomic
nuclei, etc. Basing on some invariance properties under the action of isometric
and affine transformations we reviewed some new models of the mutual
interaction between rotational and deformative degrees of freedom. Our
methodology and some results may be useful in the theory of Raman scattering
and nuclear radiation.
