In this thesis we investigate a new formalism for supergeometry which focuses
on the categorical properties of the theory. This approach is our main tool in
the subsequent investigation of a global analytic approach to the construction
of super Teichmueller spaces. These results should be of importance to various
other fields, in particular, superstring theory and superconformal field
theory.
  This new approach, which was actually first proposed by Molotkov and Schwarz
and Voronov already in the mid-80s, is based on a consequent use of the functor
of points. Apart from clarifying various issues of supergeometry which
sometimes remain obscure in the standard (ringed-space) approach, its main
achievement is that it makes infinite-dimensional supermanifolds available.
  We use this to define the supermanifold of all almost complex structures on a
given finite-dimensional supermanifold and show that it actually carries a
complex structure itself. Moreover we succeed in giving an explicit definition
and construction of the diffeomorphism supergroup of a finite-dimensional
supermanifold.
  We then combine these results to show that one can construct a slice for the
action of the diffeomorphism supergroup on the subspace of integrable almost
complex structures on a smooth closed oriented 2|2-dimensional supersurface.
This slice represents a local patch of super Teichmueller space. We also
investigate how this construction changes if one instead looks at N=1
superconformal structures on such a surface and show that one obtains an
analogous result.
