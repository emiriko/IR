We report on strong coupling between surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) and
Rhodamine 6G (R6G) molecules, with double vacuum Rabi splitting energies up to
230 and 110 meV. In addition, we demonstrate the emission of all three energy
branches of the strongly coupled SPP-exciton hybrid system, revealing features
of system dynamics that are not visible in conventional reflectometry. Finally,
in analogy to tunable-Q microcavities, we show that the Rabi splitting can be
controlled by adjusting the interaction time between waveguided SPPs and R6G
deposited on top of the waveguide. The interaction time can be controlled with
sub-fs precision by adjusting the length of the R6G area with standard
lithography methods.
