Exotic cluster decay of very heavy nuclei is studied using the microscopic
nuclear potentials obtained by folding density dependent M3Y effective
interaction with the densities of the cluster and the daughter nuclei. The
microscopic nuclear potential, Coulomb interaction and the centrifugal barrier
arising out of spin-parity conservation are used to obtain the potential
between the cluster and the daughter nuclei. Half life values are calculated in
the WKB framework and the preformation factors are extracted. The latter values
are seen to have only a very weak dependence on the mass of the emitted
cluster.
