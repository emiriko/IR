How does the framework shape influence the static polarizability (alpha_0)
and the first hyperpolarizability (beta_0)? This work, for the first time,
presents a comparison study at the MP2/6-31+G(d) level, by using the
nitrogen-substituted polyacenes as models: the Moebius strip with a knot, the
cyclic strip without knot, and the linear strip. Opening the knot of the
Moebius strip to form the cyclic strip, it leads to the increase of the alpha_0
from 268 au to 323 au and the beta_0 value increases about three times from 393
(Moebius) to 1049 au (cyclic). Further, opening the cyclic strip to form the
linear strip, the alpha_0 value increases from 323 au to 476 au. While the
beta_0 value as well increases about three times from 1049 (cyclic) to 2814 au
(linear). The changes in the static (hyper)polarizabilities are well explained
by the geometrical differences among the Moebius, cyclic, and linear
nitrogen-substituted polyacenes.
