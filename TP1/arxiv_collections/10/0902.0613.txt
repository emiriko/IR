A non-trivial spatial topology of the Universe is a potentially observable
attribute, which can be probed through the circles-in-the-sky for all locally
homogeneous and isotropic universes with no assumptions on the cosmological
parameters. We show how one can use a possible circles-in-the-sky detection of
the spatial topology of globally homogeneous universes to set constraints on
the dark energy equation of state parameters.
