The chiral low-energy constants c_D and c_E are constrained by means of
accurate ab initio calculations of the A=3 binding energies and, for the first
time, of the triton beta decay. We demonstrate that these low-energy
observables allow a robust determination of the two undetermined constants. The
consistency of the interactions and currents in chiral effective field theory
is crucial to this remarkable result. The two- plus three-nucleon interactions
from chiral effective field theory defined by properties of the A=2 system and
the present determination of c_D and c_E are successful in predicting
properties of the A=3, and 4 systems.
