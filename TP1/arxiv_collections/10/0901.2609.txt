It has been suggested that, considering channeling effect, the order of a few
GeV dark matters which are elastically scattered from detector nuclei might be
plausible candidates reconciling the DAMA annual modulation signal with the
results of other null experiments. We show that Singlet Fermionic Dark Matter
can be such a dark matter candidate, simultaneously providing the correct
thermal relic density which is consistent with the WMAP data.
