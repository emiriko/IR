We present a list of interstellar absorption lines in the direction of HD
37061 in the M 43 nebula. Some of the absorption lines arise from atomic
excited levels that are uncommon in interstellar clouds. The excited levels of
Fe II are populated by fluorescence. We found a large number of H2 molecular
absorption lines arising from vibrationally excited levels. The ortho/para H2
ratio is equal to 2.7. The H2 rotational temperature of vibrational levels 1 -
5 exceeds 2000 K.
