We consider the small deformation of the point-like Wilson loop in the
3-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=6$ superconformal Chern-Simons theory. By Taylor
expansion of the point-like Wilson loop in powers of the loop variables, we
obtain the BPS operators that correspond to the excited string states of the
dual IIA string theory on the pp wave background. The BPS conditions of the
Wilson loop constrain both the loop variables and the forms of the operators
obtained in the Taylor expansion.
