Progress is reported on the development and testing of Monolithic Active
Pixel Sensors (MAPS) for a Si-W ECAL for the ILC. Using laser and source
setups, a first version of the sensor has been characterised through
measurements of the absolute gain calibration, noise and pedestal. The
pixel-to-pixel gain spread is 10%. Charge diffusion has been measured and found
to be compatible with simulation results. The charge collected by a single
pixel varies from 50% to 20% depending on where it is generated. After adding
detector effects to the Geant4 simulation of an ILC-like ECAL, using the
measured parameters, the energy resolution is found to be 35% higher than the
ideal resolution, but is still lower than the resolution obtained for an
equivalent analogue ECAL.
