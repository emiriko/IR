This paper presents solutions to Density Classification Task (DCT) using a
variant of Cellular Automata (CA) called Programmable Cellular Automata (PCA).
The translation property as well as the density preserving property of
fundamental CA rules in 1D and 2D, and the advantage of PCA are embedded
together to obtain the DCT solution. The advantage of PCA over standard CA is
reported. A general 2D DCT of arbitrary shapes and sizes, its applicability and
its solution using PCA is newly introduced.
