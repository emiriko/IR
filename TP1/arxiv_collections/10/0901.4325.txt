The formation of compact objects like stars and black holes is strongly
constrained by the requirement that nearly all of the initial angular momentum
of the diffuse material from which they form must be removed or redistributed
during the formation process. The mechanisms that may be involved and their
implications are discussed for (1) low-mass stars, most of which probably form
in binary or multiple systems; (2) massive stars, which typically form in
clusters; and (3) supermassive black holes that form in galactic nuclei. It is
suggested that in all cases, gravitational interactions with other stars or
mass concentrations in a forming system play an important role in
redistributing angular momentum and thereby enabling the formation of a compact
object. If this is true, the formation of stars and black holes must be a more
complex, dynamic, and chaotic process than in standard models. The
gravitational interactions that redistribute angular momentum tend to couple
the mass of a forming object to the mass of the system, and this may have
important implications for mass ratios in binaries, the upper stellar IMF in
clusters, and the masses of supermassive black holes in galaxies.
