The paper is concerned with the development of a gravitational field theory
having locally a covariant version of the Galilei group. We show that this
Galilean gravity can be used to study the advance of perihelion of a planet,
following in parallel with the result of the (relativistic) theory of general
relativity in the post-Newtonian approximation.
