The high accuracy of modern space astrometry requires the use of General
Relativity to model the propagation of stellar light through the gravitational
field encountered from a source to a given observer inside the Solar System. In
this sense relativistic astrometry is part of fundamental physics. The general
relativistic definition of astrometric measurement needs an appropriate use of
the concept of reference frame, which should then be linked to the conventions
of the IAU Resolutions (2000), which fix the celestial coordinate system. A
consistent definition of the astrometric observables in the context of General
Relativity is also essential to find uniquely the stellar coordinates and
proper motion, this being the main physical task of the inverse ray tracing
problem. Aim of this work is to set the level of reciprocal consistency of two
relativistic models, GREM and RAMOD (Gaia, ESA mission), in order to garantee a
physically correct definition of light direction to a star, an essential item
for deducing the star coordinates and proper motion within the same level of
measurement accuracy.
