We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the 2009 Feb. 2
transit of the exoplanet XO-3b. The new data show that the planetary orbital
axis and stellar rotation axis are misaligned, as reported earlier by Hebrard
and coworkers. We find the angle between the sky projections of the two axes to
be 37.3 +/- 3.7 deg, as compared to the previously reported value of 70 +/- 15
deg. The significance of this discrepancy is unclear because there are
indications of systematic effects. XO-3b is the first exoplanet known to have a
highly inclined orbit relative to the equatorial plane of its parent star, and
as such it may fulfill the predictions of some scenarios for the migration of
massive planets into close-in orbits. We revisit the statistical analysis of
spin-orbit alignment in hot-Jupiter systems. Assuming the stellar obliquities
to be drawn from a single Rayleigh distribution, we find the mode of the
distribution to be 13^{+5}_{-2} deg. However, it remains the case that a model
representing two different migration channels--in which some planets are drawn
from a perfectly-aligned distribution and the rest are drawn from an isotropic
distribution--is favored over a single Rayleigh distribution.
