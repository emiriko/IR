The heavy quark-antiquark potential in perturbative QCD is subject to
ambiguities. We show how to derive a well-defined and stable short-distance
potential that can be matched to results from lattice QCD simulations at
intermediate distances. The static potential as well as the order 1/m potential
are discussed.
