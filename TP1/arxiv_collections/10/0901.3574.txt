Garg and Abadi recently proved that prominent access control logics can be
translated in a sound and complete way into modal logic S4. We have previously
outlined how normal multimodal logics, including monomodal logics K and S4, can
be embedded in simple type theory (which is also known as higher-order logic)
and we have demonstrated that the higher-order theorem prover LEO-II can
automate reasoning in and about them. In this paper we combine these results
and describe a sound and complete embedding of different access control logics
in simple type theory. Employing this framework we show that the off the shelf
theorem prover LEO-II can be applied to automate reasoning in prominent access
control logics.
