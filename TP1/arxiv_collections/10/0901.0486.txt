We examine MHD simulations of the propagation of a strong shock wave through
the interstellar two-phase medium composed of small-scale cloudlets and diffuse
warm neutral medium in two-dimensional geometry. The pre-shock two-phase medium
is provided as a natural consequence of the thermal instability that is
expected to be ubiquitous in the interstellar medium. We show that the
shock-compressed shell becomes turbulent owing to the preshock density
inhomogeneity and magnetic field amplification takes place in the shell. The
maximum field strength is determined by the condition that plasma beta ~ 1,
which gives the field strength on the order of 1 mG in the case of shock
velocity ~ 1,000 km/s. The strongly magnetized region shows filamentary and
knot-like structures in two-dimensional simulations. The spatial scale of the
regions with magnetic field of 1 mG in our simulation is roughly 0.05 pc which
is comparable to the spatial scale of the X-ray hot spots recently discovered
in supernova remnants where the magnetic field strength is indicated to be
amplified up to the order of 1 mG. This result may also suggest that the
turbulent region with locally strong magnetic field is expected to be spread
out in the region with frequent supernova explosions, such as in the Galactic
center and starburst galaxies.
