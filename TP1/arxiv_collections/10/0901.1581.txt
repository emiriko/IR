The hidden on-shell E(7(7)) symmetry of maximal supergravity is usually
discussed in a truncation from D=11 to four dimensions. In this article, we
reverse the logic and start from a theory with manifest off-shell E(7(7))
symmetry inspired by West's coset construction. Following de Wit's and
Nicolai's idea that a 4+56 dimensional "exceptional geometry" underlies maximal
supergravity, we construct the corresponding Lagrangian and the supersymmetry
variations for the 56 dimensional subsector. We prove that both the dynamics
and the supersymmetry coincide with D=11 supergravity in a truncation to d=7 in
the expected way.
