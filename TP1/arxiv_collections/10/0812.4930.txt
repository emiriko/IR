In response to a published assertion to the contrary, this paper briefly
reviews many studies that document remote wounding effects of ballistic
pressure waves including experiments in pigs and dogs that find brain injury
resulting from animal models shot in the thigh and case studies in humans that
document both remote brain and spinal cord injuries ascribed to ballistic
pressure waves.
