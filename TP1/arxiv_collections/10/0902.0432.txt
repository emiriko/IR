The weak decays of $B \to K^{\ast}_0(1430) l^{+} l^{-}$ ($l=\mu, \tau$) are
investigated in Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and also in
Supersymmetric (SUSY) SO(10) Grand Unified Models. Neutral Higgs bosons are the
point of main focus in MSSM because they make quite a large contribution in
exclusive $B \to X_{s} l^{+} l^{-}$ decays at large $\tan{\beta}$ regions of
parameter space of SUSY models, as part of SUSY contributions is proportional
to $\tan^{3}{\beta}$. The analysis of decay rate, forward-backward asymmetries
and lepton polarization asymmetries in $B \to K^{\ast}_0(1430) l^{+} l^{-}$
show that the values of these physical observables are greatly modified by the
effects of neutral Higgs bosons. In SUSY SO(10) GUT model, the new physics
contribution comes from the operators which are induced by the neutral Higgs
boson penguins and also from the operators with chirality opposite to that of
the corresponding Standard Model (SM) operators. SUSY SO(10) effects show up
only in the decay $B \to K^{\ast}_0 \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ where the transverse
lepton polarization asymmetries deviate significantly from the SM value while
the effects in the decay rate, forward-backward asymmetries, the longitudinal
and normal lepton polarization asymmetries are very mild. The transverse lepton
polarization asymmetry is almost zero in SM and in MSSM model, whereas it can
reach to -0.3 in SUSY SO(10) GUT model which could be seen at the future
colliders; hence this asymmetry observable can be used to discriminate between
different SUSY models.
