The behavior of the spatial two-particle correlation function is surveyed in
detail for a uniform 1D Bose gas with repulsive contact interactions at finite
temperatures. Both long-, medium-, and short-range effects are investigated.
The results span the entire range of physical regimes, from ideal gas, to
strongly interacting, and from zero temperature to high temperature. We present
perturbative analytic methods, available at strong and weak coupling, and
first-principle numerical results using imaginary time simulations with the
gauge-P representation in regimes where perturbative methods are invalid.
Nontrivial effects are observed from the interplay of thermally induced
bunching behavior versus interaction induced antibunching.
