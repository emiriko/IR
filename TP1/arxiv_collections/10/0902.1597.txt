Parametric enhancement of the appearance probability of the neutrino
oscillation under the inhomogeneous matter is studied. Fourier expansion of the
matter density profile leads to a simple resonance condition and manifests that
each Fourier mode modifies the energy spectrum of oscillation probability at
around the corresponding energy; below the MSW resonance energy, a large-scale
variation modifies the spectrum in high energies while a small-scale one does
in low energies. In contrast to the simple parametric resonance, the
enhancement of the oscillation probability is itself an slow oscillation as
demonstrated by a numerical analysis with a single Fourier mode of the matter
density. We derive an analytic solution to the evolution equation on the
resonance energy, including the expression of frequency of the slow
oscillation.
