We study a moving boundary model of non-conserved interface growth that
implements the interplay between diffusive matter transport and aggregation
kinetics at the interface. Conspicuous examples are found in thin film
production by chemical vapor deposition and electrochemical deposition. The
model also incorporates noise terms that account for fluctuations in the
diffusive and in the attachment processes. A small slope approximation allows
us to derive effective interface evolution equations (IEE) in which parameters
are related to those of the full moving boundary problem. In particular, the
form of the linear dispersion relation of the IEE changes drastically for slow
or for instantaneous attachment kinetics. In the former case the IEE takes the
form of the well-known (noisy) Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, showing a
morphological instability at short times that evolves into kinetic roughening
of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang class. In the instantaneous kinetics limit, the IEE
combines Mullins-Sekerka linear dispersion relation with a KPZ nonlinearity,
and we provide a numerical study of the ensuing dynamics. In all cases, the
long preasymptotic transients can account for the experimental difficulties to
observe KPZ scaling. We also compare our results with relevant data from
experiments and discrete models.
