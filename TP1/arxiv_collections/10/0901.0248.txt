Current data indicates that lepton mixing is very close to the tri-bimaximal
mixing scenario. In general, however, one expects deviations from any mixing
scenario. We discuss several examples to perturb tri-bimaximal mixing, namely
soft breaking, renormalization group running and charged lepton corrections. We
also present a convenient parametrization of the PMNS matrix which takes
advantage of the apparently close to tri-bimaximal mixing pattern. Finally, it
is discussed how to generate values of U_{e3} which correspond to the recently
found hint for non-zero U_{e3}.
