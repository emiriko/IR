The ideals of the eighteenth century's Age of Enlightenment are the
foundation of modern democracies. The era was characterized by thinkers who
promoted progressive social reforms that opposed the long-established
aristocracies and monarchies of the time. Prominent examples of such reforms
include the establishment of inalienable human rights, self-governing
republics, and market capitalism. Twenty-first century democratic nations can
benefit from revisiting the systems developed during the Enlightenment and
reframing them within the techno-social context of the Information Age. This
article explores the application of social algorithms that make use of Thomas
Paine's (English: 1737--1809) representatives, Adam Smith's (Scottish:
1723--1790) self-interested actors, and Marquis de Condorcet's (French:
1743--1794) optimal decision making groups. It is posited that
technology-enabled social algorithms can better realize the ideals articulated
during the Enlightenment.
