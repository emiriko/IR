We suggest discovery targets for the Higgs boson, dark matter, and quantum
gravity mass scales, motivated by the Dirac equation for the electron in
deSitter space, and a sixth-order constraint between the electron QED
parameters and the cosmological constant. We go on to show that this constraint
can be viewed as a structural parameter of the electron, and leads naturally to
a new cosmic horizon. A dual fourth-order constraint implies a second-order
one, from which the electron neutrino mass is derived.
