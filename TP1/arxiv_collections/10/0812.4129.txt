We prove a complex and a real interpolation theorems on Besov spaces and
Triebel-Lizorkin spaces associated with a selfadjoint operator $L$, without
assuming the gradient estimate for its spectral kernel. The result applies to
the cases where $L$ is a uniformly elliptic operator or a Schr\"odinger
operator with electro-magnetic potential.
