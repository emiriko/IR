We present the first statistical analysis of 27 UVOT optical/ultra-violet
lightcurves of GRB afterglows. We have found, through analysis of the
lightcurves in the observer's frame, that a significant fraction rise in the
first 500s after the GRB trigger, that all lightcurves decay after 500s,
typically as a power-law with a relatively narrow distribution of decay
indices, and that the brightest optical afterglows tend to decay the quickest.
We find that the rise could either be produced physically by the start of the
forward shock, when the jet begins to plough into the external medium, or
geometrically where an off-axis observer sees a rising lightcurve as an
increasing amount of emission enters the observers line of sight, which occurs
as the jet slows. We find that at 99.8% confidence, there is a correlation, in
the observed frame, between the apparent magnitude of the lightcurves at 400s
and the rate of decay after 500s. However, in the rest frame a Spearman Rank
test shows only a weak correlation of low statistical significance between
luminosity and decay rate. A correlation should be expected if the afterglows
were produced by off-axis jets, suggesting that the jet is viewed from within
the half-opening angle theta or within a core of uniform energy density
theta_c. We also produced logarithmic luminosity distributions for three rest
frame epochs. We find no evidence for bimodality in any of the distributions.
Finally, we compare our sample of UVOT lightcurves with the XRT lightcurve
canonical model. The range in decay indices seen in UVOT lightcurves at any
epoch is most similar to the range in decay of the shallow decay segment of the
XRT canonical model. However, in the XRT canonical model there is no indication
of the rising behaviour observed in the UVOT lightcurves.
