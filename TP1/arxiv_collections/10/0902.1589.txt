We find that the exponential operator V=exp[ilamda
(Q_1P_2+Q_2P_3+...+Q_{n-1}P_{n}+Q_{n}P_1)], Q_{i}, P_{i} are respectively the
coordinate and momentum operators, is an n-mode squeezing operator which
engenders standard squeezing. By virtue of the technique of integration within
an ordered product of operators we derive V's normally ordered expansion and
obtain the n-mode squeezed vacuum states, its Wigner function is calculated by
using the Weyl ordering invariance under similar transformations.
