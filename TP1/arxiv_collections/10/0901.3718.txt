Wave propagation phenomena in soils can be experimentally simulated using
centrifuge scale models. An original excitation device (drop-ball arrangement)
is proposed to generate short wave trains. Wave reflections on model boundaries
are taken into account and removed by homomorphic filtering. Propagation is
investigated through dispersion laws. For drop-ball experiments, spherical wave
field analysis assuming linear viscoelasticity leads to a complete analytical
description of wave propagation. Damping phenomena are examined and evaluated
using this description.
