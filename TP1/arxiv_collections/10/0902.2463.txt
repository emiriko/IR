Recent experiments on quantum degenerate gases give an opportunity for
simulating strongly-correlated electronic systems in optical lattices. It may
shed light on some long-standing puzzles in condensed-matter physics, like the
nature of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates that had baffled
people over two decades. It is believed that the two-dimensional fermionic
Hubbard model, or t-J model, contains the key to this problem; but the
difficulty of unveiling the mystery of a strongly-interacting fermionic system
is also generally acknowledged. Here, as a substitute, we systematically
analyze the property of bosonic t-J model simulated in optical superlattices
near unit-filling. In particular, we show the emergence of a strange
topological Fermi liquid with Fermi surfaces from a purely bosonic system. We
also discuss the possibility of observing these phenomena in ultracold atom
experiments. The result may provide some crucial insights into the origin of
high-T_{c} superconductivity.
