We consider the Euler equations governing relativistic compressible fluids
evolving in the Minkowski spacetime with several spatial variables. We propose
a new symmetrization which makes sense for solutions containing vacuum states
and, for instance, applies to the case of compactly supported solutions, which
are important to model star dynamics. Then, relying on these symmetrization and
assuming that the velocity does not exceed some threshold and remains bounded
away from the light speed, we deduce a local-in-time existence result for
solutions containing vacuum states. We also observe that the support of
compactly supported solutions does not expand as time evolves.
