The out-of-equilibrium mean-field dynamics of a model for wave-particle
interaction is investigated. Such a model can be regarded as a general
formulation for all those applications where the complex interplay between
particles and fields is known to be central, e.g., electrostatic instabilities
in plasma physics, particle acceleration and free-electron lasers (FELs). The
latter case is here assumed as a paradigmatic example. A transition separating
different macroscopic regimes is numerically identified and interpreted by
making use of the so-called violent relaxation theory. In the context of
free-electron lasers, such a theory is showed to be effective in predicting the
saturated regime for energies below the transition. The transition is explained
as a dynamical switch between two metastable regimes, and is related to the
properties of a stationary point of an entropic functional.
