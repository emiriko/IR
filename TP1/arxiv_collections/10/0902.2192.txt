Other the past few years we have developed a monolithic CMOS pixel detector
design for the ILC in collaboration with the SARNOFF Corporation. The unique
feature of this design is the recorded time tag for each hit, allowing
assignment of the hit to a particular bunch crossing (thus the name
Chronopixel). The prototype design was completed in 2007. The first set of
prototype devices was fabricated in 2008. We have developed a detailed testing
plan and have designed the test electronics in collaboration with SLAC. Testing
is expected to start early in 2009.
