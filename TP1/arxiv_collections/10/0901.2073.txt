Here, we accept the results of quantum experiments at face value and we make
no apology for the failure of classical physics. Just as Wheeler has called
particle detection an "act of creation", we suggest that, in some
circumstances, not detecting the particle might be considered an "act of
annihilation". We propose a delayed choice experiment in which we decide to
interrupt an experiment after the particle has supposedly passed through the
preparation apparatus and is on the verge of being detected. Even with the
detection device in place, the particle is nowhere to be found.
