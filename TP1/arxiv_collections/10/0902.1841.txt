We treat the problem of diffusion of solute atoms around screw dislocations.
In particular, we express and solve the diffusion equation, in radial symmetry,
in an elastic field of a screw dislocation subject to the flux conservation
boundary condition at the interface of a new phase. We consider an incoherent
second-phase precipitate growing under the action of the stress field of a
screw dislocation. The second-phase growth rate as a function of the
supersaturation and a strain energy parameter is evaluated in spatial
dimensions d=2 and d=3. Our calculations show that an increase in the amplitude
of dislocation force, e.g. the magnitude of the Burgers vector, enhances the
second-phase growth in an alloy. Moreover, a relationship linking the
supersaturation to the precipitate size in the presence of the elastic field of
dislocation is calculated.
