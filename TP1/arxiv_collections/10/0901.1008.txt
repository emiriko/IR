The notion of death line of rotating pulsars is applied to model of
oscillating neutron stars. It is shown that the magnetosphere of typical
non-rotating oscillating stars may not contain secondary plasma to support the
generation of radio emission in the region of open field lines of plasma
magnetosphere.
