In this note we consider effects of a Two-Photon Exchange (TPE) in inclusive
DIS and semi-inclusive DIS (SIDIS). In particular, transverse single spin
asymmetries are generated in inclusive DIS if more than one photon is exchanged
between the lepton and the hadron. We briefly summarize the TPE in DIS in the
parton model and extend our approach to SIDIS, where a new leading twist
$\sin(2\phi)$ contribution to the longitudinal beam spin asymmetry shows up.
Possible TPE effects for the Sivers and the Collins asymmetries in SIDIS are
power-suppressed.
