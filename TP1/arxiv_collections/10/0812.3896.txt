We report exact diagonalization studies of inelastic light scattering in
few-electron quantum dots under the strong confinement regime characteristic of
self-assembled dots. We apply the orthodox (second-order) theory for scattering
due to electronic excitations, leaving for the future the consideration of
higher-order effects in the formalism (phonons, for example), which seem
relevant in the theoretical description of available experiments. Our numerical
results stress the dominance of monopole peaks in Raman spectra and the
breakdown of selection rules in open-shell dots. The dependence of these
spectra on the number of electrons in the dot and the incident photon energy is
explicitly shown. Qualitative comparisons are made with recent experimental
results.
