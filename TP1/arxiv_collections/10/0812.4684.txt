We explore variational Poisson-Nijenhuis structures on nonlinear PDEs and
establish relations between Schouten and Nijenhuis brackets on the initial
equation with the Lie bracket of symmetries on its natural extensions
(coverings). This approach allows to construct a framework for the theory of
nonlocal structures.
