We consider electronic transport through a suspended voltage-biased nanowire.
By coupling the tunneling current to a transverse magnetic field, vibrational
modes of the wire are excited which influences the current-voltage
characteristics of the system in novel ways through the induced electron-vibron
interaction. From this analysis, we find that at high voltages the current
through the suspended nanowire is offset from its non-vibrating ohmic value by
an amount that is independent of both bias voltage and temperature. We also
show that the corrections to the current from the back-action of the vibrating
wire decay exponentially in the limit of high voltage, a result that holds even
if the nanowire vibrational modes have been driven out of thermal equilibrium.
