We give the first example of faster transport with a quantum walk on an
inherently directed graph, on the directed line with a variable number of
self-loops at each vertex. These self-loops can be thought of as adding a
number of small dimensions. This is a discrete time quantum walk using the
Fourier transform coin, where the walk proceeds a distance $\Theta(1)$ in
constant time compared to $\Theta(1/n)$ classically, independent of the number
of these small dimensions. The analysis proceeds by reducing this walk to a
walk with a two dimensional coin.
