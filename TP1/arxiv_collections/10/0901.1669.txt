Gisin's theorem assures that for any pure bipartite entangled state, there is
violation of Bell-CHSH inequality revealing its contradiction with local
realistic model. Whether, similar result holds for three-qubit pure entangled
states, remained unresolved. We show analytically that all three-qubit pure
entangled states violate a Bell-type inequality, derived on the basis of local
realism, by exploiting the Hardy's non-locality argument.
