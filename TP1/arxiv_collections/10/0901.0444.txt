We consider a protocol for the control of few-qubit registers comprising one
electronic spin embedded in a nuclear spin bath. We show how to isolate a few
proximal nuclear spins from the rest of the environment and use them as
building blocks for a potentially scalable quantum information processor. We
describe how coherent control techniques based on magnetic resonance methods
can be adapted to these electronic-nuclear solid state spin systems, to provide
not only efficient, high fidelity manipulation of the registers, but also
decoupling from the spin bath. As an example, we analyze feasible performances
and practical limitations in a realistic setting associated with
nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond.
