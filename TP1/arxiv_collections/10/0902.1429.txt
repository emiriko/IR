We theoretically demonstrate that earthquake shield made of seismic crystal
can damp down surface waves, which are the most destructive type for
constructions. In the paper, seismic crystal is introduced in aspect of band
gaps (Stop band) and some design concepts for earthquake and tsunami shielding
were discussed in theoretical manner. We observed in our FDTD based 2D elastic
wave simulations that proposed earthquake shield could provide about 0.5
reductions in magnitude of surface wave on the Richter scale. This reduction
rate in magnitude can considerably reduce destructions in the case of
earthquake.
