In this paper, we investigate the semiclassical strings in AdS(3)XS^2, in
which the string configuration of AdS(3) is classified to three cases depending
on the parameters. Each of these has a different anomalous dimension
proportional to logS, S^(1/3) and S, where S is a angular momentum on AdS(3).
Further we generalize the dispersion relations for various string configuration
on AdS(3)XS^2.
