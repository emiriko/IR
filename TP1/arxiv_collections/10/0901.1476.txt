The process of coherent creation of particle - hole excitations by an
electric field in graphene is quantitatively described. We calculate the
evolution of current density, number of pairs and energy after switching on the
electric field. In particular, it leads to a dynamical visualization of the
universal finite resistivity without dissipation in pure graphene. We show that
the DC conductivity of pure graphene is rather $\frac{\pi e^{2}}{2 h}$ than the
often cited value of $\frac{4 e^{2}}{\pi h}$. This value coincides with the AC
conductivity calculated and measured recently at optical frequencies. The
effect of temperature and random chemical potential (charge puddles) are
considered and explain the recent experiment on suspended graphene. A
possibility of Bloch oscillations is discussed within the tight binding model.
