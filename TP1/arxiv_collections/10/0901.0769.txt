An energy harvesting device based on nanohelices is presented. The energy
harvesting scheme based on nanohelices involves the same rectification
circuitry found in many household electronic goods, which converts alternating
current (AC) from a wall outlet into a direct current (DC) supply. The
presented device, however, involves the rectification of ambient
electromagnetic waves rather than the AC source from a household wall outlet.
