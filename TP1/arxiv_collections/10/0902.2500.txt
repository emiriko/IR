This paper studies Brownian motion and heat kernel measure on a class of
infinite dimensional Lie groups. We prove a Cameron-Martin type
quasi-invariance theorem for the heat kernel measure and give estimates on the
$L^p$ norms of the Radon-Nikodym derivatives. We also prove that a logarithmic
Sobolev inequality holds in this setting.
