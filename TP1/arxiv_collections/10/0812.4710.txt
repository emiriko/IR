This paper presents a brief overview of several studies concerning the indoor
wireless communications at 60 GHz performed by the IETR. The characterization
and the modeling of the radio propagation channel are based on several
measurement campaigns realized with the channel sounder developed at IETR. Some
typical residential environments were also simulated by ray tracing and
Gaussian Beam Tracking. The obtained results show a good agreement with the
similar experimental results. Currently, the IETR is developing a high data
rate wireless communication system operating at 60 GHz. The single-carrier
architecture of this system is also presented.
