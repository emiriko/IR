Using a new numerical code with non-uniform adapted mesh, we study the
changes produced in the global properties of neutron stars by the motion of
matter in crust region during post-glitch epoch. Our numerical analysis shows
that these changes may contribute to explain the observed spin-down of
rotational frequency.
