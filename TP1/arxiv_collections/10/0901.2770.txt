Ram pressure stripping of the multiphase ISM is studied in the perturbed
Virgo cluster spiral galaxy NGC 4438. This galaxy underwent a tidal interaction
~100 Myr ago and is now strongly affected by ram pressure stripping. Deep VLA
radio continuum observations at 6 and 20 cm are presented. We detect prominent
extraplanar emission to the west of the galactic center, which extends twice as
far as the other tracers of extraplanar material. The spectral index of the
extraplanar emission does not steepen with increasing distance from the galaxy.
This implies in situ re-acceleration of relativistic electrons. The comparison
with multiwavelength observations shows that the magnetic field and the warm
ionized interstellar medium traced by Halpha emission are closely linked. The
kinematics of the northern extraplanar Halpha emission, which is ascribed to
star formation, follow those of the extraplanar CO emission. In the western and
southern extraplanar regions, the Halpha measured velocities are greater than
those of the CO lines. We suggest that the ionized gas of this region is
excited by ram pressure. The spatial and velocity offsets are consistent with a
scenario where the diffuse ionized gas is more efficiently pushed by ram
pressure stripping than the neutral gas. We suggest that the recently found
radio-deficient regions compared to 24 mum emission are due to this difference
in stripping efficiency.
