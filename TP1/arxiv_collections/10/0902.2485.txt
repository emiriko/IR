We present results from three-dimensional ideal magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of low $\beta$ compact toroid (CT) injection into a hot strongly
magnetized plasma, with the aim of providing insight into CT fueling of a
tokamak with parameters relevant for ITER (International Thermonuclear
Experimental Reactor). A regime is identified in terms of CT injection speed
and CT-to-background magnetic field ratio that appears promising for precise
core fueling. Shock-dominated regimes, which are probably unfavorable for
tokamak fueling, are also identified. The CT penetration depth is proportional
to the CT injection speed and density. The entire CT evolution can be divided
into three stages: (1) initial penetration, (2) compression in the direction of
propagation, and reconnection with the background magnetic field, and (3)
coming to rest and spreading in the direction perpendicular to injection.
Tilting of the CT is not observed due to the fast transit time of the CT across
the background plasma.
