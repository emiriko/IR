In this paper, we will propose that magnetic-resonance nanostructures in a
metal surface could be used to realize extraordinary optical transmission
(EOT). Toward this goal, we designed and fabricated a one dimensional diatomic
chain of slit-hole resonator (SHR). Due to the strong exchange current
interaction, a type of magnetic plasmon (MP) propagation mode with a broad
frequency bandwidth was established in this system. Apparent EOT peaks induced
by the MP mode were observed in our measured spectra at infrared frequencies.
The strongest EOT peak was obtained at 1.07 eV with an incident angle of 20
degree. The measured dependence of EOT peaks on the incident angle coincided
with the theoretical results quite well. This proposed MP propagation mode in
SHR structure has good potential applications in multifrequency nonlinear
optical processes.
