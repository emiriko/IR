In this note we discuss explicitly the structure of two simple set of zeros
which are associated with the mean staircase emerging from the zeta function
and we specify a solution using the Lambert W function. The argument of it may
then be set equal to a special $N \times N$ classical matrix (for every $N$)
related to the Hamiltonian of the Mehta-Dyson model. In this way we specify a
function of an hermitean operator whose eigenvalues are the "trivial zeros" on
the critical line. The first set of trivial zeros is defined by the relations
$\tmop{Im} (\zeta ({1/2} + i \cdot t)) = 0 \wedge \tmop{Re} (\zeta ({1/2} + i
\cdot t)) \neq 0$ and viceversa for the second set. (To distinguish from the
usual trivial zeros $s = \rho + i \cdot t = - 2 n$, $n \geqslant 1$ integer)
