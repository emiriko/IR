The ESA gamma-ray telescope, INTEGRAL, is detecting relatively more
intrinsically rare cataclysmic variables (CVs) than were found by surveys at
lower energies. Specifically, a large fraction of the CVs that are INTEGRAL
sources consists of asynchronous polars and intermediate polars (IPs). IP
classifications have been proposed for the majority of CVs discovered by
INTEGRAL, but, in many cases, there is very little known about these systems.
In order to address this, I present time-resolved optical data of five CVs
discovered through INTEGRAL observations. The white dwarf spin modulation is
detected in high-speed photometry of three of the new CVs (IGR J15094-6649, IGR
J16500-3307, and IGR J17195-4100), but two others (XSS J12270-4859 and IGR
J16167-4957) show no evidence of magnetism, and should be considered
unclassified systems. Spectroscopic orbital period (P_orb) measurements are
also given for IGR J15094-6649, IGR J16167-4957, IGR J16500-3307, and IGR
J17195-4100.
