A complete parton level analysis of lv + four jets production at the LHC is
presented, including all processes at order O(alpha^6), O(alpha^4*alpha_s^2)
and O(alpha^2*alpha_s^4). The infinite Higgs mass scenario, which is considered
as a benchmark for strong scattering theories and is the limiting case for
composite Higgs models, is confronted with the Standard Model light Higgs
predictions in order to determine whether a composite Higgs signal can be
detected as an excess of events in boson--boson scattering.
