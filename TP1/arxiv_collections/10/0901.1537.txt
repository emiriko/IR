Red giants offer a good opportunity to study the interplay of magnetic fields
and stellar evolution. Using the spectro-polarimeter NARVAL of the Telescope
Bernard Lyot (TBL), Pic du Midi, France and the LSD technique, we began a
survey of magnetic fields in single G-K-M giants. Early results include 6
MF-detections with fast rotating giants, and for the first time a magnetic
field was detected directly in an evolved M-giant: EK Boo. Our results could be
explained in the terms of $\alpha$--$\omega$ dynamo operating in these giants.
