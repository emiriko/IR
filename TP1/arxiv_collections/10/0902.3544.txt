We describe a method for calculating the counting statistics of electronic
transport through nanoscale devices with both sequential and cotunneling
contributions. The method is based upon a perturbative expansion of the von
Neumann equation in Liouvillian space, with current cumulants calculated from
the resulting nonMarkovian master equation without further approximation. As
application, we consider transport through a single quantum dot and discuss the
effects of cotunneling on noise and skewness, as well as the properties of
various approximation schemes.
