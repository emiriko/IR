SAXSFit is a computer analysis program that has been developed to assist in
the fitting of small-angle x-ray and neutron scattering spectra primarily from
nanoparticles (nanopores). The fitting procedure yields the pore or particle
size distribution and eta parameter for one or two size distributions (which
can be log-normal, Schulz, or Gaussian). A power-law and/or constant background
can also be included. The program is written in Java so as to be stand-alone
and platform-independent, and is designed to be easy for novices to use, with a
user-friendly graphical interface.
