We use lithographically induced strain relaxation to periodically modulate
the magnetic anisotropy in a single (Ga,Mn)As layer. This results in a lateral
magnetoresistance device where two non-volatile magnetic states exist at zero
external magnetic field with resistances resulting from the orientation of two
lithographically defined regions in a single and contiguous layer.
