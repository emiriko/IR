Exact stationary solutions of the wave equation are obtained to describe the
interaction between magnetic moment of elementary particle and circularly
polarized photons. The obtained solutions substantially modify the conventional
model of field-matter interaction. It follows from them that magnetic moment
couples to photons, and this coupling leads to bound particle-photon states
with different energies for different orientations of magnetic moment. As a
consequence, the interaction splits particle states differing by directions of
total angular momentum. Stationary spin splitting, induced by photons, and
concomitant effects can be observed for particles exposed to a laser-generated
circularly polarized electromagnetic wave.
