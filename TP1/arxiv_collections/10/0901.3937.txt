We have computed the charge that develops on an SQN in space as a result of
balance between the rates of ionization by ambient gammas and capture of
ambient electrons. We have also computed the times for achieving that
equilibrium and binding energy of the least bound SQN electrons. We have done
this for seven different settings. We sketch the calculations here and give
their results in the Figure and Table II; details are in the Physical Review
D.79.023513 (2009).
