The energy spectrum of cosmic rays in the range 10^15 eV to 6*10^19 eV has
been studied using the air Cherenkov light detectors of the Yakutsk array. The
total flux of photons produced by relativistic electrons (including positrons
as well, hereafter) of extensive air showers in the atmosphere is used as the
energy estimator of the primary particle initiating a shower. The resultant
differential flux of cosmic rays exhibits, in accordance with previous
measurements, a knee and ankle features at energies 3*10^15 and ~10^19 eV,
respectively. A comparison of observational data with simulations is made in
the knee and ankle regions in order to choose the models of galactic and
extragalactic components of cosmic rays which describe better the energy
spectrum measured.
