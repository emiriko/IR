We present a practical way of smoothing discrete breakup S-matrix elements
calculated by the continuum-discretized coupled-channel method (CDCC). This
method makes the smoothing procedure much easier. The reliability of the
smoothing method is confirmed for the three-body breakup reactions, 58Ni(d,pn)
at 80 MeV and 12C(6He,4He2n) at 229.8 MeV.
