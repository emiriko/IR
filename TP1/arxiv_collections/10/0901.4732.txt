These lectures give an overview of aspects of missing E_T signatures from new
physics at the LHC, along with their important connection to dark matter
physics. Mostly, I will concentrate on supersymmetric (SUSY) sources of missing
E_T, but will also mention Little Higgs models with T-parity (LHT) and
universal extra dimensions (UED) models with KK-parity. Lecture 1 covers SUSY
basics, model building and spectra computation. Lecture 2 addresses sparticle
production and decay mechanisms at hadron colliders and event generation.
Lecture 3 covers SUSY signatures at LHC, along with LHT and UED signatures for
comparison. In Lecture 4, I address the dark matter connection, and how direct
and indirect dark matter searches, along with LHC collider searches, may allow
us to both discover and characterize dark matter in the next several years.
Finally, the interesting scenario of Yukawa-unified SUSY is examined; this case
works best if the dark matter turns out to be a mixture of axion/axino states,
rather than neutralinos.
