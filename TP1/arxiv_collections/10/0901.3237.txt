In this short note we explain the main idea of the work done in
arXiv:0804.4487[hep-th] and arXiv:0812.2942[hep-th]. We present a family of
black hole microstates, the bubbling solutions. We then explain how supertubes
placed in such backgrounds have their entropy enhanced by the presence of the
background dipole charges. This indicates this could account for a large amount
in the entropy of the three charge black hole.
