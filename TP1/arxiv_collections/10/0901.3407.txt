We describe the results of a theoretical study of transport through gated
metallic graphene nanoribbons using a non-equilibrium Green function method.
Although analogies with quantum field theory predict perfect transmission of
chiral fermions through gated regions in one dimension, we find \emph{perfect
reflection} of chiral fermions in armchair ribbons for specific configurations
of the gate. This effect should be measurable in narrow graphene constrictions
gated by a charged carbon nanotube.
