We show in detail that the Hawking temperature calculated from the surface
gravity is in agreement with the result of exact semi-classical radiation
spectrum for higher dimensional linear dilaton black holes in various theories.
We extend the method derived first by Cl\'ement-Fabris-Marques for
4-dimensional linear dilaton black hole solutions to the higher dimensions in
theories such as Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton, Einstein-Yang-Mills-Dilaton and
Einstein-Yang-Mills-Born-Infeld-Dilaton. Similar to the
Cl\'ement-Fabris-Marques results, it is proved that whenever an analytic
solution is available to the massless scalar wave equation in the background of
higher dimensional massive linear dilaton black holes, an exact computation of
the radiation spectrum leads to the Hawking temperature T_{H} in the high
frequency regime. The significance of the dimensionality on the value of T_{H}
is shown, explicitly. For a chosen dimension, we demonstrate how higher
dimensional linear dilaton black holes interpolate between the black hole
solutions with Yang-Mills and electromagnetic fields by altering the
Born-Infeld parameter in aspect of measurable quantity T_{H}. Finally, we
explain the reason of, why massless higher dimensional linear dilaton black
holes cannot radiate.
