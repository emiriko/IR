We present recent investigations on dipole and quadrupole excitations in
spherical skin nuclei, particular exploring their connection to the thickness
of the neutron skin. Our theoretical method relies on density functional
theory, which provides us with a proper link between nuclear many-body theory
of the nuclear ground state and its phenomenological description. For the
calculation of the nuclear excited states we apply QPM theory. A new quadrupole
mode related to pygmy quadrupole resonance (PQR) in tin isotopes is suggested.
