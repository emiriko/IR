We investigate the relation between Trees of Fragmenting Granules (TFGs) and
the locations of concentrated magnetic flux in internetwork areas. The former
have previously been identified with mesogranulation. While a relationship has
been suggested to exist between these features, no direct evidence has yet been
provided. We present some preliminary results that show that concentrated
magnetic flux indeed collects on the borders of TFGs.
