We analyze Loewner traces driven by functions asymptotic to K\sqrt{1-t}. We
prove a stability result when K is not 4 and show that K=4 can lead to non
locally connected hulls. As a consequence, we obtain a driving term \lambda(t)
so that the hulls driven by K\lambda(t) are generated by a continuous curve for
all K > 0 with K not equal to 4 but not when K = 4, so that the space of
driving terms with continuous traces is not convex. As a byproduct, we obtain
an explicit construction of the traces driven by K\sqrt{1-t} and a conceptual
proof of the corresponding results of Kager, Nienhuis and Kadanoff,
