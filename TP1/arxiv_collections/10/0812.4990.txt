This first article of a series formulates the thermodynamics of ideal gases
in a constant gravitational field in terms of an action principle that is
closely integrated with thermodynamics. The theory, in its simplest form, does
not deviate from standard practice, but it lays the foundations for a more
systematic approach to the various extensions, such as the incorporation of
radiation, the consideration of mixtures and the integration with General
Relativity. We study the interaction between an ideal gas and the photon gas,
and propose a new approach to this problem. We study the propagation of sound
in a vertical, isothermal column and are led to suggest that the theory is
incomplete, and to ask whether the true equilibrium state of an ideal gas may
turn out be adiabatic, in which case the role of solar radiation is merely to
compensate for the loss of energy by radiation into the cosmos. An experiment
with a centrifuge is proposed, to determine the influence of gravitation on the
equilibrium distribution with a very high degree of precision.
