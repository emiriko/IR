The expressions for the superfluid density have been discussed in both weak
and strong coupling approaches. The numerical calculations of temperature and
isotope composition dependencies have been performed for a number of High-Tc
compounds. The tight-binding parameters and corresponding Fermi surfaces are
taken in accord to the available photoemission data.
