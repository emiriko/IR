We derive exact solutions of simplified models for the temporal evolution of
the protein concentration within a cell population arbitrarily far from the
stationary state. We show that monitoring the dynamics can assist in modeling
and understanding the nature of the noise and its role in gene expression and
protein production. We introduce a new measure, the cell turnover distribution,
which can be used to probe the phase of transcription of DNA into messenger
RNA.
