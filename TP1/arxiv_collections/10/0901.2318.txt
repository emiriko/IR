The star BD+29 1748 was resolved to be a close binary from its occultation by
the asteroid 87 Sylvia on 2006 December 18 UT. Four telescopes were used to
observe this event at two sites separated by some 80 km apart. Two flux drops
were observed at one site, whereas only one flux drop was detected at the
other. From the long-term variation of Sylvia, we inferred the probable shape
of the shadow during the occultation, and this in turn constrains the binary
parameters: the two components of BD+29 1748 have a projected separation of
0.097" to 0.110" on the sky with a position angle 104 deg to 107 deg. The
asteroid was clearly resolved with a size scale ranging from 130 to 290 km, as
projected onto the occultation direction. No occultation was detected for
either of the two known moonlets of 87 Sylvia.
