Magnetotransport of natural graphite and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite
(HOPG) has been measured at mK temperatures. Quantum oscillations for both
electron and hole carriers are observed with orbital angular momentum quantum
number up to $N\approx90$. A remarkable agreement is obtained when comparing
the data and the predictions of the Slonczewski--Weiss--McClure tight binding
model for massive fermions. No evidence for Dirac fermions is observed in the
transport data which is dominated by the crossing of the Landau bands at the
Fermi level, corresponding to $dE/dk_z=0$, which occurs away from the $H$ point
where Dirac fermions are expected.
