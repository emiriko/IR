The problem of prediction in functional linear regression is conventionally
addressed by reducing dimension via the standard principal component basis. In
this paper we show that an alternative basis chosen through weighted
least-squares, or weighted least-squares itself, can be more effective when the
experimental errors are heteroscedastic. We give a concise theoretical result
which demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach, even when the model for
the variance is inaccurate, and we explore the numerical properties of the
method. We show too that the advantages of the suggested adaptive techniques
are not found only in low-dimensional aspects of the problem; rather, they
accrue almost equally among all dimensions.
