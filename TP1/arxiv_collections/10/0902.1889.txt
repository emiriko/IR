We study the electrophoretic separation of polyelectrolytes of varying
lengths by means of end-labeled free-solution electrophoresis (ELFSE). A
coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation model, using full electrostatic
interactions and a mesoscopic Lattice Boltzmann fluid to account for
hydrodynamic interactions, is used to characterize the drag coefficients of
different label types: linear and branched polymeric labels, as well as
transiently bound micelles.
  It is specifically shown that the label's drag coefficient is determined by
its hydrodynamic size, and that the drag per label monomer is largest for
linear labels. However, the addition of side chains to a linear label offers
the possibility to increase the hydrodynamic size, and therefore the label
efficiency, without having to increase the linear length of the label, thereby
simplifying synthesis. The third class of labels investigated, transiently
bound micelles, seems very promising for the usage in ELFSE, as they provide a
significant higher hydrodynamic drag than the other label types.
  The results are compared to theoretical predictions, and we investigate how
the efficiency of the ELFSE method can be improved by using smartly designed
drag-tags.
