The propagation of transverse spatial correlations of photon pairs through
arbitrary first-order linear optical systems is studied experimentally and
theoretically using the fractional Fourier transform. Highly-correlated photon
pairs in an EPR-like state are produced by spontaneous parametric
down-conversion and subject to optical fractional Fourier transform systems. It
is shown that the joint detection probability can display either correlation,
anti-correlation, or no correlation, depending on the sum of the orders
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ of the transforms of the down-converted photons. We
present analytical results for the propagation of the perfectly correlated EPR
state, and numerical results for the propagation of the two-photon state
produced from parametric down-conversion. We find good agreement between theory
and experiment.
