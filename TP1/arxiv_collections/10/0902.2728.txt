The occurrence of bulk superconductivity at ~22 K is reported in
polycrystalline samples of BaFe2-xRuxAs2 for nominal Ru content in the range of
x=0.75 to 1.125. A systematic suppression of the spin density wave transition
temperature (TSDW) precedes the appearance of superconductivity in the system.
A phase diagram is proposed based on the measured TSDW and superconducting
transition temperature (TC) variations as a function of Ru composition. Band
structure calculations, indicate introduction of electron carriers in the
system upon Ru substitutiom. The calculated magnetic moment on Fe shows a
minimum at x=1.0, suggesting that the suppression of the magnetic moment is
associated with the emergence of superconductivity. Results of low temperature
and high field Mossbauer measurements are presented. These indicate weakening
of magnetic interaction with Ru substitution
