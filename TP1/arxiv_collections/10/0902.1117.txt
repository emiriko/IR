Realistic simulations of current ultra-cold atoms experiments in optical
lattices show that the ramping up of the optical lattice is significantly
nonadiabatic, implying that experimentally prepared Mott insulators are not
really in the ground state of the atomic system. The nonadiabaticity is even
larger in the presence of a secondary quasi-periodic lattice simulating
"disorder". Alternative ramping schemes are suggested that improve the
adiabaticity when the disorder is not too large.
