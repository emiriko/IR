We present computer simulation results on the dynamic propensity [as defined
by Widmer- Cooper, Harrowell, and Fynewever, Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 135701
(2004)] in a Kob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones liquid system consisting of 8788
particles. We compute the spatial correlation function of the dynamic
propensity as a function of both the reduced temperature T, and the time scale
on which the particle displacements are measured. For T\leq0.6, we find that
nonzero correlations occur at the largest length scale accessible in our
system. We also show that a cluster-size analysis of particles with extremal
values of the dynamic propensity, as well as 3D visualizations, reveal
spatially correlated regions that approach the size of our system as T
decreases, consistent with the behavior of the spatial correlation function.
Next, we define and examine the "coordination propensity", the
isoconfigurational average of the coordination number of the minority B
particles around the majority A particles. We show that a significant
correlation exists between the spatial fluctuations of the dynamic and
coordination propensities. In addition, we find non-zero correlations of the
coordination propensity occurring at the largest length scale accessible in our
system for all T in the range 0.466<T<1.0. We discuss the implications of these
results for understanding the length scales of dynamical heterogeneity in
glass-forming liquids.
