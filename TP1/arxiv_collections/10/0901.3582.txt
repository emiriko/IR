Recent measurements of cosmic-ray electron and positron fluxes by PAMELA and
ATIC experiments may indicate the existence of annihilating dark matter with
large annihilation cross section. We show that the dark matter annihilation in
the big-bang nucleosynthesis epoch affects the light element abundances, and it
gives stringent constraints on such annihilating dark matter scenarios for the
case of hadronic annihilation. Constraints on leptonically annihilating dark
matter models are less severer.
