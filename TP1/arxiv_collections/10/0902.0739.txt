Ultracold dipolar Fermi gases represent relatively unexplored, strongly
correlated systems arising from long-range and anisotropic interactions. We
demonstrate the possibility of a spontaneous symmetry breaking biaxial phase in
these systems, which may be realized in, e.g., gases of ultracold polar
molecules or strongly magnetic atoms. This biaxial nematic phase is manifest in
a spontaneous distortion of the Fermi surface perpendicular to the axis of
polarization. We describe these dipolar interaction induced phases using Landau
Fermi liquid theory.
