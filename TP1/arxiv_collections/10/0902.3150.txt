We study the interaction of the octet of vector mesons with the decuplet of
baryons using Lagrangians of the hidden gauge theory for vector interactions.
The unitary amplitudes in coupled channels develop poles that can be associated
with some known baryonic resonances, while there are predictions for new ones
at the energy frontier of the experimental research. The work offers guidelines
on how to search for these resonances.
