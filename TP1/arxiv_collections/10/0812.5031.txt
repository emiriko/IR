We have presented a $S_4$ flavor model to unify quarks and leptons in the
framework of the SU(5) GUT. Three generations of $\bar5$-plets in SU(5) are
assigned $3_1$ of $S_4$ while the first and the second generations of 10-plets
in SU(5) are assigned to be 2 of $S_4$, and the third generation of 10-plet is
to be $1_1$ of $S_4$. The right-handed neutrinos are also assigned 2 for the
first and second generations and $1_1$ for the third generation, respectively.
Taking vacuum alignments of relevant gauge singlet scalars, we predict the
quark mixing as well as the tri-bimaximal mixing of neutrino flavors.
Especially, the Cabbibo angle is predicted to be $15^{\circ}$ in the limit of
the vacuum alignment. We can improve the model to predict observed CKM mixing
angles as well as the non-vanishing $U_{e3}$ of the neutrino flavor mixing.
