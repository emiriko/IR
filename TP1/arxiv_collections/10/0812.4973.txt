The problem of space-optimal jump encoding in the x86 instruction set, also
known as branch displacement optimization, is described, and a linear-time
algorithm is given that uses no complicated data structures, no recursion, and
no randomization. The only assumption is that there are no array declarations
whose size depends on the negative of the size of a section of code (Hyde
2006), which is reasonable for real code.
