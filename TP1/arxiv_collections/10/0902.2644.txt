Nonlinear-optical manifestations of the Borrmann effect that are consequences
of the spectral dependence of the spatial distributions of the electromagnetic
field in a structure are observed in one-dimensional photonic crystals. The
spectrum of the light self-focusing effect corresponding to the
propagation-matrix calculations has been measured near the edge of the photonic
gap.
