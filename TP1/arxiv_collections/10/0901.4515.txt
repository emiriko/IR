The natural trajectory tracking problem is studied for generic quantum states
represented by density operators. A control design based on the Hilbert-Schmidt
distance as a Lyapunov function is considered. The control dynamics is
redefined on an extended space where the LaSalle invariance principle can be
correctly applied even for non-stationary target states. LaSalle's invariance
principle is used to derive a general characterization of the invariant set,
which is shown to always contain the critical points of the Lyapunov function.
Critical point analysis of the latter is used to show that, for generic states,
it is a Morse function with $n!$ isolated critical points, including one global
minimum, one global maximum and $n!-2$ saddles. It is also shown, however, that
the actual dynamics of the system is not a gradient flow, and therefore a full
eigenvalue analysis of the linearized dynamics about the critical points of the
dynamical system is necessary to ascertain stability of the critical points.
This analysis shows that a generic target state is locally asymptotically
stable if the linearized system is controllable and the invariant set is
regular, and in fact convergence to the target state (trajectory) in this case
is almost global in that the stable manifolds of all other critical points form
a subset of measure zero of the state space. On the other hand, if either of
these sufficient conditions is not satisfied, the target state ceases to be
asymptotically stable, a center manifold emerges around the target state, and
the control design ceases to be effective.
