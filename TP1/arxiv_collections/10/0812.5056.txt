Recently the first two authors constructed an L-infinity morphism using the
S^1-equivariant version of the Poisson Sigma Model (PSM). Its role in
deformation quantization was not entirely clear. We give here a "good"
interpretation and show that the resulting formality statement is equivalent to
formality on cyclic chains as conjectured by Tsygan and proved recently by
several authors.
