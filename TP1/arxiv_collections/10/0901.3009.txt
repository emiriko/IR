We consider a class of ordinary differential equations describing
one-dimensional systems with a quasi-periodic forcing term and in the presence
of large damping. We discuss the conditions to be assumed on the mechanical
force and the forcing term for the existence of quasi-periodic solutions which
have the same frequency vector as the forcing.
