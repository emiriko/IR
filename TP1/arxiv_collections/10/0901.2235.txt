There has been overwhelming evidence that coherent structures play a critical
role in determining the overall transport in a variety of systems. We compute
the probability distribution function (PDF) tails of momentum flux and heat
flux in ion-temperature-gradient turbulence, by taking into account the
interaction among modons, which are assumed to be coherent structures
responsible for bursty and intermittent events, contributing to the PDF tails.
The tail of PDF of momentum flux $R = < v_x v_y>$ is shown to be exponential
with the form $\exp{\{-\xi R^{3/2}\}}$, which is broader than a Gaussian,
similarly to what was found in the previous local studies. An analogous
expression with the same functional dependence is found for the PDF tails of
heat flux. Furthermore, we present a detailed numerical study of the dependence
of the PDF tail on the temperature and density scale lengths and other physical
parameters through the coefficient $\xi$.
