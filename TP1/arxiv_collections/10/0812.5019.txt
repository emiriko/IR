We discuss the experimental data on the n,e-scattering length bne and the
values of mean square charge radius of the neutron <r^2> obtained from them. It
is shown that the accumulated during the last 50 years most significant
experimental estimates of the bne are not contradictory and lead to the average
value <r^2>=-0.1178+-0.0037 fm^2. Assuming that all the authors have
underestimated the errors of their measurements by a factor of 1.7, the
combined fit of all available experimental data would lead to Chi^2~1 per
degree of freedom. Different modern theoretical predictions of <r^2> are
considered. They are found to be in a good agreement with the obtained
experimental value <r^2>. However the existing theoretical description of the
structure of neutron does not provide a value of <r^2> with a sufficient
accuracy.
