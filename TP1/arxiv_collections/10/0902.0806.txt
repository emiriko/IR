The newest homologous series of superconducting As-pnictides, LiFeAs (Li111)
and NaFeAs (Na111) have been synthesized and investigated. Both crystallize
with the layered tetragonal anti-PbFCl-type structure in P4/nmm space group.
Polycrystalline samples and single-crystals of Li111 and Na111 display
superconducting transitions at ~ 18 K and 12-25 K, respectively. No magnetic
order has been found in either compound, although a weak magnetic background is
clearly in evidence. The origin of the carriers and the stoichiometric
compositions of Li111 and Na111 were explored.
