The "carries" when n random numbers are added base b form a Markov chain with
an "amazing" transition matrix determined by Holte. This same Markov chain
occurs in following the number of descents or rising sequences when n cards are
repeatedly riffle shuffled. We give generating and symmetric function proofs
and determine the rate of convergence of this Markov chain to stationarity.
Similar results are given for type B shuffles. We also develop connections with
Gaussian autoregressive processes and the Veronese mapping of commutative
algebra.
