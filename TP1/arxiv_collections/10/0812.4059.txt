We calculate a correlation function of the Jordan-Wigner operator in a class
of free-fermion models formulated on an infinite one-dimensional lattice. We
represent this function in terms of the determinant of an integrable Fredholm
operator, convenient for analytic and numerical investigations. By using Wick's
theorem, we avoid the form-factor summation customarily used in literature for
treating similar problems.
