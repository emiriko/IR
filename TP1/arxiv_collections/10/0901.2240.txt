We present a phenomenological study of neutral gauge bosons and fermions in
an extended Standard model with SU(3)C x SU(4)L x U(1)X gauge symmetry.The
model includes gauge bosons and fermions without exotic charges and is
distinguished by the symmetry-breaking patern SU(4)L->SU(2)L x SU(2)H x U(1)AH.
This introduces an extended electroweak symmetry group SU(2)L x SU(2)H at low
energies.We recover the fermion spectra of an anomaly-free three-family 3-4-1
modelwithout exotic chargesfor U(1)X charge X = T3R+(B-L)/2.The interaction of
physical neutral gauge bosons Zprime,Z double prime and exotic fermions are
presented along with their masses and mixing angle.The electroweak constraints
from oblique corections on the model are also calculated.
