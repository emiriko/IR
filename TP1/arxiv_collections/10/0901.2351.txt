Current noise in electronic devices usually arises from uncorrelated charging
events, with individual transitions resolved only at low temperatures. However,
in 1-D nanotube-based transistors, we have observed random telegraph signal
(RTS) with unprecedented signal-to-noise ratio at room temperature. In
addition, we find evidence for cooperative multi-trap interactions that give
rise to a characteristically terminated RTS: current blockade induced by one
trap is found to fully reverse through electrostatic `passivation' by another.
Our observations are well described by a robust quantum transport model that
demonstrates how strong correlation and fast varying potentials can resolve
energetically proximal states along a 1-D channel.
