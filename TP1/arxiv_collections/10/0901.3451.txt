e analyze the excitation of Ar substrate in contact with Na clusters using a
previously developed hierarchical model for the description of the system
constituted of a highly reactive metal cluster in contact with a rather inert
substrate. Particular attention is paid to the dipole excitation of the Ar
atoms and the energy stored therein. The Na clusters are considered at
different charge states, anions, cations, and neutral clusters for the case of
deposition and a highly ionized cluster embedded in a matrix. It is found that
the dipole polarization of the Ar atoms stores the largest fraction of energy
in the case of charged clusters. Some, although smaller, polarization is also
observed for polar clusters, as Na$_6$. The effect is predominantly induced by
the electrostatic interaction.
