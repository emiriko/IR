We report on measurements on Y1-xPrxBa2Cu3O7-delta single crystals, with x
varying from 0 to 2.4%. The upper and the lower critical fields, Hc2 and Hc1,
the Ginzburg-Landau parameter and the critical current density, Jc(B), were
determined from magnetization measurements and the effective media approach
scaling method. We present the influence of Pr substitution on the pinning
force density as well as on the trapped field profiles analyzed by Hall probe
scanning.
