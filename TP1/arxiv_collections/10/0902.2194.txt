We calculate analytically grey-body factors of Schwarzschild black-holes
localized on a 3-brane of finite tension and codimension 2. We obtain explicit
expressions for various types of particles emitted in the bulk as well as on
the brane in both the low and high frequency regimes. In the latter case, we
obtain expressions which are valid for arbitrary number of extra dimensions if
the brane tension vanishes.
