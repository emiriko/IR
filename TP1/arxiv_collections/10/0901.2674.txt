We study a (k,m)-threshold controlling scheme for controlled quantum
teleportation. A standard polynomial coding over GF(p) with prime p > m-1 needs
to distribute a d-dimensional qudit with d >= p to each controller for this
purpose. We propose a scheme using m qubits (two-dimensional qudits) for the
controllers' portion, following a discussion on the benefit of a quantum
control in comparison to a classical control of a quantum teleportation.
