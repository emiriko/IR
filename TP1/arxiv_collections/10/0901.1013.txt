A proximity-effect thermometer measures the temperature dependent critical
supercurrent in a long superconductor - normal metal - superconductor (SNS)
Josephson junction. Typically, the transition from the superconducting to the
normal state is detected by monitoring the appearance of a voltage across the
junction. We describe a new approach to detect the transition based on the
temperature increase in the resistive state due to Joule heating. Our method
increases the sensitivity and is especially applicable for temperatures below
about 300 mK.
