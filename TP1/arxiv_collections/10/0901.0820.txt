We present the results of a spectroscopic survey of the recently discovered
M31 satellites And XV and And XVI, lying at projected distances from the centre
of M31 of 93 and 130 kpc respectively. These satellites lie to the South of
M31, in regions of the stellar halo which wide field imaging has revealed as
relative voids (compared to the degree-scale coherent stream-like structures).
Using the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph mounted on the Keck II
telescope, we have defined probable members of these satellites, for which we
derive radial velocities as precise as ~6 km/s down to i~21.5. While the
distance to And XVI remains the same as previously reported (525pm50 kpc), we
have demonstrated that the brightest three stars previously used to define the
tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) in And XV are in fact Galactic, and And XV
is actually likely to be much more distant at 770pm70 kpc (compared to the
previous 630 kpc), increasing the luminosity from MV -9.4 to MV~-9.8. The And
XV velocity dispersion is resolved with vr =-339+7-6 km/s and sigma-v = 11+7-5
km/s. The And XVI dispersion is not quite resolved at 1sigma with vr =-385+5-6
km/s and sigma-v = 0+10-indef km/s. Using the photometry of the confirmed
member stars, we find metallicities of And XV (median [Fe/H]=-1.58, interquar-
tile range +-0.08), and And XVI (median [Fe/H]=-2.23, interquartile range
+-0.12). Stacking the spectra of the member stars, we find spectroscopic
[Fe/H]=-1.8 (-2.1) for And XV (And XVI), with a uncertainty of ~0.2 dex in both
cases. Our measure- ments of And XV reasonably resolve its mass (~10^8 Msun)
and suggest a polar orbit, while the velocity of And XVI suggests it is
approaching the M31 escape velocity given its large M31-centric distance.
