We investigate the random dynamics of rational maps on the Riemann sphere and
the dynamics of semigroups of rational maps on the Riemann sphere. We show that
regarding random complex dynamics of polynomials, in most cases, the chaos of
the averaged system disappears, due to the cooperation of the generators. We
investigate the iteration and spectral properties of transition operators. We
show that under certain conditions, in the limit stage, "singular functions on
the complex plane" appear. In particular, we consider the functions $T$ which
represent the probability of tending to infinity with respect to the random
dynamics of polynomials. Under certain conditions these functions $T$ are
complex analogues of the devil's staircase and Lebesgue's singular functions.
More precisely, we show that these functions $T$ are continuous on the Riemann
sphere and vary only on the Julia sets of associated semigroups. Furthermore,
by using ergodic theory and potential theory, we investigate the
non-differentiability and regularity of these functions. We find many phenomena
which can hold in the random complex dynamics and the dynamics of semigroups of
rational maps, but cannot hold in the usual iteration dynamics of a single
holomorphic map. We carry out a systematic study of these phenomena and their
mechanisms.
