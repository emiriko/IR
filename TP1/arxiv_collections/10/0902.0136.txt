We present an analytical formalism, within the Effective-One-Body framework,
which predicts gravitational-wave signals from inspiralling and coalescing
black-hole binaries that agree, within numerical errors, with the results of
the currently most accurate numerical relativity simulations for several
different mass ratios. In the equal-mass case, the gravitational wave energy
flux predicted by our formalism agrees, within numerical errors, with the most
accurate numerical-relativity energy flux. We think that our formalism opens a
realistic possibility of constructing a sufficiently accurate, large bank of
gravitational wave templates, as needed both for detection and data analysis of
(non spinning) coalescing binary black holes.
