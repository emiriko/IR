MUSE, a 2nd generation VLT instrument, will become the world's largest
integral field spectrograph. It will be an AO assisted instrument which, in a
single exposure, covers the wavelength range from 465 to 930 nm with an average
resolution of 3000 over a field of view of 1'x1' with 0.2'' spatial sampling.
Both the complexity and the rate of the data are a challenge for the data
processing of this instrument.
  We will give an overview of the data processing scheme that has been designed
for MUSE. Specifically, we will use only a single resampling step from the raw
data to the reduced data product. This allows us to improve data quality,
accurately propagate variance, and minimize spreading of artifacts and
correlated noise. This approach necessitates changes to the standard way in
which reduction steps like wavelength calibration and sky subtraction are
carried out, but can be expanded to include combination of multiple exposures.
