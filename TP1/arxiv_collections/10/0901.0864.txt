We report a time resolved imaging and micromagnetic simulation study of the
relaxation dynamics of a magnetic vortex in the non-linear regime. We use
time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy and micromagnetic calculations
to examine the emergence of non-linear vortex dynamics in patterned Ni80Fe20
disks in the limit of long field pulses. We show for core shifts beyond ~20-25%
of the disk radius, the initial motion is characterized by distortions of the
vortex, a transient cross-tie wall state, and instabilities in the core
polarization that influence the core trajectories.
