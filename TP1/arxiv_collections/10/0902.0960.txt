Starting from the Strasbourg ESO Catalogue (SEC) of Planetary Nebulae (PNe),
the largest PNe compilation available with ~ 1500 objects, we undertook a
comprehensive study of the whole PN population, never carried out so far, only
using on-line catalogues and data from public imaging surveys. The study
includes the PN dynamics through their measured proper motions (PMs), the study
of their galactocentric orbits, the study of their interactions with the
interstellar medium (ISM), and the study of their UV-to-IR spectral energy
distribution (SED). As a preliminary step required to perform
cross-correlations with on-line catalogues, we first went through a systematic
reassessment of the PN coordinates (Kerber et al. 2003a).
