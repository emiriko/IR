We report on XMM-Newton and optical results for 6 cataclysmic variables that
were selected from Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra because they showed strong
HeII emission lines, indicative of being candidates for containing white dwarfs
with strong magnetic fields. While high X-ray background rates prevented
optimum results, we are able to confirm SDSSJ233325.92+152222.1 as an
intermediate polar from its strong pulse signature at 21 min and its obscured
hard X-ray spectrum. Ground-based circular polarization and photometric
observations were also able to confirm SDSSJ142256.31-022108.1 as a polar with
a period near 4 hr. Photometry of SDSSJ083751.00+383012.5 and
SDSSJ093214.82+495054.7 solidifies the orbital period of the former as 3.18 hrs
and confirms the latter as a high inclination system with deep eclipses.
