A novel group of small non-coding RNA, known as microRNA (miRNA) is predicted
to regulate as high as 90% of the coding genes in human. The diversity and
abundance of miRNA targets offer an enormous level of combinatorial
possibilities and suggest that miRNAs and their targets form a complex
regulatory network. In the present study, we analyzed 711 miRNAs and their 34,
525 predicted targets in the miRBase database which generate a complex
bipartite network having numerous numbers of genes forming the hub. Genes at
the hub (total 9877) are significantly over represented in genes with specific
molecular functions, biological processes and biological pathways as revealed
from the analysis using PANTHER. We further construct a miRNA co-target network
by linking every pair of miRNAs which co-target at least one gene. The weight
of the link, which is taken to be the number of co-targets of the pair of
miRNAs vary widely, and we could erase several links while keeping the relevant
features of the network intact. The largest connected sub-graph, thus obtained,
contains 479 miRNAs. More than 75% of the miRNAs deregulated in 15 different
diseases collected from published data are found to be in this largest sub
graph. We further analyze this sub-graph to obtain 70 small clusters containing
total 330 miRNAs of 479. We identified the biological pathways where the
co-targeted genes in the clusters are significantly over- represented in
comparison to that obtained with that are not co-targeted by the miRNAs in the
cluster. Using published data, we identified that specific clusters of miRNAs
are associated with specific diseases by altering particular pathways. We
propose that instead of single miRNA, clusters of miRNA that co-targets the
genes are important for the regulation of miRNA in diseases.
