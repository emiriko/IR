Sample-to-sample fluctuations of the time-dependent conductance of a system
with static disorder have been studied by means of diagrammatic theory and
microwave pulsed transmission measurements. The fluctuations of time-dependent
conductance are not universal, i.e., depend on sample parameters, in contrast
to the universal conductance fluctuations in the steady-state regime. The
variance of normalized conductance, determined by the infinite-range intensity
correlation C_3(t), is found to increase as a third power of delay time from an
exciting pulse, t. C_3(t) grows larger than the long-range intensity
correlation C_2(t) after a time t_q ~ <g>^{1/2} t_D (t_D being the diffusion
time, <g> being the average dimensionless conductance).
