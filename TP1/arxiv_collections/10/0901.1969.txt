We consider a neutral spinor condensate moving in a periodic magnetic field.
The spatially dependent magnetic field induces an effective spin dependent
Lorentz force which in turn gives rise to a spin dependent Hall effect.
Simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation quantify the Hall effect. We
discuss possible experimental realizations.
