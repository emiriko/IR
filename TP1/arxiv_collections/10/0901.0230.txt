We study the fate of the energy deposited by a jet in a heavy ion collision
assuming that the medium created is opaque (jets quickly lose energy) and its
viscosity is so low that the energy lost by the jet is quickly thermalized. The
expectation is that under these conditions the energy deposited gives rise to a
Mach cone. We argue that, in general, the behavior of the system is different
from the naive expectation and it depends strongly on the assumptions made
about the energy and momentum deposited by the jet into the medium. We compare
our phenomenological hydrodynamic calculations performed in a static medium for
a variety of energy-momentum sources (including a pQCD-based calculation) with
the exact strong coupling limit obtained within the AdS/CFT correspondence. We
also discuss the observability of hydrodynamical features triggered by jets in
experimentally measured two-particle correlations at RHIC.
