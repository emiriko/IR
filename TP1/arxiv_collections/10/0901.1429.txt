We show in this paper that thermopower is enhanced in non-Abelian quantum
Hall liquids under appropriate conditions. This is because thermopower measures
entropy per electron in the clean limit, while the degeneracy and entropy
associated with non-Abelian quasiparticles enhance entropy when they are
present. Thus thermopower can potentially probe non-Abelian nature of the
quasiparticles, and measure their quantum dimension.
