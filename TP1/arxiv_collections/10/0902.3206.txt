We analyze theoretically Josephson oscillations in a mixture of two Zeeman
states of a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential. We find
that in the strongly polarized case, the less populated component exhibits a
complex dynamics with an anti-Josephson behavior, i.e. oscillates in phase with
the more populated one. In the balanced population case the Josephson
oscillations unveal a dependence with the different spin collision channels.
This effect could be used to experimentally measure the distinct scattering
lengths entering in the description of a spinor condensate. Our numerical
results are in close agreement with an analytical description of the binary
mixture using a two mode model.
