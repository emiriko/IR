We continue the investigation of a CME-driven coronal dimming from December
14 2006 using unique high resolution imaging of the chromosphere and corona
from the Hinode spacecraft. Over the course of the dimming event we observe the
dynamic increase of non-thermal line broadening of multiple emission lines as
the CME is released and the corona opens; reaching levels seen in coronal
holes. As the corona begins to close, refill and brighten, we see a reduction
of the non-thermal broadening towards the pre-eruption level. The dynamic
evolution of non-thermal broadening is consistent with the expected change of
Alfven wave amplitudes in the magnetically open rarefied dimming region,
compared to the dense closed corona prior to the CME. The presented data
reinforce the belief that coronal dimmings must be temporary sources of the
fast solar wind. It is unclear if such a rapid transition in the thermodynamics
of the corona to a solar wind state has an effect on the CME itself.
