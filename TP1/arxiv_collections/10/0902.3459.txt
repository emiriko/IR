Based on a suite of Monte Carlo simulations, I show that a stellar-mass
dependent lifetime of the gas disks from which planets form can explain the
lack of hot Jupiters/close-in giant planets around high-mass stars and other
key features of the observed semimajor axis distribution of radial
velocity-detected giant planets. Using reasonable parameters for the Type II
migration rate, regions of planet formation, and timescales for gas giant core
formation, I construct synthetic distributions of jovian planets. A planet
formation/migration model assuming a stellar mass-dependent gas disk lifetime
reproduces key features in the observed distribution by preferentially
stranding planets around high-mass stars at large semimajor axes.
