Nonlinear transport properties of the two-dimensional Wigner solid of surface
electrons on superfluid helium are studied for alternating current conditions.
For time-averaged quantities like Fourier coefficients, the field-velocity
characteristics are shown to be qualitatively different as compared to that
found in the DC theory. For a spatially uniform current we found a general
solution for the field-velocity relationship which appears to be strongly
dependent on the current frequency. If the current frequency is much lower than
the ripplon damping parameter, the Bragg-Cherenkov resonances which appear at
high enough drift velocities acquire a distinctive saw-tooth shape with long
right-side tails independent of small damping. For current frequencies which
are close or higher than the ripplon damping coefficient, the interference of
ripplons excited at different time intervals results in a new oscillatory (in
drift velocity) regime of Bragg-Cherenkov scattering.
