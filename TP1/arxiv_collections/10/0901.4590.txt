We investigated the ferroelectric domain wall propagation in epitaxial
Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 thin films over a wide temperature range (3 - 300 K). We measured
the domain wall velocity under various electric fields and found that the
velocity data is strongly nonlinear with electric fields, especially at low
temperature. We found that, as one of surface growth problems, our domain wall
velocity data from ferroelectric epitaxial film could be classified into the
creep, depinning, and flow regimes due to competition between disorder and
elasticity. The measured values of velocity and dynamical exponents indicate
that the ferroelectric domain walls in the epitaxial films are fractal and
pinned by a disorder-induced local field.
