We study a model of a light-induced proton pump in artificial reaction
centers. The model contains a molecular triad with four electron states (i.e.,
one donor state, two photosensitive group states, and one acceptor state) as
well as a molecular shuttle having one electron and one proton-binding sites.
The shuttle diffuses between the sides of the membrane and translocates protons
energetically uphill: from the negative side to the positive side of the
membrane, harnessing for this purpose the energy of the
electron-charge-separation produced by light. Using methods of quantum
transport theory we calculate the range of light intensity and transmembrane
potentials that maximize both the light-induced proton current and the energy
transduction efficiency. We also study the effect of temperature on proton
pumping. The light-induced proton pump in our model gives a quantum yield of
proton translocation of about 55 %. Thus, our results explain previous
experiments on these artificial photosynthetic reaction centers.
