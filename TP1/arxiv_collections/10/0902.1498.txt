In-medium Yukawa theory is part of the thermodynamics of the Standard Model
of particle physics and is one of the main building blocks of most effective
field theories of fermionic systems. By computing its pressure we investigate
the nonperturbative thermodynamics at finite temperature and density using the
optimized perturbation theory (OPT) framework. Our calculations are valid for
arbitrary fermion and scalar masses, temperature, chemical potential, and not
restricted to weak coupling. The model is considered in the presence as well as
in the absence of condensates. Comparison with nonperturbative results shows
that second order perturbation theory (PT) fails in the first case but performs
rather well when condensates are absent, even at high-temperature regimes.
