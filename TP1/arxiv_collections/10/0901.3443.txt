More than 40 years ago, neutrinos where conceived as a way to test the
validity of the solar models which tell us that stars are powered by nuclear
fusion reactions. The first measurement of the neutrino flux, in 1968 in the
Homestake mine in South Dakota, detected only one third of the expected value,
originating what has been known as the Solar Neutrino Problem. Different
experiments were built in order to understand the origin of this discrepancy.
Now we know that neutrinos undergo oscillation phenomenon changing their nature
traveling from the core of the Sun to our detectors. In the work the 40 year
long saga of the neutrino detection is presented; from the first proposals to
test the solar models to last real time measurements of the low energy part of
the neutrino spectrum.
