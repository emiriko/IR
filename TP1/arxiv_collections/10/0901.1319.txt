We introduce the concept of generalized concatenated quantum codes. This
generalized concatenation method provides a systematical way for constructing
good quantum codes, both stabilizer codes and nonadditive codes. Using this
method, we construct families of new single-error-correcting nonadditive
quantum codes, in both binary and nonbinary cases, which not only outperform
any stabilizer codes for finite block length, but also asymptotically achieve
the quantum Hamming bound for large block length.
