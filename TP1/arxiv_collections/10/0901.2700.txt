In this paper the regularity of optimal transportation potentials defined on
round spheres is investigated. Specifically, this research generalises the
calculations done by Loeper, where he showed that the strong (A3) condition of
Trudinger and Wang is satisfied on the round sphere, when the cost-function is
the geodesic distance squared. In order to generalise Loeper's calculation to a
broader class of cost-functions, the (A3) condition is reformulated via a
stereographic projection that maps charts of the sphere into Euclidean space.
This reformulation subsequently allows one to verify the (A3) condition for any
case where the cost-fuction of the associated optimal transportation problem
can be expressed as a function of the geodesic distance between points on a
round sphere. With this, several examples of such cost-functions are then
analysed to see whether or not they satisfy this (A3) condition.
