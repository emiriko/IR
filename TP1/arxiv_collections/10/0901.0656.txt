Coupling between two singing wineglasses was obtained and investigated.
Rubbing the rim of one wineglass produce a tone and due to the coupling induces
oscillations on the other wineglasses. The needed coupling strength between the
wineglasses to induce oscillations as a function of the detuning was
investigated.
