In this supporting information we briefly describe the torque-speed
measurement procedure. We show the hook spring compliance used in the
simulations. We analyze the distribution functions of the moving and waiting
time intervals. We study the dependence of the torque plateau region on the
stator jumping rate and the cutoff angle, and the robustness of the results
against different rotor-stator- potential and load-rotor forces.
