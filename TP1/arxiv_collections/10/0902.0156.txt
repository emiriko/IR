We present a method to measure the resonance transitions between the
gravitationally bound quantum states of neutrons in the GRANIT spectrometer.
The purpose of GRANIT is to improve the accuracy of measurement of the quantum
states parameters by several orders of magnitude, taking advantage of long
storage of Ultracold neutrons at specula trajectories. The transitions could be
excited using a periodic spatial variation of a magnetic field gradient. If the
frequency of such a perturbation (in the frame of a moving neutron) coincides
with a resonance frequency defined by the energy difference of two quantum
states, the transition probability will sharply increase. The GRANIT experiment
is motivated by searches for short-range interactions (in particular
spin-dependent interactions), by studying the interaction of a quantum system
with a gravitational field, by searches for extensions of the Standard model,
by the unique possibility to check the equivalence principle for an object in a
quantum state and by studying various quantum optics phenomena.
