We present our initial study of the electromagnetic splittings of charged and
neutral mesons, and the violation of Dashen's theorem. Hadron masses are
calculated on MILC N_f=2+1 QCD ensembles at lattice spacing \approx 0.15fm,
together with quenched non-compact U(1) configurations. The O(a^2) tadpole
improved staggered quark (asqtad) action is used both for the sea quarks and
for six different valence quark masses. Chiral extrapolations are performed
using partially quenched chiral perturbation theory incorporating
electromagnetic corrections.
