Work has been on-going for the development of the required code for full
polarisation processing of VLBI data using some new antennae mounts. The
extensions of AIPS allows the support of two new mount types; the left-handed
and right-handed Nasmyth antennae (Pico Veleta in the GMVA and Yebes-40m in the
EVN) and the EW-mount (Hobart in the LBA). The data handling process is
seamless, once the correct mount type has been selected. All subsequent calls
to the parallactic angle subroutine PARANG will return the feed angles for Left
or Right Nasmyth or EW-mount. These are required, respectively, for Pico
Veleta, Yebes-40m (low frequency branch) and Hobart.
