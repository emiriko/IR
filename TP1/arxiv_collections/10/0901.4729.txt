We construct entanglement witnesses with regard to the geometric structure of
the Hilbert--Schmidt space and investigate the geometry of entanglement. In
particular, for a two--parameter family of two--qutrit states that are part of
the magic simplex we calculate the Hilbert--Schmidt measure of entanglement. We
present a method to detect bound entanglement which is illustrated for a
three--parameter family of states. In this way we discover new regions of bound
entangled states. Furthermore we outline how to use our method to distinguish
entangled from separable states.
