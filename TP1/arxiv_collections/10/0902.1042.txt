A new class of languages of infinite words is introduced, called the
max-regular languages, extending the class of $\omega$-regular languages. The
class has two equivalent descriptions: in terms of automata (a type of
deterministic counter automaton), and in terms of logic (weak monadic
second-order logic with a bounding quantifier). Effective translations between
the logic and automata are given.
