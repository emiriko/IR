We theoretically study chaos synchronization of two lasers which are
delay-coupled via an active or a passive relay. While the lasers are
synchronized, their dynamics is identical to a single laser with delayed
feedback for a passive relay and identical to two delay-coupled lasers for an
active relay. Depending on the coupling parameters the system exhibits
bubbling, i.e., noise-induced desynchronization, or on-off intermittency. We
associate the desynchronization dynamics in the coherence collapse and low
frequency fluctuation regimes with the transverse instability of some of the
compound cavity's antimodes. Finally, we demonstrate how, by using an active
relay, bubbling can be suppressed.
