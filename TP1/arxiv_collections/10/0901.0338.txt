We study the conductance through finite Aharonov-Bohm rings of interacting
electrons weakly coupled to non-interacting leads at two arbitrary sites. This
model can describe an array of quantum dots with a large charging energy
compared to the interdot overlap. As a consequence of the spin-charge
separation, which occurs in these highly correlated systems, the transmittance
is shown to present pronounced dips for particular values of the magnetic flux
piercing the ring. We analyze this effect by numerical and analytical means and
show that the zero-temperature equilibrium conductance in fact presents these
striking features which could be observed experimentally.
