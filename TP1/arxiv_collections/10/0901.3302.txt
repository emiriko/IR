We discuss a 3-flavour lattice QCD action with clover improvement in which
the fermion matrix has single level stout smearing for the hopping terms
together with unsmeared links for the clover term. With the (tree-level)
Symanzik improved gluon action this constitutes the Stout Link Non-perturbative
Clover or SLiNC action. To cancel O(a) terms the clover term coefficient has to
be tuned. We present here results of a non-perturbative determination of this
coefficient using the Schroedinger functional and as a by-product a
determination of the critical hopping parameter. Comparisons of the results are
made with lowest order perturbation theory.
