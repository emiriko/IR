A collection of pairwise mutually unbiased bases (in short: MUB) in d>1
dimensions may consist of at most d+1 bases. Such "complete" collections are
known to exists in C^d when d is a power of a prime. However, in general little
is known about the maximal number N(d) of bases that a collection of MUBs in
C^d can have.
  In this work it is proved that a collection of d MUBs in C^d can be always
completed. Hence N(d) cannot be d and when d>1 we have a dichotomy: either
N(d)=d+1 (so that there exists a complete collection of MUBs), or N(d)\leq d-1.
In the course of the proof an interesting new characterization is given for a
linear subspace of M_d(C) to be a subalgebra.
