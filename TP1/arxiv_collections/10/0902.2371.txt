The application of quadrupole-devices with high field gradients and small
apertures requires precise control over higher order multipole field
components. We present a new scheme for performance control and tuning, which
allows the illumination of most of the quadrupole-device aperture because of
the reduction of higher order field components. Consequently, the size of the
aperture can be minimized to match the beam size achieving field gradients of
up to 500 T/m at good imaging quality. The characterization method based on a
Hall probe measurement and a Fourier analysis was confirmed using the high
quality electron beam at the Mainz Microtron MAMI.
