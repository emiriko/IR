As outflow activity in low mass protostars is strongly connected to ac-
cretion it is reasonable to expect accreting brown dwarfs to also be driving
out- flows. In the last three years we have searched for brown dwarf outflows
using high quality optical spectra obtained with UVES on the VLT and the
technique of spectro-astrometry. To date five brown dwarf outflows have been
discovered. Here the method is discussed and the results to date outlined.
