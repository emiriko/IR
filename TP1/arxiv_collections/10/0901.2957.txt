We present the quantitative interpretation for the glass-like behavior of
thermal conductivities $\kappa(T)$ for type-I clathrate compounds involving
off-centered guest ions. It is shown that the dipole-dipole interaction
generated in cage/guest-ion systems is crucial to reproduce the characteristics
of thermal conductivities for these symmetry-broken clathrates. The above
scenario also explains well the difference of $\kappa(T)$ between the $p$-type
and the $n$-type $\beta$-BGS found recently by K. Suekuni et al. [Phys. Rev. B,
77 (2008) 235119.]
