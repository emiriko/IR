The geometry of Quantum Mechanics in the context of uncertainty and
complementarity, and probability is explored. We extend the discussion of
geometry of uncertainty relations in wider perspective. Also, we discuss the
geometry of probability in Quantum Mechanics and its interpretations. We give
yet another interpretation to the notion of Faraday lines and loops as the
locus of probability flow. Also, the possibilities of visualization of spectra
of area operators by means of classical geometric forms and conventional
Quantum Mechanics are explored.
