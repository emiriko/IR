We report the first (to our knowledge) experimental demonstration of lensless
ghost imaging with true thermal light. Although there is no magnification, the
method is suitable for all wavelengths and so may find special applications in
cases where it is not possible to use lenses, such as with x-rays or
gamma-rays. We also show numerically that some magnification may be realized
away from the focal plane, but the image will always be somewhat blurred.
