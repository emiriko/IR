We report on the detection of the secondary eclipse of the very-hot Jupiter
OGLE-TR-56b from combined z-band time series photometry obtained with the VLT
and Magellan telescopes. We measure a flux decrement of 0.0363+/-0.0091 percent
from the combined Magellan and VLT datasets, which indicates a blackbody
brightness temperature of 2718 (+127/-107) K, a very low albedo, and a small
incident radiation redistribution factor, indicating a lack of strong winds in
the planet's atmosphere. The measured secondary depth is consistent with
thermal emission, but our precision is not sufficient to distinguish between a
black-body emitting planet, or emission as predicted by models with strong
optical absorbers such as TiO/VO. This is the first time that thermal emission
from an extrasolar planet is detected at optical wavelengths and with
ground-based telescopes.
