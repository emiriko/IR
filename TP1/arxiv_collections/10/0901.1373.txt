The existence of a light S=+1 baryon resonance follows from Quantum Field
Theory applied to baryons. This is illustrated in the Skyrme model (where
Theta+ exists but is too strong) and in a new mean field approach where Theta+
arises as a consequence of three known resonances: Lambda(1405), N(1440) and
N(1535).
