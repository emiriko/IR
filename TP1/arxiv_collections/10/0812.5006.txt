We investigate theoretically the spin states in InAs/AlSb/GaSb broken-gap
quantum wells by solving the Kane model and the Poisson equation
self-consistently. The spin states in InAs/AlSb/GaSb quantum wells are quite
different from those obtained by the single-band Rashba model due to the
electron-hole hybridization. The Rashba spin-splitting of the lowest conduction
subband shows an oscillating behavior. The D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation
time shows several peaks with increasing the Fermi wavevector. By inserting an
AlSb barrier between the InAs and GaSb layers, the hybridization can be greatly
reduced. Consequently, the spin orientation, the spin splitting, and the
D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation time can be tuned significantly by changing
the thickness of the AlSb barrier.
