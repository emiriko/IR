We consider a PDE system comprising compressible hydrodynamics, flux-limited
diffusion radiation transport and chemical ionization kinetics in a
cosmologically-expanding universe. Under an operator-split framework, the
cosmological hydrodynamics equations are solved through the Piecewise Parabolic
Method, as implemented in the Enzo community hydrodynamics code. The remainder
of the model, including radiation transport, chemical ionization kinetics, and
gas energy feedback, form a stiff coupled PDE system, which we solve using a
fully-implicit inexact Newton approach, and which forms the crux of this paper.
The inner linear Newton systems are solved using a Schur complement
formulation, and employ a multigrid-preconditioned conjugate gradient solver
for the inner Schur systems. We describe this approach and provide results on a
suite of test problems, demonstrating its accuracy, robustness, and scalability
to very large problems.
