I use the recently proposed framework of ontological models [Harrigan et al.,
arXiv:0709.1149v2] to obtain economical models for results of tomographically
complete sets of measurements on finite-dimensional quantum systems. I describe
a procedure that simplifies the models by decreasing the number of necessary
ontic states, and present an explicit model with just 33 ontic states for a
qutrit.
