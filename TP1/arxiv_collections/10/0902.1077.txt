In practically all known till now methods of nuclear chronometry there were
usually taken into account the life-times of only fundamental states of
$\alpha$-radioactive nuclei. But in the processes of nuclear synthesis in stars
and under the influence of the constant cosmic radiation on surfaces of planets
the excitations of the $\alpha$-radioactive nuclei are going on. Between them
there are the states with the excited $\alpha$-particles inside the parent
nuclei and so with much smaller life-times. And inside the large masses of
stellar, terrestrial and meteoric substances the transitions between different
internal conditions of radioactive nuclei are accompanied by infinite chains of
the $\gamma$-radiations with the subsequent $\gamma$-absorptions, the further
$\gamma$-radiations etc. For the description of the $\alpha$-decay evolution
with considering of such excited states and multiple $\gamma$-radiations and
$\gamma$-absorptions inside stars and under the influence of the cosmic
radiation on the earth surface we present the quantum-mechanical approach,
which is based on the generalized Krylov-Fock theorem.
  Some simple estimations are also presented. They bring to the conclusion that
the usual (non-corrected) "nuclear clocks" do really indicate not to realistic
values but to the \emph{upper limits} of the durations of the $\alpha$-decay
stellar and planet processes.
