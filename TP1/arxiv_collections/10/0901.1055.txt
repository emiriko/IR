The role of binary progenitors of neutron stars in the apparent distribution
of space velocities and spin-velocity alignment observed in young pulsars is
studied. A Monte-Carlo synthesis of pulsar population from single and binary
stars with different assumptions about the NS natal kick model (direction
distribution, amplitude, and kick reduction in binary progenitors which
experienced mass exchange due to Roche lobe overflow with initial masses on the
main sequence from the range 8-11 $M_\odot$) is performed. The calculated
spin-velocity alignment distributions are compared with observational data
obtained from radio polarization measurements. The observed space velocity of
pulsars is found to be mostly shaped by the natal kick velocity form and its
amplitude; the fraction of binaries is not important here for reasonably large
kicks. The distribution of kick direction relative to the spin axis during the
formation of a NS is found to affect strongly the spin-velocity correlation of
pulsars. Comparison with observed pulsar spin-velocity angles favours a
sizeable fraction of binary progenitors and the kick-spin angle $\sim
5-20^\circ$. The form of the initial binary mass ratio distribution does not
affect our results.
