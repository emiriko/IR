Most professional golfers and analysts think that winning on the PGA Tour
peaks when golfers are in their thirties. Rather than relying on educated
guesses, we can actually use available statistical data to determine the actual
ages at which golfers peak their golf game. We can also test the hypothesis
that age affects winning professional golf tournaments. Using data available
from the Golf Channel, the PGA Tour, and LPGA Tour, I calculated and provided
the mean, the median, and the mode ages at which professional golfers on the
PGA, European PGA, Champions, and LPGA Tours had won over a five-year period.
More specifically, the ages at which golfers on the PGA, European PGA,
Champions Tour, and LPGA Tours peak their wins are 35, 30, 52, and 25,
respectively. The regression analyses I conducted seem to support my hypothesis
that age affects winning professional golf tournaments.
