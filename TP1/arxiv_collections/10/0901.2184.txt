In this letter, we have considered that the universe is filled with normal
matter and variable modified Chaplygin gas. Also we have considered the
interaction between normal matter and variable modified Chaplygin gas in FRW
universe. Then we have considered a correspondence between the holographic dark
energy density and interacting variable modified Chaplygin gas energy density.
Then we have reconstructed the potential of the scalar field which describes
the variable modified Chaplygin cosmology.
