In this paper the acoustic field propagating in the early hot ($p=\epsilon/$)
universe of arbitrary space curvature ($K=0, \pm 1$) is considered. The field
equations are reduced to the d'Alembert equation in an auxiliary static
Roberson-Walker space-time. Symbolic computation in {\em Mathematica} is
applied.
