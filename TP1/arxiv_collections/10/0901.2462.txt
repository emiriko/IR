Using the recently published model \cite{Gossiaux:2008jv,goss2} for the
collisional energy loss of heavy quarks in a Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP), based on
perturbative QCD (pQCD), we study the centrality dependence of $R_{AA}$ and
$R_{AA}(p_T^{min})$, %= \frac{dN_{AA}/dp_T}{<N_{binary}> dN_{pp}/dp_T}$
measured by the Phenix collaboration, and compare our model with other
approaches based on pQCD and on Anti de Sitter/ Conformal Field Theory
(AdS/CFT)
