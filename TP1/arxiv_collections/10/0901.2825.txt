Research on friendship networks in schools suggests that heterogeneity
increases homophily preferences. We argue that this may be a misleading
interpretation of the coefficients of the exponential random graph models (p*)
that are used to model the network data. If students wish to avoid having no
friends at all, then minority students may appear to be willing to integrate
more with the majority in a more homogeneous school, even if the preference for
having same ethnicity friends has the same strength in all schools. We use a
random utility model of network formation to study in computational experiments
the effects of the preferences that drive network choices. We generate
simulated networks for different school compositions but with the same
parameter for a preference for homophily. We estimate with a p* model on these
simulated data the coefficients for the effect of same ethnicity on (simulated)
friendship choice. The tests confirm that p* coefficients for the effect of
same ethnicity are much larger in populations with a large minority, although
actual homophily preferences are the same across all simulated school
compositions.
