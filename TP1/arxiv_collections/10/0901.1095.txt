This work introduces FAIR, a novel framework for Fuzzy-based Aggregation
providing In-network Resilience for Wireless Sensor Networks. FAIR addresses
the possibility of malicious aggregator nodes manipulating data. It provides
data-integrity based on a trust level of the WSN response and it tolerates link
or node failures. Compared to available solutions, it offers a general
aggregation model and makes the trust level visible to the querier. We classify
the proposed approach as complementary to protocols ensuring resilience against
sensor leaf nodes providing faulty data. Thanks to our flexible resilient
framework and due to the use of Fuzzy Inference Schemes, we achieve promising
results within a short design cycle.
