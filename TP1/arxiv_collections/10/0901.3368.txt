We add an initial nonhomogeneous perturbation to an otherwise homogeneous
condensing tachyon background and compute its space time energy-momentum tensor
from worldsheet string theory. We show that in the far future the
energy-momentum tensor corresponds to nonhomogeneous pressureless tachyon
matter.
