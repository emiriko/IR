We describe the geometry of foams squeezed between two solid plates (2D GG
foams) in two main asymptotic regimes: fully dry floor tiles and dry pancakes.
We predict an abrupt transition between both regimes, with a substantial change
in the Plateau border radius. This should be observable in different types of
experiments on such 2D GG foams: when foam is being progressively dried or
wetted, when it is being squeezed further or stretched, when it coarsens
through film breakage or Oswald ripening.
