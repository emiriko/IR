We report on the status of the Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave
Observatory (LIGO) and the plans and progress towards Enhanced and Advanced
LIGO. The initial LIGO detectors have finished a two year long data run during
which a full year of triple-coincidence data was collected at design
sensitivity. Much of this run was also coincident with the data runs of
interferometers in Europe, GEO600 and Virgo. The joint analysis of data from
this international network of detectors is ongoing. No gravitational wave
signals have been detected in analyses completed to date. Currently two of the
LIGO detectors are being upgraded to increase their sensitivity in a program
called Enhanced LIGO. The Enhanced LIGO detectors will start another roughly
one year long data run with increased sensitivity in 2009. In parallel,
construction of Advanced LIGO, a major upgrade to LIGO, has begun. Installation
and commissioning of Advanced LIGO hardware at the LIGO sites will commence at
the end of the Enhanced LIGO data run in 2011. When fully commissioned, the
Advanced LIGO detectors will be ten times as sensitive as the initial LIGO
detectors. Advanced LIGO is expected to make several gravitational wave
detections per year.
