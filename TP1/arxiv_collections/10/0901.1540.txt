We propose a QCD motivated theoretical approach to high energy soft
interactions, which successfully describes the experimental data on total,
elastic and diffraction cross sections. We predict that the survival
probability for the diffractive Higgs production at the LHC energy is small
(less than 1%), and investigate the influence of suggested corrections e.g.
threshhold effects and semi-enhanced diagrams, on this value.
