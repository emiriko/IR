Previous theoretical work has speculated about the existence of
double-diffusive magnetic buoyancy instabilities of a dynamically evolving
horizontal magnetic layer generated by the interaction of forced vertically
sheared velocity and a background vertical magnetic field. Here we confirm
numerically that if the ratio of the magnetic to thermal diffusivities is
sufficiently low then such instabilities can indeed exist, even for high
Richardson number shear flows. Magnetic buoyancy may therefore occur via this
mechanism for parameters that are likely to be relevant to the solar
tachocline, where regular magnetic buoyancy instabilities are unlikely.
