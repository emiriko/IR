Self-doping in graphene has been studied by examining single-layer
epitaxially grown graphene samples with differing characteristic lateral
terrace widths. Low energy electron microscopy was used to gain real-space
information about the graphene surface morphology, which was compared with data
obtained by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to study the effect of
the monolayer graphene terrace width on the low energy dispersions. By altering
the graphene terrace width, we report significant changes in the electronic
structure and quasiparticle relaxation time of the material, in addition to a
terrace width-dependent doping effect.
