Molecular-scale components are expected to be central to nanoscale electronic
devices. While molecular-scale switching has been reported in atomic quantum
point contacts, single-molecule junctions provide the additional flexibility of
tuning the on/off conductance states through molecular design. Thus far,
switching in single-molecule junctions has been attributed to changes in the
conformation or charge state of the molecule. Here, we demonstrate reversible
binary switching in a single-molecule junction by mechanical control of the
metal-molecule contact geometry. We show that 4,4'-bipyridine-gold
single-molecule junctions can be reversibly switched between two conductance
states through repeated junction elongation and compression. Using
first-principles calculations, we attribute the different measured conductance
states to distinct contact geometries at the flexible but stable N-Au bond:
conductance is low when the N-Au bond is perpendicular to the conducting
pi-system, and high otherwise. This switching mechanism, inherent to the
pyridine-gold link, could form the basis of a new class of
mechanically-activated single-molecule switches.
