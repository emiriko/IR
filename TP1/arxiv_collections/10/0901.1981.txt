The two-photon decay widths of scalar mesons \sigma(600), f_0(980) and
a_0(980) are calculated in framework of the local Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. The
contributions of the quark loops (Hartree-Fock approximation) and the meson
loops (next 1/N_c-approximation where N_c is the number of colors) are taken
into account. These contributions, as we show, are the values of the same order
of magnitude. For the f_0 decay the K-loop contribution turns out to play the
dominant role. The results are in satisfactory agreement with modern
experimental data.
