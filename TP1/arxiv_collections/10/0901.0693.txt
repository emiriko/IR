In this paper, we present our analysis of mid-rapidity non-photonic electron
(NPE) production at pT >0.2GeV/c in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200
GeV. The dataset is about 78M TOF-triggered events taken from RHIC year 2008
runs. Through the measurement of e/\pi ratio, we find that the photonic
background electrons from gamma conversions are reduced by about a factor of 10
compared with those in STAR previous runs due to the absence of inner tracking
detectors and the supporting materials. The dramatic increase of
signal-to-background ratio will allow us to improve the precision on extracting
the charm cross-section via its semi-leptonic decays to electrons.
