Assuming that time exists, a new, effective formulation of gravity is
introduced, which lies in between the Wheeler-DeWitt approach and ordinary QFT.
Remarkably, the Penrose-Hawking singularity of usual Friedman-Robertson-Walker
cosmologies is naturally avoided there. The theory is made explicit via
specific examples, and compared with loop quantum cosmology. It is argued that
it is the regularization of the classical Hamiltonian performed in this last
theory what avoid the singularity, rather than quantum effects as in our case.
