Nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) models are thought to be viable tools for
investigating the structure, dynamics and evolution of the coronae of solar
active regions. In a series of NLFFF modeling studies, we have found that NLFFF
models are successful in application to analytic test cases, and relatively
successful when applied to numerically constructed Sun-like test cases, but
they are less successful in application to real solar data. Different NLFFF
models have been found to have markedly different field line configurations and
to provide widely varying estimates of the magnetic free energy in the coronal
volume, when applied to solar data. NLFFF models require consistent, force-free
vector magnetic boundary data. However, vector magnetogram observations
sampling the photosphere, which is dynamic and contains significant Lorentz and
buoyancy forces, do not satisfy this requirement, thus creating several major
problems for force-free coronal modeling efforts. In this article, we discuss
NLFFF modeling of NOAA Active Region 10953 using Hinode/SOT-SP, Hinode/XRT,
STEREO/SECCHI-EUVI, and SOHO/MDI observations, and in the process illustrate
the three such issues we judge to be critical to the success of NLFFF modeling:
(1) vector magnetic field data covering larger areas are needed so that more
electric currents associated with the full active regions of interest are
measured, (2) the modeling algorithms need a way to accommodate the various
uncertainties in the boundary data, and (3) a more realistic physical model is
needed to approximate the photosphere-to-corona interface in order to better
transform the forced photospheric magnetograms into adequate approximations of
nearly force-free fields at the base of the corona. We make recommendations for
future modeling efforts to overcome these as yet unsolved problems.
