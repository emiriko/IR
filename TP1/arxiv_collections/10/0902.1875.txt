Let F be a non-archimedean local field, of characteristic 0. Let V be a
finite dimensional vector space over F and q be a non-degenerate quadratic form
on V. Denote d the dimension of V and G=SO(d) the special orthogonal group of
(V,q). Let v_{0}\in V such that q(v_{0})\not=0, denote W the subspace of V
orthogonal to v_{0} and H=SO(d-1) the special orthogonal group of W. Let \pi,
resp. \sigma, an admissible irreducible representation of G(F), resp. H(F).
Denote m(\sigma,\pi) the dimension of the complex space Hom_{H(F)}(\pi_{|
H(F)},\sigma). By a theorem of Aizenbud, Gourevitch, Rallis and Schiffmann, we
know that m(\sigma,\pi)=0 or 1. We define another term m_{geom}(\sigma,\pi).
It's an explicit sum of integrals of functions that can be deduced from the
characters of \sigma and \pi. Assume that \pi is supercuspidal. Then we prove
the equality m(\sigma,\pi)=m_{geom}(\sigma,\pi). Now, let \Pi, resp. \Sigma, an
L-packet of tempered representations of G(F), resp. H(F). We use the
sophisticated notion of L-paquet due to Vogan: the representations in the
packets can be representations of inner forms of G(F), resp. H(F). We assume
that certain conjectural properties of tempered L-packets are true. Assume that
all elements of \Pi are supercuspidal. Then our integral formula implies the
weak form of the Gross-Prasad conjecture: there exist a unique pair
\sigma\times \pi\in \Sigma\times \Pi such that m(\sigma,\pi)=1.
