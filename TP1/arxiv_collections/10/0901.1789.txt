We present the first results of the expected variations of the molecular line
emission arising from material recently affected by C-shocks (shock
precursors). Our parametric model of the structure of C-shocks has been coupled
with a radiative transfer code to calculate the molecular excitation and line
profiles of shock tracers such as SiO, and of ion and neutral molecules such as
H13CO+ and HN13C, as the shock propagates through the unperturbed medium. Our
results show that the SiO emission arising from the early stage of the magnetic
precursor typically has very narrow line profiles slightly shifted in velocity
with respect to the ambient cloud. This narrow emission is generated in the
region where the bulk of the ion fluid has already slipped to larger velocities
in the precursor as observed toward the young L1448-mm outflow. This strongly
suggests that the detection of narrow SiO emission and of an ion enhancement in
young shocks, is produced by the magnetic precursor of C-shocks. In addition,
our model shows that the different velocity components observed toward this
outflow can be explained by the coexistence of different shocks at different
evolutionary stages, within the same beam of the single-dish observations.
