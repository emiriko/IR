We present magnetic field dependence of the critical current density from
dc-magnetization measurements concerning the anisotropic behavior of flux line
lattice (FLL) in a single crystal of YNi_2B_2C. The peak effect (PE) phenomenon
is observed for all crystallographic orientations, but the second magnetization
peak (SMP) anomaly is observed only for H//a. Our study reveals that the FLL
obtained when H//[100] is better ordered within the basal plane. However, the
FLL for H// c is found to be even more ordered than that for H//[110]. The
perfect square symmetry of the FLL for H//c is perhaps responsible for
promoting the realization of the best spatial order of the FLL prior to the
onset of PE, indicating a correlation between the crystalline lattice and the
FLL. We have also found a change over in the power law governing the decay of
the critical current density which is identified as a crossover from weak to
weaker pinning regime in the phase diagram.
