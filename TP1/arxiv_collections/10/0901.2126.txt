We model and evaluate the Peltier and Seebeck effects in magnetic multilayer
nanostructures by a finite-element theory of thermoelectric properties. We
present analytical expressions for the thermopower and the current-induced
temperature changes due to Peltier cooling/heating. The thermopower of a
magnetic element is in general spin-polarized, leading to spin-heat coupling
effects. Thermoelectric effects in spin valves depend on the relative alignment
of the magnetization directions and are sensitive to spin-flip scattering as
well as inelastic collisions in the normal metal spacer.
