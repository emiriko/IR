Recalling the similarities between the Maxwell equations for a transverse
electric wave in a stratified medium and the quantum mechanical Schroedinger
equation in a piece-wise potential, we investigate the analog of the so called
particle limit in quantum mechanics. It is shown that in this limit the
resonance phenomena are lost since individual reflection and transmission terms
no longer overlap. The result is a stationary zebra-like response with the
intensity in each stripe calculable.
