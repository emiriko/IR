We derive a general expression for the Hankel determinants of a Dirichlet
series F(s) and derive the asymptotic behavior for the special case that F(s)
is the Riemann zeta function. In this case the Hankel determinant is a discrete
analogue of the Selberg integral and can be viewed as a matrix integral with
discrete measure. We briefly comment on its relation to Plancherel measures.
