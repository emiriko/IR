We study the dynamics of billiard models with a modified collision rule: the
outgoing angle from a collision is a uniform contraction, by a factor lambda,
of the incident angle. These pinball billiards interpolate between a
one-dimensional map when lambda=0 and the classical Hamiltonian case of elastic
collisions when lambda=1. For all lambda<1, the dynamics is dissipative, and
thus gives rise to attractors, which may be periodic or chaotic. Motivated by
recent rigorous results of Markarian, Pujals and Sambarino, we numerically
investigate and characterise the bifurcations of the resulting attractors as
the contraction parameter is varied. Some billiards exhibit only periodic
attractors, some only chaotic attractors, and others have coexistence of the
two types.
