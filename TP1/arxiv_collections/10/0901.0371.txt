Using a traveling-wave OPA with two orthogonally oriented type-I BBO crystals
pumped by picosecond pulses, we generate vertically and horizontally polarized
squeezed vacuum states within a broad range of wavelengths and angles.
Depending on the phase between these states, fluctuations in one or another
Stokes parameters are suppressed below the shot-noise limit. Due to the large
number of photon pairs produced, no local oscillator is required, and 3dB
squeezing is observed by means of direct detection.
