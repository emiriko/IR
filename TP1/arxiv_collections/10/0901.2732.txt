The problem of the surface current excitation in a conductive targets by a
relativistic electron electric field as the origin of such radiation mechanisms
as diffraction and transition radiation of relativistic electron was considered
in frame of both surface current and pseudo-photon methods. The contradiction
between these viewpoints in respect to the surface current on the target
downstream surface necessitated the experimental test of this phenomenon. The
test performed on electron beam of the 6 MeV microtron showed, that not any
surface current is induced on the target downstream surface under the influence
of a relativistic electron electromagnetic field in contrast to the upstream
surface. This is important implication for the understanding of the forward
transition and diffraction radiation nature.
