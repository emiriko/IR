The upgrade problems faced by Free and Open Source Software distributions
have characteristics not easily found elsewhere. We describe the structure of
packages and their role in the upgrade process. We show that state of the art
package managers have shortcomings inhibiting their ability to cope with
frequent upgrade failures. We survey current countermeasures to such failures,
argue that they are not satisfactory, and sketch alternative solutions.
