We consider Aharonov - Bohm effect at normal metal-inhomogeneous LOFF
superconducting state transition. It is shown that magnetic flux can increase
the transition temperature and AB oscillations can have the double-peak
structure at one period. Expressions for fuctuational heat capacity and
persistent current are calculated for a thin ring and a cylinder. We also
discuss the effect of fluctuations interaction in the nonuniform states in the
vicinity of the superconducting transition.
