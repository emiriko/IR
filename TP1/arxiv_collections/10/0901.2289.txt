The physics of interacting nuclear spins arranged in a crystalline lattice is
typically described using a thermodynamic framework: a variety of experimental
studies in bulk solid-state systems have proven the concept of a spin
temperature to be not only correct but also vital for the understanding of
experimental observations. Using demagnetization experiments we demonstrate
that the mesoscopic nuclear spin ensemble of a quantum dot (QD) can in general
not be described by a spin temperature. We associate the observed deviations
from a thermal spin state with the presence of strong quadrupolar interactions
within the QD that cause significant anharmonicity in the spectrum of the
nuclear spins. Strain-induced, inhomogeneous quadrupolar shifts also lead to a
complete suppression of angular momentum exchange between the nuclear spin
ensemble and its environment, resulting in nuclear spin relaxation times
exceeding an hour. Remarkably, the position dependent axes of quadrupolar
interactions render magnetic field sweeps inherently non-adiabatic, thereby
causing an irreversible loss of nuclear spin polarization.
