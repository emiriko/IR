We report 2D time-dependent non-linear magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of
waves in the atmospheres of roAp stars. We explore a grid of simulations in a
wide parameter space. The aim of our study is to understand the influence of
the atmosphere and the magnetic field on the propagation and reflection
properties of magneto-acoustic waves, formation of shocks and node layers.
