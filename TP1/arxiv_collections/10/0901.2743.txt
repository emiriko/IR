We report the discovery of a trend of increasing barium abundance with
decreasing age for a large sample of Galactic open clusters. The observed
pattern of [Ba/Fe] vs. age can be reproduced with a Galactic chemical evolution
model only assuming a higher Ba yield from the $s$-process in low-mass stars
than the average one suggested by parametrized models of neutron-capture
nucleosynthesis. We show that this is possible in a scenario where the
efficiency of the extra-mixing processes producing the neutron source $^{13}$C
is anti-correlated with the initial mass, with a larger efficiency for lower
masses. This is similar to the known trend of extended mixing episodes acting
in H-rich layers and might suggest a common physical mechanism.
