In many organic molecules the strong coupling of excess charges to
vibrational modes leads to the formation of polarons, i.e., a localized state
of a charge carrier and a molecular deformation. Incoherent hopping of polarons
along the molecule is the dominant mechanism of transport at room temperature.
We study the far-from-equilibrium situation where, due to the applied bias, the
induced number of charge carriers on the molecule is high enough such that
charge correlations become relevant. We develop a diagrammatic theory that
exactly accounts for all many-particle correlations functions for incoherent
transport through a finite system. We compute the transport properties of short
sequences of DNA by expanding the diagrammatic theory up to second order in the
hopping parameters. The correlations qualitatively modify the I-V
characteristics as compared to those approaches where correlations are dealt
with in a mean-field type approximation only.
