Thanks to their wavelength diversity and to their excellent uniformity,
Quantum Well Infrared Photodetectors (QWIP) emerge as potential candidates for
astronomical or defense applications in the very long wavelength infrared
(VLWIR) spectral domain. However, these applications deal with very low
backgrounds and are very stringent on dark current requirements. In this paper,
we present the full electro-optical characterization of a 15 micrometer QWIP,
with emphasis on the dark current measurements. Data exhibit striking features,
such as a plateau regime in the IV curves at low temperature (4 to 25 K). We
show that present theories fail to describe this phenomenon and establish the
need for a fully microscopic approach.
