We consider a single-component gas of dipolar bosons confined in a
one-dimensional optical lattice, where the dipoles are aligned such that the
long-ranged dipolar interactions are maximally repulsive. In the limit of zero
inter-site hopping and sufficiently large on-site interaction, the phase
diagram is a complete devil's staircase for filling fractions between 0 and 1,
wherein every commensurate state at a rational filling is stable over a finite
interval in chemical potential. We perturb away from this limit in two
experimentally motivated directions involving the addition of hopping and a
reduction of the onsite interaction. The addition of hopping alone yields a
phase diagram, which we compute in perturbation theory in the hopping, where
the commensurate Mott phases now compete with the superfluid. Further softening
of the onsite interaction yields alternative commensurate states with double
occupancies which can form a staircase of their own, as well as one-dimensional
"supersolids" which simultaneously exhibit discrete broken symmetries and
superfluidity.
