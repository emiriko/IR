In this paper we present an analysis of the magnetic toroidal moment and its
relation to the various structural modes in R3c-distorted perovskites with
magnetic cations on either the perovskite A or B site. We evaluate the toroidal
moment in the limit of localized magnetic moments and show that the full
magnetic symmetry can be taken into account by considering small induced
magnetic moments on the oxygen sites. Our results give a transparent picture of
the possible coupling between magnetization, electric polarization, and
toroidal moment, thereby highlighting the different roles played by the various
structural distortions in multiferroic BiFeO_3 and in the recently discussed
isostructural material FeTiO_3, which has been predicted to exhibit electric
field-induced magnetization switching.
