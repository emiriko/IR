Aggregation of stiff polyelectrolytes in solution and angle- and
distance-dependent potential of mean force between two like-charged rods are
studied in the presence of 3-valent salt using molecular dynamics simulations.
In the bulk solution, formation of long-lived metastable structures with
similarities to the raft-like structures of actin filaments is observed within
a range of salt concentration. The system finally goes to a state with lower
free energy in which finite-sized bundles of parallel polyelectrolytes form.
Preferred angle and interaction type between two like-charged rods at different
separations and salt concentrations are also studied, which shed some light on
the formation of orientationally ordered structures.
