We report a systematic experimental study of mesoscopic conductance
fluctuations in superconductor/normal/superconductor (SNS) devices
Nb/InAs-nanowire/Nb. These fluctuations far exceed their value in the normal
state and strongly depend on temperature even in the low-temperature regime.
This dependence is attributed to high sensitivity of perfectly conducting
channels to dephasing and the SNS fluctuations thus provide a sensitive probe
of dephasing in a regime where normal transport fails to detect it. Further,
the conductance fluctuations are strongly non-linear in bias voltage and reveal
sub-gap structure. The experimental findings are qualitatively explained in
terms of multiple Andreev reflections in chaotic quantum dots with imperfect
contacts.
