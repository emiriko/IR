There is a constraining relation between the reliability of a quantum
measurement and the extent to which the measurement process is, in principle,
reversible. The greater the information that is gained, the less reversible the
measurement dynamics become. To illustrate this relation, we develop a simple
physical model for quantum measurement, as well as a hypothetical scheme by
which the experimenters can determine the reliability and reversibility. We
derive an "uncertainty" (constraining) relation between reliability and
reversibility, which holds even when there is no interaction with any external
environment other than the fundamental information recording device.
