Using Co-L_(2,3) and O-K x-ray absorption spectroscopy, we reveal that the
charge ordering in La_(1.5)Sr_(0.5)CoO4 involves high spin (S=3/2) Co^2+ and
low spin (S=0) Co^3+ ions. This provides evidence for the spin blockade
phenomenon as a source for the extremely insulating nature of the
La_(2-x)Sr_(x)CoO4 series. The associated e_g^2 and e_g^0 orbital occupation
accounts for the large contrast in the Co-O bond lengths, and in turn, the high
charge ordering temperature. Yet, the low magnetic ordering temperature is
naturally explained by the presence of the non-magnetic (S=0) Co^3+ ions. From
the identification of the bands we infer that La_(1.5)Sr_(0.5)CoO4 is a narrow
band material.
