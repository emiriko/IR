We demonstrate the existence of a novel superconducting state in high quality
two-component MgB2 single crystalline superconductors where a unique
combination of both type-1 (kappa_1 < 0.707) and type-2 (kappa_2 > 0.707)
superconductor conditions is realized for the two components of the order
parameter. This condition leads to a vortex-vortex interaction attractive at
long distances and repulsive at short distances, which stabilizes
unconventional stripe- and gossamer-like vortex patterns that we have
visualized in this type-1.5 superconductor using Bitter decoration and also
reproduced in numerical simulations.
