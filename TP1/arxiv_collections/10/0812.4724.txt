The recombination model as a model for hadronization from a quark-gluon
plasma has been recently revived since it has advantages in explaining several
important features of the final state produced in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC,
such as the constituent quark number scaling of the elliptic coefficient versus
the transverse energy of identified hadrons, the bending shape of the $p_T$
spectrum of hadrons near 5 GeV/c, and the measured large value of baryon to
meson ratio(of the order of unity) in the same $p_T$ range. We have developed a
dynamic simulation model of heavy-ion collisions in which a quark-gluon plasma,
starting from a certain initial condition, evolves hydrodynamically until it
reaches the phase boundary, and then hadronizes by valence quark recombination.
Rescattering after hadronization is described by UrQMD. We discuss some details
of the model and report first, preliminary results.
