Recently, Dufour et al. (2007) reported the unexpected discovery that a few
white dwarfs found in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey had an atmosphere dominated
by carbon with little or no trace of hydrogen and helium. Here we present a
progress report on these new objects based on new high signal-to-noise
follow-up spectroscopic observations obtained at the 6.5m MMT telescope on
Mount Hopkins, Arizona.
