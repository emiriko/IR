We prove that any complete hyperbolic 3--manifold with finitely generated
fundamental group, with a single topological end, and which embeds into $\BS^3$
is the geometric limit of a sequence of hyperbolic knot complements in $\BS^3$.
In particular, we derive the existence of hyperbolic knot complements which
contain balls of arbitrarily large radius. We also show that a complete
hyperbolic 3--manifold with two convex cocompact ends cannot be a geometric
limit of knot complements in $\BS^3$.
