We study first and second order theories of relativistic diffusion coupled to
hydrodynamics under the approximation, valid at mid-rapidity in the RHIC and
LHC, that conserved number densities are much smaller than the entropy density.
We identify experimentally accessible quantities of interest, and show that the
first and second order theories may lead to radically different evolutions of
these quantities. In the first order theory the memory of the initial state is
almost completely washed out, whereas in the second order theory it is possible
that freezeout occurs at a time when transient dynamics is still on, and the
memory of the initial state remains. There are observational consequences which
we touch upon. In the first order theory, and for initial conditions when the
second order theory mimics the first order, one may be able to put a bound on
the diffusion constant.
