The upgrade of the CEBAF Accelerator at Jefferson Lab to 12 GeV will deliver
high luminosity and high quality beams, which will open unique opportunities
for studies of the quark and gluon structure of hadrons in the valence region.
Such physics will be made accessible by substantial additions to the
experimental equipment in combination with the increased energy reach of the
upgraded machine. The emphasis of the talk will be on the program in a new
experimental Hall D designed to search for gluonic excitations.
