We propose a novel mechanism of cell motility, which relies on the coupling
of actin polymerization at the cell membrane to geometric confinement. We
consider a polymerizing viscoelastic cytoskeletal gel confined in a narrow
channel, and show analytically that spontaneous motion occurs. Interestingly,
this does not require specific adhesion with the channel walls, and yields
velocities potentially larger than the polymerization velocity. The contractile
activity of myosin motors is not necessary to trigger motility in this
mechanism, but is shown quantitatively to increase the velocity. Our model
qualitatively accounts for recent experiments which show that cells without
specific adhesion proteins are motile only in confined environments while they
are unable to move on a flat surface, and could help in understanding the
mechanisms of cell migration in more complex confined geometries such as living
tissues.
