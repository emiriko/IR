Perfect synchronicity in $N$-player games is a useful theoretical dream, but
communication delays are inevitable and may result in asynchronous
interactions. Some systems such as financial markets are asynchronous by
design, and yet most theoretical models assume perfectly synchronized actions.
We propose a general method to transform standard models of adaptive agents
into asynchronous systems while preserving their global structure under some
conditions. Using the Minority Game as an example, we find that the phase and
fluctuations structure of the standard game subsists even in maximally
asynchronous deterministic case, but that it disappears if too much
stochasticity is added to the temporal structure of interaction. Allowing for
heterogeneous communication speeds and activity patterns gives rise to a new
information ecology that we study in details.
