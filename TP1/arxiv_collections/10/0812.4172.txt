Various phonemes are considered in terms of nonlinear dynamics. Phase
portraits of the signals in the embedded space, correlation dimension estimate
and the largest Lyapunov exponent are analyzed. It is shown that the speech
signals have comparatively small dimension and the positive largest Lyapunov
exponent
