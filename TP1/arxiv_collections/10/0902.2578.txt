We study the single and double lepton polarization asymmetries in the
semileptonic $B$ meson decays $B \to K_1 (1270) \ell^+ \ell^-$ $\ell \equiv e$,
$\mu$, $\tau$), where the strange $P$-wave meson, $K_1(1270)$, is the mixtures
of the $K_{1A}$ and $K_{1B}$, which are the $1^3P_1$ and $1^1P_1$ states,
respectively. The lepton polarization asymmetries show relatively strong
dependency in the various region of dileptonic invariant mass. The lepton
polarization asymmetries can also be used for determining the
$K_1(1270)$--$K_1(1400)$ mixing angle, $\theta_{K_1}$ and new physics effects.
Furthermore, it is shown that these asymmetries in $B\to K_1(1270)\ell^+\ell^-$
decay compared with those of $B\to K^*\ell^+\ell^-$ decay are more sensitive to
the dileptonic invariant mass.
