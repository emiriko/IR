We evaluate the information capacities of a lossy bosonic channel with
correlated noise. The model generalizes the one recently discussed in [Phys.
Rev. A 77, 052324 (2008)], where memory effects come from the interaction with
correlated environments. Environmental correlations are quantified by a
multimode squeezing parameter, which vanishes in the memoryless limit. We show
that a global encoding/decoding scheme, which involves input entangled states
among different channel uses, is always preferable with respect to a local one
in the presence of memory. Moreover, in a certain range of the parameters, we
provide an analytical expression for the classical capacity of the channel
showing that a global encoding/decoding scheme allows to attain it. All the
results can be applied to a broad class of bosonic Gaussian channels.
