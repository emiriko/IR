We present OGLE-III Photometric Maps of the Small Magellanic Cloud. They
contain precise, calibrated VI photometry of about 6.2 million stars from 41
OGLE-III fields in the SMC observed regularly in the years 2001-2008 and
covering about 14 square degrees in the sky. Also precise astrometry of these
objects is provided. One of the fields, SMC140, is centered on the 47 Tucanae
Galactic globular cluster providing unique data on this object. We discuss
quality of the data and present a few color-magnitude diagrams of the observed
fields. All photometric data are available to the astronomical community from
the OGLE Internet archive.
