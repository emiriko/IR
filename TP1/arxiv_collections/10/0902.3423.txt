We consider reaction-diffusion equations of KPP type in one spatial
dimension, perturbed by a Fisher-Wright white noise, under the assumption of
uniqueness in distribution. Examples include the randomly perturbed Fisher-KPP
equations $ \partial_t u = \partial_x^2 u + u(1-u) + \epsilon \sqrt{u(1-u)}\dot
W, $ and $ \partial_t u = \partial_x^2 u + u(1-u) + \epsilon \sqrt{u}\dot W, $
where $\dot W= \dot W(t,x)$ is a space-time white noise.
  We prove the Brunet-Derrida conjecture that the speed of traveling fronts is
asymptotically $ 2-\pi^2 |\log \epsilon^2|^{-2} $ up to a factor of order $
(\log|\log\epsilon|)|\log\epsilon|^{-3}$.
