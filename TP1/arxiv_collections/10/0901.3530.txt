We study experimental signatures of the Ising nematic quantum phase
transition in d-wave superconductors, associated with the change of lattice
symmetry from tetragonal to orthorhombic in the superconducting state. The
characteristic feature of this transition is that the ratio between the Fermi
velocity $v_F$ and gap velocity $v_\Delta$ flows to a maximally anisotropic
fixed point, i.e. the renormalization group fixed point is situated at
(v_\Delta/v_F)^*=0$. Our main point is that the logarithmic approach to this
fixed point has visible signatures in the thermal transport. The analysis of
the quasiparticle contribution to the thermal transport is carried out in the
framework of a kinetic approach, which shows that the thermal conductivity is
enhanced near the nematic critical point. Another aspect of our study is the
interplay of dilute disorder and electronic interactions in the measured
thermal transport coefficients.
