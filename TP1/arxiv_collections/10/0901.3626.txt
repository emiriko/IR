The inability to produce two perfect copies of an unknown state is inherently
linked with the inability to produce maximal entanglement between multiple
spins. Despite this, there is no quantitative link between how much
entanglement can be generated between spins (known as monogamy), and how well
an unknown state can be cloned. This situation is remedied by giving a set of
sufficient conditions such that the optimal Completely Positive map can be
implemented as a teleportation operation into a standard, reference, state. The
case of arbitrary 1 to N asymmetric cloning of d-dimensional spins can then be
solved exactly, yielding the concept of `singlet monogamy'. The utility of this
relation is demonstrated by calculating properties of Heisenberg systems, and
contrasting them with the results from standard monogamy arguments.
