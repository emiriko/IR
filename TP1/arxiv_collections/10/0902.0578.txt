Azimuthal asymmetries in unpolarized SIDIS can be used to probe the
transverse momentum of the quarks inside the nucleon. Furthermore they give
access to the so-far unmeasured Boer-Mulders function. We report on the
extraction of these asymmetries from the COMPASS data taken with a 160 GeV/c
$\mu ^+$ beam impinging on a deuteron target. This asymmetries have been
extracted separately for positive and negative hadrons, and the results have
been compared with theoretical predictions.
