A Monte-Carlo approach to solving a stochastic jump transition model for
active-region energy (Wheatland and Glukhov, Astrophys. J. 494, 1998;
Wheatland, Astrophys. J. 679, 2008) is described. The new method numerically
solves the stochastic differential equation describing the model, rather than
the equivalent master equation. This has the advantages of allowing more
efficient numerical solution, the modelling of time-dependent situations, and
investigation of details of event statistics. The Monte-Carlo approach is
illustrated by application to a Gaussian test case, and to the class of
flare-like models presented in Wheatland (2008), which are steady-state models
with constant rates of energy supply, and power-law distributed jump transition
rates. These models have two free parameters: an index ($\delta $), which
defines the dependence of the jump transition rates on active-region energy,
and a non-dimensional ratio ($\overline{r})$ of total flaring rate to rate of
energy supply. For $\overline{r}\ll 1$ the non-dimensional mean energy
$<\overline{E}>$ of the active-region satisfies $<\overline{E}> \gg 1$,
resulting in a power-law distribution of flare events over many decades in
energy. The Monte-Carlo method is used to explore the behavior of the
waiting-time distributions for the flare-like models. The models with
$\delta\neq 0$ are found to have waiting times which depart significantly from
simple Poisson behavior when $<\overline{E}> \gg 1$. The original model from
Wheatland and Glukhov (1998), with $\delta=0$ (no dependence of transition
rates on active-region energy), is identified as being most consistent with
observed flare statistics.
