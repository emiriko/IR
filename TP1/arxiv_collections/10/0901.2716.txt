We report on the design and testing of an array of Penning ion traps made
from printed circuit board. The system enables fast shuttling of ions from one
trapping zone to another, which could be of use in quantum information
processing. We describe simulations carried out to determine the optimal
potentials to be applied to the trap electrodes for enabling this movement. The
results of a preliminary experiment with a cloud of laser cooled calcium ions
demonstrate a round-trip shuttling efficiency of up to 75%.
