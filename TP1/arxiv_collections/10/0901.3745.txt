By the mid-1980s, measurements of the nucleon form factors had reached a
stage where only slow, incremental progress was possible using unpolarized
electron scattering. The development of high quality polarized beams, polarized
targets, and recoil polarimeters led to a renaissance in the experimental
program. I provide an overview of the changes in the field in the last ten
years, which were driven by the dramatically improved data made possible by a
new family of tools to measure polarization observables.
