This paper analyses non-regular $|2|$-graded geometries, and show that they
share many of the properties of regular geometries -- the existence of a unique
normal Cartan connection encoding the structure, the harmonic curvature as
obstruction to flatness of the geometry, the existence of the first two BGG
splitting operators and of (in most cases) invariant prolongations for the
standard Tractor bundle $\mc{T}$. Finally, it investigates whether these
geometries are determined entirely by the distribution $H = T_{-1}$ and
concludes that this is generically the case, up to a finite choice, whenever
$H^1(\mf{g}^1,\mf{g})$ vanishes in non-negative homogeneity.
