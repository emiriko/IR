We present a comprehensive study of chiral fluctuations in the reference
helimagnet MnSi by polarized neutron scattering and Neutron Spin Echo
spectroscopy, which reveals the existence of a completely left-handed and
dynamically disordered phase. This phase may be identified as a spontaneous
skyrmion phase: it appears in a limited temperature range just above the
helical transition Tc and coexists with the helical phase at Tc.
