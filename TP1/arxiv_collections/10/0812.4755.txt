"Development of biomechanical response corridors of the thorax to blunt
ballistic impacts" (Bir, C., Viano, D., King, A., 2004, Journal of Biomechanics
37, 73-79.) contains apparent measurement errors. Areas under several force vs.
time (Fig. 2) and force vs. deflection curves (Fig.4) differ significantly from
the momentum and kinetic energy changes, respectively. These differences
violate Newton's second law and the work-energy theorem.
