We report the discovery of WASP-6b, an inflated sub-Jupiter mass planet
transiting every 3.3610060 +0.0000022-0.0000035 days a mildly metal-poor
solar-type star of magnitude V=11.9. A combined analysis of the WASP
photometry, high-precision followup transit photometry and radial velocities
yield a planetary mass M_p = 0.503 +0.019-0.038 M_jup and radius R_p = 1.224
+0.051-0.052 R_jup, resulting in a density rho_p = 0.27 +-0.05 rho_jup. The
mass and radius for the host star are M_s = 0.88 +0.05-0.08 M_sun and R_s =
0.870 +0.025-0.036 R_sun. The non-zero orbital eccentricity e = 0.054
+0.018-0.015 that we measure suggests that the planet underwent a massive tidal
heating ~1 Gyr ago that could have contributed to its inflated radius.
High-precision radial velocities obtained during a transit allow us to measure
a sky-projected angle between the stellar spin and orbital axis Beta = 11
+14-18 deg. In addition to similar published measurements, this result favors a
dominant migration mechanism based on tidal interactions with a protoplanetary
disk.
