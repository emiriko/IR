We study the separability of permutationally symmetric quantum states. We
show that for bipartite symmetric systems most of the relevant entanglement
criteria coincide. However, we provide a method to generate examples of bound
entangled states in symmetric systems, for the bipartite and the multipartite
case. These states shed some new light on the nature of bound entanglement.
