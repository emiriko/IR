We have studied the Nernst coefficient, v(T), of epitaxial thin films of the
superconductor Y1-xCaxBa2Cu3Oy with x =0.05 and x = 0.1. The x = 0.1 sample has
been measured at three different values of y, in the over- (OV), optimally-
(OP), and under-doped (UD) states. As the doping level is reduced, v(T) starts
to fall linearly with T at the temperature (T*) where we expect to see the
influence of the pseudogap. The onset temperature of the superconducting
fluctuation contribution to v(T) was found to vary slowly with the hole
concentration (p) between p = 0.118 and 0.197. For the OP and UD samples,
v(T>T*) is unusually large, being comparable with |S tan(Theta)| where S is the
Seebeck coefficient and Theta the Hall angle.
