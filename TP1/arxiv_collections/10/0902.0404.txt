Brownian dynamics simulations were carried out to study wave spectra of
two-dimensional dusty plasma liquids and solids for a wide range of
wavelengths. The existence of a longitudinal dust thermal mode was confirmed in
simulations, and a cutoff wavenumber in the transverse mode was measured.
Dispersion relations, resulting from simulations, were compared with those from
analytical theories, such as the random-phase approximation (RPA),
quasi-localized charged approximation (QLCA), and harmonic approximation (HA).
An overall good agreement between the QLCA and simulations was found for wide
ranges of states and wavelengths after taking into account the direct thermal
effect in the QLCA, while for the RPA and HA good agreement with simulations
were found in the high and low temperature limits, respectively.
