In this article, we review the prospects for the Fermi satellite (formerly
known as GLAST) to detect gamma rays from dark matter annihilations in the
Central Region of the Milky Way, in particular on the light of the recent
astrophysical observations and discoveries of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov
Telescopes. While the existence of significant backgrounds in this part of the
sky limits Fermi's discovery potential to some degree, this can be mitigated by
exploiting the peculiar energy spectrum and angular distribution of the dark
matter annihilation signal relative to those of astrophysical backgrounds.
