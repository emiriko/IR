In this work we propose techniques for efficient reachability analysis of the
state space (e.g., detection of bad states) using a combination of partial
order and symmetry based reductions in a distributed setting. The proposed
techniques are focused towards explicit state space enumeration based
model-checkers like SPIN. We consider variants for both depth-first as well as
breadth-first based generation of the reduced state graphs on-the-fly.
