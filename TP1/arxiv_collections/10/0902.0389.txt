Color centers in diamond nanocrystals are a new class of fluorescence markers
that attract significant interest due to matchless brightness, photostability
and biochemical inertness. Fluorescing diamond nanocrystals containing defects
can be used as markers replacing conventional organic dye molecules, quantum
dots or autofluorescent proteins. They can be applied for tracking and
ultrahigh-resolution localization of the single markers. In addition the spin
properties of diamond defects can be utilized for novel magneto-optical imaging
(MOI) with nanometer resolution. We develop this technique to unravel the
details of the rotary motions and the elastic energy storage mechanism of a
single biological nanomotor FoF1-ATP synthase. FoF1-ATP synthase is the enzyme
that provides the 'chemical energy currency' adenosine triphosphate, ATP, for
living cells. The formation of ATP is accomplished by a stepwise internal
rotation of subunits within the enzyme. Previously subunit rotation has been
monitored by single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and
was limited by the photostability of the fluorophores. Fluorescent nanodiamonds
advance these FRET measurements to long time scales.
