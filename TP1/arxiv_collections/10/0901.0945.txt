The consequence of energy conservation in the flat
Friedmannn-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology is a strictly positive accelerating
expansion. A mechanism is proposed for this expansion due to the effect of the
attractive (negative) gravitational potential of matter as it is being included
within the expanding horizon, and the offsetting work of metric expansion,
which takes place at sub-luminal speed. In our semi-classical treatment, we
deal with a quintic as the equation for the scale parameter. Implications for
modeling the earliest parts of the primordial expansion are discussed.
