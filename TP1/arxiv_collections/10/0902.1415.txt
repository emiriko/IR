Both components of the transverse polarization of electrons emitted in the
beta-decay of polarized, free neutrons have been measured. The T-odd, P-odd
correlation coefficient quantifying the component perpendicular to the decay
plane defined by neutron polarization and electron momentum, was found to be
R=0.008 +/- 0.015 +/-0.005. This value is consistent with time reversal
invariance, and significantly improves limits on the relative strength of
imaginary scalar couplings in the weak interaction. The value obtained for the
correlation coefficient associated with the electron polarization component
contained within the decay plane N=0.056 +/- 0.011 +/- 0.005, agrees with the
Standard Model expectation, providing an important sensitivity test of the
experimental setup.
