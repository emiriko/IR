We present an alternate interpretation of recent STEREO/STE observations that
were originally attributed to energetic neutral atoms (ENA) from the
heliosheath. The signal attributed to the diffuse ENA source instead shows the
characteristics of a point source. We point out that the peak intensity seen by
STEREO/STE is centered at the ecliptic longitude of the bright X-ray source Sco
X-1. The observed energy spectrum and intensity are also consistent with the
X-rays from Sco X-1. The problem of energy dissipation at the solar wind
termination shock remains unsolved while current understanding of the
interaction between the solar wind and interstellar wind awaits future
observations.
