In models where there is a global chiral symmetry which spontaneously breaks
to its vectorial subgroup, the introduction of an explicit symmetry breaking
perturbation will define the true vacuum of the theory. This true vacuum is
found via the minimization of the expectation value of the perturbing
hamiltonian between different vacua as prescribed by Dashen. The procedure of
finding the correct vacuum of the theory may result in the spontaneous breaking
of CP symmetry even if one initially demands CP invariance on the perturbation.
In this work we study in detail models where the perturbation is provided by
four-Fermi operators. We present exact treatment for models with two fermion
flavors and study the three flavor case in depth numerically. We show that
after Dashen procedure is applied the solutions for the true vacuum fall in
three classes with different CP breaking patterns. Critical transitions is
possible between these classes as one varies the parameters of the
perturbation. We rigorously show that at these transitions a pseudo-Goldstone
boson mass vanishes. We also advocate, and substantiate with numerical
statistical analysis for various types of models, that if one imposes CP
invariance on the perturbation before solving the vacuum alignment, the
resulting vacuum structure will have a sizable probability for a light
pseudo-Goldstone boson mass. That is a statistical variant of Peccei-Quinn
mechanism can be speculated to operate.
