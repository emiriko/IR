We study Nielsen equivalence classes of generating pairs of Kleinian groups
and HNN-extensions. We establish the following facts: - Hyperbolic 2-bridge
knot groups have infinitely many Nielsen classes of generating pairs. - For any
natural number N there is a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold whose fundamental
group has N distinct Nielsen classes of generating pairs. - Two pairs of
elements of a fundamental group of an HNN-extension are Nielsen equivalent iff
they are so for the obvious reasons.
