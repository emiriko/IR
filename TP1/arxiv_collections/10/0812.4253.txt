We propose a protocol for creating entanglement within a dissipative circuit
QED network architecture that consists of two electromagnetic circuits
(cavities) and two superconducting qubits. The system interacts with a quantum
environment, giving rise to decoherence and dissipation. We discuss the
preparation of two separate entangled cavity-qubit states via Landau-Zener
sweeps, after which the cavities interact via a tunable "quantum switch" which
is realized with an ancilla qubit. Moreover, we discuss the decay of the
resulting entangled two-cavity state due to the influence of the environment,
where we focus on the entanglement decay.
