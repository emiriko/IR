We study the response functions (chromo-electric susceptibilities) for an
interacting quark-gluon plasma. The interaction effects have been encoded in
the effective fugacities for quasi-partons which are extracted
self-consistently from the two equations of state for hot QCD. The first one is
the fully perturbative $O(g^5)$ EOS and, the second one which is
$O(g^6\ln(1/g))$, incorporates some non-perturbative effects. We find that
response function shows large deviations from the ideal behavior. We further
determine the temperature dependence of the Debye mass by fixing the effective
coupling constant $Q^2$ which appears in the transport equation. We show that
our formalism naturally yields the leading order HTL expression for the Debye
mass if we employ the ideal EOS. Employing the Debye mass, we estimate the
dissociation temperatures for various charmonium and bottomonium bound states.
These results are consistent with the current theoretical studies.
