We present a simple model where a scalar field is responsible for cosmic
inflation and generates the seed for structure formation, while its thermal
relic abundance explains dark matter in the universe. The inflaton
self-coupling also explains the observed neutrino masses. All the virtues can
be attained in a minimal extension of the Standard Model gauge group around the
TeV scale. We can also unveil these properties in the forthcoming ground based
experiments.
