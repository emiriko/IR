Any cluster-tilted algebra is the relation extension of a tilted algebra. We
present a method to, given the distribution of a cluster-tilting object in the
Auslander-Reiten quiver of the cluster category, construct all tilted algebras
whose relation extension is the endomorphism ring of this cluster-tilting
object.
