An approximate perturbed direct homotopy reduction method is proposed and
applied to two perturbed modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equations with
fourth order dispersion and second order dissipation. The similarity reduction
equations are derived to arbitrary orders. The method is valid not only for
single soliton solution but also for the Painlev\'e II waves and periodic waves
expressed by Jacobi elliptic functions for both fourth order dispersion and
second order dissipation. The method is valid also for strong perturbations.
