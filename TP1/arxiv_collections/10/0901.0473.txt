The NEMO 3 experiment is devoted to the search for neutrinoless double beta
decay, as well as for accurate measurement of two-neutrino double beta decay.
The detector has been taking data in the LSM laboratory since 2003 and the
latest NEMO 3 results for seven double beta decay isotopes are presented here
for both decay modes. The SuperNEMO project aims to extend the NEMO technique
to a 100-200 kg isotope experiment with the target half-life sensitivity of 1-2
x 10^26 y. The current status of the SuperNEMO R&D programme is described.
