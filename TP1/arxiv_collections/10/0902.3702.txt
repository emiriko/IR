We use the abundance and weak lensing mass measurements of the SDSS maxBCG
cluster catalog to simultaneously constrain cosmology and the richness--mass
relation of the clusters. Assuming a flat \LambdaCDM cosmology, we find
\sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.25)^{0.41} = 0.832\pm 0.033 after marginalization over all
systematics. In common with previous studies, our error budget is dominated by
systematic uncertainties, the primary two being the absolute mass scale of the
weak lensing masses of the maxBCG clusters, and uncertainty in the scatter of
the richness--mass relation. Our constraints are fully consistent with the WMAP
five-year data, and in a joint analysis we find \sigma_8=0.807\pm 0.020 and
\Omega_m=0.265\pm 0.016, an improvement of nearly a factor of two relative to
WMAP5 alone. Our results are also in excellent agreement with and comparable in
precision to the latest cosmological constraints from X-ray cluster abundances.
The remarkable consistency among these results demonstrates that cluster
abundance constraints are not only tight but also robust, and highlight the
power of optically-selected cluster samples to produce precision constraints on
cosmological parameters.
