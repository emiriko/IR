We analyze Auslander-Reiten components for the bounded derived category of a
finite-dimensional algebra. We classify derived categories whose
Auslander-Reiten quiver has either a finite stable component or a stable
component with finite Dynkin tree class or a bounded stable component. Their
Auslander-Reiten quiver is determined. We also determine components that
contain shift periodic complexes.
