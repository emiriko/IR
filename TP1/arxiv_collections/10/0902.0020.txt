The SO(5)>SO(3) spherical harmonics form a natural basis for expansion of
nuclear collective model angular wave functions. They underlie the
recently-proposed algebraic method for diagonalization of the nuclear
collective model Hamiltonian in an SU(1,1)xSO(5) basis. We present a computer
code for explicit construction of the SO(5)>SO(3) spherical harmonics and use
them to compute the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients needed for collective model
calculations in an SO(3)-coupled basis. With these Clebsch-Gordan coefficients
it becomes possible to compute the matrix elements of collective model
observables by purely algebraic methods.
