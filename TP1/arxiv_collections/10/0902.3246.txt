We propose a model in which supersymmetric weak scale dark matter is charged
under a U(1)_d dark gauge symmetry. Kinetic mixing between U(1)_d and
hypercharge generates the appropriate hierarchy of scales needed to explain
PAMELA and ATIC with a GeV scale force carrier and DAMA (or INTEGRAL) using the
proposals of inelastic (or, respectively, exciting) dark matter. Because of the
extreme simplicity of this setup, observational constraints lead to unambiguous
determination of the model parameters. In particular, the DAMA scattering cross
section is directly related to the size of the hypercharge D-term vacuum
expectation value. The known relic abundance of DM can be used to fix the ratio
of the dark sector coupling to the dark matter mass. Finally, the recent
observation of cosmic ray positron and electron excesses can be used to fix the
mass of the dark matter through the observation of a shoulder in the spectrum
and the size of the kinetic mixing by fitting to the rate. These parameters can
be used to make further predictions, which can be checked at future direct
detection, indirect detection, as well as collider experiments.
