Recently, conceptually new physics beyond the Standard Model has been
proposed by Georgi, where a new physics sector becomes conformal and provides
"unparticle" which couples to the Standard Model sector through higher
dimensional operators in low energy effective theory. Among several
possibilities, we focus on operators involving the (scalar) unparticle, Higgs
and the gauge bosons. Once the Higgs develops the vacuum expectation value
(VEV), the conformal symmetry is broken and as a result, the mixing between the
unparticle and the Higgs boson emerges. In this paper, we consider a natural
realization of bosonic seesaw in the context of unparticle physics. In this
framework, the negative mass squared or the electroweak symmetry breaking
vacuum is achieved as a result of mass matrix diagonalization. In the
diagonalization process, it is important to have zero value in the
(1,1)-element of the mass matrix. In fact, the conformal invariance in the
hidden sector can actually assure the zero of that element. So, the bosonic
seesaw mechanism for the electroweak symmetry breaking can naturally be
understood in the framework of unparticle physics.
