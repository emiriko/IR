We report an experimental refinement of the local charge density at the Si
(111) 7x7 surface utilizing a combination of x-ray and high energy electron
diffraction. By perturbing about a bond-centered pseudoatom model, we find
experimentally that the adatoms are in an anti-bonding state with the atoms
directly below. We are also able to experimentally refine a charge transfer of
0.26(4) e- from each adatom site to the underlying layers. These results are
compared with a full-potential all-electron density functional DFT calculation.
