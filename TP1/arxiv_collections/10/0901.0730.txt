We present spectroscopic evidence for infall motion of gas in the natal cloud
core harboring an extremely young low-mass protostar GF9-2. We previously
discussed that the ongoing collapse of the GF9-2 core has agreement with the
Larson-Penston-Hunter (LPH) theoretical solution for the gravitational collapse
of a core (Furuya et al.; paper I). To discuss the gas infall on firmer ground,
we have carried out On-The-Fly mapping observations of the HCO+ (1--0) line
using the Nobeyama 45m telescope equipped with the 25 Beam Array Receiver
System. Furthermore, we observed the HCN (1--0) line with the 45m telescope,
and the HCO+ (3--2) line with the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory 10.4 m
telescope. The optically thick HCO+ and HCN lines show blueskewed profiles
whose deepest absorptions are seen at the peak velocity of optically thin
lines, i.e., the systemic velocity of the cloud (paper I), indicating the
presence of gas infall toward the central protostar. We compared the observed
HCO+ line profiles with model ones by solving the radiative transfer in the
core under LTE assumption.We found that the core gas has a constant infall
velocity of ~0.5 km/s in the central region, leading to a mass accretion rate
of 2.5x10^{-5} Msun/yr. Consequently, we confirm that the gas infall in the
GF9-2 core is consistent with the LPH solution.
