The topology of the intersection of two real homogeneous coaxial quadrics was
studied by the second author who showed that its intersection with the unit
sphere is in most cases diffeomorphic to a connected sum of sphere products.
Combining that approach with a recent one (due to Antony Bahri, Martin
Bendersky, Fred Cohen and the first author) we study here the intersections of
k>2 quadrics and we identify very general families of such manifolds that are
diffeomorphic to connected sums of sphere products. These include those
moment-angle manifolds for which the result was conjectured by Frederic Bosio
and Laurent Meersseman. As a byproduct, a simpler and neater proof of the
result for the case k=2 is obtained.
  Two new sections contain results not included in the first version of this
article: Section 2 describes the topological change on the manifolds after the
operations of cutting off a vertex or an edge of the associated polytope, which
can be combined in a special way with the previos results to produce new
infinite families of manifolds that are connected sums of sphere products. In
other cases we get slightly more complicated manifolds: with this we solve
another question by Bosio-Meersseman about the manifold associated to the
truncated cube.
  In Section 3 we use this to show that the known rules for the cohomology
product of a moment-angle manifold have to be drastically modified in the
general situation. We state the modified rule, but leave the details of this
for another publication.
  Section 0 recalls known definitions and results and in section 2.1 some
elementary topological constructions are defined and explored. In the Appendix
we state and prove some results about specific differentiable manifolds, which
are used in sections 1 and 2.
