I argue that TeV neutrino physics might become an exciting frontier of
particle physics in the era of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The origin of
non-zero but tiny masses of three known neutrinos is probably related to the
existence of some heavy degrees of freedom, such as heavy Majorana neutrinos or
heavy Higgs bosons, via a TeV-scale seesaw mechanism. I take a few examples to
illustrate how to get a balance between theoretical naturalness and
experimental testability of TeV seesaws. Besides possible collider signatures
at the LHC, new and non-unitary CP-violating effects are also expected to show
up in neutrino oscillations for type-I, type-(I+II) and type-III seesaws at the
TeV scale.
