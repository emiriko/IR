We report on a calculation of the chiral odd generalized parton distributions
(GPDs) for non-zero skewness $\zeta$ in transverse and longitudinal position
spaces by taking Fourier transform with respect to the transverse and
longitudinal momentum transfer respectively using overlaps of light-front wave
functions (LFWFs).
