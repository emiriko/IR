We investigate the property of the hadron-quark mixed phase using the
Brueckner-Hartree-Fock model for hadron (hyperon) phase and the MIT bag model
for quark phase. To satisfy the Gibbs conditions, charge density as well as
baryon number density becomes non-uniform in the mixed phase, accompanying
phase separation. We clarify the roles of the surface tension and the charge
screening effect. We show that the screened Coulomb interaction tends to make
the geometrical structure of the mixed phase less stable, and the resultant EOS
becomes similar to the one given by the Maxwell construction. The composition
of the mixed phase, however, is very different from that of the Maxwell
construction; in particular, hyperons are completely suppressed in the mixed
phase, because hadron phase is positively charged. This is a novel mechanism of
hyperon suppression in compact stars.
