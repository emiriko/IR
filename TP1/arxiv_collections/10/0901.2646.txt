We study the functorial and growth properties of closed orbits for maps. By
viewing an arbitrary sequence as the orbit-counting function for a map,
iterates and Cartesian products of maps define new transformations between
integer sequences. An orbit monoid is associated to any integer sequence,
giving a dynamical interpretation of the Euler transform.
