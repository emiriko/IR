We have measured the temperature dependences of Rho and Chi for
Fe-substituted La_2-x_Sr_x_Cu_1-y_Fe_y_O_4_ in the overdoped regime, in order
to investigate Fe-substitution effects on electronic properties around x=0.22.
  From the Rho measurements, it has been found around x=0.22 that the values of
Rho are large at room temperature and that Rho exhibits a pronounced upturn at
low temperatures. Moreover, from the Rho and Chi measurements, it has been
found that T_c_ is anomalously depressed around x=0.22. These results indicate
that the electronic anomalies around x=0.22 are enhanced by Fe substitution,
which might be related to the development of stripe correlations by Fe
substitution.
