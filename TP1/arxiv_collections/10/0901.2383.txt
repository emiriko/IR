When a quantum dot is subjected to a thermal gradient, the temperature of
electrons entering the dot can be determined from the dot's thermocurrent if
the conductance spectrum and background temperature are known. We demonstrate
this technique by measuring the temperature difference across a 15 nm quantum
dot embedded in a nanowire. This technique can be used when the dot's energy
states are separated by many kT and will enable future quantitative
investigations of electron-phonon interaction, nonlinear thermoelectric
effects, and the effciency of thermoelectric energy conversion in quantum dots.
