The current art in optimal combinatorial auctions is limited to handling the
case of single units of multiple items, with each bidder bidding on exactly one
bundle (single minded bidders). This paper extends the current art by proposing
an optimal auction for procuring multiple units of multiple items when the
bidders are single minded. The auction minimizes the cost of procurement while
satisfying Bayesian incentive compatibility and interim individual rationality.
Under appropriate regularity conditions, this optimal auction also satisfies
dominant strategy incentive compatibility.
