Using the second Drinfeld formulation of the quantized universal enveloping
algebra $U_q(\widehat{sl_2})$ we introduce a family of its Heisenberg-type
elements which are endowed with a deformed commutator and satisfy properties
similar to generators of a Heisenberg subalgebra. Explicit expressions for new
family of generators are found.
