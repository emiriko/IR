In single-layer graphene sheets non-local interband exchange leads to a
renormalized Fermi-surface effective mass which vanishes in the low
carrier-density limit. We report on a comparative study of Fermi surface
effective mass renormalization in single-layer and AB-stacked bilayer graphene.
We explain why the mass does not approach zero in the bilayer case, although
its value is still strongly suppressed.
