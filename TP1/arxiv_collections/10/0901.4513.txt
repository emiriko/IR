I make publicly available my literature study into carbon isotope ratios in
the Solar System, which formed a part of Woods & Willacy (2009). As far as I
know, I have included here all measurements of 12C/13C in Solar System objects
(excluding those of Earth) up to and including 1 February 2010. Full references
are given. If you use the any of the information here, please reference the
paper Woods & Willacy (2009) and this publication.
