The Pierre Auger Observatory has a unique potential to search for ultra-high
energy photons (above ~1 EeV). First experimental limits on photons were
obtained during construction of the southern part of the Observatory.
Remarkably, already these limits have proven useful to falsify proposals about
the origin of cosmic rays, and to perform fundamental physics by constraining
Lorentz violation. A final discovery of photons at the upper end of the
electromagnetic spectrum is likely to impact various branches of physics and
astronomy.
