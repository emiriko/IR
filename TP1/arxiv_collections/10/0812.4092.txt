Based on a systematic investigation of $J/\psi(\psi^\prime)\to VP$, where $V$
and $P$ stand for light vector and pseudoscalar mesons, we identify the role
played by the electromagnetic (EM) transitions and intermediate meson loop
transitions, which are essential ingredients for understanding the $J/\psi$ and
$\psi^\prime$ couplings to $VP$. We show that on the one hand, the EM
transitions have relatively larger interferences in $\psi^\prime\to \rho\pi$
and $K^*\bar{K}+c.c.$ as explicitly shown by vector meson dominance (VMD). On
the other hand, the strong decay of $\psi^\prime$ receives relatively larger
destructive interferences from the intermediate meson loop transitions. By
identifying these mechanisms in an overall study of $J/\psi(\psi^\prime)\to
VP$, we provide a coherent understanding of the so-called "$\rho\pi$ puzzle".
