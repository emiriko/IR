In a recent paper, Filatrella et al. [Phys. Rev. B 75, 54510 (2007)] report
results of numerical calculations of energy barriers for flux quanta
propagation in two-dimensional arrays of Josephson junctions with finite self
and mutual inductances. To avoid complex numerical calculations, they use an
approximated inductance model to address the effects of the mutual couplings.
Using a full inductance matrix model, we show that this approximated model
cannot be used to calculate the energy barrier of interacting vortices. The
authors' method of comparison between numerical data and theoretical
predictions is also discussed.
