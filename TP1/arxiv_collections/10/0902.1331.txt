Liouville field theory on a sphere is considered. We explicitly derive a
differential equation for four-point correlation functions with one degenerate
field $V_{-\frac{mb}{2}}$. We introduce and study also a class of four-point
conformal blocks which can be calculated exactly and represented by finite
dimensional integrals of elliptic theta-functions for arbitrary intermediate
dimension. We study also the bootstrap equations for these conformal blocks and
derive integral representations for corresponding four-point correlation
functions. A relation between the one-point correlation function of a primary
field on a torus and a special four-point correlation function on a sphere is
proposed.
