In the search for new physical properties of S/F structures, we have found
that the superconductor critical current can be controlled by the domain state
of the neighboring ferromagnet. The superconductor is a thin wire of thickness
d_{s} ~ 2 xi_{S}. Nb/Co and Nb/Py (Permalloy Ni_{80}Fe_{20}) bilayer structures
were grown with a significant magnetic anisotropy. Critical current
measurements of Nb/Co structures with ferromagnet thickness d_{F} > 30nm show
sudden drops in two very defined steps when the measurements are made along the
hard axes direction (i.e. current track parallel to hard anisotropy axes
direction). These drops disappear when they are made along the easy axis
direction or when the ferromagnet thickness is below 30nm. The drops are
accompanied by vortex flux flow. In addition magnetorestistance measurements
close to Tc show a sharp increase near saturation fields of the ferromagnet.
Similar results are reproduced in Nb/Py bilayer structure with the ferromagnet
thickness d_{F} ~ 50nm along the easy anisotropy axes. These results are
explained as being due to spontaneous vortex formation and flow induced by
Bloch domain walls of the ferromagnet underneath. We argue these Bloch domain
walls produce a 2D vortex-antivortex lattice structure.
