Resistivity, magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements are
reported for single crystals of Fe1+yTexSe1-x grown via a modified Bridgeman
method with 0 < y < 0.15, and x= 1, 0.9, 0.75, 0. 67, 0.55 and 0.5. Although
resistivity measurements show traces of superconductivity near 14 K for all x
except x=1, only crystals grown with compositions near x=0.5 exhibit bulk
superconductivity. The appearance of bulk superconductivity correlates with a
reduction in the magnitude of the magnetic susceptibility at room temperature
and smaller values of y, the concentration of Fe in the Fe(2) site.
