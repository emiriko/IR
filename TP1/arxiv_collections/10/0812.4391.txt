We consider the entanglement dynamics between two Unruh-DeWitt detectors at
rest separated at a distance $d$. This simple model when analyzed properly in
quantum field theory shows many interesting facets and helps to dispel some
misunderstandings of entanglement dynamics. We find that there is spatial
dependence of quantum entanglement in the stable regime due to the phase
difference of vacuum fluctuations the two detectors experience, together with
the interference of the mutual influences from the backreaction of one detector
on the other. When two initially entangled detectors are still outside each
other's light cone, the entanglement oscillates in time with an amplitude
dependent on spatial separation $d$. When the two detectors begin to have
causal contact, an interference pattern of the relative degree of entanglement
(compared to those at spatial infinity) develops a parametric dependence on
$d$. The detectors separated at those $d$ with a stronger relative degree of
entanglement enjoy longer disentanglement times. In the cases with weak
coupling and large separation, the detectors always disentangle at late times.
For sufficiently small $d$, the two detectors can have residual entanglement
even if they initially were in a separable state, while for $d$ a little
larger, there could be transient entanglement created by mutual influences.
However, we see no evidence of entanglement creation outside the light cone for
initially separable states.
