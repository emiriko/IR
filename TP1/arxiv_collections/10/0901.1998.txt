We consider quarkonium in a hot QCD plasma which, due to expansion and
non-zero viscosity, exhibits a local anisotropy in momentum space. At short
distances the heavy-quark potential is known at tree level from the
hard-thermal loop resummed gluon propagator in anisotropic perturbative QCD.
The potential at long distances is modeled as a QCD string which is screened at
the same scale as the Coulomb field. At asymptotic separation the potential
energy is non-zero and inversely proportional to the temperature. We obtain
numerical solutions of the three-dimensional Schroedinger equation for this
potential. We find that quarkonium binding is stronger at non-vanishing
viscosity and expansion rate, and that the anisotropy leads to polarization of
the P-wave states.
