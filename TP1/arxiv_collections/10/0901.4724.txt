We show a uniqueness theorem for charged rotating black holes in the bosonic
sector of five-dimensional minimal supergravity. More precisely, under the
assumptions of the existence of two commuting axial isometries and spherical
topology of horizon cross-sections, we prove that an asymptotically flat,
stationary charged rotating black hole with finite temperature in
five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory is uniquely characterized
by the mass, charge, and two independent angular momenta and therefore is
described by the five-dimensional Cvetic-Youm solution with equal charges. We
also discuss a generalization of our uniqueness theorem for spherical black
holes to the case of black rings.
