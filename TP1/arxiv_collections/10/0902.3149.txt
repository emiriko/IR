This paper presents new observations of the AGNs M87 and Hydra A at 90 GHz
made with the MUSTANG bolometer array on the Green Bank Telescope at 8.5"
resolution. A spectral analysis is performed combining this new data and
archival VLA data on these objects at longer wavelengths. This analysis can
detect variations in spectral index and curvature expected from energy losses
in the radiating particles. M87 shows only weak evidence for steepening of the
spectrum along the jet suggesting either re-acceleration of the relativistic
particles in the jet or insufficient losses to affect the spectrum at 90 GHz.
The jets in Hydra A show strong steepening as they move from the nucleus
suggesting unbalanced losses of the higher energy relativistic particles. The
difference between these two sources may be accounted for by the different
lengths over which the jets are observable, 2 kpc for M87 and 45 kpc for Hydra
A.
