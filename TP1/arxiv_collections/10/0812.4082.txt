We apply the absorptive boundary prescription to include saturation effects
in CCFM evolution equation. We are in particular interested in saturation
effects in exclusive processes which can be studied using Monte Carlo event
generator CASCADE. We calculate cross section for three-jet production and
distribution of charged hadrons.
