The correlation between antiferromagnetic and ferroelectric domain structures
in multiferroics has been studied. The role of magnetoelectric interactions in
a formation of antiferromagnetic domain structure has been analysed. It has
been shown the major physical mechanism binding antiferromagnetic domains to
ferroelectrics ones is inhomogeneous flexomagnetoelectric interaction of the
Pz((lgrad)lz-lz(divl)) type. The dependences illustrating rearrangement of
antiferromagnetic domain pattern together with change of ferroelectric domains
thickness has been performed.
