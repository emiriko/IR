The static dipole polarizabibility for the $1s\sigma$ electron state of the
$\mathrm{H}_{2}^{+}$ hydrogen molecular ion is calculated within
Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The variational expansion with randomly chosen
exponents has been used for numerical studies. The results obtained for the
dipole polarizability are accurate to the nine digits.
