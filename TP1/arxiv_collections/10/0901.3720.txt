The possibility to modify the strength of the Casimir effect by tailoring the
dielectric functions of the interacting surfaces is regarded as a unique
opportunity in the development of Micro- and NanoElectroMechanical Systems. In
air, however, one expects that, unless noble metals are used, the electrostatic
force arising from trapped charges overcomes the Casimir attraction, leaving no
room for exploitation of Casimir force engineering at ambient conditions. Here
we show that, in the presence of a conductive oxide, the Casimir force can be
the dominant interaction even in air, and that the use of conductive oxides
allows one to reduce the Casimir force up to a factor of 2 when compared to
noble metals.
