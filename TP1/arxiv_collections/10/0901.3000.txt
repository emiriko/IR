Let f be a non-invertible holomorphic endomorphism of the complex projective
space P^k, f^n its iterate of order n and \mu the equilibrium measure of f. We
estimate the speed of convergence in the following known result. If a is a
Zariski generic point in P^k, the probability measures, equidistributed on the
preimages of a under f^n, converge to \mu as n goes to infinity.
