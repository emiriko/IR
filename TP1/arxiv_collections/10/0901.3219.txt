Anisotropy of the permeability tensor in statistically uniform porous media
of sizes used in typical computer simulations is studied. Although such systems
are assumed to be isotropic by default, we show that de facto their anisotropic
permeability can give rise to significant changes of transport parameters such
as permeability and tortuosity. The main parameter controlling the anisotropy
is $a/L$, being the ratio of the obstacle to system size. Distribution of the
angle $\alpha$ between the external force and the volumetric fluid stream is
found to be approximately normal, and the standard deviation of $\alpha$ is
found to decay with the system size as $(a/L)^{d/2}$, where $d$ is the space
dimensionality. These properties can be used to estimate both
anisotropy-related statistical errors in large-scale simulations and the size
of the representative elementary volume.
