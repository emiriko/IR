A complex network approach is proposed to study the shear behavior of a rough
rock joint. Similarities between aperture profiles are established and a
general network in two directions (in parallel and perpendicular to the shear
direction) is constructed. Evaluation of this newly formed network shows that
the degree distribution of the network, after a transition stage falls into a
quasi stable state which is roughly obeying a Gaussian distribution. In
addition, the growth of the clustering coefficient and the number of edges are
approximately scaled with the development of shear strength and hydraulic
conductivity, which can be utilized to estimate, shear distribution over
asperities. Furthermore, we characterize the contact profiles using the same
approach. Despite the former case, the later networks are following a growing
network mode.
