The coefficients of diffusion, thermal conductivity, and shear viscosity are
calculated for a system of non-relativistic particles interacting via a
delta-shell potential V(r)=-v \delta(r-R) when the average distance between
particles is smaller than R. The roles of resonances and long scattering
lengths including the unitary limit are examined. Results for ratios of
diffusion to viscosity and viscosity to entropy density are presented for
varying scattering lengths.
