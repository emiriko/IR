We discuss the fundamental constants of physics in the Standard Model and
possible changes of these constants on the cosmological time scale. The Grand
Unification of the strong, electromagnetic and weak interactions implies
relations between the time variation of the finestructure constant and of the
QCD scale. An experiment in quantum optics at the MPQ in Munich, which was
designed to look for a time variation of the QCD scale, is discussed.
