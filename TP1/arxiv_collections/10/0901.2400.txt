We construct an infinite number of new holonomic quasi-local gravitational
energy-momentum density pseudotensors with good limits asymptotically and in
small regions, both materially and in vacuum. For small vacuum regions they are
all a positive multiple of the Bel-Robinson tensor and consequently have
positive energy.
