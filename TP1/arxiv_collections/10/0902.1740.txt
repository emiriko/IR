Astronomical data generally consists of 2 or more high-resolution axes, e.g.,
X,Y position on the sky or wavelength and position-along-one-axis (long-slit
spectrometer). Analyzing these multi-dimension observations requires combining
3D source models (including velocity effects), instrument models, and
multi-dimensional data comparison and fitting. A prototype of such a
"Beyond-XSPEC" (Noble & Nowak, 2008) system is presented here using Chandra
imag- ing and dispersed HETG grating data. Techniques used include: Monte Carlo
event generation, chi-squared comparison, conjugate gradient fitting adapted to
the Monte Carlo characteristics, and informative visualizations at each step.
These simple baby steps of progress only scratch the surface of the
computational potential that is available these days for astronomical analysis.
