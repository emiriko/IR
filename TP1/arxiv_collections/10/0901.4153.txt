The generation of nanoscale square and stripe patterns is of major
technological importance since they are compatible with industry-standard
electronic circuitry. Recently, a blend of diblock copolymer interacting via
hydrogen-bonding was shown to self-assemble in square arrays. Motivated by
those experiments we study, using Monte Carlo simulations, the pattern
formation in a two-dimensional binary mixture of colloidal particles
interacting via isotropic core-corona potentials. We find a rich variety of
patterns that can be grouped mainly in aggregates that self-assemble in regular
square lattices or in alternate strips. Other morphologies observed include
colloidal corrals that are potentially useful as surface templating agents.
This work shows the unexpected versatility of this simple model to produce a
variety of patterns with high technological potential.
