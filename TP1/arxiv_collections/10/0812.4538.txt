We study the nonlinear dynamics of a protein-DNA molecular system by treating
DNA as a set of two coupled linear chains and protein in the form of a single
linear chain sliding along the DNA at the physiological temperature in a
viscous medium. The nonlinear dynamics of the above molecular system in general
is governed by a perturbed nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation. In the
non-viscous limit, the equation reduces to the completely integrable nonlinear
Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation which admits N-soliton solutions. The soliton
excitations of the DNA bases make localized base pair opening and travel along
the DNA chain in the form of a bubble. This may represent the bubble generated
during the transcription process when an RNA-polymerase binds to a promoter
site in the DNA double helical chain. The perturbed NLS equation is solved
using a perturbation theory by treating the viscous effect due to surrounding
as a weak perturbation and the results show that the viscosity of the solvent
in the surrounding damps out the amplitude of the soliton.
