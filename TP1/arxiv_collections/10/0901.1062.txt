Biometrics make human identification possible with a sample of a biometric
trait and an associated database. Classical identification techniques lead to
privacy concerns. This paper introduces a new method to identify someone using
his biometrics in an encrypted way. Our construction combines Bloom Filters
with Storage and Locality-Sensitive Hashing. We apply this error-tolerant
scheme, in a Hamming space, to achieve biometric identification in an efficient
way. This is the first non-trivial identification scheme dealing with fuzziness
and encrypted data.
