In this article, we study the quantum dynamics of a Klein-Gordon field on
de-Sitter space. We prove time evolution is not unitarily implementable. We
also consider a Klein-Gordon field perturbed by a local potential V. In this
case we prove that the deviation from the V=0 dynamics is unitarily
implementable.
