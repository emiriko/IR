The GMRT has been used to make deep, wide-field surveys of several fields at
610 MHz, with a resolution of about 5 arcsec. These include the Spitzer
Extragalactic First Look Survey field, where 4 square degrees were observed
with a r.m.s. sensitivity of about 30 microJy/beam, and several SWIRE fields
(namely the Lockman Hole, ELAIS-N1 and N2 fields) covering more than 20 square
degrees with a sensitivity of about 80 microJy beam or better. The analysis of
these observations, and some of the science results are described.
