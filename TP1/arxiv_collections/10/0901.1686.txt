Applying effective Lagrangian method and on-shell scheme, we analyze the
electroweak corrections to anomalous dipole moments of lepton from some special
two loop diagrams in which a closed heavy fermion loop is attached to the
virtual gauge bosons or Higgs fields. As the masses of virtual fermions in
inner loop are much heavier than the electroweak scale, we verify the final
results satisfying the decoupling theorem explicitly if the interactions among
Higgs and heavy fermions do not contain the nondecoupling couplings. At the
decoupling limit, we also present the leading corrections to lepton anomalous
dipole moments from those two loop diagrams in some popular extensions of the
standard model, such as the fourth generation, supersymmetry, universal extra
dimension, and the littlest Higgs with T-parity.
