In the celebrated paper [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 37, 1775 (2004)], D. Collins
and N. Gisin presented for the first time a three setting Bell inequality (here
we call it CG inequality for simplicity) which is relevant to the
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. Inspired by their brilliant
ideas, we obtained some multi-setting tight Bell inequalities, which are
relevant to the CHSH inequality and the CG inequality. Moreover, we generalized
the method in the paper [Phys.Rev. A 79, 012115 (2009)] to construct Bell
inequality for qubits to higher dimensional system. Based on the generalized
method, we present, for the first time, a three setting tight Bell inequality
for two qutrits, which is maximally violated by nonmaximally entangled states
and relevant to the Collins-Gisin- Linden-Massar-Popescu inequality.
