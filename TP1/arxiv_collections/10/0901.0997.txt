We argue that string percolation is in the origin of i) an approximately flat
rapidity distribution and of ii) an approximately constant forward-backward
correlation parameter $b$ over a substantial fraction of the available
rapidity. Predictions are given for $pp$ collisions at LHC, $\sqrt{s}=14$TeV
and $\sqrt{s}=5.5$TeV.
