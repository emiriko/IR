We present an analysis of the nucleon strange sea extracted from a global
Parton Distribution Function fit including the neutrino and anti-neutrino
dimuon data by the CCFR and NuTeV collaborations, the inclusive charged
lepton-nucleon Deep Inelastic Scattering and Drell-Yan data. The
(anti-)neutrino induced dimuon analysis is constrained by the semi-leptonic
charmed-hadron branching ratio $B_\mu=(8.8\pm0.5)%$, determined from the
inclusive charmed hadron measurements performed by the FNAL-E531 and CHORUS
neutrino emulsion experiments. Our analysis yields a strange sea suppression
factor $\kappa(Q^2=20{\rm GeV}^2)=0.62\pm 0.04$, the most precise value
available, an $x$-distribution of total strange sea that is slightly softer
than the non-strange sea, and an asymmetry between strange and anti-strange
quark distributions consistent with zero (integrated over $x$ it is equal to
$0.0013 \pm 0.0009$ at $Q^2=20{\rm GeV}^2$).
