We describe a general framework that can be used to geometrically engineer
local, phenomenological models in F-theory and M-theory based on
ALE-fibrations, and we present several concrete examples of such models that
feature three generations of matter with semi-realistic phenomenology. We show
that the geometric structures required for generating
interactions--triple-intersections of matter-curves in F-theory and
supersymmetric three-cycles supporting multiple conical singularities in
M-theory--are generic in such ALE-fibred manifolds, and that they can be
understood in correspondence with one another. The models we can construct in
this way are strictly limited in complexity by the maximality of the E8-ALE
space, but turn out to be just complex enough to accommodate some of the most
realistic string models to date.
