We consider the secular dynamics of a binary and a planet in terms of
non-restricted, hierarchical three-body problem, including the general
relativity corrections to the Newtonian gravity. We determine regions in the
parameter space where the relativistic corrections may be important for the
long-term dynamics. We try to constrain the inclinations of putative Jovian
planets in recently announced binary systems of HD 4113 and HD 156846.
