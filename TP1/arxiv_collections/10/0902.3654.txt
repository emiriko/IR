The influence of calcium channel distribution and geometry of the
thalamocortical cell upon its tonic firing and the low threshold spike (LTS)
generation was studied in a 3-compartment model, which represents soma,
proximal and distal dendrites as well as in multi-compartment model using the
morphology of a real reconstructed neuron. Using an uniform distribution of
Ca2+ channels, we determined the minimal number of low threshold
voltage-activated calcium channels and their permeability required for the
onset of LTS in response to a hyperpolarizing current pulse. In the
3-compartment model, we found that the channel distribution influences the
firing pattern only in the range of 3% below the threshold value of total
T-channel density. In the multi-compartmental model, the LTS could be generated
by only 64% of unequally distributed T-channels compared to the minimal number
of equally distributed T-channels. For a given channel density and injected
current, the tonic firing frequency was found to be inversely proportional to
the size of the cell. However, when the Ca2+ channel density was elevated in
soma or proximal dendrites, then the amplitude of LTS response and burst spike
frequencies were determined by the ratio of total to threshold number of
T-channels in the cell for a specific geometry.
