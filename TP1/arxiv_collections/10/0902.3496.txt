I obtain the dynamics of the continuous time quantum walk on a
$d$-dimensional lattice, with periodic boundary conditions, as an appropriate
limit of the dynamics of the discrete time quantum walk on the same lattice.
This extends the main result of arXiv:quant-ph/0606050 which proved this limit
for the infinite line. By highlighting the main features of the limiting
procedure, I then extend it to general graphs. For a given discrete time
quantum walk on a general graph, I single out the type of continuous dynamics
(Hamiltonians) that can be obtained as a limit of the discrete time dynamics.
