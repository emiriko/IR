We propose a novel `butterfly' level scheme to generate highly correlated
photon pairs from atomic vapors. With multi-photon Doppler-free pumping,
background Rayleigh scattering is dipole-forbidden and collective emission is
permitted in all directions. This results in usable pairs generated
simultaneously in the full $4\pi$ solid angle. Collecting these pairs can
produce photon pairs at a rate of $\sim 10^{12}$ per second, given only
moderate ensemble sizes of $\sim 10^6$ atoms.
