Temperature dependent magnetometry and transport measurements on epitaxial
Fe3O4 films grown on BaTiO3(100) single crystals by molecular beam epitaxy show
a series of discontinuities, that are due to changes in the magnetic anisotropy
induced by strain in the different crystal phases of BaTiO3. The magnetite film
is under tensile strain at room temperature, which is ascribed to the lattice
expansion of BaTiO3 at the cubic to tetragonal transition, indicating that the
magnetite film is relaxed at the growth temperature. From the magnetization
versus temperature curves, the variation in the magnetic anisotropy is
determined and compared with the magnetoelastic anisotropies. These results
demonstrate the possibility of using the piezoelectric response of BaTiO3 to
modulate the magnetic anisotropy of magnetite films.
