We calculate the distribution of the scattering matrix at the Fermi level for
chaotic normal-superconducting systems for the case of arbitrary coupling of
the scattering region to the scattering channels. The derivation is based on
the assumption of uniformly distributed scattering matrices at ideal coupling,
which holds in the absence of a gap in the quasiparticle excitation spectrum.
The resulting distribution generalizes the Poisson kernel to the nonstandard
symmetry classes introduced by Altland and Zirnbauer. We show that unlike the
Poisson kernel, our result cannot be obtained by combining the maximum entropy
principle with the analyticity-ergodicity constraint. As a simple application,
we calculate the distribution of the conductance for a single-channel chaotic
Andreev quantum dot in a magnetic field.
