We apply the concept of subset seeds proposed in [1] to similarity search in
protein sequences. The main question studied is the design of efficient seed
alphabets to construct seeds with optimal sensitivity/selectivity trade-offs.
We propose several different design methods and use them to construct several
alphabets. We then perform a comparative analysis of seeds built over those
alphabets and compare them with the standard BLASTP seeding method [2], [3], as
well as with the family of vector seeds proposed in [4]. While the formalism of
subset seeds is less expressive (but less costly to implement) than the
cumulative principle used in BLASTP and vector seeds, our seeds show a similar
or even better performance than BLASTP on Bernoulli models of proteins
compatible with the common BLOSUM62 matrix. Finally, we perform a large-scale
benchmarking of our seeds against several main databases of protein alignments.
Here again, the results show a comparable or better performance of our seeds
vs. BLASTP.
