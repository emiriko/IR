We investigate what determines the shape of a particle condensate in
situations when it emerges as a result of spontaneous breaking of translational
symmetry. We consider a model with particles hopping between sites of a
one-dimensional grid and interacting if they are at the same or at neighboring
nodes. We predict the envelope of the condensate and the scaling of its width
with the system size for various interaction potentials and show how to tune
the shape from a delta-peak to a rectangular or a parabolic-like form.
