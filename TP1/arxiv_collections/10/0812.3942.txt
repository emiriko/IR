By varying the vortex core size of the thick center vortex model, we have
studied the short distance potentials between static sources. It has been found
that fluctuations of the vortex core size lead to Coulombic behavior.
Furthermore, we discuss the influence of such fluctuations on Casimir scaling
for both the Coulombic and the linear part of the potential.
