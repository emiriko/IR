The speed of many one-line transformation methods for the production of, for
example, Levy alpha-stable random numbers, which generalize Gaussian ones, and
Mittag-Leffler random numbers, which generalize exponential ones, is very high
and satisfactory for most purposes. However, for the class of decreasing
probability densities fast rejection implementations like the Ziggurat by
Marsaglia and Tsang promise a significant speed-up if it is possible to
complement them with a method that samples the tails of the infinite support.
This requires the fast generation of random numbers greater or smaller than a
certain value. We present a method to achieve this, and also to generate random
numbers within any arbitrary interval. We demonstrate the method showing the
properties of the transform maps of the above mentioned distributions as
examples of stable and geometric stable random numbers used for the stochastic
solution of the space-time fractional diffusion equation.
