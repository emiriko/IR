Enzymes are on the front lines of evolution. All living organisms rely on
highly efficient, specific enzymes for growth, sustenance, and reproduction;
and many diseases are a consequence of a mutation on an enzyme that affects its
catalytic function. It follows that the function of an enzyme affects the
fitness of an organism, but just as rightfully true, the function of an enzyme
affects the fitness of itself. Understanding how the complexity of enzyme
structure relates to its essential function will unveil the fundamental
mechanisms of evolution, and, perhaps, shed light on strategies used by ancient
replicators. This paper presents evidence that supports the hypothesis that
enzymes, and proteins in general, are the manifestation of the coevolution of
two opposing forces. The synthesis of enzyme architecture, stability, function,
evolutionary relationships, and evolvability shows that the complexity of
macromolecules is a consequence of the function it provides.
