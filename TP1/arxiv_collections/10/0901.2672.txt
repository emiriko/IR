By definition, brown dwarfs never reach the main-sequence, cooling and
dimming over their entire lifetime, thus making substellar models challenging
to test because of the strong dependence on age. Currently, most brown dwarfs
with independently determined ages are companions to nearby stars, so stellar
ages are at the heart of the effort to test substellar models. However, these
models are only fully constrained if both the mass and age are known. We have
used the Keck adaptive optics system to monitor the orbit of HD 130948BC, a
brown dwarf binary that is a companion to the young solar analog HD 130948A.
The total dynamical mass of 0.109+/-0.003 Msun shows that both components are
substellar, and the ensemble of available age indicators from the primary star
suggests an age comparable to the Hyades, with the most precise age being 0.79
Gyr based on gyrochronology. Therefore, HD 130948BC is unique among field L and
T dwarfs as it possesses a well-determined mass, luminosity, and age. Our
results indicate that substellar evolutionary models may underpredict the
luminosity of brown dwarfs by as much as a factor of ~2-3x. The implications of
such a systematic error in evolutionary models would be far-reaching, for
example, affecting determinations of the initial mass function and predictions
of the radii of extrasolar gas-giant planets. This result is largely based on
the reliability of stellar age estimates, and the case study of HD 130948A
highlights the difficulties in determining the age of an arbitrary field star,
even with the most up-to-date chromospheric activity and gyrochronology
relations. In order to better assess the potential systematic errors present in
substellar models, more refined age estimates for HD 130948A and other stars
with binary brown dwarf companions (e.g., eps Ind Bab) are critically needed.
