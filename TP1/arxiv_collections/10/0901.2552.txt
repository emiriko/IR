Several hybrid tomographic methods utilizing ultrasound modulation have been
introduced lately. Success of these methods hinges on the feasibility of
focusing ultrasound waves at an arbitrary point of interest. Such a focusing,
however, is difficult to achieve in practice. We thus propose a way to avoid
the use of focused waves through the so called synthetic focusing, i.e. by the
reconstruction of the would-be response to the focused modulation from the
measurements corresponding to realistic unfocused waves. Examples of
reconstructions from simulated data are provided. This non-technical paper
describes only the general concept, while technical details will appear
elsewhere.
