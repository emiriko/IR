Arrow's Impossibility Theorem states that any constitution which satisfies
Transitivity, Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) and Unanimity is a
dictatorship. Wilson derived properties of constitutions satisfying
Transitivity and IIA for unrestricted domains where ties are allowed. In this
paper we consider the case where only strict preferences are allowed. In this
case we derive a new short proof of Arrow theorem and further obtain a new and
complete characterization of all functions satisfying Transitivity and IIA.
