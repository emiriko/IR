We use absolutely calibrated data between 3 and 90 GHz from the 2006 balloon
flight of the ARCADE 2 instrument, along with previous measurements at other
frequencies, to constrain models of extragalactic emission. Such emission is a
combination of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) monopole, Galactic
foreground emission, the integrated contribution of radio emission from
external galaxies, any spectral distortions present in the CMB, and any other
extragalactic source. After removal of estimates of foreground emission from
our own Galaxy, and the estimated contribution of external galaxies, we present
fits to a combination of the flat-spectrum CMB and potential spectral
distortions in the CMB. We find 2 sigma upper limits to CMB spectral
distortions of mu < 5.8 x 10^{-5} and Y_ff < 6.2 x 10^{-5}. We also find a
significant detection of a residual signal beyond that which can be explained
by the CMB plus the integrated radio emission from galaxies estimated from
existing surveys. After subtraction of an estimate of the contribution of
discrete radio sources, this unexplained signal is consistent with
extragalactic emission in the form of a power law with amplitude 1.06 \pm 0.11
K at 1 GHz and a spectral index of -2.56 \pm 0.04.
