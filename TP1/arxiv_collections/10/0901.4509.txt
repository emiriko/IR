Herndon's georeactor at the center of Earth is immune to meltdown, which is
not the case for recently published copy-cat georeactors, which would
necessarily be subject to hot nuclear fuel, prevailing high temperature
environments, and high confining pressures. Herndon's georeactor uniquely is
expected to be self-regulating through establishing a balance between heat
production and actinide settling out. The seventy year old idea of convection
in the Earth's fluid core is refuted because thermal expansion cannot overcome
the 23 percent higher density at the core's bottom than at its top. The
dimensionless Rayleigh Number is an inappropriate indicator of convection in
the Earth's core and mantle as a consequence of the assumptions under which it
was derived. Implications bearing on the origin of the geomagnetic field, the
physical impossibility of mantle convection, and the concomitant refutation of
plate tectonics theory are briefly described.
