In this paper, we present a factor 16 approximation algorithm for the
following NP-hard distance fitting problem: given a finite set X and a distance
d on X, find a Robinsonian distance dR on X minimizing the l\infty-error ||d -
dR||\infty = maxx,y\epsilonX {|d(x, y) - dR(x, y)|}. A distance dR on a finite
set X is Robinsonian if its matrix can be symmetrically permuted so that its
elements do not decrease when moving away from the main diagonal along any row
or column. Robinsonian distances generalize ultrametrics, line distances and
occur in the seriation problems and in classification.
