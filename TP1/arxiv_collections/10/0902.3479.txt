A general information-theoretic framework for deriving physical laws is
presented and a principle of informational physics is enunciated within its
context. Existing approaches intended to derive physical laws from
information-theoretic first principles are unified as special cases of this
framework with the introduction of constraints dependent on the physical
process of observation. Some practical, theoretical and epistemological
implications of the validity of this approach are examined.
