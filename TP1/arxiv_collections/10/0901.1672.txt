We study a model describing electronic transport in a weakly-coupled
semiconductor superlattice with a shunting side layer. Key parameters include
the lateral size of the superlattice, the connectivity between the quantum
wells of the superlattice and the shunt layer, and the conduction properties of
the shunt layer. For a superlattice with small lateral extent and high quality
shunt, static electric field domains are suppressed and a spatially-uniform
field configuration is predicted to be stable, a result that may be useful for
proposed devices such as a superlattice-based TeraHertz (THz) oscillators. As
the lateral size of the superlattice increases, the uniform field configuration
loses its stability to either static or dynamic field domains, regardless of
shunt properties. A lower quality shunt generally leads to regular and chaotic
current oscillations and complex spatio-temporal dynamics in the field profile.
Bifurcations separating static and dynamic behaviors are characterized and
found to be dependent on the shunt properties.
