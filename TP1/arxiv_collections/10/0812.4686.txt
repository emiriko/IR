Optical entanglement is a key requirement for many quantum communication
protocols. Conventionally entanglement is formed between two distinct beams,
with the quantum correlations being measured at separate locations. We show
entanglement between the modes within one beam. Our technique is particularly
elegant and a major advance towards practical systems with minimum complexity.
We demonstrate three major experimental achievements: (i) only one source is
required to produce squeezed light in two orthogonal spatial modes, (ii) the
entanglement is formed through lenses and beam rotation, without the need of a
beam splitter and (iii) the quantum correlations are measured directly and
simultaneously using a multi pixel, quadrant detector.
