A scaling model is developed to correlate relaxation time distribution of
soft glassy materials to ultimate recovery. We propose that in the limit of
creep-recovery time smaller than age, time translational invariance can be
applied to ageing soft materials. In such limit, multimode linear viscoelastic
model with Spriggs relaxation spectrum predicts enhancement in the ultimate
recovery with broadening of the relaxation time distribution. We analyze these
results in the context of creep-recovery behavior of aqueous suspension of
laponite with varying concentration of salt.
