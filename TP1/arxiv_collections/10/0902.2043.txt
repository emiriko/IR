Thermal annealing of Si/Si1-xSbx/Si amorphous thin film tri-layer samples
(x=18 and 24 at%Sb) under 100 bar Ar pressure results in an interesting pattern
formation. In pictures, taken by means of cross-sectional transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), stripe-shaped contrast, with three maxima, parallel with the
interfaces can be seen. Secondary neutral mass spectrometer (SNMS) measurements
revealed that the regions with different contrasts correspond to Sb-rich and
Sb-depleted regions. Furthermore, the Sb concentration peaks in the Sb-rich
regions, especially at longer annealing times, are different: the peak
developed at the Si/SiSb interface closer to the free surface decays faster
than that of the inner one closer to the substrate. The pattern formation is
interpreted by segregation-initiated spinodal-like decomposition, while the
difference of the Sb concentration peaks is explained by the resultant Sb
transport to and evaporation from the free surface. The possible role of
formation of nanocrystalline grains, in the explanation of the fast transport
under pressure as compared to vacuum is also discussed.
