The scheelite type laser crystals LiREF4 melt congruently only for RE being
one of the elements Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, or possibly Y, respectively. For RE = Eu,
Gd, Tb, Dy, or Ho the corresponding scheelites undergo a peritectic melting
under the formation of the corresponding rare earth fluoride. The melting
behavior of LiREF4 mixed crystals with two or more RE is not yet known well. If
RE is a mixture of Gd and Lu, Gd rich solid solutions melt peritectically under
formation of (Gd,Lu)F3 and Lu rich solid solutions melt directly without
formation of other solid phases.
