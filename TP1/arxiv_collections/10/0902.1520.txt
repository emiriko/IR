In this paper we provide an action related to a certain sector of general
relativity where the algebra of Hamiltonian constraints forms a first class
system. This action is a Dirac-consistent stand-alone action with two physical
degrees of freedom per point. In this paper we provide the steps necessary to
transform this new action to and from the associated sectors of the Ashtekar
theory and a certain antecedent of the pure spin connection formulation by
Capovilla, Dell and Jacobson.
