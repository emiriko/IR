The effect of various dielectrics on charge mobility in single layer graphene
is investigated. By calculating the remote optical phonon scattering arising
from the polar substrates, and combining it with their effect on Coulombic
impurity scattering, a comprehensive picture of the effect of dielectrics on
charge transport in graphene emerges. It is found that though high-$\kappa$
dielectrics can strongly reduce Coulombic scattering by dielectric screening,
scattering from surface phonon modes arising from them wash out this advantage.
By comparing the room-temperature transport properties with narrow-bandgap
III-V semiconductors, strategies to improve the mobility in single layer
graphene are outlined.
