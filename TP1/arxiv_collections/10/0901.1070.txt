The main result of the paper is a new representation for the Weyl Lagrangian
(massless Dirac Lagrangian). As the dynamical variable we use the coframe, i.e.
an orthonormal tetrad of covector fields. We write down a simple Lagrangian -
wedge product of axial torsion with a lightlike element of the coframe - and
show that this gives the Weyl Lagrangian up to a nonlinear change of dynamical
variable. The advantage of our approach is that it does not require the use of
spinors, Pauli matrices or covariant differentiation. The only geometric
concepts we use are those of a metric, differential form, wedge product and
exterior derivative. Our result assigns a variational meaning to the tetrad
representation of the Weyl equation suggested by J. B. Griffiths and R. A.
Newing.
