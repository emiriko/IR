Decay rates of quarkonia are studied within the framework of NRQCD formalism.
The basic parameters of the formalism have been obtained from different
potential schemes studied for the spectra of quarkonia. We estimate the heavy
quarkonia mass spectra, radiative and leptonic widths and compare them with
other contemporary theoretical approaches and experimental results.
