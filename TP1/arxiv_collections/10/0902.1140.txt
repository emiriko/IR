Generalizing a previous model to accommodate the third quark family and CP
violation, we present a $T^{'}$ model which predicts tribimaximal neutrino
(PMNS) mixings while the central predictions for quark mixings are
$|V_{td}/V_{ts}| = 0.245$ and $|V_{ub}/V_{cb}| = 0.237$ with a predicted CP
violating KM phase $\delta_{KM} = 65.8^{0}$. All these are acceptably close to
experiment, including the KM phase for which the allowed values are $63^{0} <
\delta_{KM} < 72^{0}$, and depend only on use of symmetry $T^{'} \times Z_2$ to
define the model and no additional parameters.
