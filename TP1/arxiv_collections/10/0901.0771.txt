We reinvestigate the photoproduction of the exotic pentaquark baryon
Theta^+(1540,1/2^+) from the gamma N -> Kbar Theta^+ reaction process within
the effective Lagrangian approach, taking into account new theoretical
information on the K-N-Theta and K*-N-Theta coupling strengths from the chiral
quark-soliton model (chiQSM). We also consider the crossing-symmetric hadronic
form factor, satisfying the on-shell condition as well. Due to the sizable
vector and tensor couplings for the vector kaon, g_{K* N Theta} and f_{K* N
Theta}, which are almost the same with the vector coupling g_{K N Theta} ~ 0.8
for the pseudoscalar kaon, the K*-exchange contribution plays a critical role
in the photon beam asymmetries.
