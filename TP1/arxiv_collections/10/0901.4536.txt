We review the final stages of stellar evolution, supernova properties, and
chemical yields as a function of the progenitor's mass M. (1) 8 - 10 Ms stars
are super-AGB stars when the O+Ne+Mg core collapses due to electron capture.
These AGB-supernovae may constitute an SN 2008S-like sub-class of Type IIn
supernovae. These stars produce little alpha-elements and Fe-peak elements, but
are important sources of Zn and light p-nuclei. (2) 10 - 90 Ms stars undergo
Fe-core collapse. Nucleosynthesis in aspherical explosions is important, as it
can well reproduce the abundance patterns observed in extremely metal-poor
stars. (3) 90 - 140 Ms stars undergo pulsational nuclear instabilities at
various nuclear burning stages, including O and Si-burning. (4) 140 - 300 Ms
stars become pair-instability supernovae, if the mass loss is small enough. (5)
Stars more massive than 300 Ms undergo core-collapse to form intermediate mass
black holes.
