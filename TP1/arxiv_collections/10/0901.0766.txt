Concepts of thermalization and hydrodynamical behavior are applied from time
to time to e+e-, hadron+hadron and heavy ion collisions. These applications are
scrutinized paying attention to particle multiplicities, spectra, and
Bose-Einstein correlations in particular. Can hydrodynamics describe these
data?
