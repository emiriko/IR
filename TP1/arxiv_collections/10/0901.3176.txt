Measurements at low transverse momentum will be performed at the LHC for
studying particle production mechanisms in $pp$ and heavy-ion collisions. Some
of the experimental capabilities for bulk matter physics are presented,
focusing on tracking elements and particle identification. In order to
anticipate the study of baryon production for both colliding systems at
multi-TeV energies, measurements for identified species and recent model
extrapolations are discussed. Several mechanisms are expected to compete for
hadro-production in the low momentum region. For this reason, experimental
observables that could be used for investigating multi-parton interactions and
help understanding the "underlying event" content in the first $pp$ collisions
at the LHC are also mentioned.
