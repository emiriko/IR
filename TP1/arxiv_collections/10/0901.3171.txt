Continued study of the BATSE catalog verifies previously-identified
correlations between pulse lag and pulse duration and corresponding
anti-correlations between both properties and pulse peak flux for a large
sample of Long GRB pulses; the study also finds correlations between pulse peak
lags, pulse asymmetry, and pulse hardness. These correlations apparently can be
used to delineate Long GRBs from Short ones. Correlated pulse properties
represent constraints that can be used to guide theoretical modeling, whereas
bulk prompt emission properties appear to be constructed by combining and
smearing out pulse characteristics in ways that potentially lose valuable
information.
