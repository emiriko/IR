We construct the ultraviolet completion of the Standard Model that contains
an infinite sequence of Hypercolor gauge groups. So, the whole gauge group of
the theory is $... \otimes SU(5)\otimes SU(4) \otimes SU(3) \otimes SU(2)
\otimes U(1)$. Here SU(4) is the Technicolor group of Farhi - Susskind model.
The breakdown of chiral symmetry due to the the Technicolor gives rise to
finite $W$ and $Z$ boson masses in a usual way. The other Hypercolor groups are
not confining. We suggest the hypothesis that the fermion masses are not
related in any way to technicolor gauge group. We suppose that the fermion mass
formation mechanism is related to the energies much higher than the technicolor
scale. Formally the fermion masses appear in our model as an external input. In
the construction of the theory we use essentially the requirement that it
posseses an additional discrete symmetry $\cal Z$ that is the continuation of
the $Z_6$ symmetry of the Standard Model. It has been found that there exists
such a choice of the hypercharges of the fermions that the chiral anomaly is
absent while the symmetry $\cal Z$ is preserved.
