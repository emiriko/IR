We study the exchange coupling mediated by itinerant carriers with spin-orbit
interaction by both analytic and numeric approaches. The mediated exchange
coupling is non-collinear and its spatial trends depend on the Fermi surface
topology of the itinerant carriers. Taking Rashba interaction as an example,
the exchange coupling is similar to the conventional
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida type in weak coupling. On the other hand, in the
strong coupling, the spiral interaction dominates. In addition, inclusion of
finite spin relaxation always makes the non-collinear spiral exchange
interaction dominant. Potential applications of our findings are explained and
discussed.
