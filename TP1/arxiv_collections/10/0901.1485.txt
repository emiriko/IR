A method to construct both classical and quantum completely integrable
systems from (Jordan-Lie) comodule algebras is introduced. Several integrable
models based on a so(2,1) comodule algebra, two non-standard Schrodinger
comodule algebras, the (classical and quantum) q-oscillator algebra and the
Reflection Equation algebra are explicitly obtained.
