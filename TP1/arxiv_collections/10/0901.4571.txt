The Open Archives Initiative (OAI) has recently created the Object Reuse and
Exchange (ORE) project that defines Resource Maps (ReMs) for describing
aggregations of web resources. These aggregations are susceptible to many of
the same preservation challenges that face other web resources. In this paper,
we investigate how the aggregations of web resources can be preserved outside
of the typical repository environment and instead rely on the thousands of
interactive users in the web community and the Web Infrastructure (the
collection of web archives, search engines, and personal archiving services) to
facilitate preservation. Inspired by Web 2.0 services such as digg,
deli.cio.us, and Yahoo! Buzz, we have developed a lightweight system called
ReMember that attempts to harness the collective abilities of the web community
for preservation purposes instead of solely placing the burden of curatorial
responsibilities on a small number of experts.
