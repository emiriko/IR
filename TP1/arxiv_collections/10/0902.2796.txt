We calculate the vacuum polarization tensor for pion masses from 480 MeV to
270 MeV using dynamical twisted mass fermions at a lattice spacing of 0.086 fm.
We analyze the form of the polarization tensor on the lattice using the
symmetries of twisted QCD and we study both finite size effects and lattice
artifacts at a pion mass of 310 MeV. Results for the lowest order hadronic
contribution to g-2 are presented and the impact of systematic errors is
discussed.
