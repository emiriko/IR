High-throughput experiments are shedding light on the topology of large
regulatory networks and at the same time their functional states, namely the
states of activation of the nodes (for example transcript or protein levels) in
different conditions, times, environments. We now possess a certain amount of
information about these two levels of description, stored in libraries,
databases and ontologies. A current challenge is to bridge the gap between
topology and function, i.e. developing quantitative models aimed at
characterizing the expression patterns of large sets of genes. However,
approaches that work well for small networks become impossible to master at
large scales, mainly because parameters proliferate. In this review we discuss
the state of the art of large-scale functional network models, addressing the
issue of what can be considered as realistic and what the main limitations may
be. We also show some directions for future work, trying to set the goals that
future models should try to achieve. Finally, we will emphasize the possible
benefits in the understanding of biological mechanisms underlying complex
multifactorial diseases, and in the development of novel strategies for the
description and the treatment of such pathologies.
