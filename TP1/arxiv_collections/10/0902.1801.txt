While synthesizing the single crystals of novel materials is not always
feasible, orienting the layered polycrystals becomes an attractive method in
the studies of angular dependencies of inelastic scattering of x-rays or
neutrons. Putting in use the Rietveld analysis of layered structures in novel
manganites and cuprates we develop the studies of their anisotropic properties
with oriented powders instead of single crystals. Densities of phonon states
(DOS) and atomic thermal displacememts (ATD) are anisotropic in the A-site
ordered manganites LnBaMn2Oy of both y=5 and y=6 series (Ln=Y, La, Sm, Gd). We
establish the angular dependence of DOS on textures of arbitrary strengths,
link the textures observed by x-ray and gamma-ray techniques, and solve the
problem of disentanglement of Goldanskii-Karyagin effect (GKE) and texture in
Moessbauer spectra.
