Supercurrents in superconducting flux threaded loops are expected to
oscillate with the magnetic flux with a period of hc/2e. This is indeed true
for s-wave superconductors larger than the coherence length xi_0. Here we show
that for superconductors with gap nodes, there is no such strict condition for
the supercurrent to be hc/2e rather than hc/e periodic. For nodal
superconductors, the flux induced Doppler shift of the near nodal states leads
to a flux dependent occupation probability of quasi-particles circulating
clockwise and counter clockwise around the loop, which leads to an hc/e
periodic component of the supercurrent, even at zero temperature. We analyze
this phenomenon on a cylinder in an approximative analytic approach and also
numerically within the framework of the BCS theory. Specifically for d-wave
pairing, we show that the hc/e periodic current component decreases with the
inverse radius of the loop and investigate its temperature dependence.
