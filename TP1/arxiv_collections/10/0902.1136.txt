Complementing the previous paper in the series, this paper classifies
$|2|$-graded parabolic geometries, listing their important properties: the
group $G_0$, the graded tangent bundle $gr(T)$ and its algebra\"ic bracket, the
relevant cohomology spaces and the standard Tractor bundle $\mc{T}$. Several of
these geometries are then explored in more detail, and the paper ends with a
case study that that partially solves the equivalence problem for generic six
distributions on nine dimensional manifolds.
