We propose a simple technique that achieves a conditional phase shift of pi
radians between two weak lasers with energies at the 1000-photon level. The key
idea is to set up a V-system with two far-off resonant lasers by coupling the
ground state to two excited electronic states. The lasers interact through the
ac Stark shift of the ground state and thereby acquire a large conditional
phase shift.
