By applying a staggered driving force in a prototypical discrete model with a
quartic nonlinearity, we demonstrate the spontaneous formation and destruction
of discrete breathers with a selected frequency due to thermal fluctuations.
The phenomenon exhibits the striking features of stochastic resonance (SR): a
nonmonotonic behavior as noise is increased and breather generation under
subthreshold conditions. The corresponding peak is associated with a matching
between the external driving frequency and the breather frequency at the
average energy given by ambient temperature.
