The current experimental and theoretical status of hadron and jet production
at large transverse momentum in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions is
summarised. The most important RHIC results are compared to theoretical parton
energy loss predictions providing direct information on the (thermo)dynamical
properties of hot and dense QCD matter. Prospects for the LHC are also
outlined.
