Recent demonstrations of high-harmonic generation (HHG) at very high
repetition frequencies (~100 MHz) may allow for the revolutionary transfer of
frequency combs to the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV). This advance necessitates
unifying optical frequency comb technology with strong-field atomic physics.
While strong-field studies of HHG have often focused on above-threshold
harmonic generation (photon energy above the ionization potential), for VUV
frequency combs an understanding of below-threshold harmonic orders and their
generation process is crucial. Here we present a new and quantitative study of
the harmonics 7-13 generated below and near the ionization threshold in xenon
gas. We show multiple generation pathways for these harmonics that are
manifested as on-axis interference in the harmonic yield. This discovery
provides a new understanding of the strong-field, below-threshold dynamics
under the influence of an atomic potential and allows us to quantitatively
assess the achievable coherence of a VUV frequency comb generated through below
threshold harmonics. We find that under reasonable experimental conditions
temporal coherence is maintained. As evidence we present the first explicit VUV
frequency comb structure beyond the 3rd harmonic.
