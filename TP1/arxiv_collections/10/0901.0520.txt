A simple Sweet--Parker-like model for the electron current layer in resistive
Hall magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) reconnection is presented, with the focus on the
collisionless limit. The derivation readily recovers the main results obtained
recently by Malyshkin [PRL, 101, 225001 (2008)] and others, but is much quicker
and more physically transparent. In particular, it highlights the role of
resistive drag in determining the electron outflow velocity. The principal
limitations of any such approach are discussed.
