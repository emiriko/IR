We give a twist to the assumption - discussed in various earlier works - that
gravity plays a role in the collapse of the wave function. This time we discuss
the contrary assumption that the collapse of the wave function plays a role in
the emergence of the gravitational field. We start from the mathematical
framework of a particular Newtonian gravitational collapse theory proposed by
the author longtime ago, and we reconciliate it with the classical equivalence
principle.
