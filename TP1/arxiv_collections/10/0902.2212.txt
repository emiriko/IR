We investigate spin-order of ultracold bosons in an optical lattice by means
of Dynamical Mean-Field Theory. A rich phase diagram with anisotropic magnetic
order is found, both for the ground state and at finite temperatures. Within
the Mott insulator, a ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic transition can be
tuned using a spin-dependent optical lattice. In addition we find a supersolid
phase, in which superfluidity coexists with antiferromagnetic spin order. We
present detailed phase diagrams at finite temperature for the experimentally
realized heteronuclear 87Rb - 41K mixture in a three-dimensional optical
lattice.
