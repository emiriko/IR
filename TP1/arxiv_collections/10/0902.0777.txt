Electron states are studied for quantum dots in a strained Si quantum well,
taking into account both valley and orbital physics. Realistic geometries are
considered, including circular and elliptical dot shapes, parallel and
perpendicular magnetic fields, and (most importantly for valley coupling) the
small local tilt of the quantum well interface away from the crystallographic
axes. In absence of a tilt, valley splitting occurs only between pairs of
states with the same orbital quantum numbers. However, tilting is ubiquitous in
conventional silicon heterostructures, leading to valley-orbit coupling. In
this context, "valley splitting" is no longer a well defined concept, and the
quantity of merit for qubit applications becomes the ground state gap. For
typical dots used as qubits, a rich energy spectrum emerges, as a function of
magnetic field, tilt angle, and orbital quantum number. Numerical and
analytical solutions are obtained for the ground state gap and for the mixing
fraction between the ground and excited states. This mixing can lead to valley
scattering, decoherence, and leakage for Si spin qubits.
