We report on the efficient generation, propagation, and re-emission of
squeezed long-range surface-plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in a gold waveguide.
Squeezed light is used to excite the non-classical SPPs and the re-emitted
quantum state is fully quantum characterized by complete tomographic
reconstruction of the density matrix. We find that the plasmon-assisted
transmission of non-classical light in metallic waveguides can be described by
a Hamiltonian analogue to a beam splitter. This result is explained
theoretically.
