The growth of charge ordering phenomenon in calcium doped lanthanum
manganites La1-xCaxMnO3, x 0.62, 0.67 has been studied using transmission
electron microscopy TEM. The diffuse intensity characteristic of short range
charge ordering is observed even at room temperature. This diffuse intensity
has the local intensity maxima at the incommensurate positions q. With
decreasing temperature, the intensity I of super lattice charge ordered spot
and the magnitude of its modulation wave vector q increases and there exists a
linear relationship between I and q of super lattice charge ordered spot. This
linear dependence can be explained taking in to account the population and the
columbic interactions between the correlated polarons. It appears that the
columbic interactions between the correlated polarons lead to the coherent
distributions of eg charge carriers and thereby giving rise to the uniformly
periodic superlattice charge ordered state to these manganites.
