We have carried out first principles structural relaxation calculations on
the hydrous magnesium silicate Phase A (Mg7Si2O8(OH)6) under high pressures.
Our results show that phase A does not undergo any phase transition upto ~ 45
GPa. We find that non-bonded H--H distance reaches a limiting value of 1.85
angstrom at about 45 GPa. The H--H repulsive strain releasing mechanism in
Phase A is found to be dramatically different from the hydrogen bond bending
one that was proposed by Hofmeister et al1 for Phase B. It is based on the
reduction of one of the O-H bond distances with compression.
