At ultracold temperatures, the Pauli exclusion principle suppresses
collisions between identical fermions. This has motivated the development of
atomic clocks using fermionic isotopes. However, by probing an optical clock
transition with thousands of lattice-confined, ultracold fermionic Sr atoms, we
have observed density-dependent collisional frequency shifts. These collision
effects have been measured systematically and are supported by a theoretical
description attributing them to inhomogeneities in the probe excitation process
that render the atoms distinguishable. This work has also yielded insights for
zeroing the clock density shift.
