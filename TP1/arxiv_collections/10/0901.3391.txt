Entanglement entropy is a measure of quantum correlations between separate
parts of a many-body system, which plays an important role in many areas of
physics. Here we review recent work in which a relation between this quantity
and the Full Counting Statistics description of electron transport was
established for noninteracting fermion systems. Using this relation, which is
of a completely general character, we discuss how the entanglement entropy can
be directly measured by detecting current fluctuations in a driven quantum
system such as a quantum point contact.
