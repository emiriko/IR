A water bridge refers to an experimental "flexible cable" made up of pure
deionized water which can hang across two supports maintained with a
sufficiently large voltage difference. The resulting electric fields within the
deionized water flexible cable, maintain a tension which sustains the water
against the downward force of gravity. A detailed calculation of the water
bridge tension will be provided in terms of the Maxwell pressure tensor in a
dielectric fluid medium. General properties of the dielectric liquid pressure
tensor are discussed along with unusual features of dielectric fluid Bernoulli
flows in an electric field. Analogies between dielectric fluid Bernoulli flows
in strong electric fields and quantum Bernoulli flows in superfluids are
explored.
