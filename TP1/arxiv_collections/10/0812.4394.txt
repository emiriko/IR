In a 4D four-fermion model we study the dynamical restoration of Lorentz and
CPT symmetries at finite temperature. We evaluate the gap equation both at zero
and at finite temperature and observe that, depending on the parameters of the
theory, there is a critical temperature at which the Lorentz and CPT symmetries
are restored.
