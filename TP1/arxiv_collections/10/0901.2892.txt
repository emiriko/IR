The mechanism by which a patterned state accommodates the breaking of
translational symmetry by a phase boundary or a sample wall has been addressed
in the context of Landau branching in type-I superconductors, refinement of
magnetic domains, and compressed elastic sheets. We explore this issue by
studying an ultrathin polymer sheet floating on the surface of a fluid,
decorated with a pattern of parallel wrinkles. At the edge of the sheet, this
corrugated profile meets the fluid meniscus. Rather than branching of wrinkles
into generations of ever-smaller sharp folds, we discover a smooth cascade in
which the coarse pattern in the bulk is matched to fine structure at the edge
by the continuous introduction of discrete, higher wavenumber Fourier modes.
The observed multiscale morphology is controlled by a dimensionless parameter
that quantifies the relative strength of the edge forces and the rigidity of
the bulk pattern.
