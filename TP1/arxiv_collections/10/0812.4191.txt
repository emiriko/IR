Coexistence of competing species is, due to unavoidable fluctuations, always
transient. In this Letter, we investigate the ultimate survival probabilities
characterizing different species in cyclic competition. We show that they often
obey a surprisingly simple, though non-trivial behavior. Within a model where
coexistence is neutrally stable, we demonstrate a robust zero-one law: When the
interactions between the three species are (generically) asymmetric, the
`weakest' species survives at a probability that tends to one for large
population sizes, while the other two are guaranteed to extinct. We rationalize
our findings from stochastic simulations by an analytic approach.
