In this paper, some classes of discrete functions of $k$-valued logic are
considered, that depend on sets of their variables in a particular way.
Obtained results allow to "construct" these functions and to present them in
their tabular, analytical or matrix form, that is, as hypercubes, and in
particular Latin hypercubes. Results connected with identifying of variables of
some classes of functions are obtained.
