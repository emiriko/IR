The impact of nuclear physics on astrophysical r-process models is discussed,
emphasizing the importance of beta-decay properties of neutron-rich nuclei.
Several r-process motivated beta-decay experiments performed at the National
Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory are presented. The experiments include the
measurement of beta-decay half-lives and neutron emission probabilities of
nuclei in regions around Ni-78; Se-90; Zr-106 and Rh-120, as well as
spectroscopic studies of Pd-120. A summary on the different experimental
techniques employed, data analysis, results and impact on model calculations is
presented.
