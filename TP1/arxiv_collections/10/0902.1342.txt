A pairing gap and coherence are the two hallmarks of superconductivity. In a
classical BCS superconductor they are established simultaneously at Tc. In the
cuprates, however, an energy gap (pseudogap) extends above Tc. The origin of
this gap is one of the central issues in high temperature superconductivity.
Recent experimental evidence demonstrates that the pseudogap and the
superconducting gap are associated with different energy scales. It is however
not clear whether they coexist independently or compete. In order to understand
the physics of cuprates and improve their superconducting properties it is
vital to determine whether the pseudogap is friend or foe of high temperature
supercondctivity. Here we report evidence from angle resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) that the pseudogap and high temperature superconductivity
represent two competing orders. We find that there is a direct correlation
between a loss in the low energy spectral weight due to the pseudogap and a
decrease of the coherent fraction of paired electrons. Therefore, the pseudogap
competes with the superconductivity by depleting the spectral weight available
for pairing in the region of momentum space where the superconducting gap is
largest. This leads to a very unusual state in the underdoped cuprates, where
only part of the Fermi surface develops coherence.
