The proposal of a galactic population of intermediate mass black holes
(IMBHs), forming dark matter (DM) ``mini-spikes'' around them, has received
considerable attention in recent years. In fact, leading in some scenarios to
large annihilation fluxes in gamma rays, neutrinos and charged cosmic rays,
these objects are sometimes quoted as one of the most promising targets for
indirect DM searches. In this letter, we apply a detailed statistical analysis
to point out that the existing EGRET data already place very stringent limits
on those scenarios, making it rather unlikely that any of these objects will be
observed with, e.g., the Fermi/GLAST satellite or upcoming Air Cherenkov
telescopes. We also demonstrate that prospects for observing signals in
neutrinos or charged cosmic rays seem even worse. Finally, we address the
question of whether the excess in the cosmic ray positron/electron flux
recently reported by PAMELA/ATIC could be due to a nearby DM point source like
a DM clump or mini-spike; gamma-ray bounds, as well as the recently released
Fermi cosmic ray electron and positron data, again exclude such a possibility
for conventional DM candidates, and strongly constrain it for DM purely
annihilating into light leptons.
