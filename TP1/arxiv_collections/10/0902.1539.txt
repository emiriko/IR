We compute the massless five-point amplitude of open superstrings using the
non-minimal pure spinor formalism and obtain a simple kinematic factor in pure
spinor superspace, which can be viewed as the natural extension of the
kinematic factor of the massless four-point amplitude. It encodes bosonic and
fermionic external states in supersymmetric form and reduces to existing
bosonic amplitudes when expanded in components, therefore proving their
equivalence. We also show how to compute the kinematic structures involving
fermionic states.
