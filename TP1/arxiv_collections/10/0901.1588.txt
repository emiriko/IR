We study the properties of the scalar charm resonances $D_{s0}(2317)$ and
$D_0(2400)$, and the theoretical hidden charm state X(3700) in nuclear matter.
We find that for the $D_{s0}(2317)$ and X(3700) resonances, with negligible and
small width at zero density, respectively, the width becomes about $100 {\rm
MeV}$ and $200 {\rm MeV}$ at normal nuclear matter density, accordingly. For
$D_0(2400)$ the change in width is relatively less important. We discuss the
origin of this new width and trace it to reactions occurring in the nucleus. We
also propose a possible experimental test for those modifications in nuclear
matter, which will bring valuable information on the nature of those scalar
resonances and the interaction of $D$ mesons with nucleons.
