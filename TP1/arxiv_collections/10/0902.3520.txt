Radial Velocity follow-up is essential to establish or exclude the planetary
nature of a transiting companion as well as to accurately determine its mass.
Here we present some elements of an efficient Doppler follow-up strategy, based
on high-resolution spectroscopy, devoted to the characterization of transiting
candidates. Some aspects and results of the radial velocity follow-up of the
CoRoT space mission are presented in order to illustrate the strategy used to
deal with the zoo of transiting candidates.
