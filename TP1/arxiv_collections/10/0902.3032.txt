Decays of both $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$ provide very useful information in
our understanding of low-energy QCD, and experimental signatures for these
decays would be extremely helpful at BES-III. The rare decays of the $\eta$ and
$\eta^\prime$ mesons could serve as a low-energy test of the Standard Model and
its beyond. The sensitivities of the measurements of $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$
decays are discussed at BES-III, in which the $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$ mesons
are produced in the $\psi$ decays.
