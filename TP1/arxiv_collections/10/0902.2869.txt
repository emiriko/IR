The radial quantization of N=8 theory in three dimensions is considered i.e.
we study the N=8 BLG theory on RxS^2. We present the explicit from of the
Lagrangian and the corresponding supersymmetry transformations and
supersymmetry algebra. We study spectrum of this theory and some of its BPS
configurations.
