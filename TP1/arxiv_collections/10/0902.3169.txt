Consider the Mackey functor assigning to each finite group G the Green ring
of finitely generated kG-modules, where k is a field of characteristic p>0.
Thevenaz foresaw in 1988 that the class of primordial groups for this functor
is the family of k-Dress groups. In this paper we prove that this is true for
the subfunctor defined by the Green ring of finitely generated kG-modules of
trivial source.
