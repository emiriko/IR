We present a sample of sources with convex radio spectra peaking at
frequencies above a few GHz, known as "High Frequency Peakers" (HFPs). A
"bright" sample with a flux density limit of 300 mJy at 5 GHz has been
presented by Dallacasa et al. (2000). Here we present the "faint" sample with
flux density between 50 and 300 mJy at 5GHz, restricted to the area around the
North Galactic Cap, where the FIRST catalogue is available. The candidates have
been observed with the VLA at several frequencies ranging from 1.4 to 22 GHz,
in order to derive a simultaneous radio spectrum. The final list of confirmed
HFP sources consists of 61 objects.
