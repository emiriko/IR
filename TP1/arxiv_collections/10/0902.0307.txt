There has been remarkable progress in numerical relativity recently. This has
led to the generation of gravitational waveform signals covering what has been
traditionally termed the three phases of the coalescence of a compact binary -
the inspiral, merger and ringdown. In this paper, we examine the usefulness of
inspiral only templates for both detection and parameter estimation of the full
coalescence waveforms generated by numerical relativity simulations. To this
end, we deploy as search templates waveforms based on the effective one-body
waveforms terminated at the light-ring as well as standard post-Newtonian
waveforms. We find that both of these are good for detection of signals.
Parameter estimation is good at low masses, but degrades as the mass of the
binary system increases.
