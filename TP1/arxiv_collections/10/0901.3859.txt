In this paper a stochastic reaction diffusion system is considered, which
models the spread of a finite population reacting with a non-renewable resource
in the presence of individual based noise. A two-parameter phase diagram is
established to describe the large time evolution, distinguishing between
certain death or possible life of the population.
