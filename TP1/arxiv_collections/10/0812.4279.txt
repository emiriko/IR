We present several new characterizations of correlated equilibria in games
with continuous utility functions. These have the advantage of being more
computationally and analytically tractable than the standard definition in
terms of departure functions. We use these characterizations to construct
effective algorithms for approximating a single correlated equilibrium or the
entire set of correlated equilibria of a game with polynomial utility
functions.
