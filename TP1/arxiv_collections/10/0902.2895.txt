The behavior of non-local thermal-equilibrium (NLTE) plasmas plays a central
role in many fields of modern-day physics, such as laser-produced plasmas,
astrophysics, inertial or magnetic confinement fusion devices, or X-ray
sources. The proper description of these media in stationary cases requires to
solve linear systems of thousands or more rate equations. A possible
simplification for this arduous numerical task may lie in some type of
statistical average, such as configuration or superconfiguration average.
However to assess the validity of this procedure and to handle cases where
isolated lines play an important role, it may be important to deal with
detailed levels systems. This involves matrices with sometimes billions of
elements, which are rather sparse but still involve thousands of diagonals. We
propose here a numerical algorithm based on the LU decomposition for such
linear systems. This method turns out to be orders of magnitude faster than the
traditional Gauss elimination. And at variance with alternate methods based on
conjugate gradients or minimization, no convergence or accuracy issues have
been faced. Some examples are discussed in connection with the krypton and
tungsten cases discussed at the last NLTE meeting. Furthermore, to assess the
validity of configuration average, several criteria are discussed. While a
criterion based on detailed balance is relevant in cases not too far from LTE
but insufficient otherwise, an alternate criterion based on the use of a
fictive configuration temperature is proposed and successfully tested. It
appears that detailed calculations are sometimes necessary, which supports the
search for an efficient solver as the one proposed here.
