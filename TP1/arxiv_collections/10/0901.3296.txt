Using clover fermions on CP-PACS dynamical configurations, we consider a
number of ways of measuring hadronic electric polarizability, an
$|\mathbf{E}|^{2}$ effect in hadron masses, using lattice techniques. We
consider the effects of periodic and Dirichlet boundary conditions, the field
linearization postulate as well as a quantized electric field. We also consider
two ways of formulating the classical vector potential which describes a
uniform electric field in combination with the other possibilities.
