We consider the anomalous thermoelectric transport in gapped single and
bilayer graphene where the gap may be due to broken inversion symmetry. In the
presence of the gap, non-trivial Berry phase effects can be shown to mediate a
transverse thermoelectric voltage in response to an applied temperature
gradient even in the absence of a perpendicular magnetic field. This
spontaneous, anomalous Nernst effect is nonzero for non-uniform chemical
potential in the two inequivalent valleys in the graphene band structure.
Conversely, the Nernst response can be used to create a valley-index
polarization between the two transverse sample edges as in the analogous valley
Hall effect.
