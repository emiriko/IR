We show that Quantum Mechanics can be interpreted as a modification of the
Euclidean nature of 3-d space into a particular Weyl affine space which we call
Q-wis. This is proved using the Bohm-de Broglie causal formulation of Quantum
Mechanics. In the Q-wis geometry, the length of extended objects changes from
point to point. In our proposed geometrical formulation, deformation of the
standard rulers used to measure physical distances are in the core of quantum
effects.
