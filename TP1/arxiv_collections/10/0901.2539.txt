We study the single transverse-spin asymmetry for open charm production in
the semi-inclusive lepton-hadron deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) and $pp$
collision. Within collinear factorization approach, we find that the asymmetry
is sensitive to the twist-3 trigluon correlation functions in the proton. With
a simple model for the trigluon correlation functions, we estimate the
asymmetry in SIDIS for both COMPASS and eRHIC kinematics, as well as in $pp$
collision at RHIC energy. We discuss the possibilities of extracting the
trigluon correlation functions in these experiments.
