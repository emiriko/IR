We report the first magnetic-field-dependent Raman scattering studies on
Pb(Zr,Ti)O3-CoFe2O4 bilayer multiferroic system. The phonon frequencies of the
nano-bilayers obviously change with magnetic field, which is absent in the
single Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 films. The magnetostriction of the CoFe2O4 layer generates
stress mechanically transferred to the Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 layer, resulting in the mode
changes. The observed magnetic-field-induced softening of the soft mode in the
Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 layer bears a striking resemblance to direct magnetoelectric output
in the bilayers, providing evidence for stress-mediated magnetoelectric
coupling mechanism in the multiferroic bi-layers.
