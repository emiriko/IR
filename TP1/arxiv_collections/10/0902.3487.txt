We present phase space distributions and multiplicities of K+, K- and phi
mesons produced in Ar+KCl reactions at a kinetic beam energy of 1.756 AGeV and
measured with the HADES spectrometer. The inverse slope parameters and yields
of kaons supplement the systematics of previous measurements. The percentage of
K- mesons coming fromphi decay is found to be 18+- 7%.
