We give an explicit description of the mutation classes of quivers of type
\tilde{A}_n. Furthermore, we provide a complete classification of cluster
tilted algebras of type \tilde{A}_n up to derived equivalence. We show that the
bounded derived category of such an algebra depends on four combinatorial
parameters of the corresponding quiver.
