The weak value of an observable is experimentally accessible by weak
measurements as theoretically analyzed by Aharonov et al. and recently
experimentally demonstrated. We introduce a weak operator associated with the
weak values and give a general framework of quantum operations to the W
operator in parallel with the Kraus representation of the completely positive
map for the density operator. The decoherence effect is also investigated in
terms of the weak measurement by a shift of a probe wave function of continuous
variable. As an application, we demonstrate how the geometric phase is affected
by the bit flip noise.
