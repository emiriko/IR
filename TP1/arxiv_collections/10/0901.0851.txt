Numerical schemes for Einstein's vacuum equation are developed. Einstein's
equation in harmonic gauge is second order symmetric hyperbolic. It is
discretized in four-dimensional spacetime by Finite Differences, Finite
Elements, and Interior Penalty Discontinuous Galerkin methods, the latter
related to Regge calculus. The schemes are split into space and time and new
time-stepping schemes for wave equations are derived. The methods are evaluated
for linear and non-linear test problems of the Apples-with-Apples collection.
