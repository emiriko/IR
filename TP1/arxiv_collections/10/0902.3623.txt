We present the only proof of Pierre Fermat by descente infinie that is known
to exist today. As the text of its Latin original requires active mathematical
interpretation, it is more a proof sketch than a proper mathematical proof. We
discuss descente infinie from the mathematical, logical, historical,
linguistic, and refined logic-historical points of view. We provide the
required preliminaries from number theory and develop a self-contained proof in
a modern form, which nevertheless is intended to follow Fermat's ideas closely.
We then annotate an English translation of Fermat's original proof with terms
from the modern proof. Including all important facts, we present a concise and
self-contained discussion of Fermat's proof sketch, which is easily accessible
to laymen in number theory as well as to laymen in the history of mathematics,
and which provides new clarification of the Method of Descente Infinie to the
experts in these fields. Last but not least, this paper fills a gap regarding
the easy accessibility of the subject.
