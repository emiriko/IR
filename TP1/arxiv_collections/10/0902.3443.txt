In the present work, $D_{s}$ and $B_{s}$ meson parameters are investigated in
the framework of thermal QCD sum rules. The temperature dependence of the mass
and the leptonic decay constants are investigated by using Borel transform sum
rules and Hilbert moment sum rules. To increase sensitivity, the vacuum
contributions are subtracted from thermal expressions and the temperature
dependences of the leptonic decay constants and meson masses are studied.
