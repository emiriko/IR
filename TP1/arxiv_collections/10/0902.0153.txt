We report the existence of a field-induced ferromagnetic transition in the
magnetically ordered state (<69 K) of an intermetallic compound, Tb5Si3, and
this transition is distinctly first-order at 1.8 K (near 60 kOe), whereas it
appears to become second order near 20 K. The finding we stress is that the
electrical resistivity becomes suddenly large in the high-field state after
this transition and this is observed in the entire temperature range in the
magnetically ordered state. Such an enhancement of 'positive' magnetoresistance
(below 100 kOe) at the metamagnetic transition field is unexpected on the basis
that the application of magnetic field should favor a low-resistive state due
to alignment of spins.
