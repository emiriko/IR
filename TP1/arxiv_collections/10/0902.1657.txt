The physics of charm has become one of the best laboratories exposing the
limitations of the naive constituent quark model and also giving hints into a
more mature description of meson spectroscopy, beyond the simple
quark--antiquark configurations. In this talk we review some recent studies of
multiquark components in the charm sector and discuss in particular exotic and
non-exotic four-quark systems, both with pairwise and many-body forces.
