A precise measurement of the hadron production from interactions of 30 GeV
protons on carbon target is performed by NA61 (SHINE) experiment at the CERN
SPS. The inclusive spectra of pions and kaons on the carbon target obtained
from NA61 measurements constrain the neutrino flux in the T2K long baseline
neutrino oscillation experiment at J-PARC, Japan. The article presents
description of the NA61 apparatus together with the preliminary results from
the pilot 2007 run.
