Recent laboratory experiments on solute migration in composite porous columns
have shown an asymmetry in the solute arrival time upon reversal of the flow
direction, which is not explained by current paradigms of transport. In this
work, we propose a definition for the solute flux across sharp interfaces and
explore the underlying microscopic particle dynamics by applying Monte Carlo
simulation. Our results are consistent with previous experimental findings and
explain the observed transport asymmetry. An interpretation of the proposed
physical mechanism in terms of a flux rectification is also provided. The
approach is quite general and can be extended to other situations involving
transport across sharp interfaces.
