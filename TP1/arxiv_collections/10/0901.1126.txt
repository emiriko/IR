We suggest that dark matter can be identified with a stable composite fermion
X^0, that arises within the holographic AdS/CFT models, where the Higgs boson
emerges as a composite pseudo-goldstone boson. The predicted properties of X^0
satisfies the cosmological bounds, with m_X = O(TeV). Thus, through a deeper
understanding of the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking, a resolution
of the Dark Matter enigma is found. Furthermore, by proposing a discrete
structure of the Higgs vacuum, one can get a distinct approach to the
cosmological constant problem.
