We explore the frequency-dependent relative permittivity of Ruddlesden-Popper
series Sr(n+1)Ti(n)O(3n+1) (n =1,2,3) thin films as a function of temperature
and dc electric field. Interdigitated capacitors and coplanar waveguides were
used to extract the frequency response from 500 Hz to 40 GHz. At room
temperature, the in-plane relative permittivities obtained for
Sr(n+1)Ti(n)O(3n+1) (n =1,2,3) were 42+/-3, 54+/-3, and 77+/-2, respectively,
and were independent of frequency. At low temperatures, permittivity increases
and electric field tunability develops in Sr(4)Ti(3)O(10).
