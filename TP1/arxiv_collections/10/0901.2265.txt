We study the torque on low mass protoplanets on fixed circular orbits,
embedded in a protoplanetary disc in the isothermal limit. For low mass
protoplanets and large viscosity the corotation torque behaves as expected from
linear theory. However, when the viscosity becomes small enough to enable
horseshoe turns to occur, the linear corotation torque exists only temporarily
after insertion of a planet into the disc, being replaced by the horseshoe drag
first discussed by Ward. This happens after a time that is equal to the
horseshoe libration period reduced by a factor amounting to about twice the
disc aspect ratio. This torque scales with the radial gradient of specific
vorticity, as does the linear torque, but we find it to be many times larger.
If the viscosity is large enough for viscous diffusion across the coorbital
region to occur within a libration period, we find that the horseshoe drag may
be sustained. If not, the corotation torque saturates leaving only the linear
Lindblad torques. As the magnitude of the non linear coorbital torque
(horseshoe drag) is always found to be larger than the linear torque, we find
that the sign of the total torque may change even for for mildly positive
surface density gradients. In combination with a kinematic viscosity large
enough to keep the torque from saturating, strong sustained deviations from
linear theory and outward or stalled migration may occur in such cases
(abridged).
