We have designed and demonstrated a Superconducting Quantum Interference
Device (SQUID) array linearized with cryogenic feedback. To achieve the
necessary loop gain a 300 element series array SQUID is constructed from three
monolithic 100-element series arrays. A feedback resistor completes the loop
from the SQUID output to the input coil. The short feedback path of this
Linearized SQUID Array (LISA) allows for a substantially larger flux-locked
loop bandwidth as compared to a SQUID flux-locked loop that includes a room
temperature amplifier. The bandwidth, linearity, noise performance, and dynamic
range of the LISA are sufficient for its use in our target application: the
multiplexed readout of transition-edge sensor bolometers.
