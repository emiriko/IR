We present the results of a theoretical analysis of two-dimensionally
modulated incommensurate phases in crystals and define the space distribution
of magnetization and polarization vector in the incommensurate phase and
demonstrate that their averaging in the incommensurate phase period equals
zero. We apply symmetry arguments and show that despite the fact that the phase
transition in the system is described by reducible representation of the space
group high symmetry phase the superspace symmetry group of the in-commensurate
phase contains all symmetry point groups of the high symmetry phase. We analyze
the influence of the fractal distribu-tion of defects on the evolution of the
incommensurate phase and show that a phase transition occurs in the
incommensurate phase that is accompanied by the inversion loss.
