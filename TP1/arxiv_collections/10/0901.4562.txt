We demonstrate a simple method to tailor the magnetization reversal
mechanisms of Co/Pt multilayers by depositing them onto large area nanoporous
anodized alumina (AAO) with various aspect ratios, A = pore depth/diameter.
Magnetization reversal of composite (Co/Pt)/AAO films with large A is governed
by strong domain-wall pinning which gradually transforms into a
rotation-dominated reversal for samples with smaller A, as investigated by a
first-order reversal curve method in conjunction with analysis of the angular
dependent switching fields. The change of the magnetization reversal mode is
attributed to topographical changes induced by the aspect ratio of the AAO
templates.
