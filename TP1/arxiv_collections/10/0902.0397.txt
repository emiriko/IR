The Mn to Cr mass ratio in supernova ejecta has recently been proposed as a
tracer of Type Ia SN progenitor metallicity. We review the advantages and
problems of this observable quantity, and discuss them in the framework of the
Tycho Supernova Remnant. The fluxes of the Mn and Cr Kalpha lines in the X-ray
spectra of Tycho observed by the Suzaku satellite suggests a progenitor of
supersolar metallicity.
