To solve the spinor-spinor Bethe-Salpeter equation in Euclidean space we
propose a novel method related to the use of hyperspherical harmonics. We
suggest an appropriate extension to form a new basis of spin-angular harmonics
that is suitable for a representation of the vertex functions. We present a
numerical algorithm to solve the Bethe-Salpeter equation and investigate in
detail the properties of the solution for the scalar, pseudoscalar and vector
meson exchange kernels including the stability of bound states. We also compare
our results to the non relativistic ones and to the results given by light
front dynamics.
