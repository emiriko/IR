In QFT the effective potential is an important tool to study symmetry
breaking phenomena. It is known that, in some theories, the canonical approach
and the path-integral approach yield different effective potentials. In this
paper we investigate this for the Euclidean N=2 linear sigma model. Both the
Green's functions and the effective potential will be computed in three
different ways. The relative merits of the various approaches are discussed.
