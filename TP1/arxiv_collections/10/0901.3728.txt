Newly observed enhanced linear optical features of fullerene solutions (Raman
scattering and one-photon luminescence) are due to clusterization of fullerene
molecules themselves as well as their composites with solvent molecules. A
direct connection between the enhanced linear effects and nonlinear behavior of
the solutions is discussed and empirical and computational tests of the
solutions nonlinear optics efficacy are suggested.
