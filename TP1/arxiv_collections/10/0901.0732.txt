The equations of motion for a fully ionized hydrogenic plasma in applied
coaxial electric and magnetic fields are analyzed, where the term for the Hall
effect in the generalized Ohm's law equation picks up a factor of 1/2 relative
to its usual expression. Magnetization of the medium is incorporated through
the decomposition of the Hall term and the inclusion of the magnetization
force, which is found to equal or exceed the gradient of the scalar pressure. A
limit on the kinetic pressure obtains which corresponds to the usual limit of
unity for a certain selection of parameters. Solutions of these equations for
the free motion of the charges in the case of an infinite column with azimuthal
symmetry are compared for various prescribed pressure profiles, where one finds
that the profile near the outer edge plays an important role in the feasibility
of the equilibrium.
