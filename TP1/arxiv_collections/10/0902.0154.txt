Given a connected Lipschitz domain U we let L(U) be the subset of functions
in 2nd order Sobolev space whose gradient (in the sense of trace) is equal to
the inward pointing unit normal to U. The the Aviles Giga functional over L(U)
serves as a model in connection with problems in liquid crystals and thin film
blisters, it is also the most natural higher order generalisation of the Modica
Mortola functional. Jabin, Otto, Perthame characterised a class of functions
which includes all limits of sequences whose Aviles Giga energy goes to zero. A
corollary to their work is that if there exists such a sequence for a bounded
domain U, then U must be a ball and the limiting function must be the distance
from the boundary. We prove a quantitative generalisation of this corollary for
the class of bounded convex sets.
  As a consequence of this we show that if U has C^2 boundary and is close to a
ball, then for all small enough \ep the minimiser of I_{\ep} is close to the
distance function from the boundary.
