We investigate domain walls between topologically ordered phases in two
spatial dimensions and present a simple but general framework from which their
degrees of freedom can be understood. The approach we present exploits the
results on topological symmetry breaking that we have introduced and presented
elsewhere. After summarizing the method, we work out predictions for the
spectrum of edge excitations and for the transport through edges in some
representative examples. These include domain walls between the Abelian and
non-Abelian topological phases of Kitaev's honeycomb lattice model in a
magnetic field, as well as recently proposed domain walls between spin
polarized and unpolarized non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall states at
different filling fractions.
