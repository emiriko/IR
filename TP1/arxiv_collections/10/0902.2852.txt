We present a study of correlations between X-ray spectral and timing
properties observed from a number of Galactic Black Hole (BH) binaries during
hard-soft state spectral evolution. We analyze 17 transition episodes from 8 BH
sources observed with RXTE. Our scaling technique for BH mass determination
uses a correlation between spectral index and quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO)
frequency. In addition, we use a correlation between index and the
normalization of the disk "seed" component to cross-check the BH mass
determination and estimate the distance to the source. While the index-QPO
correlations for two given sources contain information on the ratio of the BH
masses in those sources, the index-normalization correlations depend on the
ratio of the BH masses and the distance square ratio. In fact, the
index-normalization correlation also discloses the index-mass accretion rate
saturation effect given that the normalization of disk "seed" photon supply is
proportional to the disk mass accretion rate. We present arguments that this
observationally established index saturation effect is a signature of the bulk
motion (converging) flow onto black hole which was early predicted by the
dynamical Comptonization theory. We use GRO J1655-40 as a primary reference
source for which the BH mass, distance and inclination angle are evaluated by
dynamical measurements with unprecedented precision among other Galactic BH
sources. We apply our scaling technique to determine BH masses and distances
forCygnus X-1, GX 339-4, 4U 1543-47, XTE J1550-564, XTE J1650-500, H 1743-322
and XTE J1859-226. Good agreement of our results for sources with known values
of BH masses and distance provides an independent verification for our scaling
technique.
