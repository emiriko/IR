In this work we suggest a simple model of the cosmological constant as the
coefficient of the quantum tunneling of vacuum fluctuations (with wave length
larger than Planck length) at tiny, boundary spherical shell of the universe
(with thickness equivalent to Planck length and radius equivalent to scale
factor). Roughly speaking, given fluctuations can, by quantum tunneling (i.e.
scattering with a potential barrier with highness equivalent to Planck energy
and width proportional to, approximately, three hundred Planck length) leave
universe and arrive in its exterior, i.e. multi-universe (in sense of Linde
chaotic inflation theory universe can be considered as a causally-luminally
connected space domain while its exterior can be considered as a space domain
without causal-luminal connections with universe). It is in full agreement with
usual quantum mechanics and quantum field theory as well as WMAP observational
data (especially fine tuning condition).
