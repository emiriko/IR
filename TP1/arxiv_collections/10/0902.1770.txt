We survey recent studies of Gauss-Bonnet gravity and its dual conformal field
theories, including their relation to the violation of the Kovtun-Starinets-Son
viscosity bound. Via holography, we can also study properties such as
microcausality and unitarity of boundary field theory duals. Such studies in
turn supply constraints on bulk gravitational theories, consigning some of them
to the swampland.
