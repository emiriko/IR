The results from muon spin relaxation experiments on the non-centrosymmetric
intermetallic superconductor LaNiC$_2$ are reported. We find that the onset of
superconductivity coincides with the appearance of spontaneous magnetic fields,
implying that in the superconducting state time reversal symmetry is broken. An
analysis of the possible pairing symmetries suggests only four triplet states
compatible with this observation, all of which are non-unitary. They include
the intriguing possibility of triplet pairing with the full point group
symmetry of the crystal, which is only possible in a non-centrosymmetric
superconductor.
