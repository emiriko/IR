The properties of the Extreme Horizontal Branch stars are quite well
understood, but much uncertainty surrounds the many paths that bring a star to
this peculiar configuration. Asteroseismology of pulsating EHB stars has been
performed on a number of objects, bringing us to the stage where comparisons of
the inferred properties with evolutionary models becomes feasible. In this
review I outline our current understanding of the formation and evolution of
these stars, with emphasis on recent progress. The aim is to show how the
physical parameters derived by asteroseismology can enable the discrimination
between different evolutionary models.
