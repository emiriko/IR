We present a method of computing with matrices over very small finite fields
of size larger than 2. Specifically, we show how the Method of Four Russians
can be efficiently adapted to these larger fields, and introduce a row-wise
matrix compression scheme that both reduces memory requirements and allows one
to vectorize element operations. We also present timings which confirm the
efficiency of these methods and exceed the speed of the fastest implementations
the authors are aware of.
