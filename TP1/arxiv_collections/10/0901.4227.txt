Flares being partially occulted by the solar limb, are the best reservoir of
our knowledge about hard X-ray loop-top sources. Recently, the survey of
partially occulted flares observed by the RHESSI has been published (Krucker &
Lin 2008). The extensive YOHKOH database still awaits such activities. This
work is an attempt to fill this gap. Among from 1286 flares in the YOHKOH Hard
X-ray Telescope Flare Catalogue, for which the hard X-ray images had been
enclosed, we identified 98 events that occurred behind the solar limb. We
investigated their hard X-ray spectra and spatial structure. We found that in
most cases the hard X-ray spectrum of partially occulted flares consists of two
components, non-thermal and thermal, which are co-spatial. The photon energy
spectra of the partially occulted flares are systematically steeper than
spectra of the non-occulted flares. Such a difference we explain as a
consequence of intrinsically dissimilar conditions ruling in coronal parts of
flares, in comparison with the footpoints which usually dominate the hard X-ray
emission of disk flares. At least two reasons of the difference should be taken
into consideration: (1) stronger contamination of hard X-rays with emission of
thermal plasma, (2) different mechanism in which non-thermal electrons radiate
their energy. A schematic picture, in which thin-target mechanism is
responsible for hard X-ray emission of loop-top sources and thick-target
mechanism -- for emission of footpoint sources, can be modified by the presence
of some coronal thick-target sources. At least a part of them suggests a
magnetic trapping. Investigated flares do not respond the global magnetic
configuration of the solar corona. For their characteristics conclusive is
rather the local magnetic configuration in which they were developed.
