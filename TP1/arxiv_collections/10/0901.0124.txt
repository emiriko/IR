A recently discovered mechanism of electric dipole spin resonance, mediated
by the hyperfine interaction, is investigated experimentally and theoretically.
The effect is studied using a spin-selective transition in a GaAs double
quantum dot. The resonant frequency is sensitive to the instantaneous hyperfine
effective field, revealing a nuclear polarization created by driving the
resonance. A device incorporating a micromagnet exhibits a magnetic field
difference between dots, allowing electrons in either dot to be addressed
selectively. An unexplained additional signal at half the resonant frequency is
presented.
