In amorphous superconducting thin films of $Nb_{0.15}Si_{0.85}$ and $InO_x$,
a finite Nernst coefficient can be detected in a wide range of temperature and
magnetic field. Due to the negligible contribution of normal quasi-particles,
superconducting fluctuations easily dominate the Nernst response in the entire
range of study. In the vicinity of the critical temperature and in the
zero-field limit, the magnitude of the signal is in quantitative agreement with
what is theoretically expected for the Gaussian fluctuations of the
superconducting order parameter. Even at higher temperatures and finite
magnetic field, the Nernst coefficient is set by the size of superconducting
fluctuations. The Nernst coefficient emerges as a direct probe of the ghost
critical field, the normal-state mirror of the upper critical field. Moreover,
upon leaving the normal state with fluctuating Cooper pairs, we show that the
temperature evolution of the Nernst coefficient is different whether the system
enters a vortex solid, a vortex liquid or a phase-fluctuating superconducting
regime.
