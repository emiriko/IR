This note reports on an independent implementation of calculating one-loop
amplitudes semi-numerically using generalized unitarity techniques. The
algorithm implemented in form of a C++ code closely follows the method by
Ellis, Giele, Kunszt and Melnikov. For the case of gluons, the algorithm is
briefly reviewed. Double-precision results are presented documenting the
accuracy and efficiency of this computation.
