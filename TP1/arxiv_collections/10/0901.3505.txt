We present a simple scheme using two identical cross-phase modulation
processes in decoherence environment to generate superpositions of two coherent
states with the opposite phases, which are known as cat states. The scheme is
shown to be robust against decoherence due to photon absorption losses and
other errors, and the design of its experimental setup is also discussed.
