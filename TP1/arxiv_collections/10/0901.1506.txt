We construct the Schubert basis of the torus-equivariant K-homology of the
affine Grassmannian of a simple algebraic group G, using the K-theoretic
NilHecke ring of Kostant and Kumar. This is the K-theoretic analogue of a
construction of Peterson in equivariant homology.
  For the case G = SL_n, the K-homology of the affine Grassmannian is
identified with a sub-Hopf algebra of the ring of symmetric functions. The
Schubert basis is represented by inhomogeneous symmetric functions, called
K-k-Schur functions, whose highest degree term is a k-Schur function. The dual
basis in K-cohomology is given by the affine stable Grothendieck polynomials,
verifying a conjecture of Lam. In addition, we give a Pieri rule in K-homology.
  Many of our constructions have geometric interpretations using Kashiwara's
thick affine flag manifold.
