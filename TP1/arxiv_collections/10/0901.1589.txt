After the launch and successful beginning of operations of the FERMI
satellite, the topics related to high-energy observations of gamma-ray bursts
have obtained a considerable attention by the scientific community.
Undoubtedly, the diagnostic power of high-energy observations in constraining
the emission processes and the physical conditions of gamma-ray burst is
relevant. We briefly discuss how gamma-ray burst observations with ground-based
imaging array Cerenkov telescopes, in the GeV-TeV range, can compete and
cooperate with FERMI observations, in the MeV-GeV range, to allow researchers
to obtain a more detailed and complete picture of the prompt and afterglow
phases of gamma-ray bursts.
