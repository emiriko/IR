We report the results from a computational study of the self-assembly of
amphiphilic di-tethered nanospheres using molecular simulation. As a function
of the interaction strength and directionality of the tether-tether
interactions, we predict the formation of four highly ordered phases not
previously reported for nanoparticle systems. We find a double diamond
structure comprised of a zincblende (binary diamond) arrangement of spherical
micelles with a complementary diamond network of nanoparticles (ZnS/D); a phase
of alternating spherical micelles in a NaCl structure with a complementary
simple cubic network of nanoparticles to form an overall crystal structure
identical to that of AlCu_2Mn (NaCl/SC); an alternating tetragonal ordered
cylinder phase with a tetragonal mesh of nanoparticles described by the [8,8,4]
Archimedean tiling (TC/T); and an alternating diamond phase in which both
diamond networks are formed by the tethers (AD) within a nanoparticle matrix.
We compare these structures with those observed in linear and star triblock
copolymer systems.
