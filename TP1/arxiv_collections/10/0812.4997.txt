Using long C_{N}H_{2} conjugated carbon chains with the polyynic structure as
prototypical examples of one-dimensional (1D) semiconductors, we discuss
self-localization of excess charge carriers into 1D large polarons in the
presence of the interaction with a surrounding polar solvent. The solvation
mechanism of self-trapping is different from the polaron formation due to
coupling with bond-length modulations of the underlying atomic lattice
well-known in conjugated polymers. Model ab initio computations employing the
hybrid B3LYP density functional in conjunction with the polarizable continuum
model are carried out demonstrating the formation of both electron- and
hole-polarons. Polarons can emerge entirely due to solvation but even larger
degrees of charge localization occur when accompanied by atomic displacements.
