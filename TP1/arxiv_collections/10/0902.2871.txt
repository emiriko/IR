The present work consisted in developing a plateau game. There are the
traditional ones (monopoly, cluedo, ect.) but those which interest us leave
less place at the chance (luck) than to the strategy such that the chess game.
Kallah is an old African game, its rules are simple but the strategies to be
used are very complex to implement. Of course, they are based on a strongly
mathematical basis as in the film "Rain-Man" where one can see that gambling
can be payed with strategies based on mathematical theories. The Artificial
Intelligence gives the possibility "of thinking" to a machine and, therefore,
allows it to make decisions. In our work, we use it to give the means to the
computer choosing its best movement.
