We present a basic tutorial for implementing surface mount technology in
lab-built scientific instruments. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages
of using surface mount chips. We also describe methods for the development and
prototyping of surface mount circuitry in home-built electronics. The method of
soldering surface mount components in a common toaster oven is described. We
provide advice from our own experience in developing this technology, and argue
that surface mount technology is often preferable to using leaded components
when building large circuits, and is essential if the desired component
characteristics are only available in surface mount packages.
