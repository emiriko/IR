Homogeneous Multi-scale Entanglement Renormalization Ansazt (MERA) state have
been recently introduced to describe quantum critical systems. Here we present
an extensive analysis of the properties of such states by clarifying the
definition of their transfer super-operator whose structure is studied within a
informational theoretical approach. Explicit expressions for computing the
expectation values of symmetric observables are given both in the case of
finite size systems and in the thermodynamic limit of infinitely many
particles.
