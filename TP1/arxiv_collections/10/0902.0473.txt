A fully explicit renormalized quantum action functional is constructed for
the O(N)-model in the auxiliary field formulation at next-to-leading order
(NLO) of the 1/N expansion. Counterterms are consistently and explicitly
derived for arbitrary constant vacuum expectation value of the scalar and
auxiliary fields. The renormalized NLO pion propagator is exact at this order
and satisfies Goldstone's theorem. Elimination of the auxiliary field sector at
the level of the functional provides with order N^0 accuracy the renormalized
effective action of the model in terms of the original variables. Alternative
elimination of the pion and sigma propagators provides the renormalized NLO
effective potential for the expectation values of the N-vector and of the
auxiliary field with the same accuracy.
