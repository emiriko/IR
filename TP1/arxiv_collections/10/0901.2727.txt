We study numerically chaotic behavior associated with a hyperbolic strange
attractor of Plykin type in the model of Hunt, an artificially constructed
dynamical system with continuous time. There are presented portraits of the
attractor, plots of realizations for chaotic signal generated by the system,
illustrations of the sensitive dependence on initial conditions for the
trajectories on the attractor. Quantitative characteristics of the attractor
are estimated, including the Lyapunov exponents and the attractor dimension. We
discuss symbolic dynamics on the attractor, find out and analyze some unstable
periodic orbit belonging to the attractor.
