We study optimal rates for quantum communication over a single use of a
channel, which itself can correspond to a finite number of uses of a channel
with arbitrarily correlated noise. The corresponding capacity is often referred
to as the one-shot quantum capacity. In this paper, we prove bounds on the
one-shot quantum capacity of an arbitrary channel. This allows us to compute
the quantum capacity of a channel with arbitrarily correlated noise, in the
limit of asymptotically many uses of the channel. In the memoryless case, we
explicitly show that our results reduce to known expressions for the quantum
capacity.
