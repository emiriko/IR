We investigate the performance of superconducting nanowire photon detectors
fabricated from ultra-thin Nb. A direct comparison is made between these
detectors and similar nanowire detectors fabricated from NbN. We find that Nb
detectors are significantly more susceptible than NbN to thermal instability
(latching) at high bias. We show that the devices can be stabilized by reducing
the input resistance of the readout. Nb detectors optimized in this way are
shown to have approximately 2/3 the reset time of similar large-active-area NbN
detectors of the same geometry, with approximately 6% detection efficiency for
single photons at 470 nm.
