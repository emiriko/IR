We present gauge-invariant theory of the dynamic inverse spin Hall effect
driven by the spin--orbit interaction in metallic systems. Charge conservation
is imposed diagrammatically by including vertex corrections. We show the charge
current is induced by an effective electric field that is proportional to the
spin current pumped by the magnetization dynamics. The result is consistent
with recent experiments.
