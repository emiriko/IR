We experimentally investigate the collapse dynamics of dipolar Bose- Einstein
condensates of chromium atoms in different harmonic trap geometries, from
prolate to oblate. The evolutions of the condensates in the unstable regime are
compared to three-dimensional simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation
including three-body losses. In order to probe the phase coherence of collapsed
condensates, we induce the collapse in several condensates simultaneously and
let them interfere.
