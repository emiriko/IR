We report the results of interferometric HCN(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) observations
of four luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs), NGC 2623, Mrk 266, Arp 193, and NGC
1377, as a final sample of our systematic survey using the Nobeyama Millimeter
Array. Our survey contains the most systematic interferometric,
spatially-resolved, simultaneous HCN(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) observations of LIRGs.
Ground-based infrared spectra of these LIRGs are also presented to elucidate
the nature of the energy sources at the nuclei. We derive the
HCN(1-0)/HCO+(1-0) brightness-temperature ratios of these LIRGs and confirm the
previously discovered trend that LIRG nuclei with luminous buried AGN
signatures in infrared spectra tend to show high HCN(1-0)/HCO+(1-0)
brightness-temperature ratios, as seen in AGNs, while starburst-classified LIRG
nuclei in infrared spectra display small ratios, as observed in
starburst-dominated galaxies. Our new results further support the argument that
the HCN(1-0)/HCO+(1-0) brightness-temperature ratio can be used to
observationally separate AGN-important and starburst-dominant galaxy nuclei.
