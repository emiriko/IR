If f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) is a polynomial dependent on a large number of
independent Bernoulli random variables, what can be said about the maximum
concentration of f on any single value? For linear polynomials, this reduces to
one version of the classical Littlewood-Offord problem: Given nonzero constants
a_1 through a_n, what is the maximum number of sums of the form +/- a_1 +/- a_2
+/-... +/- a_n which take on any single value? Here we consider the case where
f is either a bilinear form or a quadratic form. For the bilinear case, we show
that the only forms having concentration significantly larger than n^{-1} are
those which are in a certain sense very close to being degenerate. For the
quadratic case, we show that no form having many nonzero coefficients has
concentration significantly larger than n^{-1/2}. In both cases the results are
nearly tight.
