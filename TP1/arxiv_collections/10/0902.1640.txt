A mass-radius relationship is proposed for solid planets and solid cores
ranging from 1 to 100 Earth-mass planets. It relies on the assumption that
solid spheres are composed of iron and silicates, around which a variable
amount of water is added. The M-R law has been set up assuming that the
planetary composition is similar to the averaged composition for silicates and
iron obtained from the major elements ratio of 94 stars hosting exoplanets.
Except on Earth for which a tremendous amount of data is available, the
composition of silicate mantles and metallic cores cannot be constrained.
Similarly, thermal profiles are poorly known. In this work, the effect of
compositional parameters and thermal profiles on radii estimates is quantified.
It will be demonstrated that uncertainties related to composition and
temperature are of second order compared to the effect of the water amount. The
Super-Earths family includes four classes of planets: iron-rich, silicate-rich,
water-rich, or with a thick atmosphere. For a given mass, the planetary radius
increases significantly from the ironrich to the atmospheric-rich planet. Even
if some overlaps are likely, M-R measurements could be accurate enough to
ascertain the discovery of an earth-like planet .The present work describes how
the amount of water can be assessed from M-R measurements. Such an estimate
depends on several assumptions including i) the accuracy of the internal
structure model and ii) the accuracy of mass and radius measurements. It is
shown that if the mass and the radius are perfectly known, the standard
deviation on the amount of water is about 4.5 %. This value increases rapidly
with the radius uncertainty but does not strongly depend on the mass
uncertainty.
