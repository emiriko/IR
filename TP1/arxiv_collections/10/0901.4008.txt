We discuss the strong spin segregation in a dilute trapped Fermi gas recently
observed by Du et al. with "anomalous" large time scale and amplitude. In a
collisionless regime, the atoms oscillate rapidly in the trap and average the
inhomogeneous external field in an energy dependent way, which controls their
transverse spin precession frequency. During interactions between atoms with
different spin directions, the identical spin rotation effect (ISRE) transfers
atoms to the up or down spin state, depending on their motional energy. Since
low energy atoms are closer to the center of the trap than high energy atoms,
the final outcome is a strong correlation between spins and positions.
