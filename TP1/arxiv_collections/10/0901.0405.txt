Images of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field are analyzed to obtain a catalog of
galaxies for which the angular sizes, surface brightness, photometric
redshifts, and absolute magnitudes are found. The catalog contains a total of
about 4000 galaxies identified at a high signal-to-noise ratio, which allows
the cosmological relations angular size{redshift and surface
brightness-redshift to be analyzed. The parameters of the evolution of linear
sizes and surface brightness of distant galaxies in the redshift interval
0.5-6.5 are estimated in terms of a grid of cosmological models with different
density parameters. The distribution of photometric redshifts of galaxies is
analyzed and possible superlarge inhomogeneities in the radial distribution of
galaxies are found with scale lengths as large as 2000 Mpc.
