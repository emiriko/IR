The cosmological backreaction proposal, which attempts to account for
observations without a primary dark energy source in the stress-energy tensor,
has been developed and discussed by means of different approaches. Here, we
focus on the concept of cosmological background solutions in order to develop a
framework to study different backreaction proposals.
