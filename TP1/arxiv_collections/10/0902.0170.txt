We make a complete catalog of extended Higgs sectors involving SU(2)_L
doublets and singlets, subject to natural flavor conservation. In each case we
present the couplings of a light neutral CP-even Higgs state h in terms of the
model parameters, and identify which models are distinguishable in principle
based on this information. We also give explicit expressions for the model
parameters in terms of h couplings and exhibit the behaviors of the couplings
in the limit where the deviations from the Standard Model Higgs couplings are
small. Finally we discuss prospects for differentiation of extended Higgs
models based on measurements at the LHC and ILC and identify the regions in
which these experiments could detect deviations from the SM Higgs predictions.
