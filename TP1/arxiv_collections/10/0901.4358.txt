Let $k$ be a field of characteristic zero, let $G$ be a connected reductive
algebraic group over $k$ and let $\mathfrak{g}$ be its Lie algebra. Let $k(G)$,
respectively, $k(\mathfrak{g})$, be the field of $k$-rational functions on $G$,
respectively, $\mathfrak{g}$. The conjugation action of $G$ on itself induces
the adjoint action of $G$ on $\mathfrak{g}$. We investigate the question
whether or not the field extensions $k(G)/k(G)^G$ and
$k(\mathfrak{g})/k(\mathfrak{g})^G$ are purely transcendental. We show that the
answer is the same for $k(G)/k(G)^G$ and $k(\mathfrak{g})/k(\mathfrak{g})^G$,
and reduce the problem to the case where $G$ is simple. For simple groups we
show that the answer is positive if $G$ is split of type ${\sf A}_{n}$ or ${\sf
C}_n$, and negative for groups of other types, except possibly ${\sf G}_{2}$. A
key ingredient in the proof of the negative result is a recent formula for the
unramified Brauer group of a homogeneous space with connected stabilizers.
  As a byproduct of our investigation we give an affirmative answer to a
question of Grothendieck about the existence of a rational section of the
categorical quotient morphism for the conjugating action of $G$ on itself. The
results and methods of this paper have played an important part in recent A.

${\sf A}_n$, ${\sf C}_n$, and ${\sf G}_2$.
