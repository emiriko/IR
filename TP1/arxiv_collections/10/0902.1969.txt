We present an efficient algorithm for generating unitary maps on a
$d$-dimensional Hilbert space from a time-dependent Hamiltonian through a
combination of stochastic searches and geometric construction. The protocol is
based on the eigen-decomposition of the map. A unitary matrix can be
implemented by sequentially mapping each eigenvector to a fiducial state,
imprinting the eigenphase on that state, and mapping it back to the
eigenvector. This requires the design of only $d$ state-to-state maps generated
by control waveforms that are efficiently found by a gradient search with
computational resources that scale polynomially in $d$. In contrast, the
complexity of a stochastic search for a single waveform that simultaneously
acts as desired on all eigenvectors scales exponentially in $d$. We extend this
construction to design maps on an $n$-dimensional subspace of the Hilbert space
using only $n$ stochastic searches. Additionally, we show how these techniques
can be used to control atomic spins in the ground electronic hyperfine manifold
of alkali atoms in order to implement general qudit logic gates as well to
perform a simple form of error correction on an embedded qubit.
