Recently Parigi et al. [Science 317, 1890 (2007)] implemented experimentally
the photon subtraction and addition processes from/to a light field in a
conditional way, when the required operations were produced successfully only
upon the positive outcome of a separate measurement. It was verified that for a
low intensity beam (quantum regime) the bosonic annihilation operator does
indeed describe a single photon subtraction, while the creation operator
describes a photon addition. Nonetheless, the exact formal expressions for
these operations do not always reduce to these simple identifications, and in
this connection here we deduce the general superoperators for multiple photons
subtraction and addition processes and analyze the statistics of the resulting
states for classical field states having an arbitrary intensity. We obtain
closed analytical expressions and verify that for classical fields with high
intensity (classical regime) the operators that describe photon subtraction and
addition processes deviate significantly from simply annihilation and creation
operators. Complementarily, we analyze in details such a smooth
quantum-classical transition as function of beam intensity for both processes.
