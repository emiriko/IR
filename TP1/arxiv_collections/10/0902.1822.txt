Multi-particle dynamics in one-dimensional asymmetric exclusion processes
with disorder is investigated theoretically by computational and analytical
methods. It is argued that the general phase diagram consists of three
non-equilibrium phases that are determined by the dynamic behavior at the
entrance, at the exit and at the slowest defect bond in the bulk of the system.
Specifically, we consider dynamics of asymmetric exclusion process with two
identical defect bonds as a function of distance between them. Two approximate
theoretical methods, that treat the system as a sequence of segments with exact
description of dynamics inside the segments and neglect correlations between
them, are presented. In addition, a numerical iterative procedure for
calculating dynamic properties of asymmetric exclusion systems is developed.
Our theoretical predictions are compared with extensive Monte Carlo computer
simulations. It is shown that correlations play an important role in the
particle dynamics. When two defect bonds are far away from each other the
strongest correlations are found at these bonds. However, bringing defect bonds
closer leads to the shift of correlations to the region between them.
