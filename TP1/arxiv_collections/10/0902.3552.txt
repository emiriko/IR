A simple model of circular polarization dependence on Mn delta-layer position
in LED heterostructures with InGaAs/GaAs quantum well is proposed, being able
to explain quite accurately recent fascinating experimental results [S.V.
Zaitsev, et al., Physica E (2009), doi:10.1016/j.physe.2008.11.003]. The model
emphasizes the role of position-dependent exchange interaction between injected
holes and Mn spins which significantly affects the hole level splitting in a
magnetic field, leading to strong variations of polarization dependence. The
role of effective temperature corresponding to the injected hole energy and the
broadening caused by the geometrical structure imperfections is also discussed.
