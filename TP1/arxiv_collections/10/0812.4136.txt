Motivated by the possible large direct CP asymmetry of \bar{B}^0_d \to D^+
D^- decay measured by Belle collaboration, we investigate double charm B_{u,d}
and B_s decays in the minimal supersymmetric standard model with R-parity
violation. We derive the bounds on relevant R-parity violating couplings from
the current experimental data, which show quite consistent measurements among
relative collaborations. Using the constrained parameter spaces, we explore
R-parity violating effects on other observables in these decays, which have not
been measured or have not been well measured yet. We find that the R-parity
violating effects on the mixing-induced CP asymmetries of \bar{B}^0_d \to
D^{(*)+} D^{(*)-} and \bar{B}^0_s \to D^{(*)+}_s D^{(*)-}_s decays could be
very large, nevertheless the R-parity violating effects on the direct CP
asymmetries could not be large enough to explain the large direct CP violation
of \bar{B}^0_d \to D^{+} D^{-} from Belle. Our results could be used to probe
R-parity violating effects and will correlate with searches for direct R-parity
violating signals in future experiments.
