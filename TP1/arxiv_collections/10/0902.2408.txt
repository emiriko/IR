Despite all the already existing observational data, current models still
cannot explain completely the excessive energy output and the time variability
of GRB. One of the reasons for this is the lack of a good model of the central
engine of GRB. A major problem in the proposed models with a black hole (BH) in
the center is that they don't explain the observed evidences of late time
activity of the central engine.
  In this paper we are starting the search for a possible model of that central
engine as a rotating compact body of still unknown nature. The formation of
jets in the new model lies entirely on the fundamental Teukolsky Master
Equation. We demonstrate that this general model can describe the formation of
collimated GRB-jets of various forms. Some preliminary results are presented.
