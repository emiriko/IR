We combine the principle of gauge invariance with extrinsic string geometry
to develop a lattice model that can be employed to theoretically describe
properties of chiral, unbranched homopolymers. We find that in its low
temperature phase the model is in the same universality class with proteins
that are deposited in the Protein Data Bank, in the sense of the compactness
index. We apply the model to analyze various statistical aspects of folded
proteins. Curiously we find that it can produce results that are a very good
good match to the data in the Protein Data Bank.
