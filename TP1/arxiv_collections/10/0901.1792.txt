The factorization of the amplitude for the deeply virtual Compton scattering
(DVCS) process gamma*(Q) gamma -> gamma gamma at high Q2 is demonstrated in two
distinct kinematical domains, allowing to define the photon generalized parton
distributions and the diphoton generalized distribution amplitudes. Both these
quantities exhibit an anomalous scaling behaviour and obey new inhomogeneous
QCD evolution equations.
