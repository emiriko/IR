The NEMO Collaboration installed an underwater detector including most of the
critical elements of a possible km$^3$ neutrino telescope: a four-floor tower
(called Mini-Tower) and a Junction Box, including the data transmission, the
power distribution, the timing calibration and the acoustic positioning
systems. These technical solutions will be evaluated, among others proposed for
the construction of the km$^3$ detector, within the KM3NeT Consortium. The main
test of this test experiment was the validation of the proposed design
solutions mentioned above. We present results of the analysis of data collected
with the NEMO Mini-Tower. The position of PMTs is determined through the
acoustic position system; signals detected with PMTs are used to reconstruct
the tracks of atmospheric muons. The angular distribution of atmospheric muons
was measured and results were compared with Monte Carlo simulations.
