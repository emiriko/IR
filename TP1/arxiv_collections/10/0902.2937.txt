We analyze a contribution of the finite-width (mass-smearing) effects to the
mixing of neutral mesons. It was shown, that this contribution is dominant in
the D-meson system and large in the K-meson one. An account of the
mass-smearing effects allows to explain some discrepancy between standard
predictions and experimental data in these cases.
