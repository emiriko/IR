Collapse of massive stars may result in formation of accreting black holes in
their interior. The accreting stellar matter may advect substantial magnetic
flux onto the black hole and promote release of its rotational energy via
magnetic stresses (the Blandford-Znajek mechanism). In this paper we explore
whether this process can explain the stellar explosions and relativistic jets
associated with long Gamma-ray-bursts. In particularly, we show that the
Blandford-Znajek mechanism is activated when the rest mass-energy density of
matter drops below the energy density of magnetic field in the very vicinity of
the black hole (within its ergosphere). We also discuss whether such a strong
magnetic field is in conflict with the rapid rotation of stellar core required
in the collapsar model and suggest that the conflict can be avoided if the
progenitor star is a component of close binary. In this case the stellar
rotation can be sustained via spin-orbital interaction. In an alternative
scenario the magnetic field is generated in the accretion disk but in this case
the magnetic flux through the black hole ergosphere is not expected to be
sufficiently high to explain the energetics of hypernovae by the BZ mechanism
alone. However, this energy deficit can be recovered via additional power
provided by the disk.
