The concept of a generalized nonanalytic expansion which involves nonanalytic
combinations of exponentials, logarithms and powers of a coupling is introduced
and its use illustrated in various areas of physics. Dispersion relations for
the resonance energies of odd anharmonic oscillators are discussed, and
higher-order formulas are presented for cubic and quartic potentials.
