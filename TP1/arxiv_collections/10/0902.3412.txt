The contribution of D waves to physical observables for neutral pion
photoproduction in the near threshold region is studied. Heavy Baryon Chiral
Perturbation Theory to one loop, and up to ${\cal O}(q^4)$, is used to account
for the S and P waves, while D waves are added in an almost model-independent
way using standard Born terms and vector mesons. It is found that the inclusion
of D waves is necessary to extract the $E_{0+}$ multipole reliably from present
and forthcoming data and to assess the low-energy constants of Chiral
Perturbation Theory. Arguments are presented demonstrating that F-wave
contributions are negligible in the near-threshold region.
