We introduce a simple open-ended model that describes the emergence of a
shared vocabulary. The ordering transition toward consensus is generated only
by an agreement mechanism. This interaction defines a finite and small number
of states, despite each individual having the ability to invent an unlimited
number of new words. The existence of a phase transition is studied by
analyzing the convergence times, the cognitive efforts of the agents and the
scaling behavior in memory and time
