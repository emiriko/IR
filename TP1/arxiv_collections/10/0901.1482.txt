We are interested in the $q$ Logarithmic Sobolev inequality for probability
measures on the infinite product of Heisenberg groups. We assume that the one
site boundary free measure satisfies either a $q$ Log-Sobolev inequality or a
U-Bound inequality, and we determine conditions so that the infinite
dimensional Gibbs measure satisfies a $q$ Log-Sobolev inequality.
