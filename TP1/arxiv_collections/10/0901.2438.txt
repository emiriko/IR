A multi-dimensional (x, y, z, P_{h\perp}) extraction of cos\phi_h and
cos2\phi_h azimuthal asymmetries of unpolarized Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic
Scattering at HERMES is discussed. The use of data taken with hydrogen and
deuterium targets and the separation of positive and negative hadrons allow to
access flavor-dependent information about quark intrinsic transverse momenta
and spin-orbit correlations. This flavor sensitivity allows for a
discrimination between theoretical models in the HERMES kinematic regime.
