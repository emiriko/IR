We study a parton shower description, based on a dipole picture, of the final
state in electron-positron annihilation. In such a shower, the distribution
function describing the inclusive probability to find a quark with a given
energy depends on the shower evolution time. Starting from the exclusive
evolution equation for the shower, we derive an equation for the evolution of
the inclusive quark energy distribution in the limit of strong ordering in
shower evolution time of the successive parton splittings. We find that, as
expected, this is the DGLAP equation. This paper is a response to a recent
paper of Dokshitzer and Marchesini that raised troubling issues about whether a
dipole based shower could give the DGLAP equation for the quark energy
distribution.
