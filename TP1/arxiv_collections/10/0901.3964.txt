Semiconductor quantum dots (known as artificial atoms) hold great promise for
solid-state quantum networks and quantum computers. To realize a quantum
network, it is crucial to achieve light-matter entanglement and coherent
quantum-state transfer between light and matter. Here we present a robust
photon-spin entangling gate with high fidelity and high efficiency (up to 50
percent) using a charged quantum dot in a double-sided microcavity. This gate
is based on giant circular birefringence induced by a single electron spin, and
functions as an optical circular polariser which allows only one
circularly-polarized component of light to be transmitted depending on the
electron spin states. We show this gate can be used for single-shot quantum
non-demolition measurement of a single electron spin, and can work as an
entanglement filter to make a photon-spin entangler, spin entangler and photon
entangler as well as a photon-spin quantum interface. This work allows us to
make all building blocks for solid-state quantum networks with single photons
and quantum-dot spins.
