We use high resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to study the
band structure and Fermi surface topology of the BaFe$_2$As$_2$ iron pnictides.
We observe two electron bands and two hole bands near the X-point, $(\pi,\pi)$
of the Brillouin zone, in the paramagnetic state for different doping levels,
including electron-doped Ba(Co$_{0.06}$Fe$_{0.94}$)$_2$As$_2$, undoped
BaFe$_2$As$_2$, and hole-doped Ba$_{0.6}$K$_{0.4}$Fe$_2$As$_2$. Among these
four bands, only the electron bands cross the Fermi level, forming two electron
pockets around X, while the hole bands approach but never reach the Fermi
level. We show that the band structure of the BaFe$_2$As$_2$ family matches
reasonably well with the prediction of LDA calculations after a
momentum-dependent shift and renormalization. Our finding resolves a number of
inconsistencies regarding the electronic structure of pnictides.
