For the electroweak interactions, the massive neutrino perturbative
kinematical procedure is developed in the massive neutrino Fock space; The
perturbation expansion parameter is the ratio of the neutrino mass to its
energy. This procedure, with the Pontecorvo-Maki-nakagawa-Sakata modified
electroweak Lagrangian, calculates the cross-sections with the new neutrino
energy projection operators in the massive neutrino Fock space, resulting in
the Standard Model mass-less flavor neutrino cross-sections, plus the Lorentz
non-invariant neutrino oscillation cross-sections which are proportional to the
squares of neutrino masses and, as such, practically unobservable in the
laboratory. This scheme reinforces the notion that the mass-less flavor
neutrino can be considered as the superposition of three massive neutrinos.
