Non-commuting noises may give rise to entanglement sudden death. By
considering the decoherence dynamics during establishment of the channel states
and noisy recovery operations, we study further the impact of non-commuting
noises on single- and two-qubit teleportation. We show that in the presence of
these noises there exists a critical rate of recovery operation below which
teleportation will fail.
