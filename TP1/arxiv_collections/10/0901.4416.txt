This article focuses on techniques for position reconstruction of acoustic
point sources with the AMADEUS setup consisting of 36 acoustic sensors in the
Mediterranean Sea. The direction reconstruction of an acoustic point source
utilizes the information of the 6 small-volume hydrophone clusters of AMADEUS
individually. Source position reconstruction is then done by combining the
directional information of each cluster. The algorithms for direction and
position reconstruction are explained and demonstrated using data taken in the
deep sea.
