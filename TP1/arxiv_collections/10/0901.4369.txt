We have developed 3D, compressible, non-linear radiative MHD simulations to
study the influence of the magnetic field of various strength and geometry on
the turbulent convective cells and on the excitation mechanisms of the acoustic
oscillations. The results reveal substantial changes of the granulation
structure with increased magnetic field, and a frequency-dependent reduction in
the oscillation power. These simulation results reproduce the enhanced
high-frequency acoustic emission observed at the boundaries of active region
("acoustic halo" phenomenon). In the presence of inclined magnetic field the
solar convection develops filamentary structure with flows concentrated along
magnetic filaments, and also exhibits behavior of running magnetoconvective
waves, resembling recent observations of the sunspot penumbra dynamics from
Hinode/SOT.
