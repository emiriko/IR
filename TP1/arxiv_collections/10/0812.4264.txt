We present a theoretical algorithm which, given any finite presentation of a
group as input, will terminate with answer yes if and only if the group is
large. We then implement a practical version of this algorithm using Magma and
apply it to a range of presentations. Our main focus is on 2-generator
1-relator presentations where we have a complete picture of largeness if the
relator has exponent sum zero in one generator and word length at most 12, as
well as when the relator is in the commutator subgroup and has word length at
most 18. Indeed all but a tiny number of presentations define large groups.
Finally we look at fundamental groups of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds, where
the algorithm readily determines that a quarter of the groups in the Snappea
closed census are large.
