The effects of intrinsic noise on stochastic delay systems is studied within
an expansion in the inverse system size. We show that the stochastic nature of
the underlying dynamics may induce oscillatory behaviour in parameter ranges
where the deterministic system does not sustain cycles, and compute the power
spectra of these stochastic oscillations analytically, in good agreement with
simulations. The theory is developed in the context of a simple one-dimensional
toy model, but is applicable more generally. Gene regulatory systems in
particular often contain only a small number of molecules, leading to
significant fluctuations in mRNA and protein concentrations. As an application
we therefore study a minimalistic model of the expression levels of hes1 mRNA
and Hes1 protein, representing the simple motif of an auto-inhibitory feedback
loop and motivated by its relevance to somite segmentation.
