The oscillation-center Hamiltonian is derived for a relativistic electron
injected with an arbitrary momentum in a linearly polarized laser pulse
propagating in tenuous plasma, assuming that the pulse length is smaller than
the plasma wavelength. For hot electrons generated at collisions with ions
under intense laser drive, multiple regimes of ponderomotive acceleration are
identified and the laser dispersion is shown to affect the process at plasma
densities down to 10^17 cm-3. Assuming a/gamma_g << 1, which prevents net
acceleration of the cold plasma, it is also shown that the normalized energy
gamma of hot electrons accelerated from the initial energy gamma_0 <~ Gamma
does not exceed Gamma ~ a gamma_g, where a is the normalized laser field, and
gamma_g is the group velocity Lorentz factor. Yet gamma ~ Gamma is attained
within a wide range of initial conditions; hence a cutoff in the hot electron
distribution is predicted.
