In a previous paper, a project of constructing quantum models of classical
properties has been started. The present paper concludes the project by turning
to classical mechanics. The quantum states that maximize entropy for given
averages and variances of coordinates and momenta are called ME packets. They
generalize the Gaussian wave packets. A non-trivial extension of the
partition-function method of probability calculus to quantum mechanics is
given. Non-commutativity of quantum variables limits its usefulness. Still, the
general form of the state operators of ME packets is obtained with its help.
The diagonal representation of the operators is found. A general way of
calculating averages that can replace the partition function method is
described. Classical mechanics is reinterpreted as a statistical theory.
Classical trajectories are replaced by classical ME packets. Quantum states
approximate classical ones if the product of the coordinate and momentum
variances is much larger than Planck constant. Thus, ME packets with large
variances follow their classical counterparts better than Gaussian wave
packets.
