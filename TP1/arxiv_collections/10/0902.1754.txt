We present results of high resolution hydrodynamical simulations of the
formation and evolution of dwarf galaxies. Our simulations start from
cosmological initial conditions at high redshift. They include metal-dependent
cooling, star formation, feedback from type II and type Ia supernovae and UV
background radiation, with physical recipes identical to those applied in a
previous study of Milky Way type galaxies. We find that a combination of
feedback and the cosmic UV background results in the formation of galaxies with
properties similar to the Local Group dwarf spheroidals, and that their effect
is strongly moderated by the depth of the gravitational potential. Taking this
into account, our models naturally reproduce the observed luminosities and
metallicities. The final objects have halo masses between 2.3x10^8 and 1.1x10^9
solar masses, mean velocity dispersions between 6.5 and 9.7 kms-1, stellar
masses ranging from 5x10^5 to 1.2x10^7 solar masses, median metallicities
between [Fe/H] = -1.8 and -1.1, and half-light radii of the order of 200 to 300
pc, all comparable with Local Group dwarf spheroidals. Our simulations also
indicate that the dwarf spheroidal galaxies observed today lie near a halo mass
threshold around 10^9 solar masses, in agreement with stellar kinematic data,
where supernova feedback not only suffices to completely expel the interstellar
medium and leave the residual gas-free, but where the combination of feedback,
UV radiation and self-shielding establishes a dichotomy of age distributions
similar to that observed in the Milky Way and M31 satellites.
