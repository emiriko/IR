Ultrasonic waves propagating in solids have stress-dependent velocities. The
relation between stress (or strain) and velocity forms the basis of non-linear
acoustics. In homogeneous solids, conventional time-of-flight techniques have
measured this dependence with spectacular precision. In heterogeneous media
like concrete, the direct (ballistic) wave around 500 kHz is strongly
attenuated and conventional techniques are less efficient. In this manuscript,
the effect of weak stress changes on the late arrivals constituting the
acoustic diffuse coda is tracked. A resolution of $2.10^{-5}$ in relative
velocity change is attained which corresponds to a sensitivity to stress change
of better than 50 kPa. Therefore the technique described here provides an
original way to measure the non-linear parameter with stress variations on the
order of tens of kPa.
