Beauty photoproduction in dijet events has been measured at HERA with the
ZEUS detector using an integrated luminosity of 126 pb-1. Beauty was identified
in events with a muon in the final state by using the transverse momentum of
the muon relative to the closest jet. Lifetime information from the silicon
vertex detector was also used; the impact parameter of the muon with respect to
the primary vertex was exploited to discriminate between signal and background.
Cross sections for beauty production as a function of the muon and the jet
variables as well as dijet correlations are compared to QCD predictions and to
previous measurements. The data are well described by predictions from
next-to-leading-order QCD.
