A necessary and sufficient condition for an inner function F in the upper
half-plane (UHP) to satisfy F = E*/E where E is a de Branges function is
presented. Since F_E =E^*/E is an inner function for any de Branges function E,
and the map that takes f to f/E is an isometry of the de Branges space H(E)
onto S(F_E), the orthogonal complement of F_E H^2, there is a natural bijective
correspondence between de Branges spaces of entire functions and the set of
subspaces S(F), for which F= E*/E for some de Branges function E. Under the
canonical isometry of H^2(UHP) onto H^2(D) the subspaces S(F_E) become certain
invariant subspaces for the backwards shift in H^2(D).
  I have been informed that the results contained in this paper are not new.
Most of the results in this paper can be found, for example, in Theorem 2.7,
Section 2.8, and Lemma 2.1 of V. Havin and J. Mashregi, "Admissable majorants
for model spaces of H^2, Part I: slow winding of the generating inner
function", Canad. J. Math. Vol. 55 (6), 2003 pp. 12311263. For this reason I
have withdrawn this article.
