BaFe2As2 is the parent compound of the '122' iron arsenide superconductors
and crystallizes with the tetragonal ThCr2Si2 type structure, space group
I4/mmm. A spin density wave transition at 140 K is accompanied by a symmetry
reduction to space group Fmmm and simultaneously by antiferromagnetic ordering.
Hole-doping induces superconductivity in Ba1-xKxFe2As2 with a maximum Tc of 38
K at x = 0.4. The upper critical fields approach 75 T with rather small
anisotropy of Hc2. At low potassium concentrations (x <= 0.2),
superconductivity apparently co-exists with the orthorhombic distorted and
magnetically ordered phase. At doping levels x >= 0.3, the structural
distortion and antiferromagnetic ordering is completely suppressed and the Tc
is maximized. No magnetically ordered domains could be detected in optimally
doped Ba1-xKxFe2As2 (x >= 0.3) by 57Fe-Moessbauer spectroscopy in contrast muSR
results obtained with single crystals. The magnetic hyperfine interactions
investigated by 57Fe Moessbauer spectroscopy are discussed and compared to the
ZrCuSiAs-type materials.
