The interaction between charged bodies in an ionic solution is a general
problem in colloid physics and becomes a central topic in the study of
biological systems where the electrostatic interaction between proteins,
nucleic acids, membranes is involved. This problem is often described starting
from the simple one-dimensional model of two parallel charged plates. Several
different approaches to this problem exist, focusing on different features. In
many cases, an intuitive expression of the pressure exerted on the plates is
proposed, which includes an electrostatic plus an osmotic contribution. We
present an explicit and self-consistent derivation of this formula for the
general case of any charge densities on the plates and any salt solution,
obtained in the framework of the Poisson-Boltzmann theory. We also show that,
depending on external constraints, the correct thermodynamic potential can
differ from the usual PB free energy. The resulting expression predicts, for
asymmetric, oppositely charged plates, the existence of a non trivial
equilibrium position with the plates separated by a finite distance. It is
therefore crucial, in order to study the kinetic stability of the corresponding
energy minimum, to obtain its explicit dependence on the plates charge
densities and on the ion concentration. An analytic expression for the position
and value of the corresponding energy minimum has been derived in 1975 by
Ohshima [Ohshima H., Colloid and Polymer Sci. 253, 150-157 (1975)] but,
surprisingly, this important result seems to be overlooked today. We retrieve
the expressions obtained by Ohshima in a simpler formalism, more familiar to
the physics community, and give a physical interpretation of the observed
behavior.
