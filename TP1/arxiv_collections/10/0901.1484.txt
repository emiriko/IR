In this work, we examine a system for coherent transfer of atoms into a
Bose-Einstein condensate. We utilize two spatially separate Bose-Einstein
condensates in different hyperfine ground states held in the same dc magnetic
trap. By means of a pulsed transfer of atoms, we are able to show a clear
resonance in the timing of the transfer, both in temperature and number, from
which we draw conclusions about the underlying physical process. The results
are discussed in the context of the recently demonstrated pumped atom laser.
