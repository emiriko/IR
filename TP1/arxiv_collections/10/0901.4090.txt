Based on lectures given at the 2008 Theoretical Advanced Study Institute
(TASI), I review here some aspects of the phenomenology of particle dark
matter, including the process of thermal freeze-out in the early universe, and
the direct and indirect detection of WIMPs. I also describe some of the most
popular particle candidates for dark matter and summarize the current status of
the quest to discover dark matter's particle identity.
