We explore the possibility to observe the effects of electron neutrinos from
past galactic supernovae, through a geochemical measurement of the amount of
Technetium 97 produced by neutrino-induced reactions in a Molybdenum ore. The
calculations we present take into account the recent advances in our knowledge
of neutrino interactions, of neutrino oscillations inside a supernova, of the
solar neutrino flux at Earth and of possible failed supernovae. The predicted
Technetium 97 abundance is of the order of 10^7 atoms per 10 kilotons of ore,
which is close to the current geochemical experimental sensitivity. Of this,
10-20% is from supernovae. Considering the comparable size of uncertainties,
more precision in the modeling of neutrino fluxes as well as of neutrino cross
sections is required for a meaningful measurement.
