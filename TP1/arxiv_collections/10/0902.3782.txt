We introduce new representations to formulate quantum mechanics on
noncommutative phase space, in which both coordinate-coordinate and
momentum-momentum are noncommutative. These representations explicitly display
entanglement properties between degrees of freedom of different coordinate and
momentum components. To show their potential applications, we derive explicit
expressions of Wigner function and Wigner operator in the new representations,
as well as solve exactly a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator on the
noncommutative phase plane with both kinetic coupling and elastic coupling.
