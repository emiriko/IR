We discuss the holographic derivation of the magnetic susceptibility of the
quark condensate. It is found that the susceptibility emerges upon the account
of the Chern-Simons term in the holographic action. We demonstrate that
Vainshtein's relation is not exact in the hard wall dual model but is fulfilled
with high accuracy. Some comments concerning the spectral density of the Dirac
operator are presented.
