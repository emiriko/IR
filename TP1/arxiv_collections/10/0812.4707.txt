Exchanges between the blood compartment and the surrounding tissues require a
tight regulation by the endothelial barrier. Recent reports inferred that
VE-cadherin, an endothelial specific cell-cell adhesion molecule, plays a
pivotal role in the formation, maturation and remodeling of the vascular wall.
Indeed, a growing number of permeability inducing factors (PIFs) was shown to
elicit signaling mechanisms culminating in VE-cadherin destabilization and
global alteration of the junctional architecture. Conversely, anti-PIFs protect
from VE-cadherin disruption and enhance cell cohesion. These findings provide
evidence on how endothelial cell-cell junctions impact the vascular network,
and change our perception about normal and aberrant angiogenesis.
