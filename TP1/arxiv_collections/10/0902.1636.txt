We determined electronic relaxation times via pump-probe optical spectroscopy
using sub-15 fs pulses for the normal state of two different cuprate
superconductors.We show that the primary relaxation process is the
electron-phonon interaction and extract a measure of its strength, the second
moment of the Eliashberg function\lambda<\omega^{2}>=800\pm200 meV^{2} for
La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{4} and \lambda<\omega^{2}>=400\pm100 meV^{2} for
YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.5}. These values suggest a possible fundamental role of the
electron-phonon interaction in the superconducting pairing mechanism.
