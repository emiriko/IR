We study the relaxation of a single colloidal sphere which is periodically
driven between two nonequilibrium steady states. Experimentally, this is
achieved by driving the particle along a toroidal trap imposed by scanned
optical tweezers. We find that the relaxation time after which the probability
distributions have been relaxed is identical to that obtained by a steady state
measurement. In quantitative agreement with theoretical calculations the
relaxation time strongly increases when driving the system further away from
thermal equilibrium.
