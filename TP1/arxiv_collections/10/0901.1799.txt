The standard theory of ideal gases ignores the interaction of the gas
particles with the thermal radiation (photon gas) that fills the otherwise
vacuum space between them. This is an unphysical feature since every material
absorbs and radiates thermal energy. This interaction may be important in gases
since the latter, unlike solids and liquids are capable of undergoing
conspicuous volume changes. Taking it into account makes the behaviour of the
ideal gases more realistic and removes Gibbs' paradox.
