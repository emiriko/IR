In constructions of analytical solutions to open string field theories pure
gauge configurations parameterized by wedge states play an essential role.
These pure gauge configurations are constructed as perturbation expansions and
to guaranty that these configurations are asymptotical solutions to equations
of motions one needs to study convergence of the perturbation expansions. We
demonstrate that for the large parameter of the perturbation expansion these
pure gauge truncated configurations give divergent contributions to the
equation of motion on the subspace of the wedge states. We perform this
demonstration numerically for the pure gauge configurations related to tachyon
solutions for the bosonic and the NS fermionic SFT. By the numerical
calculations we also show that the perturbation expansions are cured by adding
extra terms. These terms are nothing but the terms necessary to make valued the
Sen conjectures.
