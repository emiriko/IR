Light-front holography allows hadronic amplitudes in the AdS/QCD fifth
dimension to be mapped to frame-independent light-front wavefunctions of
hadrons in physical space-time, thus providing a relativistic description of
hadrons at the amplitude level. The AdS coordinate z is identified with an
invariant light-front coordinate zeta which separates the dynamics of quark and
gluon binding from the kinematics of constituent spin and internal orbital
angular momentum. The result is a single-variable light-front Schrodinger
equation for QCD which determines the eigenspectrum and the light-front
wavefunctions of hadrons for general spin and orbital angular momentum. A new
method for computing the hadronization of quark and gluon jets at the amplitude
level using AdS/QCD light-front wavefunctions is outlined.
