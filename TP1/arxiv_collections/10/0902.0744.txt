The promise of e-Science will only be realized when data is discoverable,
accessible, and comprehensible within distributed teams, across disciplines,
and over the long-term--without reliance on out-of-band (non-digital) means. We
have developed the open-source Tupelo semantic content management framework and
are employing it to manage a wide range of e-Science entities (including data,
documents, workflows, people, and projects) and a broad range of metadata
(including provenance, social networks, geospatial relationships, temporal
relations, and domain descriptions). Tupelo couples the use of global
identifiers and resource description framework (RDF) statements with an
aggregatable content repository model to provide a unified space for securely
managing distributed heterogeneous content and relationships.
