We describe the implementation of a system for studying light-matter
interactions using an ensemble of $10^6$ cold rubidium 87 atoms, trapped in a
single-beam optical dipole trap. In this configuration the elongated shape of
the atomic cloud increases the strength of the collective light-atom coupling.
Trapping all-optically allows for long storage times in a low decoherence
environment. We are able to perform several thousands of measurements on one
atomic ensemble with little destruction. We report results on paramagnetic
Faraday rotations from a macroscopically polarized atomic ensemble. Our results
confirm that strong light-atom coupling is achievable in this system which
makes it attractive for single-pass quantum information protocols.
