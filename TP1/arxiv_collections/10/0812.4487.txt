For a given prime $p$, a new construction of families of the complex valued
sequences of period $p$ with efficient implementation is given by applying both
multiplicative characters and additive characters of finite field
$\mathbb{F}_p$. Such a signal set consists of $p^2(p-2)$ time-shift distinct
sequences, the magnitude of the two-dimensional autocorrelation function (i.e.,
the ambiguity function) in both time and phase of each sequence is upper
bounded by $2\sqrt{p}$ at any shift not equal to $(0, 0)$, and the magnitude of
the ambiguity function of any pair of phase-shift distinct sequences is upper
bounded by $4\sqrt{p}$. Furthermore, the magnitude of their Fourier transform
spectrum is less than or equal to 2. A proof is given through finding a simple
elementary construction for the sequences constructed from the Weil
representation by Gurevich, Hadani and Sochen. An open problem for directly
establishing these assertions without involving the Weil representation is
addressed.
