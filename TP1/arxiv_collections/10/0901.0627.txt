A campaign on the open cluster NGC 5617 was organized in order to
characterize the pulsations and to better understand the internal structure of
its stars. The variability of the cluster members was never studied before. We
present the observations taken and an up-to-date analysis of the obtained time
series, especially of several SPB candidates we discovered.
