Intratube quantum dots showing particle-in-a-box-like states with level
spacings up to 200meV are realized in metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes
by means of low dose medium energy Ar irradiation. Fourier transform scanning
tunneling spectroscopy compared to results of a Fabry-Perot electron resonator
model yields clear signatures for inter- and intra-valley scattering of
electrons confined between consecutive irradiation-induced defects
(inter-defects distance < 10nm). Effects arising from lifting the degeneracy of
the Dirac cones within the first Brillouin zone are also observed.
