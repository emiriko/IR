The phenomenon of time resonances (or explosions) can explain the exponential
reduction of the energy, which is accompanied for the certain degree by slight
fluctuations under some conditions in the range of the energy strongly
overlapped compound-resonances. These resonant explosions correspond to
formation of several highly-exited non-exponentially decaying nuclear clots
(partial compound nuclei consisting of several small groups of projectile
nucleons and targets). This paper is a continuation and expansion of
theoretical authors' work, which is a more general self-consistent version of
the time-evolution approach in comparison with the traditional Izumo-Araseki
time compound-nucleus model.
