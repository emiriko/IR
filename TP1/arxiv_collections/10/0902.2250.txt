We give a lower estimate of the gap of the first two eigenvalues of the
Schrodinger operator in the case when the potential is strongly convex. In
particular, if the Hessian of the potential is bounded from below by a positive
constant, the gap has a lower bound independent of the dimension. We also
estimate the gap when the potential is not necessarily convex.
