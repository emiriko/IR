I give a brief overview of the effective theory for the Color Glass
Condensate, which is the high-density gluonic matter which controls high-energy
scattering in QCD in the vicinity of the unitarity limit. I concentrate on
fundamental phenomena, like gluon saturation, unitarization, and geometric
scaling, and the way how these are encoded in the formalism. I emphasize the
importance of the next-to-leading order corrections, especially the running of
the coupling, for both conceptual and phenomenological issues. I survey the
implications of the CGC theory for the HERA physics and its phenomenological
applications based on saturation models.
