When speaking of the unification of quantum mechanics and relativity, one
normally refers to special relativity (SR) or to Einstein general relativity
(GR). The Dirac and Klein-Gordon wave equations are an example of unification
of quantum concepts and concepts falling within the domain of SR. Current
relativistic QFT derives from the transcription of these equations into second
quantization formalism. Many researchers hope that the unification of QFT with
GR can solve the problems peculiar to QFT (divergences) and to GR
(singularities). In this article, a different strategy is proposed, in an
informal manner. Firstly, emphasis is laid on the importance of the transaction
notion for quantum theories, introduced by Cramer in the eighties and
generalized by the author of this article. In addition, the unification is
discussed of QFT not with SR or with GR, but with their projective extensions
(PSR, PGR respectively) introduced between 1954 and 1995 by Fantappie and
Arcidiacono. The existence emerges of new fundamental constants of nature,
whose significance is discussed. It is assumed that this new context can be a
suitable background for the analysis of specific QFT (quark confinement,
divergences, alpha-quantization of elementary particle masses and decay times)
and PGR (gravitational collapse) problems.
