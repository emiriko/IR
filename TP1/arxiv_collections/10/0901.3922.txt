In this note we review our ideas, first published in year 2006, and
corresponding results, including the new ones, which show that whereas the
assumption of (partial) thermalization in relativistic A+A collisions is really
crucial to explain soft physics observables, the hypotheses of {\it early}
thermalization at times less than 1 fm/c is not necessary. The reason for the
later conclusion is that the initial transverse flow in thermal matter as well
as its anisotropy, leading to asymmetry of the transverse momentum spectra,
could be developed at pre-thermal, either partonic or classical field - Glasma,
stage with even more efficiency than in the case of very early perfect
hydrodynamics. Such radial and elliptic flows develop no matter whether a
pressure already established. The general reason for them is an essential
finiteness of the system in transverse direction.
