Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) measurements are crucial for advanced exploration
of the evolutionary history of the lunar orbit, the laws of fundamental
gravitational physics, selenophysics and geophysics as well as for future human
missions to the Moon. Current LLR technique measures distance to the Moon with
a precision approaching one millimeter that strongly demands further
significant improvement of the theoretical model of the orbital and rotational
dynamics of the Earth-Moon system. This model should inevitably be based on the
theory of general relativity, fully incorporate the relevant
geophysical/selenophysical processes and rely upon the most recent IAU
standards in order to give us the opportunity to perform the most precise
fundamental test of general relativity in the solar system in robust and
physically-adequate way. The talk discusses new methods and approaches in
developing such a mathematical model.
