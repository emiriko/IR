We investigate the launching and stability of extragalactic jets through
nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation and linear eigenmode analysis.
In the simulations of jet evolution, a small-scale equilibrium magnetic arcade
is twisted by a differentially rotating accretion disk. These simulations
produce a collimated outflow which is unstable to the current driven m=1 kink
mode for low rotational velocities of the accretion disk relative to the Alfven
speed of the coronal plasma. The growth rate of the kink mode in the jet is
shown to be inversely related to the rotation rate of the disk, and the jet is
stable for high rotation rates. Linear MHD calculations investigate the effect
of rigid rotation on the kink mode in a cylindrical plasma. These calculations
show that the Coriolis force distorts the m=1 kink eigenmode and stabilizes it
at rotation frequencies such that the rotation period is longer than a few
Alfven times.
