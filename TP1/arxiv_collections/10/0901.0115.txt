We review basic features of cosmological models with large-scale classical
non-Abelian Yang-Mills (YM) condensates. There exists a unique SU(2) YM
configuration (generalizable to larger gauge groups) compatible with
homogeneity and isotropy of the three-space which is parameterized by a single
scalar field. In the past various aspects of Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM)
cosmology were discussed in the context of the Early Universe. Due to conformal
invariance, solvable EYM FRW models exist both on the classical and quantum
levels. To develop the YM model for dark energy one has to find mechanisms of
the conformal symmetry breaking. We discuss the Born-Infeld generalization and
some phenomenological models motivated by quantum corrections exploring
possibility of transient DE and phantom regimes.
