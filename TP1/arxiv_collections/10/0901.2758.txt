We investigate the field-angle-dependent zero-energy density of states for
YNi2B2C with using realistic Fermi surfaces obtained by band calculations. Both
the 17th and 18th bands are taken into account. For calculating the oscillating
density of states, we adopt the Kramer-Pesch approximation, which is found to
improve accuracy in the oscillation amplitude. We show that superconducting gap
structure determined by analyzing STM experiments is consistent with thermal
transport and heat capacity measurements.
