Using the recently published model for the collisional energy loss of heavy
quarks (Q) in a Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP), based on perturbative QCD (pQCD) with
a running coupling constant, we study the interaction between heavy quarks and
plasma particles in detail. We discuss correlations between the simultaneously
produced $c$ and $\bar{c}$ quarks, study how central collisions can be
experimentally selected, predict observable correlations and extend our model
to the energy domain of the large hadron collider (LHC). We finally compare the
predictions of our model with that of other approaches like AdS/CFT.
