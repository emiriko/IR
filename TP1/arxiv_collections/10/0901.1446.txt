The vibrating behaviour of thin structures is affected by prestress states.
Hence, the effects of thermal prestress are important research subjects in view
of ambient vibration monitoring of civil structures. The interaction between
prestress, geometrically non-linear behaviour, as well as damping and its
coupling with the aforementioned phenomena has to be taken into account for a
comprehensive understanding of the structural behaviour. Since the literature
on this subject lacks a clear procedure to derive models of thin prestressed
and damped structures from 3D continuum mechanics, this paper presents a new
derivation of models for thin structures accounting for generic prestress,
moderate rotations and viscous damping. Although inspired by classical
approaches, the proposed procedure is quite different, because of (i) the
definition of a modified Hu-Washizu (H-W) functional, accounting for stress
constraints associated with Lagrange multipliers, in order to derive
lower-dimensional models in a convenient way; (ii) an original definition of a
(mechanical and thermal) strain measure and a rotation measure enabling one to
identify the main terms in the strain energy and to derive a cascade of
lower-dimensional models (iii) a new definition of "strain-rotation domains"
providing a clear interpretation of the classical assumptions of "small
perturbations" and "small strains and moderate rotations"; (iv) the
introduction of a pseudo-potential with stress constraints to account for
viscous damping. The proposed procedure is applied to thin beams.
