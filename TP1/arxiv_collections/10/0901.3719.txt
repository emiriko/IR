Oxidative DNA single strand breaks arise continuously in cells and defects in
their repair have been implicated in neurological disease. While much progress
has been made in understanding how chromosomal single strand breaks are
repaired little is known about the changes chromatin structure that accompany
this process. Here, we show that nascent recombinant histone H3.1 protein
accumulates and is deposited into chromatin at sites of DNA strand breakage in
quiescent human cells following oxidative stress, and that core components of
the single-strand break repair machinery are required for this process. We show
that the SSBR sensor and scaffold proteins poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and
XRCC1 facilitate accumulation of chromatin assembly factor-1 (CAF-1) at sites
of oxidative DNA strand breakage, which in turn mediates the deposition of
Histone H3.1. We also demonstrate that depletion of CAF-1 slows global rates of
DNA strand break repair in quiescent cells following oxidative stress,
demonstrating that single-strand break repair and histone deposition are
tightly coordinated processes. These data describe a novel role for the DNA
singlestrand break repair machinery and implicate histone turnover as a core
component of the cellular response of quiescent cells to oxidative damage.
