We present the preliminary results of a systematic search for GRB and other
transients in the publicly available data for the IBIS/PICsIT (0.2-10 MeV)
detector on board INTEGRAL. Lightcurves in 2-8 energy bands with time
resolution from 1 to 62.5 ms have been collected and an analysis of spectral
and temporal characteristics has been performed. This is the nucleus of a
forthcoming first catalog of GRB observed by PICsIT.
