Comparison of precision frequency measurements to quantum electrodynamics
(QED) predictions for Rydberg states of hydrogen-like ions can yield
information on values of fundamental constants and test theory. With the
results of a calculation of a key QED contribution reported here, the
uncertainty in the theory of the energy levels is reduced to a level where such
a comparison can yield an improved value of the Rydberg constant.
