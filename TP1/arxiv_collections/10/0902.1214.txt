The critical current densities of polycrystalline bulk SmFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$
prepared by the powder-in-tube (PIT) method and by a conventional solid-state
reaction were investigated using the remnant magnetic moment method and
Campbell's method. Two types of shielding current, corresponding to global and
local critical current densities $J_{\rm c}$ were observed using both
measurement methods. The global and local $J_{\rm c}$ were on the order of
$10^7$ A/m$^2$ and $10^{10}$ A/m$^2$ at 5 K, respectively. The local $J_{\rm
c}$ decreased slightly with increasing magnetic field. The global $J_{\rm c}$
was independent of the preparation method, while the local $J_{\rm c}$ was
larger for samples prepared by PIT than for those prepared by solid-state
reaction.
