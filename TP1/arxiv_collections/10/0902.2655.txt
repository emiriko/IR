To simulate the influence of pendulum effect in hollow cathode configuration
on a current-voltage characteristic it is proposed to consider a plane glow
discharge in one-dimensional space configuration with two plane parallel
cathodes and one plane anode in the middle. A pendulum effect could be switched
on or off, with consideration for the anode to be transparent or not for fast
ionizing electrons. On the basis of a stationary kinetic equation for ionizing
electrons an integral equation for a source of ionization is derived. This
equation can be used as a component in self-consistent problem for field
equations to calculate a current-voltage characteristic and to show how it
changes in both cases - in presence or absence of anode transparency.
