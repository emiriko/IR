Motivated by the recent observation of the high energy electron and positron
excesses in cosmic ray by PAMELA and ATIC/PPB-BETS, we suggest an anomaly-free
scenario for the universal extra dimension that localizes the SM quarks and
splits the spectrum of KK quarks from KK leptons. When the SM quarks are "well
localized" at the boundaries, the most stringent bound of the model ($1/R >
510$ GeV) comes from the resonance search for the Tevatron dijet channels. Even
at the early stage of LHC, one can discover the second KK gluon for masses up
to 4 TeV.
