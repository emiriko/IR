From a study of BAL + IR + Fe II QSOs (using deep Gemini GMOS-IFU
spectroscopy) new results are presented: for IRAS 04505-2958. Specifically, we
have studied in detail the out flow (OF) process and their associated
structures, mainly at two large galactic scales: (i) two blobs/shells (S1, S2)
at radius r = 1.1 and 2.2 kpc; and (ii) an external hypergiant shell (S3) at r
= 11 kpc. In addition, the presence of two very extended hypergiant shells (S4,
S5) at r = 80 kpc is discussed. From this GMOS study the following main results
were obtained: (i) For the external hypergiant shell S3 the kinematics GMOS
maps of the ionized gas show very similar features to those observed for the
prototype of exploding external supergiant shell: in NGC 5514. (ii) The main
knots K1, K2 and K3 -of this hypergiant shell S3- show a stellar population and
emission line ratios associated with the presence of a starburst + OF/shocks.
(iii) The internal shells S1 and S2 show structures, OF components and
properties very similar to those detected in the nuclear shells of Mrk 231.
(iv) The shells S1+S2 and S3 are aligned at PA = 131: i.e. suggesting that the
OF process is in the blow-out phase with bipolar structure. In addition, the
shells S4 and S5 (at 80-100 kpc scale) are aligned at PA = 40, i.e.: a bipolar
OF perpendicular to the internal OF. Finally, the generation of UHE cosmic rays
and neutrino/ dark-matter -associated with HyNe in BAL + IR + Fe II QSOs- is
discussed.
