There exist two ways to obtain walk behavior: assuming a large number of
technifermions in the fundamental representation of the technicolor (TC) gauge
group, or a small number of technifermions, assuming that these fermions are in
higher-dimensional representations of the TC group. We propose a scheme to
obtain the walking behavior based on technicolored GUTs (TGUTs), where
elementary scalars with the TC degree of freedom may remain in the theory after
the GUT symmetry breaking.
