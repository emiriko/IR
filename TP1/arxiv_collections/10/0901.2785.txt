NLO QCD corrections to charged and neutral current Drell-Yan processes and
their implementation in the computer system SANC are considered. On the
partonic level both quark-antiquark and quark-gluon scattering channels are
taken into account. Subtractions of the collinear singularities in the massive
case are compared with ones in the MS-bar scheme. Results of SANC on the
hadronic level are presented. Comparison with results of the MCFM package is
shown.
