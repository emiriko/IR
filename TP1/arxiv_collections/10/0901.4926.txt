We present a new theoretical approach for collisional absorption of laser
energy in dense plasmas which accommodates arbitrary frequencies and high
intensities of the laser field. We establish a connection between laser
absorption by inverse Bremstrahlung and the stopping power. This relation is
then applied to include strong correlations beyond the mean field approach. The
results show an excellent agreement with molecular dynamics simulations up to
very high coupling strength.
