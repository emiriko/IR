It is presented an analysis on lepton flavour violating transitions, leptonic
magnetic dipole moments and electric dipole moments in a class of models
characterized by the flavour symmetry A4 x Z3 x U(1)_FN, whose choice is
motivated by the approximate Tri-Bimaximal mixing observed in neutrino
oscillations. A low-energy effective Lagrangian is constructed, where these
effects are dominated by dimension six operators, suppressed by the scale M of
new physics. All the flavour breaking effects are universally described by the
vacuum expectation values of a set of spurions. Two separate cases, a
supersymmetric and a general one, are described. An upper limit on the reactor
angle of a few percent is concluded.
