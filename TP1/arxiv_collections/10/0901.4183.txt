The "LiC Detector Toy" is a fast single-track simulation and reconstruction
tool, aiming at the optimization of tracking detector design, i.e. geometric
layout and material budgets. Its implementation is based on the MATLAB system.
Improvements over the last year include correct handling of complex forward
regions (arbitrary mixture of cylindrical and plane surfaces), enhanced
detector description, flexible data presentation of results (e.g. fitted track
resolutions and impact parameters), and support by an integrated GUI. In
addition a non-GUI version running under open-source OCTAVE has been
implemented. The tool has recently been used for fixing the "reference design"
layout of the silicon tracker (SIT, SET and FTD) of the ILD detector concept.
