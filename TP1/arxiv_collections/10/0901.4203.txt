A voting bloc is defined to be a group of voters who have similar voting
preferences. The cleavage of the Irish electorate into voting blocs is of
interest. Irish elections employ a ``single transferable vote'' electoral
system; under this system voters rank some or all of the electoral candidates
in order of preference. These rank votes provide a rich source of preference
information from which inferences about the composition of the electorate may
be drawn. Additionally, the influence of social factors or covariates on the
electorate composition is of interest. A mixture of experts model is a mixture
model in which the model parameters are functions of covariates. A mixture of
experts model for rank data is developed to provide a model-based method to
cluster Irish voters into voting blocs, to examine the influence of social
factors on this clustering and to examine the characteristic preferences of the
voting blocs. The Benter model for rank data is employed as the family of
component densities within the mixture of experts model; generalized linear
model theory is employed to model the influence of covariates on the mixing
proportions. Model fitting is achieved via a hybrid of the EM and MM
algorithms. An example of the methodology is illustrated by examining an Irish
presidential election. The existence of voting blocs in the electorate is
established and it is determined that age and government satisfaction levels
are important factors in influencing voting in this election.
