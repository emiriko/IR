Educational research often studies subjects that are in naturally clustered
groups of classrooms or schools. When designing a randomized experiment to
evaluate an intervention directed at teachers, but with effects on teachers and
their students, the power or anticipated variance for the treatment effect
needs to be examined at both levels. If the treatment is applied to clusters,
power is usually reduced. At the same time, a cluster design decreases the
probability of contamination, and contamination can also reduce power to detect
a treatment effect. Designs that are optimal at one level may be inefficient
for estimating the treatment effect at another level. In this paper we study
the efficiency of three designs and their ability to detect a treatment effect:
randomize schools to treatment, randomize teachers within schools to treatment,
and completely randomize teachers to treatment. The three designs are compared
for both the teacher and student level within the mixed model framework, and a
simulation study is conducted to compare expected treatment variances for the
three designs with various levels of correlation within and between clusters.
We present a computer program that study designers can use to explore the
anticipated variances of treatment effects under proposed experimental designs
and settings.
