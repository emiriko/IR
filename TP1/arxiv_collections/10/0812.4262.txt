The three dimensional rotation group, SO(3), is a symmetry group of the
normal hydrogen atom. Each reducible representation of this group can be
associated with a degenerate energy level. If this atom is placed in an
external magnetic field, the interaction between the orbital magnetic moment
with this field will lead to a symmetry breaking where the symmetry group of
the atom is a new group distinct from the SO(3) group. This phenomenon
describes the normal Zeeman effect, where a degenerate energy level splits into
several new energy levels. It is explicitly shown that each of the new energy
levels can be associated with an irreducible representation of the new symmetry
group.
