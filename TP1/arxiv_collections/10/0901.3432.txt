We present a hybrid method based on a combination of quantum/classical
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and a mod el Hamiltonian approach to
describe charge transport through bio-molecular wires with variable lengths in
presence o f a solvent. The core of our approach consists in a mapping of the
bio-molecular electronic structure, as obtained f rom density-functional based
tight-binding calculations of molecular structures along MD trajectories, onto
a low di mensional model Hamiltonian including the coupling to a dissipative
bosonic environment. The latter encodes fluctuat ion effects arising from the
solvent and from the molecular conformational dynamics. We apply this approach
to the c ase of pG-pC and pA-pT DNA oligomers as paradigmatic cases and show
that the DNA conformational fluctuations are essential in determining and
supporting charge transport.
