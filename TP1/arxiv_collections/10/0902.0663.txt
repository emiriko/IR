Heat capacity, magnetic susceptibility, NMR, and resistivity of SrNi2P2
single crystals are presented, illustrating a purely structural transition at
325 K with no magnetism. Bulk superconductivity is found at 1.4 K. The
magnitude of the transition temperature T_c, fits to the heat capacity data,
the small upper critical field $H_{c2}$ = 390 Oe, and Ginzburg-Landau parameter
$\kappa$ = 2.1 suggests a conventional fully gapped superconductor. With
applied pressure a second structural phase transition occurs which results in
an 8% reduction in the c/a ratio of lattice parameters. We find that
superconductivity persists into this high pressure phase, although the
transition temperature is monotonically suppressed with increasing pressure.
Comparison of these Ni-P data as well as layered Fe-As and Ni-As superconductor
indicates that reduced dimensionality can be a mechanism for increasing the
transition temperature.
