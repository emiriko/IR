We theoretically propose a method to identify $\pm s$-wave order parameter in
recently discovered Fe-pnictide superconductors. Our idea uses the Riedel
anomaly in ac-Josephson current through an SI($\pm$ S) (single-band s-wave
superconductor/insulator/$\pm$s-wave two-band superconductor) junction. We show
that the Riedel peak effect leads to vanishing ac-Josephson current at some
values of biased voltage. This phenomenon does not occur in the case when the
$\pm s$-wave superconductor is replaced by a conventional s-wave one, so that
the observation of this vanishing Josephson current would be a clear signature
of $\pm s$-wave pairing state in Fe-pnictide superconductors.
