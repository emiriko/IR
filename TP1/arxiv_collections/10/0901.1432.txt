In the next years the FERMI gamma ray telescope and the Cherenkov telescopes
will put very stringent constraints to models of gamma ray emission from galaxy
clusters providing crucial information on relativistic particles in the
inter-galactic-medium. We derive the broad band non-thermal spectrum of galaxy
clusters in the context of general calculations in which relativistic particles
(protons and secondary electrons due to proton-proton collisions) interact with
MHD turbulence generated in the cluster volume during cluster mergers, and
discuss the importance of future gamma ray observations.
