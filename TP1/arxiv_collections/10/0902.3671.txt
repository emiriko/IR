When, and how, did the first galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBH)
form, and how did they reionization the Universe? First galaxy formation and
cosmic reionization are among the last frontiers in studies of cosmic structure
formation. We delineate the detailed astrophysical probes of early galaxy and
SMBH formation afforded by observations at centimeter through submillimeter
wavelengths. These observations include studies of the molecular gas (= the
fuel for star formation in galaxies), atomic fine structure lines (= the
dominant ISM gas coolant), thermal dust continuum emission (= an ideal star
formation rate estimator), and radio continuum emission from star formation and
relativistic jets. High resolution spectroscopic imaging can be used to study
galaxy dynamics and star formation on sub-kpc scales. These cm and mm
observations are the necessary compliment to near-IR observations, which probe
the stars and ionized gas, and X-ray observations, which reveal the AGN.
Together, a suite of revolutionary observatories planned for the next decade
from centimeter to X-ray wavelengths will provide the requisite panchromatic
view of the complex processes involved in the formation of the first generation
of galaxies and SMBHs, and cosmic reionization.
