Inflationary cosmology has, in the last few years,received a strong dose of
support from observations. The fact that the fluctuation spectrum can be
extracted from the inflationary scenario through an analysis that involves
quantum field theory in curved space-time, and that it coincides with the
observational data has lead to a certain complacency in the community, which
prevents the critical analysis of the obscure spots in the derivation. We argue
here briefly, as we have discussed in more detail elsewhere, that there is
something important missing in our understanding of the origin of the seeds of
Cosmic Structure, as is evidenced by the fact that in the standard accounts the
inhomogeneity and anisotropy of our universe seems to emerge from an exactly
homogeneous andisotropic initial state through processes that do not break
those symmetries. This article gives a very brief recount of the problems faced
by the arguments based on established physics. The conclusion is that we need
some new physics to be able to fully address the problem. The article then
exposes one avenue that has been used to address the central issue and
elaborates on the degree to which, the new approach makes different predictions
from the standard analyses. The approach is inspired on Penrose's proposals
that Quantum Gravity might lead to a real, dynamical collapse of the wave
function, a process that we argued has the properties needed to extract us from
the theoretical impasse described above.
