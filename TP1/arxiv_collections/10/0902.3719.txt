We implement an iterative quantum state transfer exploiting the natural
dipolar couplings in a spin chain of a liquid crystal NMR system. During each
iteration a finite part of the amplitude of the state is transferred and by
applying an external operation on only the last two spins the transferred state
is made to accumulate on the spin at the end point. The transfer fidelity
reaches one asymptotically through increasing the number of iterations. We also
implement the inverted version of the scheme which can transfer an arbitrary
state from the end point to any other position of the chain and entangle any
pair of spins in the chain, acting as a full quantum data bus.
