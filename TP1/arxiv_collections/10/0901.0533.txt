We report reliable transport of 9Be+ ions through a 2-D trap array that
includes a separate loading/reservoir zone and an "X-junction". During
transport the ion's kinetic energy in its local well increases by only a few
motional quanta and internal-state coherences are preserved. We also examine
two sources of energy gain during transport: a particular radio-frequency (RF)
noise heating mechanism and digital sampling noise. Such studies are important
to achieve scaling in a trapped-ion quantum information processor.
