A caesium fountain clock is operated utilizing a microwave oscillator that
derives its frequency stability from a stable laser by means of a fiber-laser
femtosecond frequency comb. This oscillator is based on the technology
developed for optical clocks and replaces the quartz based microwave oscillator
commonly used in fountain clocks. As a result, a significant decrease of the
frequency instability of the fountain clock is obtained, reaching 0.74E-14 at
100 s averaging time. We could demonstrate that for a significant range of
detected atom numbers the instability is limited by quantum projection noise
only, and that for the current status of this fountain clock the new microwave
source poses no limit on the achievable frequency instability.
