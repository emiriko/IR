The kinetic equation of non - Markovian type for description of the vacuum
creation of parton - antiparton pairs under action of a space homogeneous time
- dependent chromo - electric field of the arbitrary polarization is obtained
on the strict non - pertubative foundation in the framework of the oscillator
representation. A comparison of the effectiveness of vacuum creation with the
case of linear polarization one is fulfilled.
