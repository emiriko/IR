We report five new measurements of central black hole masses based on STIS
and WFPC2 observations with the Hubble Space Telescope and on axisymmetric,
three-integral, Schwarzschild orbit-library kinematic models. We selected a
sample of galaxies within a narrow range in velocity dispersion that cover a
range of galaxy parameters (including Hubble type and core/power-law surface
density profile) where we expected to be able to resolve the galaxy's sphere of
influence based on the predicted value of the black hole mass from the M-sigma
relation. We find masses in units of 10^8 solar masses for the following
galaxies:
  NGC 3585, M_BH = 3.4 (+1.5, -0.6);
  NGC 3607, M_BH = 1.2 (+0.4, -0.4);
  NGC 4026, M_BH = 2.1 (+0.7, -0.4); and
  NGC 5576, M_BH = 1.8 (+0.3, -0.4), all significantly excluding M_BH = 0. For
  NGC 3945, M_BH = 0.09 (+0.17, -0.21), which is significantly below
predictions from M-sigma and M-L relations and consistent with M_BH = 0, though
the presence of a double bar in this galaxy may present problems for our
axisymmetric code.
