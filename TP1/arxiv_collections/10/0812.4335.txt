We have investigated the collisional properties of 41K atoms at ultracold
temperature. To show the possibility to use 41K as a coolant, a Bose-Einstein
condensate of 41K atoms in the stretched state (F=2, m_F=2) was created for the
first time by direct evaporation in a magnetic trap. An upper bound of three
body loss coefficient for atoms in the condensate was determined to be 4(2)
10^{-29} cm -6 s-1. A Feshbach resonance in the F=1, m_F=-1 state was observed
at 51.42(5) G, which is in good agreement with theoretical prediction.
