Preliminary results of one year anisotropy measurement in the energy range
10^{13} -10^{14} eV as a function of energy are presented. The results are
compared for two methods of data analysis: the standard one with meteo
correction approach in use and another one so-called "East minus West" method.
Amplitudes and phases of anisotropy for three median energies E = 25 TeV, E =
75 TeV and E = 120 TeV are reported. Brief consideration of amplitude-phase
dependence of anisotropy on energy is expounded.
