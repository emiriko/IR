(Brief Summary) What is the total radiative content of the Universe since the
epoch of recombination? The extragalactic background light (EBL) spectrum
captures the redshifted energy released from the first stellar objects,
protogalaxies, and galaxies throughout cosmic history. Yet, we have not
determined the brightness of the extragalactic sky from UV/optical to
far-infrared wavelengths with sufficient accuracy to establish the radiative
content of the Universe to better than an order of magnitude. Among many
science topics, an accurate measurement of the EBL spectrum from optical to
far-IR wavelengths, will address: What is the total energy released by stellar
nucleosynthesis over cosmic history? Was significant energy released by
non-stellar processes? Is there a diffuse component to the EBL anywhere from
optical to sub-millimeter? When did first stars appear and how luminous was the
reionization epoch? Absolute optical to mid-IR EBL spectrum to an
astrophysically interesting accuracy can be established by wide field imagingat
a distance of 5 AU or above the ecliptic plane where the zodiacal foreground is
reduced by more than two orders of magnitude.
