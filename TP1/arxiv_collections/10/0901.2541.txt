While the high-entropy wind (HEW) of Type II supernovae remains one of the
more promising sites for the rapid neutron-capture (r-) process, hydrodynamic
simulations have yet to reproduce the astrophysical conditions under which the
latter occurs. We have performed large-scale network calculations within an
extended parameter range of the HEW, seeking to identify or to constrain the
necessary conditions for a full reproduction of all r-process residuals
N_{r,\odot}=N_{\odot}-N_{s,\odot} by comparing the results with recent
astronomical observations. A superposition of weighted entropy trajectories
results in an excellent reproduction of the overall N_{r,\odot}-pattern beyond
Sn. For the lighter elements, from the Fe-group via Sr-Y-Zr to Ag, our HEW
calculations indicate a transition from the need for clearly different sources
(conditions/sites) to a possible co-production with r-process elements,
provided that a range of entropies are contributing. This explains recent
halo-star observations of a clear non-correlation of Zn and Ge and a weak
correlation of Sr - Zr with heavier r-process elements. Moreover, new
observational data on Ru and Pd seem to confirm also a partial correlation with
Sr as well as the main r-process elements (e.g. Eu).
