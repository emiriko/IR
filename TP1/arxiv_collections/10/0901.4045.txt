The phi(1020) radiative decays form a good playground for study of the
low-lying a0(980) and f0(980) scalar mesons. The complicated interplay of kaon
loop mechanism, isoscalar meson mixing and momentum dependence of the effective
couplings manifests itself in the invariant mass distributions in the phi(1020)
-> pi0 pi0 gamma and pi eta gamma spectra. These distributions are fitted in
framework of Resonance Chiral Theory.
