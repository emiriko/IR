I present an overview of the Galactic binaries that form the foreground for
the ESA/NASA Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The currently known
population is discussed, as well as current and near-future large-scale surveys
that will find new systems. The astrophysics that can be done when the LISA
data becomes available is presented, with particular attention to verification
binaries, the overall Galactic populations, neutron star and black hole
binaries and sources in globular clusters. I discuss the synergy with
electro-magnetic observations and correct an error in the estimate of the
number of LISA systems that can be found in the optical compared to Nelemans
(2006a) and conclude that at least several hundreds of systems should be
detectable.
