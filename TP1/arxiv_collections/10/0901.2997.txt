The slow light effects of an amplitude modulated Gaussian (AMG) pulse in a
cesium atomic vapor are presented. In a single-$\Lambda$ type
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) medium, more severe distortion
is observed for an AMG pulse than a Gaussian one. Using Fourier spectrum
analysis, we find that the distortion, as well as the loss, is dominantly
caused by linear absorption than dispersion. Accordingly, a compensation method
is proposed to reshape the slow light pulse based on the transmission spectrum.
In addition, we find a novel way to obtain simultaneous slow and fast light.
