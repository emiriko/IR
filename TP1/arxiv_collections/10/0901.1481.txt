The tau constant is an important invariant of a metrized graph, and it has
applications in arithmetic properties of curves. We show how the tau constant
of a metrized graph changes under successive edge contractions and deletions.
We discover identities which we call "contraction", "deletion", and
"contraction-deletion" identities on a metrized graph. By establishing a lower
bound for the tau constant in terms of the edge connectivity, we prove that
Baker and Rumely's lower bound conjecture on the tau constant holds for
metrized graphs with edge connectivity 5 or more. We show that proving this
conjecture for 3-regular graphs is enough to prove it for all graphs.
