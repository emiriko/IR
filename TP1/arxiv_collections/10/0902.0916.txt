An isotropic expansion for the QGP is proposed in curved Kasner spacetime for
an experimental configuration with three dimensional set of beams. The fluid of
relativistic particles has no shear viscosity but the nonzero bulk viscosity
$\zeta$ is time dependent and its value could explain the enormous entropy per
baryon of our Universe. In addition, $\zeta$ equals the bulk viscosity of the
anisotropic compressible fluid conjectured for the interior of a black hole.
