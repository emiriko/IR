Straight-forward derivation of planetary parameters can only be achieved in
transiting planetary systems. However, planetary attributes such as radius and
mass strongly depend on stellar host parameters. Discovering a transit host
star to be multiple leads to a necessary revision of the derived stellar and
planetary parameters. Based on our observations of 14 transiting exoplanet
hosts, we derive parameters of the individual components of three transit host
stars (WASP-2, TrES-2, and TrES-4) which we detected to be binaries. Two of
these have not been known to be multiple before. Parameters of the
corresponding exoplanets are revised. High-resolution "Lucky Imaging" with
AstraLux at the 2.2m Calar Alto telescope provided near diffraction limited
images in i' and z' passbands. These results have been combined with existing
planetary data in order to recalibrate planetary attributes. Despite the
faintness (delta mag ~ 4) of the discovered stellar companions to TrES-2,
TrES-4, and WASP-2, light-curve deduced parameters change by up to more than
1sigma. We discuss a possible relation between binary separation and planetary
properties, which - if confirmed - could hint at the influence of binarity on
the planet formation process.
