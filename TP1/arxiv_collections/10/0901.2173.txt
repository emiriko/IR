Several integrate-to-threshold models with differing temporal integration
mechanisms have been proposed to describe the accumulation of sensory evidence
to a prescribed level prior to motor response in perceptual decision-making
tasks. An experiment and simulation studies have shown that the introduction of
time-varying perturbations during integration may distinguish among some of
these models. Here, we present computer simulations and mathematical proofs
that provide more rigorous comparisons among one-dimensional stochastic
differential equation models. Using two perturbation protocols and focusing on
the resulting changes in the means and standard deviations of decision times,
we show that, for high signal-to-noise ratios, drift-diffusion models with
constant and time-varying drift rates can be distinguished from
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, but not necessarily from each other. The
protocols can also distinguish stable from unstable Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
processes, and we show that a nonlinear integrator can be distinguished from
these linear models by changes in standard deviations. The protocols can be
implemented in behavioral experiments.
