A new thermodynamics for liquids related to von Laue's approach (1917)
substitutes some particle priors of Gibb's rational thermodynamics. This allows
the definition of a new dynamic entity ($G$ defect) whose diffusion properties
also claim a largest causal region ($F$ speckle). In the frame of the hidden
charge model \cite{this part} it is discussed, whether this new thermodynamics
can be applied to an initial liquid for cosmology, where the $G$ defects lead
to the later galaxies and the $F$ speckles to a finite expanding universe of
diameter $R$. Far below a "hadronic" Compton wave length $\lambda_{0}$ of order
1 fermi, $R\ll \lambda_{0}$, there is no room left for too small filter
elements, that would, however, be necessary for a filter convergence to an
isolated cold quantum mechanical point particle. When the expansion of the
universe comes to $\lambda_{0}$, i.e. for $R\approx \lambda_{0}$, then many
hadrons are created. The related negative pressure gets large amounts and leads
to an intense hadronic cosmological inflation. -- The $G$ defects are formed by
the shaping power of Levy distribution (preponderant component, hierarchy,
damping factor). A relation between the number of galaxies, the tilt in the
density fluctuation, and the temperature amplitude of the CMB is obtained. For
$R\gg \lambda_{0}$ (much vacuum), the "electromagnetic" $M_4$ tangent objects
are large and flat. This allows a geometric interpretation of the "stony" dark
energy as flatness on the "golden" side of the Einstein equation,
$\Omega_{\Lambda}=1-\Omega_{M}$.
