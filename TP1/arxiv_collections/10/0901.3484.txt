Short-range forecasts of precipitation fields are needed in a wealth of
agricultural, hydrological, ecological and other applications. Forecasts from
numerical weather prediction models are often biased and do not provide
uncertainty information. Here we present a postprocessing technique for such
numerical forecasts that produces correlated probabilistic forecasts of
precipitation accumulation at multiple sites simultaneously. The statistical
model is a spatial version of a two-stage model that represents the
distribution of precipitation by a mixture of a point mass at zero and a Gamma
density for the continuous distribution of precipitation accumulation. Spatial
correlation is captured by assuming that two Gaussian processes drive
precipitation occurrence and precipitation amount, respectively. The first
process is latent and drives precipitation occurrence via a threshold. The
second process explains the spatial correlation in precipitation accumulation.
It is related to precipitation via a site-specific transformation function, so
as to retain the marginal right-skewed distribution of precipitation while
modeling spatial dependence. Both processes take into account the information
contained in the numerical weather forecast and are modeled as stationary
isotropic spatial processes with an exponential correlation function. The
two-stage spatial model was applied to 48-hour-ahead forecasts of daily
precipitation accumulation over the Pacific Northwest in 2004. The predictive
distributions from the two-stage spatial model were calibrated and sharp, and
outperformed reference forecasts for spatially composite and areally averaged
quantities.
