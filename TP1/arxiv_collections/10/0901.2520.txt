Data Models are an essential part of automatic data processing, but even more
so when trying to tie together data coming from many different data sources, as
is the case for the International Virtual Observatory. In this talk we will
review the different data models used in the IVOA, which parts of that Data
Modelling work are still incomplete, specially in radio wavelengths, and the
work the AMIGA group has done within the IVOA Data Modelling Working Group to
overcome those shortcomings both in missing data models and support for Radio
Astronomy.
