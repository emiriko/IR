A new five dimensional spherical vacuum solution is both dervied and its
signature, curvature and truncation discussed. Its truncation leads to a four
dimensional spacetime with similiar stress to those found by charge-free
Kaluza-Klein compactification. Various other restrictions to four dimensions
are looked at to see if they have stresses consisting of electromagnetic fields
or quadratic tensors. The solution is extended to the brane picture where the
extended space is found to obey field equations with metric stress derivable
from a lagrangian dependent on brane function and kaluza scalar.
