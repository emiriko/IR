We extend the study of the Fermi surface instability of the Pomeranchuk type
into systems with orbital band structures, which are common features in
transition metal oxides. Band hybridization significantly shifts the spectra
weight of the Landau interactions from the conventional s-wave channel to
unconventional non-s-wave channels, which results in anisotropic (nematic)
Fermi surface distortions even with ordinary interactions in solids. The
Ginzburg-Landau free energy is constructed by coupling the charge-nematic,
spin-nematic and ferromagnetic order parameters together, which shows that
nematic electron states can be induced by metamagnetism. The connection between
this mechanism to the anisotropic metamagnetc states observed in
Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ at high magnetic fields is studied in a multi-band Hubbard
model with the hybridized quasi-one dimensional $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$-bands.
