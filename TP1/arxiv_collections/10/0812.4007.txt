It is traced out a parallel between the cosmological constant problem and the
polymer physics. The time evolution of the universe world line is compared with
the growing of a polymer chain. An equivalent Flory free energy and a
modification of it are used as a means to evaluate two versions for the radius
of gyration of the universe. It is proposed a link between this radius of
gyration and the cosmological constant parameter.
