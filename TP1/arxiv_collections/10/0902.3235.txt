We calculate the dispersive force between a ground state atom and a non
planar surface. We present explicit results for a corrugated surface, derived
from the scattering approach at first order in the corrugation amplitude. A
variety of analytical results are derived in different limiting cases,
including the van der Waals and Casimir-Polder regimes. We compute numerically
the exact first-order dispersive potential for arbitrary separation distances
and corrugation wavelengths, for a Rubidium atom on top of a silicon or gold
corrugated surface. We discuss in detail the inadequacy of the proximity force
approximation, and present a simple but adequate approximation for computing
the potential.
