Although the study of weak convergence of superpositions of point processes
to the Poisson process dates back to the work of Grigelionis in 1963, it was
only recently that Schuhmacher [Stochastic Process. Appl. 115 (2005)
1819--1837] obtained error bounds for the weak convergence. Schuhmacher
considered dependent superposition, truncated the individual point processes to
0--1 point processes and then applied Stein's method to the latter. In this
paper, we adopt a different approach to the problem by using Palm theory and
Stein's method, thereby expressing the error bounds in terms of the mean
measures of the individual point processes, which is not possible with
Schuhmacher's approach. We consider locally dependent superposition as a
generalization of the locally dependent point process introduced in Chen and
Xia [Ann. Probab. 32 (2004) 2545--2569] and apply the main theorem to the
superposition of thinned point processes and of renewal processes.
