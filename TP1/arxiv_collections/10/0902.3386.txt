In Phys. Rev. D77 (2008) 105001, we have studied decoherence models for
flavour oscillations in four-dimensional stochastically fluctuating space times
and discussed briefly the sensitivity of current terrestrial and astrophysical
neutrino experiments to such models. In this addendum we extend these results
to incorporate the effects due to the expansion of the Universe, so that our
analysis can be useful in studies of extragalactic high-energy neutrinos, such
as those coming from Gamma Ray Bursts at cosmological distances. Unfortunately
for some microscopic models of foam, constructed in the string theory
framework, we arrive at pessimistic conclusions about the detectability of the
decoherence effects via flavour oscillation meaurements.
