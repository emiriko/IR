A chief problem in phylogenetics and database theory is the computation of a
maximum consistent tree from a set of rooted or unrooted trees. A standard
input are triplets, rooted binary trees on three leaves, or quartets, unrooted
binary trees on four leaves. We give exact algorithms constructing rooted and
unrooted maximum consistent supertrees in time O(2^n n^5 m^2 log(m)) for a set
of m triplets (quartets), each one distinctly leaf-labeled by some subset of n
labels. The algorithms extend to weighted triplets (quartets). We further
present fast exact algorithms for constructing rooted and unrooted maximum
consistent trees in polynomial space. Finally, for a set T of m rooted or
unrooted trees with maximum degree D and distinctly leaf-labeled by some subset
of a set L of n labels, we compute, in O(2^{mD} n^m m^5 n^6 log(m)) time, a
tree distinctly leaf-labeled by a maximum-size subset X of L that all trees in
T, when restricted to X, are consistent with.
