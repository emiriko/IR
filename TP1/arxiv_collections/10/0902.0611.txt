We discuss the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well trap
subject to phase noise and particle loss. The phase coherence of a
weakly-interacting condensate, experimentally measured via the contrast in an
interference experiment, as well as the response to an external driving become
maximal for a finite value of the dissipation rate matching the intrinsic time
scales of the system. This can be understood as a stochastic resonance of the
many-particle system. Even stronger effects are observed when dissipation acts
in concurrence with strong inter-particle interactions, restoring the purity of
the condensate almost completely and increasing the phase coherence
significantly. Our theoretical results are backed by Monte Carlo simulations,
which show a good qualitative agreement and provide a microscopic explanation
for the observed stochastic resonance effect.
