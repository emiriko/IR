Diffraction limits the behaviour of light in optical systems and sets the
smallest achievable line width at half the wavelength. With a novel
subwavelength plasmonic lens to reduce the diffraction via an asymmetry and to
generate and squeeze the wave functions, an incident light is focused by the
aperture to a single-line with its width beyond the limit outside the near
zone. The fields focused are radiative and capable of propagating to the far
zone. The light focusing process, besides being of academic interest, is
expected to open up a wide range of application possibilities.
