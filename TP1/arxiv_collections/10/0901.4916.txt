We propose a minimal model for spherical proteins with aeolotopic pair
interactions to describe the equilibrium phase behavior of lysozyme. The
repulsive screened Coulomb interactions between the particles are taken into
account assuming that the net charges are smeared out homogeneously over the
spherical protein surfaces. We incorporate attractive surface patches, with the
interactions between patches on different spheres modeled by an attractive
Yukawa potential. The parameters entering the attractive Yukawa potential part
are determined using information on the experimentally accessed gas-liquid-like
critical point. The Helmholtz free energy of the fluid and solid phases is
calculated using second-order thermodynamic perturbation theory. Our
predictions for the solubility curve are in fair agreement with experimental
data. In addition, we present new experimental data for the gas-liquid
coexistence curves at various salt concentrations and compare these with our
model calculations. In agreement with earlier findings, we observe that the
strength and the range of the attractive potential part only weakly depend on
the salt content.
