We formulate a new Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method applicable to weakly bound
deformed nuclei using the coordinate-space Green's function technique. An
emphasis is put on treatment of quasiparticle states in the continuum, on which
we impose the correct boundary condition of the asymptotic out-going wave. We
illustrate this method with numerical examples.
