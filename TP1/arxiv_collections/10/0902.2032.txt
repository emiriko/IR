The special theory of relativity is the foundation of modern physics, but its
unusual postulate of invariant vacuum speed of light results in a number of
plausible paradoxes. This situation leads to radical criticisms and suspicions
against the theory of relativity. In this paper, from the perspective that the
relativity is nothing but a geometry, we give a uniform resolution to some
famous and typical paradoxes such as the ladder paradox, the Ehrenfest's
rotational disc paradox. The discussion shows that all the paradoxes are caused
by misinterpretation of concepts. We misused the global simultaneity and the
principle of relativity. As a geometry of Minkowski space-time, special
relativity can never result in a logical contradiction.
