Muons produced via the $\pi \to \mu \nu_{\mu}$ decay are in a coherent
superposition of energy states because the $\nu_{\mu}$ is not a mass
eigenstate. This presents an opportunity to access neutrino mixing parameters
via muon decay. The oscillation period is long compared to the muon lifetime
which presents some experimental challenges.
