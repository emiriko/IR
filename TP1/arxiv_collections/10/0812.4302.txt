Gravitational-wave signals from inspirals of binary compact objects (black
holes and neutron stars) are primary targets of the ongoing searches by
ground-based gravitational-wave interferometers (LIGO, Virgo, and GEO-600). We
present parameter-estimation simulations for inspirals of
black-hole--neutron-star binaries using Markov-chain Monte-Carlo methods. As a
specific example of the power of these methods, we consider source localisation
in the sky and analyse the degeneracy in it when data from only two detectors
are used. We focus on the effect that the black-hole spin has on the
localisation estimation. We also report on a comparative Markov-chain
Monte-Carlo analysis with two different waveform families, at 1.5 and 3.5
post-Newtonian order.
