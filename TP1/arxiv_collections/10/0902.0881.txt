We examine the possibility of coherent, reversible information transfer
between solid-state superconducting qubits and ensembles of ultra-cold atoms.
Strong coupling between these systems is mediated by a microwave transmission
line resonator that interacts near-resonantly with the atoms via their
optically excited Rydberg states. The solid-state qubits can then be used to
implement rapid quantum logic gates, while collective metastable states of the
atoms can be employed for long-term storage and optical read-out of quantum
information.
