Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have long been considered as candidates of
ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). We investigate the signatures of CR
proton acceleration in the GRBs by consistently taking into account their
hadronic and electromagnetic interactions. We discuss the implications of our
findings for high-energy gamma ray observations with the recently launched
Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.
