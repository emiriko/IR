Picosecond carrier dynamics in indium antimonide (InSb) following excitation
by below-bandgap broadband far infrared radiation were investigated at 200 K
and 80 K. Using a novel THz-pump/THz-probe scheme with pump THz fields of 100
kV/cm and an intensity of 100 MW/cm^2, we observed carrier heating and impact
ionization. The number of carriers produced exceeds 10^16 cm-3, corresponding
to a change in carrier density Delta N/N of 700% at 80K. The onset of a well
defined absorption peak at 1.2 THz is an indication of changes in LO and LA
phonon populations due to cooling of the hot electrons.
