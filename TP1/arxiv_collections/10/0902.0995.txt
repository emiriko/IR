X-ray pulsations with a 6.85 s period were recently detected in the SMC and
were subsequently identified as originating from the Be/X-ray binary system XTE
J0103-728. The recent localization of the source of the X-ray emission has made
a targeted search for radio pulsations from this source possible. The detection
of pulsed radio emission from XTE J0103-728 would make it only the second
system after PSR B1259-63 that is both a Be/X-ray binary and a radio pulsar. We
observed XTE J0103-728 in Feb 2008 with the Parkes 64-m radio telescope soon
after the identification of the source of X-ray pulsations was reported in
order to search for corresponding radio pulsations. We used a continuous 6.4
hour observation with a 256 MHz bandwidth centered at 1390 MHz using the center
beam of the Parkes multibeam receiver. In the subsequent data analysis, which
included a folding search, a Fourier search, a fast-folding algorithm search,
and a single-pulse search, no pulsed signals were found for trial dispersion
measures (DMs) between 0 and 800 pc cm^-3. This DM range easily encompasses the
expected values for sources in the SMC. We place an upper limit of ~45 mJy
kpc^2 on the luminosity of periodic radio emission from XTE J0103-728 at the
epoch of our observation, and we compare this limit to a range of luminosities
measured for PSR B1259-63, the only Be/X-ray binary currently known to emit
radio pulses. We also compare our limit to the radio luminosities of neutron
stars having similarly long spin periods to XTE J0103-728. Since the radio
pulses from PSR B1259-63 are eclipsed and undetectable during the portion of
the orbit near periastron, repeated additional radio search observations of XTE
J0103-728 may be valuable if it is undergoing similar eclipsing and if such
observations are able to sample the orbital phase of this system well.
