Consumers of mass media must have a comprehensive, balanced and plural
selection of news to get an unbiased perspective; but achieving this goal can
be very challenging, laborious and time consuming. News stories development
over time, its (in)consistency, and different level of coverage across the
media outlets are challenges that a conscientious reader has to overcome in
order to alleviate bias.
  In this paper we present an intelligent agent framework currently
facilitating analysis of the main sources of on-line news in El Salvador. We
show how prior tools of text analysis and Web 2.0 technologies can be combined
with minimal manual intervention to help individuals on their rational decision
process, while holding media outlets accountable for their work.
