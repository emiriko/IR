The establishment of a scalable scheme for quantum computing with addressable
and long-lived qubits would be a scientific watershed, harnessing the laws of
quantum physics to solve classically intractable problems. The design of many
proposed quantum computational platforms is driven by competing needs:
isolating the quantum system from the environment to prevent decoherence, and
easily and accurately controlling the system with external fields. For example,
neutral-atom optical-lattice architectures provide environmental isolation
through the use of states that are robust against fluctuating external fields,
yet external fields are essential for qubit addressing. Here we demonstrate the
selection of individual qubits with external fields, despite the fact that the
qubits are in field-insensitive superpositions. We use a spatially
inhomogeneous external field to map selected qubits to a different
field-insensitive superposition ("optical MRI"), minimally perturbing
unselected qubits, despite the fact that the addressing field is not spatially
localized. We show robust single-qubit rotations on neutral-atom qubits located
at selected lattice sites. This precise coherent control is an important step
forward for lattice-based neutral-atom quantum computation, and is quite
generally applicable to state transfer and qubit isolation in other
architectures using field-insensitive qubits.
