We consider avoiding squares and overlaps over the natural numbers, using a
greedy algorithm that chooses the least possible integer at each step; the word
generated is lexicographically least among all such infinite words. In the case
of avoiding squares, the word is 01020103..., the familiar ruler function, and
is generated by iterating a uniform morphism. The case of overlaps is more
challenging. We give an explicitly-defined morphism phi : N* -> N* that
generates the lexicographically least infinite overlap-free word by iteration.
Furthermore, we show that for all h,k in N with h <= k, the word phi^{k-h}(h)
is the lexicographically least overlap-free word starting with the letter h and
ending with the letter k, and give some of its symmetry properties.
