We summarize the R&D activities on a novel semitransparent microstrip sensor
to be used on laser-based alignment systems for silicon trackers. The new
sensor is used both for particle tracking and laser detection. The aim of this
research line is to increase the optical transmittance (T) of Silicon
microstrips detectors to infrared light, introducing minor modifications to the
sensor design still suitable for its industrial production. The optical
simulations used in the sensor design have been experimentally validated
against several patterned material samples. This activities have been carried
out in the context of SiLC collaboration for the next International Linear
Collider.
