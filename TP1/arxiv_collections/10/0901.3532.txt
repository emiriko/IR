We investigate the dynamical response of a mass defect in a one-dimensional
non-loaded horizontal chain of identical spheres which interact via the
nonlinear Hertz potential. Our experiments show that the interaction of a
solitary wave with a light intruder excites localized mode. In agreement with
dimensional analysis, we find that the frequency of localized oscillations
exceeds the incident wave frequency spectrum and nonlinearly depends on the
size of the intruder and on the incident wave strength. The absence of tensile
stress between grains allows some gaps to open, which in turn induce a
significant enhancement of the oscillations amplitude. We performed numerical
simulations that precisely describe our observations without any adjusting
parameters.
