We have used the He I discontinuities at 3421A to determine the electron
temperatures, designated Te(He I), for a sample of five Galactic planetary
nebulae (PNe). We compared Te(He I) with the electron temperatures derived from
the hydrogen Balmer jump at 3646A, designated Te(H I), and found that Te(He I)
are generally lower than Te(H I). There are two possible interpretations, a)
the presence of substantial He+2 zone, or b) the presence of hydrogen-deficient
cold clumps within diffuse nebulae. A series of photoionization models were
constructed to test the two scenarios. We found that the observed Te(He I)/Te(H
I) discrepancies are beyond the predictions of chemically homogeneous models.
Our modelling shows that the presence of a small amount of hydrogen-deficient
inclusions seems to be able to reproduce the observed intensities of He I
discontinuities. We stress the value of He I discontinuities in investigating
nebular physical conditions. Albeit with some observational and technical
limitations, He I discontinuities should be considered in future modelling
work.
