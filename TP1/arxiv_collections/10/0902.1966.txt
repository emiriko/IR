We investigate features that are observed in Ca ii H sequences from Hinode in
places where reversed granulation seems to interact with p-modes. These
features appear ubiquitously in the quiet sun. They are co-spatial with
reversed granulation, and display similar general properties, but have sharper
edges and show fast brightness changes. They also appear predominantly above
wide intergranular lanes, indicating a potential connection with magnetism. We
report on the appearance and dynamics of these features using high-resolution,
high-cadence observations from Hinode, and we discuss their possible origin.
