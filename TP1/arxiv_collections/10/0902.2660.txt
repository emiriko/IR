We present measurements of the semileptonic decays B- --> D0 tau- nubar_tau,
B- --> D*0 tau- nubar_tau, B0bar --> D+ tau- nubar_tau, and B0bar --> D*+ tau-
nubar_tau, which are sensitive to non--Standard Model amplitudes in certain
scenarios. The data sample consists of 232x10^6 Upsilon(4S) --> BBbar decays
collected with the BaBar detector at the PEP-II e+e- collider. We select events
with a D or D* meson and a light lepton (ell=e or mu) recoiling against a fully
reconstructed B meson. We perform a fit to the joint distribution of lepton
momentum and missing mass squared to distinguish signal B --> D(*) tau-
nubar_tau (tau- --> ell- nubar_ell nu_tau) events from the backgrounds,
predominantly B --> D(*) ell- nubar_ell. We measure the branching-fraction
ratios R(D) == BR(B --> D tau- nubar_tau) / BR(B --> D ell- nubar_ell) and
R(D*) == BR(B --> D* tau- nubar_tau) / BR(B --> D* ell- nubar_ell) and, from a
combined fit to B- and B0bar channels, obtain the results R(D)=(41.6 +/- 11.7
+/- 5.2)% and R(D*)=(29.7 +/- 5.6 +/- 1.8)%, where the uncertainties are
statistical and systematic. Normalizing to measured B- --> D(*)0 ell- nubar_ell
branching fractions, we obtain BR(B --> D tau- nubar_tau)=(0.86 +/- 0.24 +/-
0.11 +/- 0.06)% and BR(B --> D* tau- nubar_tau)=(1.62 +/- 0.31 +/- 0.10 +/-
0.05)%, where the additional third uncertainty is from the normalization mode.
We also present, for the first time, distributions of the lepton momentum,
p*_ell, and the squared momentum transfer, q^2.
