We discuss recently obtained data using different experimental methods
including magnetoresistance measurements that indicate the existence of
metal-free high-temperature magnetic order in graphite. Intrinsic as well as
extrinsic difficulties to trigger magnetic order by irradiation of graphite are
discussed in view of recently published theoretical work.
