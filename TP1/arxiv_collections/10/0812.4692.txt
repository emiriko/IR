RNA polymerase (RNAP) is a mobile molecular workshop that polymerizes a RNA
molecule by adding monomeric subunits one by one, while moving step by step on
the DNA template itself. Here we develop a theoretical model by incorporating
the steric interactions of the RNAPs and their mechanochemical cycles which
explicitly captures the cyclical shape changes of each motor. Using this model,
we explain not only the dependence of the average velocity of a RNAP on the
externally applied load force, but also predict a {\it nonmotonic} variation of
the average velocity on external torque. We also show the effect of steric
interactions of the motors on the total rate of RNA synthesis. In principle,
our predictions can be tested by carrying out {\it in-vitro} experiments which
we suggest here.
