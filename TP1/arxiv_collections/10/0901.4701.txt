It has been recently argued that the depletion attraction may play an
important role in different aspects of the cellular organization, ranging from
the organization of transcriptional activity in transcription factories to the
formation of the nuclear bodies. In this paper we suggest a new application of
these ideas in the context of the splicing process, a crucial step of messanger
RNA maturation in Eukaryotes. We shall show that entropy effects and the
resulting depletion attraction may explain the relevance of the aspecific
intron length variable in the choice of the splice-site recognition modality.
On top of that, some qualitative features of the genome architecture of higher
Eukaryotes can find an evolutionary realistic motivation in the light of our
model.
