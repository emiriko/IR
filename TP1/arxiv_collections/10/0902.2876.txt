We measure the vacuum energy of two-dimensional N=(2,2) super Yang-Mills
theory using lattice simulation. The obtained vacuum energy density is
E_0=0.09(9)(+10-8) g^2, where the first error is the systematic and the second
is the statistical one, measured in the dimensionful gauge coupling g which
governs the scale of the system. The result is consistent with unbroken
supersymmetry, although we cannot exclude a possible very small non-zero vacuum
energy.
