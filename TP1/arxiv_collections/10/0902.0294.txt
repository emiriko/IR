We show through a simple example that perturbations of the Hamiltonian of a
spin glass which cannot be detected at the level of the free energy can
completely alter the behavior of the overlap. In particular, perturbations of
order O(log N), with N the size of the system, suffice to have ultrametricity
emerge in the thermodynamical limit.
