We present 11 independent measurements of the half-life and spectral shape of
the 4-fold forbidden beta decay of 113-Cd using CdZnTe semiconductors with a
total combined lifetime of 6.58 kg days. Our overall result gives a half-life
of (8.00 +/- 0.11(stat) +/- 0.24(sys)) x 10^15 years and a Q value of 322.2 +/-
0.3(stat) +/- 0.9(sys) keV. For the first time half-lives well beyond 10^10
years have been deduced with a statistically representative sample of
independent measurements.
