We show that an explicit counting of Gribov copies can shed light on the
infrared behavior of non-abelian gauge theories. A power-law growth of the
number of copies suppresses gluon propagation while the distribution of copies
along a gauge orbit implies an enhanced density of small eigenvalues of the
Fadeev-Popov operator. Both of these phenomena are related to confinement. The
discreteness in the number of copies and the associated nonlocality also has
implications for vacuum energy.
