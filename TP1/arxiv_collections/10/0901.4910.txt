The 3+1 (canonical) decomposition of all geometries admitting two-dimensional
space-like surfaces is exhibited. A proposal consisting of a specific
re-normalization {\bf Assumption} and an accompanying {\bf Requirement} is put
forward, which enables the canonical quantization of these geometries. The
resulting Wheeler-deWitt equation is based on a re-normalized manifold
parameterized by three smooth scalar functionals. The entire space of solutions
to this equation is analytically given, exploiting the freedom left by the
imposition of the {\bf Requirement} and contained in the third functional.
