We study the nucleon, Sigma and cascade octet baryon electromagnetic form
factors and the effects of SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking from 2+1-flavor
lattice calculations. We find that electric and magnetic radii are similar; the
maximum discrepancy is about 10%. In the pion-mass region we explore, both the
quark-component and full-baryon moments have small SU(3) symmetry breaking. We
extrapolate the charge radii and the magnetic moments using three-flavor
heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory (HBXPT). The systematic errors due to
chiral and continuum extrapolations remain significant, giving rise to charge
radii for $p$ and $\Sigma^-$ that are 3--4 standard deviations away from the
known experimental ones. Within these systematics the predicted $\Sigma^+$ and
$\Xi^-$ radii are 0.67(5) and 0.306(15) fm$^2$ respectively. When the
next-to-next-to-leading order of HBXPT is included, the extrapolated magnetic
moments are less than 3 standard deviations away from PDG values, and the
discrepancy is possibly due to remaining chiral and continuum extrapolation
errors.
