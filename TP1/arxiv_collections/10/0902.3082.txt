To study the evolution of protoplanetary dust aggregates, we performed
experiments with up to 2600 collisions between single, highly-porous dust
aggregates and a solid plate. The dust aggregates consisted of spherical
SiO$_2$ grains with 1.5$\mu$m diameter and had an initial volume filling factor
(the volume fraction of material) of $\phi_0=0.15$. The aggregates were put
onto a vibrating baseplate and, thus, performed multiple collisions with the
plate at a mean velocity of 0.2 m s$^{-1}$. The dust aggregates were observed
by a high-speed camera to measure their size which apparently decreased over
time as a measure for their compaction. After 1000 collisions the volume
filling factor was increased by a factor of two, while after $\sim2000$
collisions it converged to an equilibrium of $\phi\approx0.36$. In few
experiments the aggregate fragmented, although the collision velocity was well
below the canonical fragmentation threshold of $\sim1$ m s$^{-1}$. The
compaction of the aggregate has an influence on the surface-to-mass ratio and
thereby the dynamic behavior and relative velocities of dust aggregates in the
protoplanetary nebula. Moreover, macroscopic material parameters, namely the
tensile strength, shear strength, and compressive strength, are altered by the
compaction of the aggregates, which has an influence on their further
collisional behavior. The occurrence of fragmentation requires a reassessment
of the fragmentation threshold velocity.
