When electrons are subject to a large external magnetic field, the
conventional charge quantum Hall effect \cite{Klitzing,Tsui} dictates that an
electronic excitation gap is generated in the sample bulk, but metallic
conduction is permitted at the boundary. Recent theoretical models suggest that
certain bulk insulators with large spin-orbit interactions may also naturally
support conducting topological boundary states in the extreme quantum limit,
which opens up the possibility for studying unusual quantum Hall-like phenomena
in zero external magnetic field. Bulk Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$ single crystals are
expected to be prime candidates for one such unusual Hall phase of matter known
as the topological insulator. The hallmark of a topological insulator is the
existence of metallic surface states that are higher dimensional analogues of
the edge states that characterize a spin Hall insulator. In addition to its
interesting boundary states, the bulk of Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$ is predicted to
exhibit three-dimensional Dirac particles, another topic of heightened current
interest. Here, using incident-photon-energy-modulated (IPEM-ARPES), we report
the first direct observation of massive Dirac particles in the bulk of
Bi$_{0.9}$Sb$_{0.1}$, locate the Kramers' points at the sample's boundary and
provide a comprehensive mapping of the topological Dirac insulator's gapless
surface modes. These findings taken together suggest that the observed surface
state on the boundary of the bulk insulator is a realization of the much sought
exotic "topological metal". They also suggest that this material has potential
application in developing next-generation quantum computing devices.
