We have developed a new simple method to build the exact analytical
expression of the eigenenergy as a function of the potential. The idea of our
method is mainly based on the partitioning of the potential curve, solving the
Schr\"odinger equation, realizing a discrete form of the energy quantification
condition, and finally, deriving its integral form which permit to create a
simple relation: Energy-potential. Our method has been applied to three
examples: the well-known square well, the harmonic oscillators, and the Morse
potential. Our non numerical method is more realistic, simpler, with high
degree of accuracy, both satisfactory and not computationally complicated, and
applicable for any forms of potential. Our results agree very well with the
preceding ones.
