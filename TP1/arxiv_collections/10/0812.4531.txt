We study the edge excitations of the Chern Simons matrix theory, describing
the Laughlin fluids for filling fraction $\nu=\frac{1}{k}$, with $k$ an
integer. Based on the semiclassical solutions of the theory, we are able to
identify the bulk and edge degrees of freedom. In this way we can freeze the
bulk of the theory, to the semiclassical values, obtaining an effective theory
governing the boundary excitations of the Chern Simons matrix theory. Finally,
we show that this effective theory is equal to the chiral boson theory on the
circle.
