There exist two popular energy-momentum tensors for an electromagnetic wave
in a dielectric medium. The Abraham expression is robust to experimental
verification but more mathematically demanding, while the Minkowski expression
is the foundation of a number of simplifications commonly found within the
literature, including the relative refractive index transformation often used
in modelling optical tweezers. These simplifications are based on neglecting
the Minkowski tensor's material counterpart, a process known to be incompatible
with conservation of angular momentum, and in conflict with experimental
results, yet they are very successful in a wide range of circumstances. This
paper combines existing constraints on their usage with recent theoretical
analysis to obtain a list of conditions which much be satisfied to safely use
the simplified Minkowski approach. Applying these conditions to an experiment
proposed by Padgett et al., we find their prediction in agreement with that
obtained using the total energy-momentum tensor.
