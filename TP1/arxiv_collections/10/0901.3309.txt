Squeezing experiments which are capable of creating a minimum uncertainty
state during the nonlinear process, for example optical parametric
amplification, are commonly used to produce light far below the quantum noise
limit. This report presents a method with which one can characterize this
minimum uncertainty state and gain valuable knowledge of the experimental
setup.
