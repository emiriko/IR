The effect of the right-left asymmetry is considered in the angular
distribution of gamma quanta from fission of U-235 by polarised thermal
neutrons, which depends on the polarisation of the neutrons with respect to the
gamma-fission plane. Electric dipole radiation from fission fragments arising
due to the Strutinsky-Denisov induced polarisation mechanism may give rise to
such an effect. Earlier, this mechanism was shown to fit the non-statistical
part observed in the gamma spectrum from spontaneous fission of Cf-252. The
calculated value of the magnitude of the asymmetry parameter is on the level of
10$^{-4}$. That is in agreement with the current experimental data. A crucial
experiment to give a more definite picture of the concrete mechanism would be
determination of the energy of the quanta responsible for the asymmetry.
Detection of the quanta with the energy of ~5 MeV approaching the giant dipole
resonance is needed in order to identify prompt gamma rays emitted at the stage
of fissioning.
