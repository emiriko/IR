We present measurements of the longitudinal spin asymmetry, $A_{LL}$, for the
inclusive jet signal at STAR. The data presented here are mid-rapidity jets in
the transverse momentum range of $5<pT<35$ GeV/c and come from polarized
proton-proton collisions at center of mass energies of $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV. We
compare our measured $A_{LL}$ values to predictions derived from various
parameterizations of the polarized gluon distribution function. The results are
shown to provide significant constraints for allowable gluon parameterizations
within the measurement's kinematic Bjorken-x range of $0.03<x<0.3$.
