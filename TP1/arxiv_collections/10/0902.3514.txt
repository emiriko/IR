In this paper, we present results of a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme
applied to deterministic computations of the transients for the
Boltzmann-Poisson system describing electron transport in semiconductor
devices. The collisional term models optical-phonon interactions which become
dominant under strong energetic conditions corresponding to nano-scale active
regions under applied bias. The proposed numerical technique is a finite
element method using discontinuous piecewise polynomials as basis functions on
unstructured meshes. It is applied to simulate hot electron transport in bulk
silicon, in a silicon $n^+$-$n$-$n^+$ diode and in a double gated 12nm MOSFET.
Additionally, the obtained results are compared to those of a high order WENO
scheme simulation and DSMC (Discrete Simulation Monte Carlo) solvers.
