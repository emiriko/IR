The crystal structure, anisotropic electrical resistivity and magnetic
susceptibility, as well as specific heat results from single crystals of
BaFe2As2, BaNi2As2, and BaFeNiAs2 are surveyed. BaFe2As2 properties demonstrate
the equivalence of C(T), Fisher's d(XT)/dT, and dp/dT results in determining
the antiferromagnetic transition at TN = 132(1) K. BaNi2As2 shows a structural
phase transition from a high-temperature tetragonal phase to a low-temperature
triclinic (P-1) phase at T0 = 131 K.The superconducting critical temperature
for BaNi2As2 is well below T0 and at Tc = 0.69 K. BaFeNiAs2 does not show any
sign of superconductivity to 0.4 K and exhibits properties similar to BaCo2As2,
a renormalized paramagnetic metal.
