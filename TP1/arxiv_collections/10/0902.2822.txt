A strong periodic potential generally enhances the short wavelength
fluctuations of a superfluid beyond the validity of standard continuum
approaches. Here we report some recent results on hard core bosons on finite
lattices. We find several interesting effects of the periodic potential on the
ground state, vortex dynamics, and and Hall conductivity. For example, the
Magnus field on a vortex abruptly reverses direction at half filling. A
rotating Bose condensate on an optical lattice may allow an experimental test
of our results. Insight may also be gained about strongly fluctuating
superconductors modelled by charge 2e lattice bosons.
