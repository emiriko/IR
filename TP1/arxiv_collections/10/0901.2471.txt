Using a time-dependent multifluid, magnetohydrodynamic code, we calculated
the structure of steady perpendicular and oblique C-type shocks in dusty
plasmas. We included relevant processes to describe mass transfer between the
different fluids, radiative cooling by emission lines and grain charging and
studied the effect of single-sized and multiple sized grains on the shock
structure. Our models are the first of oblique fast-mode molecular shocks in
which such a rigorous treatment of the dust grain dynamics has been combined
with a self-consistent calculation of the thermal and ionisation structures
including appropriate microphysics. At low densities the grains do not play any
significant role in the shock dynamics. At high densities, the ionisation
fraction is sufficiently low that dust grains are important charge and current
carriers and, thus, determine the shock structure. We find that the magnetic
field in the shock front has a significant rotation out of the initial upstream
plane. This is most pronounced for single-sized grains and small angles of the
shock normal with the magnetic field. Our results are similar to previous
studies of steady C-type shocks showing that our method is efficient, rigorous
and robust. Unlike the method employed in the previous most detailed treatment
of dust in steady oblique fast-mode shocks, ours allows a reliable calculation
even when chemical or other conditions deviate from local statistical
equilibrium. We are also able to model transient phenomena.
