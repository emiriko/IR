At the International Linear Collider (ILC), measurement of the beam profile
at the interaction point (IP) is a key issue to achieve high luminosity. We
studied the beam size measurement by combination of Pair Monitor and BeamCal.
We obtained measurement accuracies of 2.7%, and 6.6% for the horizontal, and
vertical beam sizes, respectively, for 50 bunch crossings.
