Different characteristic of matter influencing the evolution of the Universe
has been simulated by means of a nonlinear spinor field. Using the nonlinear
spinor field corresponding to different types of perfect fluid or dark energy
as a source of gravitational field, evolution of a Bianchi type-I universe has
been illustrated.
