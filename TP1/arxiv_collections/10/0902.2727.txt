Extensive Monte Carlo simulations of bulk liquid para-hydrogen at a
temperature T=16.5 K have been carried out using the continuous-space Worm
Algorithm. Results for the momentum distribution, as well as for the kinetic
energy per particle and the pair correlation function are reported. The static
equilibrium thermodynamic properties of this system can be generally computed
by assuming that molecules are distinguishable. However, the one-body density
matrix (and the associated momentum distribution) are affected by particle
indistinguishability and quantum statistics, to an extent that lends itself to
experimental observation. Comparisons with available experimental data and
other theoretical and numerical calculations are offered.
