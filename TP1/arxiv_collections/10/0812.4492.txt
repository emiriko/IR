This article discusses the advantages of using wireless keypads in the
Lecture/classroom. This new technology requires multiple-choice (MC) questions
to mate with the keypad entry features of these devices. The format of the
traditional MC response is constrained to five choices and only one best
response is allowed. For this reason, we propose enhancements to the
traditional MC question. This enhanced MC question allows as many as ten
answers. The answers can vary in their degree of correctness and can be
assigned partial credit. By combining wireless keypads and multiple-choice
questions, we can readily perform both formative and summative assessments of
student learning. Examples and classroom applications are presented.
