Current situation in studies of mean lifetimes of excited
electronic-vibro-rotational states of hydrogen molecule (including the H2, D2,
HD and T2 isotopomers) is reviewed in brief. All measured values of the
lifetimes (published before November 2008) are collected and presented in
tabular form. Complete bibliography of papers devoted to semi-empirical
determination and non-empirical calculation of the lifetimes is presented. The
experimental data obtained in various papers are compared with the results of
semi-empirical determination and non-empirical calculations.
