The idea of black hole remnants for RG modified Schwarzschild solution
constructed in papers [hep-th/0002196; hep-th/0602159] depends essentially on
the positiveness of a parameter that enters the running Newton constant. The
positiveness of this parameter was established by comparing the large distance
expansion of RG modified Schwarzschild solution with the Donoghue's original
result about the one-loop correction to the Newtonian potential [gr-qc/9310024;
gr-qc/9405057]. But since the appearance of paper [gr-qc/0207118] by
Khriplovich and Kirilin it became widely appreciated that the sign of one-loop
correction in Donoghue's original result is incorrect. This falsifies the
argument for existence of black hole remnants in the framework of modified
Schwarzschild solution construction suggested in the above papers. But most
importantly the very construction of this modified Schwarzschild solution is
challenged by the study of graviton radiative corrections to the Newtonian
potential and running Newton constant [hep-th/0211071].
