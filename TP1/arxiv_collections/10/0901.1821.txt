Using elementary duality properties of positive semidefinite moment matrices
and polynomial sum-of-squares decompositions, we prove that the convex hull of
rationally parameterized algebraic varieties is semidefinite representable
(that is, it can be represented as a projection of an affine section of the
cone of positive semidefinite matrices) in the case of (a) curves; (b)
hypersurfaces parameterized by quadratics; and (c) hypersurfaces parameterized
by bivariate quartics; all in an ambient space of arbitrary dimension.
