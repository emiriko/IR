In these proceedings, we summarize our studies of free string propagation in
(near-)singular scale-invariant plane wave geometries. We analyze the singular
limit of the evolution for the center-of-mass motion and all excited string
modes. The requirement that the entire excitation energy of the string should
be finite excludes consistent propagation across the singularity, in case no
dimensionful scales are introduced at the singular locus (in an otherwise
scale-invariant space-time).
