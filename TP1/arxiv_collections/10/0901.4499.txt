The double perovskite Sr2CrReO6 is an interesting material for spintronics,
showing ferrimagnetism up to 635 K with a predicted high spin polarization of
about 86%. We fabricated Sr2CrReO6 epitaxial films by pulsed laser deposition
on (001)-oriented SrTiO3 substrates. Phase-pure films with optimum
crystallographic and magnetic properties were obtained by growing at a
substrate temperature of 700 degree C in pure O2 of 6.6x10-4 mbar. The films
are c-axis oriented, coherently strained, and show less than 20% anti-site
defects. The magnetization curves reveal high saturation magnetization of 0.8
muB per formula unit and high coercivity of 1.1 T, as well as a strong magnetic
anisotropy.
