I review the quantum kinematics of identical particles, which suggests new
possibilities, beyond bosons and fermions, in 2+1 dimensions; and how simple
flux-charge constructions embody the new possibilities, leading to both abelian
and nonabelian anyons. I briefly allude to experimental realizations, and also
advertise a spinor construction of nonabelian statistics, that has a 3+1
dimensional extension.
