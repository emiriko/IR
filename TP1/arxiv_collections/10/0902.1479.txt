A near-field scanning optical microscope is used to locally induce
photocurrent in a graphene transistor with high spatial resolution. By
analyzing the spatially resolved photo-response, we find that in the n-type
conduction regime a p-n-p structure forms along the graphene device due to the
doping of the graphene by the metal contacts. The modification of the
electronic structure is not limited only underneath the metal electrodes, but
extends 0.2-0.3 um into the graphene channel. The asymmetric conduction
behavior of electrons and holes that is commonly observed in graphene
transistors is discussed in light of the potential profiles obtained from this
photocurrent imaging approach. Furthermore, we show that photocurrent imaging
can be used to probe single- / multi-layer graphene interfaces.
