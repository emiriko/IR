Within the relativistic quantum field theory, we analyze the differences
between the $\pi N$ reaction models constructed from using (1)
three-dimensional reductions of Bethe-Salpeter Equation, (2) method of unitary
transformation, and (3) time-ordered perturbation theory. Their relations with
the approach based on the dispersion relations of S-matrix theory are
dicusssed.
