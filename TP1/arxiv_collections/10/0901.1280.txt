We study the quantumness of bipartite correlations by proposing a quantity
that combines a measure of total correlations -- mutual information -- with the
notion of broadcast copies -- i.e., generally nonfactorized copies -- of
bipartite states. By analyzing how our quantity increases with the number of
broadcast copies, we are able to classify classical, separable, and entangled
states. This motivates the definition of the broadcast regularization of mutual
information, the asymptotic minimal mutual information per broadcast copy,
which we show to have many properties of an entanglement measure.
