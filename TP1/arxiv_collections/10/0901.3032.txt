Asymptotic Giant Branch variables are found to obey period-luminosity
relations in the mid-IR similar to those seen at K_S (2.14 microns), even at 24
microns where emission from circumstellar dust is expected to be dominant.
Their loci in the M, logP diagrams are essentially the same for the LMC and for
NGC6522 in spite of different ages and metallicities. There is no systematic
trend of slope with wavelength. The offsets of the apparent magnitude vs. logP
relations imply a difference between the two fields of 3.8 in distance modulus.
The colours of the variables confirm that a principal period with log P > 1.75
is a necessary condition for detectable mass-loss. At the longest observed
wavelength, 24 microns, many semi-regular variables have dust shells comparable
in luminosity to those around Miras. There is a clear bifurcation in LMC
colour-magnitude diagrams involving 24 micron magnitudes.
