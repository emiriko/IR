The kinetics of the process of defect accumulation in rare-gas solids as a
result of exciton self-trapping was studied using the selective vacuum
ultraviolet photoluminescence method for monitoring of the crystal structure of
the samples. The simple kinetic model of defect accumulation in rare-gas
samples was applied to the fitting of the dose dependences of luminescence from
solid Xe and Ne. The characteristic kinetic parameters were obtained by linear
transformation of the time dependence of luminescence intensity of "defect"
subbands.
