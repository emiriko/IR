A particle rotor model is developed which couples several valence protons and
neutrons to a rigid triaxial rotor core. It is applied to investigating the
chirality in odd-$A$ nucleus $^{135}$Nd with $\pi h_{11/2}^2\otimes\nu
h^{-1}_{11/2}$ configuration for the first time in a fully quantal approach.
For the two chiral sister bands, the observed energies and the $B(M1)$ and
$B(E2)$ values for the in-band as well as interband transitions are reproduced
excellently. Root mean square values of the angular momentum components and
their probability distributions are used for discussing in detail the chiral
geometry of the aplanar rotation and its evolution with angular momentum.
Chirality is found to change from a soft chiral vibration to nearly static
chirality at spin $I=39/2$ and back to another type of chiral vibration at
higher spin.
