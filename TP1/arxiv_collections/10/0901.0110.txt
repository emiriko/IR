Without any analytical assumption we solve the ladder QED2+1 in Minkowski
space. Further, we transform Greens functions to the Temporal Euclidean space,
wherein we show that in the special case of ladder QED2+1 the solution is fully
equivalent to the Minkowski one.
  The obtained complex fermion propagator exhibits confinement because of the
lack of the pole at the real timelike $q^2$ axis.
