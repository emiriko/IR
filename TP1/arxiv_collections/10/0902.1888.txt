In the context of a classical example of glass-formation in 3-dimensions we
exemplify how to construct a statistical mechanical theory of the glass
transition. At the heart of the approach is a simple criterion for verifying a
proper choice of up-scaled quasi-species that allow the construction of a
theory with a finite number of 'states'. Once constructed, the theory
identifies a typical scale $\xi$ that increases rapidly with lowering the
temperature and which determines the $\alpha$-relaxation time $\tau_\alpha$ as
$\tau_\alpha \sim \exp(\mu\xi/T)$ with $\mu$ a typical chemical potential. The
theory can predict relaxation times at temperatures that are inaccessible to
numerical simulations.
