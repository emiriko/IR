We demonstrate that an economical two Higgs doublet model can explain the
electron and positron excesses in the recent ATIC and PAMELA experiments by the
three body decays of the dark matter (DM) fermions without requiring the fine
turning of the couplings and degeneracy of masses. We also show that the mass
and lifetime of the decaying DM particle may not be fixed to be around 1 TeV
and 10^{26} sec, respectively. Moreover, we note that this model includes a
stable dark matter candidate as well.
