This work is devoted to experimental study of influence of superconductivity
(S) on ferromagnetism (FM) (inverse proximity effects) with the help of
Polarized Neutron Reflectivity. Combining meausurements of specular and diffuse
intensities it is possible to obtain full picture of magnetization change in
S/FM layered systems like magnetization rotation, domain state formation,
inducing of magnetization in S layer, etc. To increase weak magnetic signal we
propose to use enhanced neutron standing wave regime (e.g. waveguides). In
previous work we have made calculation to increase enhcanced factor. Here we
present results of preparation sets of S/FM samples and attestation of their
structural, magnetic, superconducting and neutron waveguide properties.
