We compute the two-loop crossed six-line vertex master integral with two
massive lines in dimensional regularisation, and give the result up to the
finite part in D-4. We focus in particular on the purely analytical calculation
of the boundary condition which we derive from a three-fold Mellin-Barnes
representation. We also describe how the computation of the boundary condition
is used to derive three non-trivial relations among harmonic polylogarithms of
the sixth root of unity.
