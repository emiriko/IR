FROG is a generic framework dedicated to visualisation of events in high
energy experiment. It is suitable to any particular physics experiment or
detector design. The code is light (<3 MB) and fast (browsing time ~20 events
per second for a large High Energy Physics experiment) and can run on various
operating systems, as its object-oriented structure (C++) relies on the
cross-platform OPENGL and GLUT libraries. Moreover, FROG does not require
installation of third party libraries for the visualisation. This document
describes the features and principles of FROG version 1.106, its working scheme
and numerous functionalities such as: 3D and 2D visualisations, graphical user
interface, mouse interface, configuration files, production of pictures of
various format, integration of personal objects, etc. Finally, several examples
of its current applications are presented for illustration.
