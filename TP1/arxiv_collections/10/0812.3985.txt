We justify a Chapman-Enskog expansion for discontinuous solutions of
hyperbolic conservation laws containing shock waves with small strength.
Precisely, we establish pointwise uniform estimates for the difference between
the traveling waves of a relaxation model and the traveling waves of the
corresponding diffusive equations determined by a Chapman-Enskog expansion
procedure to first- or second-order.
