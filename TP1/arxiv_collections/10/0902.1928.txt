We study the transition from ballistic to diffusive and localized transport
in graphene nanoribbons in the presence of binary disorder, which can be
generated by chemical adsorbates or substitutional doping. We show that the
interplay between the induced average doping (arising from the non-zero average
of the disorder) and impurity scattering modifies the traditional picture of
phase-coherent transport. Close to the Dirac point, intrinsic evanescent modes
produced by the impurities dominate transport at short lengths, giving rise to
a new regime analogous to pseudodiffusive transport in clean graphene, but
without the requirement of heavily doped contacts. This intrinsic
pseudodiffusive regime precedes the traditional ballistic, diffusive and
localized regimes. The last two regimes exhibit a strongly modified effective
number of propagating modes, and a mean free path which becomes anomalously
large close to the Dirac point.
