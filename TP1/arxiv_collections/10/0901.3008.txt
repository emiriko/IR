Observational evidences point to a common explosion mechanism of Type Ia
supernovae based on a delayed detonation of a white dwarf. Although several
scenarios have been proposed and explored by means of one, two, and
three-dimensional simulations, the key point still is the understanding of the
conditions under which a stable detonation can form in a destabilized white
dwarf. One of the possibilities that have been invoked is that an inefficient
deflagration leads to the pulsation of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf,
followed by formation of an accretion shock around a carbon-oxygen rich core.
The accretion shock confines the core and transforms kinetic energy from the
collapsing halo into thermal energy of the core, until an inward moving
detonation is formed. This chain of events has been termed Pulsating Reverse
Detonation (PRD). In this work we explore the robustness of the detonation
ignition for different PRD models characterized by the amount of mass burned
during the deflagration phase, M_defl. The evolution of the white dwarf up to
the formation of the accretion shock has been followed with a three-dimensional
hydrodynamical code with nuclear reactions turned off. We found that detonation
conditions are achieved for a wide range of M_defl. However, if the nuclear
energy released during the deflagration phase is close to the white dwarf
binding energy (~ 0.46 foes -> M_defl ~ 0.30 M_sun) the accretion shock cannot
heat and confine efficiently the core and detonation conditions are not
robustly achieved.
