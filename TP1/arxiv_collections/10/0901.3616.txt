A review is presented of the fundamental equations of point, perfect
incompressible fluid and wave dynamics in the Fantappie-Arcidiacono theory of
projective relativity, also known as De Sitter relativity. Compared to the
original works, some deductions have been simplified and the physical meaning
of the equations has been analyzed in greater depth.
