We present preliminary results on efficiency and light collection uniformity
read out performances of different assemblies of scintillator tiles, coupled
with solid state photon detectors of different make. Our test beam data suggest
that the use of 2 mm scintillator tiles without wavelength shifting fibers may
be possible in an ILC hadron calorimeter.
