Let L be a bounded distributive lattice. We give several characterizations of
those L^n --> L mappings that are polynomial functions, i.e., functions which
can be obtained from projections and constant functions using binary joins and
meets. Moreover, we discuss the disjunctive normal form representations of
these polynomial functions.
