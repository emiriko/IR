The general theory on exact boundary controllability for general first order
quasilinear hyperbolic systems requires that the characteristic speeds of
system do not vanish. This paper deals with exact boundary controllability,
when this is not the case. Some important models are also shown as applications
of the main result. The strategy uses the return method, which allows in
certain situations to recover non zero characteristic speeds.
