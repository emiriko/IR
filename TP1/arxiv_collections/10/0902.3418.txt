Cognitive processes in the brain, like learning, formation of memory,
recovery of memorized images, classification of objects have two features:
First, there is no supervisor in the brain who controls these processes. Second
there is a hugh number of neurons (10^{6} to 10^{10}) involved in those
cognitive tasks. For this reason, the search of understanding cognitive
processes uses models built from a large number of neurons, but very much
simplified neurons. The so-called neural networks have been quite successful in
describing certain aspects of brain functions, like the mechanism of
associative memory or recently the prediction of epileptic seizures. At hand of
the Kohonen network we discuss the treatment of information in the brain, in
particular how the brain organizes such information without supervisor.
Recently, networks of small-world and scale-free architecture came into focus.
There is evidence indicating that the brain (cat cortex, macaque cortex, human
brain) uses such connectivity architecture. Tasks like treatment of
information, learning and classification take advantage of such scale-free and
small-world connectivity and thus play a potentially important role in
self-organization of the brain.
