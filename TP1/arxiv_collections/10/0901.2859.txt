A parallel algorithm for solving a series of matrix equations with a constant
tridiagonal matrix and different right-hand sides is proposed and studied. The
process of solving the problem is represented in two steps. The first
preliminary step is fixing some rows of the inverse matrix of SLAEs. The second
step consists in calculating solutions for all right-hand sides. For reducing
the communication interactions, based on the formulated and proved main
parallel sweep theorem, we propose an original algorithm for calculating share
components of the solution vector. Theoretical estimates validating the
efficiency of the approach for both the common- and distributed-memory
supercomputers are obtained. Direct and iterative methods of solving a 2D
Poisson equation, which include procedures of tridiagonal matrix inversion, are
realized using the mpi technology. Results of computational experiments on a
multicomputer demonstrate a high efficiency and scalability of the parallel
sweep algorithm.
