We report a calculation of the correlation function of the local density of
states in a disordered quasi-one-dimensional wire in the unitary symmetry class
at a small energy difference. Using an expression from the supersymmetric
sigma-model, we obtain the full dependence of the two-point correlation
function on the distance between the points. In the limit of zero energy
difference, our calculation reproduces the statistics of a single localized
wave function. At logarithmically large distances of the order of the Mott
scale, we obtain a reentrant behavior similar to that in strictly
one-dimensional chains.
