The direct analysis of the dynamic response of materials is possible using
Split Hopkinson pressure bar method. For soils, it has to be adapted since the
specimen has generally poor mechanical properties. An original experimental
arrangement called "Three-Dimensional Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar" (3D SHPB)
is proposed. It allows the measurement of the complete three-dimensional
dynamic response of soils. Different types of confinement systems are used. The
results on different loading paths are compared with other works on sand and
clay. The analysis at grain-size level gives further elements on the
comminution process.
