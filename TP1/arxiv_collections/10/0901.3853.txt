We have previously analysed the spectra of 135 early B-type stars in the LMC
and found several groups of stars that have chemical compositions that conflict
with the theory of rotational mixing. Here we extend this study to Galactic and
SMC metallicities with the analysis of ~50 Galactic and ~100 SMC early B-type
stars with rotational velocities up to ~300km/s. The surface nitrogen
abundances are utilised as a probe of the mixing process.
  In the SMC, we find a population of slowly rotating nitrogen-rich stars
amongst the early B type core-hydrogen burning stars, similar to the LMC. In
the Galactic sample we find no significant enrichment amongst the core
hydrogen-burning stars, which appears to be in contrast with the expectation
from both rotating single-star and close binary evolution models. However, only
a small number of the rapidly rotating stars have evolved enough to produce a
significant nitrogen enrichment, and these may be analogous to the non-enriched
rapid rotators previously found in the LMC sample. Finally, in each metallicity
regime, a population of highly enriched supergiants is observed, which cannot
be the immediate descendants of core-hydrogen burning stars. Their abundances
are, however, compatible with them having gone through a previous red
supergiant phase. Together, these observations paint a complex picture of the
nitrogen enrichment in massive main sequence and supergiant stellar
atmospheres, where age and binarity cause crucial effects. Whether rotational
mixing is required to understand our results remains an open question at this
time, but could be answered by identifying the true binary fraction in those
groups of stars that do not agree with single-star evolutionary models
(abridged).
