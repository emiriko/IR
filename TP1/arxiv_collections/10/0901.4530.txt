We present calculations of Post-Newtonian parameters for Brans-Dicke
tensor-scalar gravity in an arbitrary number of compact extra dimensions in
both the Jordan and Einstein conformal frames. We find that the parameter
gamma, which measures the amount of spacetime curvature per unit mass, becomes
a function of omega, the coefficient of the scalar kinetic term in the
Brans-Dicke Lagrangian. Experiment has placed strong constraints on gamma which
require that omega become negative in the Jordan frame for any number of extra
dimensions, highlighting that this formulation is not physical. We also confirm
the well-known result that a compact extra dimension can be equivalently viewed
as a massless scalar `dilaton.' In the Einstein frame, we find that the
behavior of gamma as constrained by experiment replicates that which is
predicted by string theory.
