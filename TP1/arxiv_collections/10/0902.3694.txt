Using methods of kinetic theory and liquid state theory we propose a
description of the non-equilibrium behavior of molecular fluids which takes
into account their microscopic structure and thermodynamic properties. The
present work represents an alternative to the recent dynamic density functional
theory which can only deal with colloidal fluids and is not apt to describe the
hydrodynamic behavior of a molecular fluid. The method is based on a suitable
modification of the Boltzmann transport equation for the phase space
distribution and provides a detailed description of the local structure of the
fluid and of the transport coefficients under inhomogeneous conditions.
Finally, we propose a practical scheme to solve numerically and efficiently the
resulting kinetic equation by employing a discretization procedure analogous to
the one used in the Lattice Boltzmann method.
