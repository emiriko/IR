By projecting the stochastic mean-field dynamics on a suitable collective
path during the entrance channel of heavy-ion collisions, expressions for
transport coefficients associated with relative distance are extracted. These
transport coefficients, which have similar forms to those familiar from nucleon
exchange model, are evaluated by carrying out TDHF simulations. The
calculations provide an accurate description of the magnitude and form factor
of transport coefficients associated with one-body dissipation and fluctuation
mechanism.
