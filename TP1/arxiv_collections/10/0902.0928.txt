In this paper we discuss the inflationary universe in the context of a
Chaplygin gas equation of state within the framework of the effective theory of
loop quantum cosmology. Under the slow-roll approximation, we calculate the
primordial perturbations for this model. We give the general expressions of the
scalar spectral index, its running, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, etc. For
the chaotic inflation with a quadratic potential, using the WMAP 5-year
results, we determine the parameters of the Chaplygin inflation model in loop
quantum cosmology. The results are consistent with the WMAP observations.
