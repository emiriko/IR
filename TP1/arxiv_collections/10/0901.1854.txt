We investigate the rates for multielectron recombination within a dense
plasma environment in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). We find that these
multielectron recombination rates can be high within dense plasmas, and they
should be treated in the simulations of the plasmas created by intense
radiation, in particular for plasmas created by intense VUV radiation from
free-electron-laser (FEL) or for modelling the inertial confinement fusion
(ICF) plasmas.
