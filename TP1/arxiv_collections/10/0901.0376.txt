We present a universal framework for quantum error-correcting codes, i.e.,
the one that applies for the most general quantum error-correcting codes. This
framework is established on the group algebra, an algebraic notation for the
nice error bases of quantum systems. The nicest thing about this framework is
that we can characterize the properties of quantum codes by the properties of
the group algebra. We show how it characterizes the properties of quantum codes
as well as generates some new results about quantum codes.
