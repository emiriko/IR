Some of the developments related to quantum anomalies and path integrals
during the past 10 years are briefly discussed. The covered subjects include
the issues related to the local counter term in the context of 2-dimensional
path integral bosonization and the treatment of chiral anomaly and index
theorem on the lattice. We also briefly comment on a recent analysis of the
connection between the two-dimensional chiral anomalies and the
four-dimensional black hole radiation.
