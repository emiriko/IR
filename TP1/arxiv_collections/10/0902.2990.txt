The ultimate active constituents of the living medium, membranes, ions and
molecules, are at the level of the nanometer. Their interactions thus require a
quantum processing. The characteristic Action A, linked to the "quantum
objects" : ions, radicals, water molecule... of the living medium, has an
average value of A ~= 14.10-34 J.s or A ~= 2 h . It is thus strictly impossible
to formulate a realistic "classical " theory of membrane electrodynamics. The
transfer of the sodium ion - among others - could be then ensured under the
action of a Tunnel effect, (with Hartman?s mechanism) specific to the channel
and the ion transferred.
