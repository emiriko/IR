Helical edge states exist in the mixed spin-singlet and -triplet phase of a
noncentrosymmetric superconductor (NCSS) when the pair amplitude (PA) in the
negative helicity band, $\Delta_-$, is smaller than the PA in the positive
helicity band, $\Delta_+$, i.e., when the PA in the triplet component is more
than the same in the singlet component. We numerically determine energies of
these edge states as a function of $\gamma = \Delta_-/\Delta_+$. The presence
of these edge states is reflected in the tunneling process from a normal metal
to an NCSS across a bias energy $eV$: (i) Angle resolved spin conductance (SC)
obeying the symmetry $g_s(\phi) =-g_s(-\phi)$ shows peaks when the bias energy
equals the available quasiparticle edge state energy provided $|eV| \lesssim
\Delta_-$. (ii) The total SC, $G_s$, is zero but modulates with $eV$ for finite
magnetic field $H$. (iii) The zero bias peaks of $G_s$ and total charge
conductance, $G_c$, at finite $H$ split into two at finite $eV$ for moderate
$H$. (iv) At zero bias, $G_c$ and $G_s$ increase with $H$ and show peaks at
$|H|\sim \gamma H_0$ where $H_0$ is a characteristic field.
