In this paper we discuss one-loop results for the translation invariant
non-commutative gauge field model we recently introduced in arXiv:0804.1914.
This model relies on the addition of some carefully chosen extra terms in the
action which mix long and short scales in order to circumvent the infamous
UV/IR mixing, and were motivated by the renormalizable non-commutative scalar
model of Gurau et al. (cf. arXiv:0802.0791).
