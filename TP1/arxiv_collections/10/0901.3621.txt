This paper proposes a solution to Stokes' paradox for asymptotically uniform
viscous flow around a cylinder. The existence of a {\it global} stream function
satisfying a perturbative form of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations
for low Reynolds number is established. This stream function satisfies the
appropriate boundary conditions on both the cylinder and at infinity, but
nevertheless agrees with Stokes' original results at finite radius as the
Reynolds number tends to zero. The Navier-Stokes equations are satisfied to a
power-log power of the Reynolds number. The drag on the cylinder is calculated
from first principles and the free parameter of the approach can be chosen to
give good agreement with data on drag. In this revised working paper we put our
approach on a firmer mathematical basis using the Helmholtz-Laplace equation as
a linear approximation to the Navier-Stokes system. In so doing we demonstrate
the instability of the original paradox. We also demonstrate the absence of a
paradox of Stokes-Whitehead class, and give further theoretical constraints on
the free parameters of the model.
