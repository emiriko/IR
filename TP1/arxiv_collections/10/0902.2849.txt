It was proposed a flavour model based on the symmetry group S4, managing to
describe fermion masses and mixings. The Weinberg operator has been used in
order to provide the smallness of the neutrino masses, while a set of scalar
fields, getting non-vanishing vacuum expectation values, spontaneously breaks
down S4 and provides the Tri-Bimaximal pattern as the lepton mixing matrix.
Restricting to this setting, in this paper we analyze possible origins for the
effective terms: the type I See-Saw mechanism is the best known approach, but
also the type II and III are discussed. The phenomenology related to these
models is various and the next future experiments could in principle
discriminate among these proposals. Furthermore, we compare our realizations to
two relevant A4 based models, also predicting the Tri-Bimaximal lepton mixing,
and we find that an analysis on the neutrinoless double beta decay parameters
could distinguish among all these realizations. Furthermore a combined
measurement of the effective mass and of the lightest neutrino mass could
indicate in the next future which is the preferred flavour symmetry group. The
introduction of new physics beyond the Standard Model, like heavy right-handed
neutrinos, scalar triplets and fermion triplets, let us investigate on
leptogenesis and this provides constraints in the realization of the models.
