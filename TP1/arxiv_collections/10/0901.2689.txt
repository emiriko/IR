We propose an efficient framework for enabling secure multi-party numerical
computations in a Peer-to-Peer network. This problem arises in a range of
applications such as collaborative filtering, distributed computation of trust
and reputation, monitoring and other tasks, where the computing nodes is
expected to preserve the privacy of their inputs while performing a joint
computation of a certain function. Although there is a rich literature in the
field of distributed systems security concerning secure multi-party
computation, in practice it is hard to deploy those methods in very large scale
Peer-to-Peer networks. In this work, we try to bridge the gap between
theoretical algorithms in the security domain, and a practical Peer-to-Peer
deployment.
  We consider two security models. The first is the semi-honest model where
peers correctly follow the protocol, but try to reveal private information. We
provide three possible schemes for secure multi-party numerical computation for
this model and identify a single light-weight scheme which outperforms the
others. Using extensive simulation results over real Internet topologies, we
demonstrate that our scheme is scalable to very large networks, with up to
millions of nodes. The second model we consider is the malicious peers model,
where peers can behave arbitrarily, deliberately trying to affect the results
of the computation as well as compromising the privacy of other peers. For this
model we provide a fourth scheme to defend the execution of the computation
against the malicious peers. The proposed scheme has a higher complexity
relative to the semi-honest model. Overall, we provide the Peer-to-Peer network
designer a set of tools to choose from, based on the desired level of security.
