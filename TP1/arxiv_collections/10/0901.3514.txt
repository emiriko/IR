The variable star V1735 Cyg (= Elias 1-12) lies in the IC 5146 dark cloud and
is a member of the class of FU Orionis objects whose dramatic optical
brightenings are thought to be linked to episodic accretion. We report the
first X-ray detections of V1735 Cyg and a deeply-embedded class I protostar
lying 24 arcsecs to its northeast. X-ray spectra obtained with EPIC on
XMM-Newton reveal very high-temperature plasma (kT > 5 keV) in both objects,
but no large flares. Such hard X-ray emission is not anticipated from accretion
shocks and is a signature of magnetic processes. We place these new results
into the context of what is presently known about the X-ray properties of FU
Orionis stars and other accreting young stellar objects.
