In this paper we show that the standard causality condition for attenuated
waves, i.e. the Kramers-Kronig relation that relates the attenuation law and
the phase speed of the wave, is necessary but not sufficient for causality of a
wave. By causality of a wave we understand the property that its wave front
speed is bounded. Although this condition is not new, the consequences for wave
attenuation have not been analysed sufficiently well. We derive the wave
equation (for a homogeneous and isotropic medium) obeying attenuation and
causality and with a generalization of the Paley-Wiener-Schwartz Theorem (cf.
Theorem 7.4.3. in \cite{Ho03}), we perform a causality analysis of waves
obeying the frequency power attenuation law. Afterwards the causality behaviour
of Szabo's wave equation (cf. \cite{Szabo94}) and the thermo-viscous wave
equation are investigated. Finally, we present a generalization of the
thermo-viscous wave equation that obeys causality and the frequency power law
(for powers in $(1,2]$ and) for small frequencies, which we propose for
Thermoacoustic Tomography.
