A unified treatment of all known types of singularities for flat, isotropic
and homogeneous spacetimes in the framework of loop quantum cosmology (LQC) is
presented. These include bangs, crunches and all future singularities. Using
effective spacetime description we perform a model independent general analysis
of the properties of curvature, behavior of geodesics and strength of
singularities. For illustration purposes a phenomenological model based
analysis is also performed. We show that all values of the scale factor at
which a strong singularity may occur are excluded from the effective loop
quantum spacetime. Further, if the evolution leads to either a vanishing or
divergent scale factor then the loop quantum universe is asymptotically
deSitter in that regime. We also show that there exist a class of sudden
extremal events, which includes a recently discussed possibility, for which the
curvature or its derivatives will always diverge. Such events however turn out
to be harmless weak curvature singularities beyond which geodesics can be
extended. Our results point towards a generic resolution of physical
singularities in LQC.
