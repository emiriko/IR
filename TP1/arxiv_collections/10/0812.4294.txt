We apply the quasiparicle self-consistent $GW$ (\qsgw) method to a cubic
virtual-crystal alloy La$_{1-x}$Ba$_x$MnO$_3$ %(LBMO) as a theoretical
representative for colossal magnetoresistive perovskite manganites. The \qsgw\
predicts it as a fully-polarized half-metallic ferromagnet for a wide range of
$x$ and lattice constant. Calculated density of states and dielectric functions
are consistent with experiments. In contrast, the energies of calculated spin
wave are very low in comparison with experiments. This is affected neither by
rhombohedral deformation nor the intrinsic deficiency in the \qsgw method. Thus
we ends up with a conjecture that phonons related to the Jahn-Teller distortion
should hybridize with spin waves more strongly than people thought until now.
