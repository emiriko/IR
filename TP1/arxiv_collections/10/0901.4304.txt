We consider discretized gravity in 4+2 dimensions compactified on a disk of
constant negative curvature. The curvature of the disk avoids the presence of
dangerous ultra-light scalar modes but comes also along with a high
multiplicity of states potentially jeopardizing a good strong-coupling behavior
of the discretized theory. We demonstrate that for Standard Model matter
propagating on the five-dimensional boundary submanifold of the disk, the
strong coupling scale, as seen by an observer, can be parametrically larger
than the local Planck scale. As a consequence, we obtain a description of
weakly coupled discretized gravity on the boundary that can be compared with
the continuum theory all the way up to the effective five-dimensional Planck
scale.
