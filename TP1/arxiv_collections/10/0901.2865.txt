The effect of the modulation instability on the propagation of solitary waves
along one-dimensional discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with cubic
nonlinearity is revisited. A self-contained quasicontinuum approximation is
developed to derive closed-form expressions for small-amplitude solitary waves.
The notion that the existence of nonlinear solitary waves is a signature of the
modulation instability is used to analytically study instability effects on
solitons during propagation. In particular, we concern with instability effects
in the dark region, where other analytical methods as the standard modulation
analysis of planewaves do not provide any information on solitons. The region
of high-velocity solitons is studied anew showing that solitons are less prone
to intabilities in this region. An analytical upper boundary for the
self-defocusing instability is defined.
