Approximation methods for calculating individual particle/ field motions in
spacetime at the quantum level of accuracy (a key feature of the Bohm Picture
of Quantum Mechanics (BP)), are studied. Modern textbook presentations of
Quantum Theory are used throughout, but only to provide the necessary, already
existing, tested formalisms and calculational techniques. New coherent
insights, reinterpretations of old solutions and results, and new (in principle
testable) quantitative and qualitative predictions, can be obtained on the
basis of the BP that complete the standard type of postdictions and
predictions.
