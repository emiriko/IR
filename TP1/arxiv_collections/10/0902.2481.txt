We present results of semi-analytic calculations which show clear evidence
for changes in the non-equilibrium ionization behind a supernova remnant
forward shock undergoing efficient diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). The
efficient acceleration of particles (i.e., cosmic rays) lowers the shock
temperature and raises the density of the shocked gas, thus altering the
ionization state of the plasma in comparison to the test particle approximation
where cosmic rays gain an insignificant fraction of the shock energy. The
differences between the test particle and efficient acceleration cases are
substantial and occur for both slow and fast temperature equilibration rates:
in cases of higher acceleration efficiency, particular ion states are more
populated at lower electron temperatures. We also present results which show
that, in the efficient shock acceleration case, higher ionization fractions are
reached noticeably closer to the shock front than in the test-particle case,
clearly indicating that DSA may enhance thermal X-ray production. We attribute
this to the higher postshock densities which lead to faster electron
temperature equilibration and higher ionization rates. These spatial
differences should be resolvable with current and future X-ray missions, and
can be used as diagnostics in estimating the acceleration efficiency in
cosmic-ray modified shocks.
