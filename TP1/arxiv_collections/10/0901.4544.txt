We measure Anderson localization in quasi-one-dimensional waveguides in the
presence of absorption by analyzing the echo dynamics due to small
perturbations. We specifically show that the inverse participation number of
localized modes dictates the decay of the Loschmidt echo, differing from the
Gaussian decay expected for diffusive or chaotic systems. Our theory, based on
a random matrix modeling, agrees perfectly with scattering echo measurements on
a quasi one-dimensional microwave cavity filled with randomly distributed
scatterers.
