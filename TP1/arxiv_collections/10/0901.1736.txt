In connection with recent discussion of topological order and topological
phase transitions in quantum systems, we reexamine circumstances that lead to
the appearance of a topological glass in certain classical lattice spin models.
Local bonding enforces constraints on low energy states which organize
themselves into topologically distinct classes that break ergodicity but not
any apparent symmetry as in the usual Landau theory of phase transitions.
Various properties of such a topological glass are demonstrated using two
classical Ising-like models.
