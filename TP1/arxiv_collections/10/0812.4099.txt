One of the primary aims of heavy-ion collisions is to map the QCD phase
diagram and search for different phases and phase boundaries. RHIC Energy Scan
Program was launched to address this goal by studying heavy-ion collisions at
different center of mass energies. The first test run with Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 9.2 GeV took place in early 2008. The large acceptance STAR
detector has collected few thousands minimum bias collisions at this beam
energy. We present the first results for identified particle yields and
particle ratios. The results for the azimuthal anisotropy parameters $v_1$ and
$v_2$ and those from pion interferometry measurements are also discussed in
this paper. These results are compared to data from the SPS at similar beam
energies.
