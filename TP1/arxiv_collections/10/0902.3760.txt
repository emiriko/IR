Neutrons have played an important role in advancing our understanding of the
pairing mechanism and the symmetry of the superconducting energy gap in the
iron arsenide compounds. Neutron measurements of the phonon density-of-state
are in good agreement with ab initio calculations, provided the magnetism of
the iron atoms is taken into account. However, the predicted superconducting
transition temperatures are less than 1 K, making a conventional phononic
mechanism for superconductivity highly unlikely. Measurements of the spin
dynamics within the spin density wave phase of the parent compounds show
evidence of strongly dispersive spin waves with exchange interactions
consistent with the observed magnetic order. Antiferromagnetic fluctuations
persist in the normal phase of the superconducting compounds, but they are more
diffuse. Below Tc, there is evidence compounds that these fluctuations condense
into a resonant spin excitation at the antiferromagnetic wavevector with an
energy that scales with Tc, consistent with unconventional superconductivity of
extended-s+/- wave symmetry.
