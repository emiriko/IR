The magnetization reversal and spin structure in circular
Co/insulator/Ni80Fe20 trilayer dots has been investigated numerically. The
effect of dipolar coupling between a soft ferromagnetic Permalloy (Py=Ni80Fe20)
layer and a hard ferromagnetic Cobalt layer inside one stack is studied. We
find either a stabilization or even a triggering of the vortex state in the Py
layer due to the magnetic stray field of the Co layer, while the Co
magnetization remains in a single-domain state. Furthermore, for thin Py layers
a 360 deg-domain wall is observed. We construct a phase diagram, where regions
of vortex stabilization, triggering, and occurrence of a 360 deg domain wall
are marked.
