We study the DVCS amplitude within the color dipole approach. The light-cone
wave function of a real photon is evaluated in the instanton vacuum model. Our
parameter free calculations are able to describe H1 data, both the absolute
values and the $t$-dependences, at medium-high values of $Q^{2}$. The $Q^{2}$
dependence is found to be sensitive to the choice of the phenomenological cross
section fitted to DIS data.
