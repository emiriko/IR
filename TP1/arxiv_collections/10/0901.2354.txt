In this Letter we show how the nonlinear evolution of a resonant triad
depends on the special combination of the modes' phases chosen according to the
resonance conditions. This phase combination is called dynamical phase. Its
evolution is studied for two integrable cases: a triad and a cluster formed by
two connected triads, using a numerical method which is fully validated by
monitoring the conserved quantities known analytically. We show that dynamical
phases, usually regarded as equal to zero or constants, play a substantial role
in the dynamics of the clusters. Indeed, some effects are (i) to diminish the
period of energy exchange $\tau$ within a cluster by 20$%$ and more; (ii) to
diminish, at time scale $\tau$, the variability of wave energies by 25$%$ and
more; (iii) to generate a new time scale, $T >> \tau$, in which we observe
considerable energy exchange within a cluster, as well as a periodic behaviour
(with period $T$) in the variability of modes' energies. These findings can be
applied, for example, to the control of energy input, exchange and output in
Tokamaks; for explanation of some experimental results; to guide and improve
the performance of experiments; to interpret the results of numerical
simulations, etc.
