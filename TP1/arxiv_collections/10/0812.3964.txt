In this study, dependence on site dilution of critical and compensation
temperatures of a two dimensional mixed spin-1/2 and spin-1 system has been
investigated with Monte Carlo simulation. The dependence of the thermal and
magnetic behaviors on dilution of mixed spin system have been discussed. We
have shown that the critical and compensation temperatures of diluted mixed
spin system linearly decrease with increasing number of diluted sites.
