The lepton-number-violating decays of $B^+, D^+$ and $D_s^+$ mesons induced
by the doubly charged Higgs boson have been studied. It is found that although
the yielded results of the branch ratio are much smaller than the present
limits from the data they are consistent with the previous conclusions
calculated in the framwork of relativistic quark model where the processes
happened via the light Majorana neutrinos.
