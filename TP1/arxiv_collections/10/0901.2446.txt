Dynamical systems driven by Gaussian noises have been considered extensively
in modeling, simulation and theory. However, complex systems in engineering and
science are often subject to non-Gaussian fluctuations or uncertainties. A
coupled dynamical system under non- Gaussian Levy noises is considered. After
discussing cocycle prop- erty, stationary orbits and random attractors, a
synchronization phe- nomenon is shown to occur, when the drift terms of the
coupled system satisfy certain dissipativity and integrability conditions. The
synchro- nization result implies that coupled dynamical systems share a dy-
namical feature in some asymptotic sense.
