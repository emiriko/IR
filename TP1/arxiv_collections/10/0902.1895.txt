We present a protocol for quantum key distribution using discrete modulation
of coherent states of light. Information is encoded in the variable phase of
coherent states which can be chosen from a regular discrete set ranging from
binary to continuous modulation, similar to phase-shift-keying in classical
communication. Information is decoded by simultaneous homodyne measurement of
both quadratures and requires no active choice of basis. The protocol utilizes
either direct or reverse reconciliation, both with and without postselection.
We analyze the security of the protocol and show how to enhance it by the
optimal choice of all variable parameters of the quantum signal.
