These are the findings of the Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM) Figure of
Merit (FoM) Science Working Group (SWG), the FoMSWG. JDEM is a space mission
planned by NASA and the DOE for launch in the 2016 time frame. The primary
mission is to explore the nature of dark energy. In planning such a mission, it
is necessary to have some idea of knowledge of dark energy in 2016, and a way
to quantify the performance of the mission. In this paper we discuss these
issues.
