Thermalization of a heavy quark near rest is controlled by the correlator of
two electric fields along a temporal Wilson line. We address this correlator
within real-time, classical lattice Yang-Mills theory, and elaborate on the
analogies that exist with the dynamics of hot QCD. In the weak-coupling limit,
it can be shown analytically that the dynamics on the two sides are closely
related to each other. For intermediate couplings, we carry out
non-perturbative simulations within the classical theory, showing that the
leading term in the weak-coupling expansion significantly underestimates the
heavy quark thermalization rate. Our analytic and numerical results also yield
a general understanding concerning the overall shape of the spectral function
corresponding to the electric field correlator, which may be helpful in
subsequent efforts to reconstruct it from Euclidean lattice Monte Carlo
simulations.
