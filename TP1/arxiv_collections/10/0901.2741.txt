Fluid cosmologies are consistent with the generally accepted observational
evidence during intermediate and late times, and they need not have singular
behavior in primordial times. A general form for fluid cosmology consistent
with Einstein's equation is demonstrated, and a dynamic metric that
incorporates fluid scale is developed. The large scale causal structure of a
multi-fluid cosmology exemplary of standard cosmology is then examined. This is
done through developing coupled rate equations for radiation, dust, and dark
components. The beginning of the dissolution of the primordial fluid into the
other components is singularity-free, since the fluid provides a non-vanishing
scale for the cosmology. Penrose diagrams are developed for cosmologies both
with and without a final state dark energy density.
