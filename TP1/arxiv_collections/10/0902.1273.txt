In this paper we construct two free field realizations of the elliptic affine
Lie algebra sl(2,R) + \Omega_R/dR, where R=C[t,t^{-1},u|u^2=t^3 - 2b t^2 + t].
The first realization gives an analogue of Wakimoto's construction for Affine
Kac-Moody algebras, but in the setting of the elliptic affine Lie algebra. The
second realization gives new type of representations analogous to Imaginary
Verma modules in the Affine setting.
