We investigate a possibility of precision measurements for parameters of the
Littlest Higgs model with T-parity at the International Linear Collider (ILC).
The model predicts new gauge bosons (AH, ZH, and WH), among which the heavy
photon (AH) is a candidate for dark matter. The masses of these new gauge
bosons strongly depend on the vacuum expectation value that breaks a global
symmetry of the model. Through Monte Carlo simulations of the processes: e+ e-
->AH ZH and e+ e- -> WH+ WH-, we show how precisely the masses can be
determined at the ILC for a representative parameter point of the model. We
also discuss the determination of the Little Higgs parameters and its impact on
the future measurement of the thermal abundance of the dark matter relics in
our universe.
