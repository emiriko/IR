We present a newly observed relation between galaxy mass and radial
metallicity gradients of early-type galaxies. Our sample of 51 early-type
galaxies encompasses a comprehensive mass range from dwarf to brightest cluster
galaxies. The metallicity gradients are measured out to one effective radius by
comparing nearly all of the Lick absorption-line indices to recent models of
single stellar populations. The relation shows very different behaviour at low
and high masses, with a sharp transition being seen at a mass of ~ 3.5 x 10^10
M_sun (velocity dispersion of ~140 km/s, M_B ~ -19). Low-mass galaxies form a
tight relation with mass, such that metallicity gradients become shallower with
decreasing mass and positive at the very low-mass end. Above the mass
transition point several massive galaxies have steeper gradients, but a clear
downturn is visible marked by a broad scatter. The results are interpreted in
comparison with competing model predictions. We find that an early star-forming
collapse could have acted as the main mechanism for the formation of low-mass
galaxies, with star formation efficiency increasing with galactic mass. The
high-mass downturn could be a consequence of merging and the observed larger
scatter a natural result of different merger properties. These results suggest
that galaxies above the mass threshold of ~ 3.5 x 10^10 M_sun might have formed
initially by mergers of gas-rich disc galaxies and then subsequently evolved
via dry merger events. The varying efficiency of the dissipative merger-induced
starburst and feedback processes have shaped the radial metallicity gradients
in these high-mass systems.
