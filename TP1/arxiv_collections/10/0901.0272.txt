We study the properties of ThCr$_2$Si$_2$ structure BaMn$_2$As$_2$ and
BaMn$_2$Sb$_2$ using density functional calculations of the electronic and
magnetic as well experimental measurements on single crystal samples of
BaMn$_2$As$_2$. These materials are local moment magnets with moderate band gap
antiferromagnetic semiconducting ground states. The electronic structures show
substantial Mn - pnictogen hybridization, which stabilizes an intermediate spin
configuration for the nominally $d^5$ Mn. The results are discussed in the
context of possible thermoelectric applications and the relationship with the
corresponding iron / cobalt / nickel compounds Ba(Fe,Co,Ni)$_2$As$_2$.
