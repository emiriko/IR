A method for the calculation of the conductance of nanoscale electrical
junctions is extended to ab-initio electronic structure methods and applied to
realistic models of metallic wires and break-junctions of sodium and gold. The
method is systematically controllable and convergeable, and can be
straightforwardly extended to include more complex processes and interactions.
Important issues about the order in which are taken both the thermodynamic and
the static (small field) limits are clarified, and characterized further
through comparisons to model systems.
