For a class of hindered magnetic dipole ($M1$) transition processes, such as
$\Upsilon(3S)\to \eta_b+\gamma$ (the discovery channel of the $\eta_b$ meson),
the emitted photon is rather energetic so that the traditional approaches based
on multipole expansion may be invalidated. We propose that a "hard-scattering"
picture, somewhat analogous to the pion electromagnetic form factor at large
momentum transfer, may be more plausible to describe such types of transition
processes. We work out a simple factorization formula at lowest order in the
strong coupling constant, which involves convolution of the Schr\"odinger wave
functions of quarkonia with a perturbatively calculable part induced by
exchange of one semihard gluon between quark and antiquark. This formula,
without any freely adjustable parameters, is found to agree with the measured
rate of $\Upsilon(3S)\to \eta_b+\gamma$ rather well, and can also reasonably
account for other recently measured hindered $M1$ transition rates. The
branching fractions of $\Upsilon(4S)\to \eta_b^{(\prime)}+\gamma$ are also
predicted.
