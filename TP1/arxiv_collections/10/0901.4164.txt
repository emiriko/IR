A method for decelerating a continuous beam of neutral polar molecules is
theoretically demonstrated. This method utilizes non-uniform, static electric
fields and regions of adiabatic population transfer to generate a mechanical
force that opposes the molecular beam's velocity. By coupling this technique
with dissipative trap-loading, molecular densities $\geq10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$ are
possible. When used in combination with forced evaporative cooling the proposed
method may represent a viable route to quantum degeneracy for a wide-class of
molecular species.
