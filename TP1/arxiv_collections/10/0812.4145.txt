An explicit realization of anyons is provided, using the three-body Calogero
model. The fact that in the coupling domain, $-1/4<g<0$, the angular spectrum
can have a band structure, leads to the manifestation of the desired phase in
the wave function, under the exchange of the paticles. Concurrently, the
momentum corresponding to the angular variable is quantized, exactly akin to
the relative angular momentum quantization in two dimensional anyonic system
