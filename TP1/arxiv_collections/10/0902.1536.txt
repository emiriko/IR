Circumstellar imaging, across the electromagnetic spectrum, allows to derive
fundamental diagnostics for the physics of mass loss in the AGB phase. I review
the current status of the field, with particular emphasis on the techniques
that provide the strongest constraints for mass loss modeling efforts.
