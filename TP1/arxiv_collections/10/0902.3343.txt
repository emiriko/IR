In the present investigation, we build a bridge between the generalized
regression (GREG) estimator due to Deville and Sarndal (1992) and the linear
regression estimator due to Hansen, Hurwitz and Madow (1953) in the presence of
single auxiliary variable. The bridge confirms that the sum of calibrated
weights should be equal to sum of design weights as pointed out by Singh (2003,
2004, 2006) and Stearns and Singh (2008). An important modification in the
statistical packages such as GES, SUDAAN etc. has been suggested.
