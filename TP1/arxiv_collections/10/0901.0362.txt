The normal paper used in any printer is among the cheapest flexible organic
materials that exist. We demonstrate that we can print on paper high-frequency
circuits tunable with an applied dc voltage. This is possible with the help of
an ink containing functionalized carbon nanotubes and water. After the water is
evaporated from the paper, the nanotubes remain steadily imprinted on paper,
showing a semiconducting behaviour and tunable electrical properties.
