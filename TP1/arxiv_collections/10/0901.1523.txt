In this paper we derive general relations for the band-structure of an array
of quantum dots and compute its transport properties when connected to two
perfect leads. The exact lattice Green's functions for the perfect array and
with an attached adatom are derived. The expressions for the linear conductance
for the perfect array as well as for the array with a defect are presented. The
calculations are illustrated for a dot made of three atoms. The results derived
here are also the starting point to include the effect of electron-electron and
electron-phonon interactions on the transport properties of quantum dot arrays.
Different derivations of the exact lattice Green's functions are discussed.
