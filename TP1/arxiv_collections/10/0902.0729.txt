E. Frenkel, A. Losev and N. Nekrasov claim that a certain class of theories
on compact Kahler manifolds and in particular the "gauged" supersymmetric
bc-system on CP^1 are logarithmic conformal field theories. We discuss that
proposition on a classical level for the bc-system on CP^1. The outcome of our
investigation conforms to their conjecture. The property of being a logarithmic
CFT thus can be interpreted as an effect of gravity.
