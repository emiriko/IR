We report the results of our study of magnetic fields in a sample of Be stars
using spectropolarimetric data obtained at the European Southern Observatory
with the multi-mode instrument FORS1 installed at the 8m Kueyen telescope. The
detected magnetic fields are rather weak, not stronger than ~150G. A few
classical Be stars display cyclic variability of the magnetic field with
periods of tens of minutes.
