We study single-particle properties of a spinless p-band correlated fermionic
gas in an optical lattice by means of a variational cluster approach (VCA). The
single-particle spectral function is almost flat at half-filling and develops a
strongly dispersive behavior at lower fillings. The competition between
different orbital orderings is studied as a function of filling. We observe
that an ``antiferromagnetic'' orbital order develops at half-filling and is
destroyed by doping the system evolving into a disordered orbital state. At low
filling limit, we discuss the possibility of ``ferromagnetic'' orbital order by
complementing the VCA result with observations based on a trial wave function.
We also study the behavior of the momentum distribution for different values of
the on-site interaction. Finally, we introduce an integration contour in the
complex plane which allows to efficiently carry out Matsubara-frequency sums.
