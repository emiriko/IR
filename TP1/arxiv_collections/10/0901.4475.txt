Understanding the equation of state (EOS) of cold nuclear matter, namely, the
relation between the pressure and energy density, is a central goal of nuclear
physics that cuts across a variety of disciplines. Indeed, the limits of
nuclear existence, the collision of heavy ions, the structure of neutron stars,
and the dynamics of core-collapse supernova, all depend critically on the
equation of state of hadronic matter. In this contribution I will concentrate
on the special role that nuclear physics plays in constraining the EOS of cold
baryonic matter and its impact on the properties of neutron stars.
