The Large Area Telescope on the recently launched Fermi Gamma-ray Space
Telescope (formerly GLAST), with its large field of view and effective area,
combined with its excellent timing capabilities, is poised to revolutionize the
field of gamma-ray astrophysics. The large improvement in sensitivity over
EGRET is expected to result in the discovery of many new gamma-ray pulsars,
which in turn should lead to fundamental advances in our understanding of
pulsar physics and the role of neutron stars in the Galaxy. Almost immediately
after launch, Fermi clearly detected all previously known gamma-ray pulsars and
is producing high precision results on these. An extensive radio and X-ray
timing campaign of known (primarily radio) pulsars is being carried out in
order to facilitate the discovery of new gamma-ray pulsars. In addition, a
highly efficient time-differencing technique is being used to conduct blind
searches for radio-quiet pulsars, which has already resulted in new
discoveries. I present some recent results from searches for pulsars carried
out on Fermi data, both blind searches, and using contemporaneous timing of
known radio pulsars.
