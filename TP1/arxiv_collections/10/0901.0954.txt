We have measured the differential conductances $G(V,T)$ in several
Al/AlO$_{x}$/Sc planar tunnel junctions between 2 and 35 K. As the temperature
decreases to $\sim$ 16 K, the zero-bias conductance $G(0,T)$ crosses over from
a standard $-$ln$T$ dependence to a novel $- \sqrt{T}$ dependence.
Correspondingly, the finite bias conductance $G(V,T)$ reveals a two-channel
Kondo scaling behavior between $\sim$ 4 and 16 K. The observed two-channel
Kondo physics is ascribed to originating from a few localized spin-$\frac12$ Sc
atoms situated slightly inside the AlO$_x$/Sc interface.
