The combined local structure techniques, extended x-ray absorption fine
structure (EXAFS) and neutron pair distribution function analysis, have been
used for temperatures 4 <= T <= 330 K to rule out a large Jahn-Teller (JT)
distortion of the Co-O bond in La1-xSrxCoO3 for a significant fraction of Co
sites (x <= 0.35), indicating few, if any, JT-active, singly occupied e_g Co
sites exist.
