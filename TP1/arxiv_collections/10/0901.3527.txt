We present the formalism for calculating the femtoscopic correlation function
directly in spherical harmonics. The numerator and denominator are stored as a
set of one-dimensional histograms representing the spherical harmonic
decompositions of each. We present the formalism to calculate the correlation
function from them directly, without going to any three-dimensional histogram.
We discuss the practical implementation of the method and we provide an example
of its use. We also discuss the stability of the method in the presence of
$\theta$-$\phi$ holes in the underlying data (e.g. from experimental
acceptance).
