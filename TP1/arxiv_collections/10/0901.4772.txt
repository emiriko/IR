Excited states in single quantum dots (QDs) have been shown to be useful for
spin state initialization and manipulation. For scalable quantum information
processing it is necessary to have multiple spins interacting. Therefore, we
present initial results from photoluminescence excitation studies of excited
states in coupled quantum dots (CQDs). Due to the rich set of possible
excitation and recombination possibilities, a technique for visualizing
photoluminescence excitation in coupled quantum dots is discussed, by which
both the interaction between the dots and the type of absorption and emission
that generated the photoluminescence is easily and clearly revealed. As an
example, this technique is applied to characterize the shell structure of the
hole in the top dot and the results are compared with those using Level
Anti-Crossing Spectroscopy (LACS).
