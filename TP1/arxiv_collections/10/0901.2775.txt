We present a new measurement of the e+e- -> J/psi ccbar cross section where
the ccbar pair can fragment either into charmed hadrons or a charmonium state.
In the former case the J/psi and a charmed hadron are reconstructed, while the
latter process is measured using the recoil mass technique, which allows the
identification of two-body final states without reconstruction of one of the
charmonia. The measured e+e- -> J/psi ccbar cross section is (0.74 +- 0.08 +
0.09 - 0.08) pb, and the e+e- -> J/psi non-ccbar cross section is (0.43 +- 0.09
+-0.09) pb. We note that the measured cross sections are obtained from a data
sample with the multiplicity of charged tracks in the event larger than four;
corrections for the effect of this requirement are not performed as this cannot
be done in a model-independent way. The analysis is based on a data sample with
an integrated luminosity of 673/fb recorded near the Upsilon(4S) resonance with
the Belle detector at the KEKB e+e- asymmetric-energy collider.
