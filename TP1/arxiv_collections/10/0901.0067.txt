We investigate structural parameters, i.e., bond lengths and bond angles of
isolated uncapped zigzag single-wall nanotubes in detail. The bond lengths and
bond angles are determined for several radii tubes by using a theoretical
procedure based on the helical and rotational symmetry for atom coordinates
generation, coupled with Tersoff potential for interaction energy calculations.
Results show that the structure of zigzag tubes is governed by two bond
lengths. One bond length is found to have a value equal to that of graphite,
while the other one is larger. Furthermore, the tube length is found to have
significant effect only on larger bond length in zigzag tubes. With the
application of the pressure, only the larger bond length compresses, the other
one remaining practically constant. At some critical pressure, this bond length
becomes equal to constant bond length. This behavior of bond lengths is
different from those of armchair tubes. An analysis regarding the cross
sectional shape has also been done. At some higher pressure, transition from
circular to oval cross section takes place. This transition pressure is found
to be equal 2.06GPa for (20,0) tube. Some comparison with chiral tubes has also
been made and important differences on bond length behavior have been observed.
