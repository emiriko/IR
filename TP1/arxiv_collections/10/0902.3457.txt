A novel method of generating artificial scintillation noise is developed and
used to evaluate occultation rates and false positive rates for surveys probing
the Kuiper Belt with the method of serendipitous stellar occultations. A
thorough examination of survey design shows that: (1) diffraction-dominated
occultations are critically (Nyquist) sampled at a rate of 2 Fsu^{-1},
corresponding to 40 s^{-1} for objects at 40 AU, (2) occultation detection
rates are maximized when targets are observed at solar opposition, (3) Main
Belt Asteroids will produce occultations lightcurves identical to those of
Kuiper Belt Objects if target stars are observed at solar elongations of: 116
deg < epsilon < 125 deg, or 131 deg < epsilon < 141 deg, and (4) genuine KBO
occultations are likely to be so rare that a detection threshold of >7-8 sigma
should be adopted to ensure that viable candidate events can be disentangled
from false positives.
