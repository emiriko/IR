I will discuss the motivations for Neutrino Astronomy and its prospects given
the current experimental scenario, which is the main focus of this paper. I
will also go through the first results of the IceCube detector deep in the ice
and of the ANTARES undersea telescope underlying complementary aspects, common
and different challenges. It is an exciting time for this science since the
first completed undersea detector is successfully taking data and the first
cubic kilometer detector is going to be shortly more than half-way from its
completion in Antarctica.
