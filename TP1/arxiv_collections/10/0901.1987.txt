Using deep J, H and Ks-band observations, we have studied the near-infrared
(nIR) extinction of the Nuclear Bulge (NB) and we find significant, complex
variations on small physical scales. We have applied a new variable nIR colour
excess method, V-NICE, to measure the extinction; this method allows for
variation in both the extinction law parameter alpha and the degree of absolute
extinction on very small physical scales. We see significant variation in both
these parameters on scales of 5 arcsec. In our observed fields, representing a
random sample of sight lines to the NB, we measure alpha to be 2.64 +- 0.52,
compared to the canonical "universal" value of 2. Our measured levels of A_Ks
are similar to previously measured results (1 < A_Ks < 4.5); however, the
steeper extinction law results in higher values for A_J (4.5 < A_J < 10) and
A_H (1.5 < A_H < 6.5). Only when the extinction law is allowed to vary on the
smallest scales can we recover self-consistent measures of the absolute
extinction at each wavelength, allowing accurate reddening corrections for
field star photometry in the NB. The steeper extinction law slope also suggests
that previous conversions of nIR extinction to A_V may need to be reconsidered.
Finally, we find that the measured values of extinction are significantly
dependent on the filter transmission functions of the instrument used to obtain
the data. This effect must be taken into account when combining or comparing
data from different instruments.
