The compact radio source Sagittarius A (Sgr A) at the centre of our Galaxy
harbours a supermassive black hole, whose mass has been measured from stellar
orbital motions. Sgr A is therefore the nearest laboratory where super-massive
black hole astrophysics can be tested, and the environment of black holes can
be investigated. Since it is not an active galactic nucleus, it also offers the
possibility of observing the capture of small objects that may orbit the
central black hole. We study the effects of the strong gravitational field of
the black hole on small objects, such as a comet or an asteroid. We also
explore the idea that the flares detected in Sgr A might be produced by the
final accretion of single, dense objects with mass of the order of 10^20 g, and
that their timing is not a characteristic of the sources, but rather of the
space-time of the central galactic black hole in which they are moving. We find
that tidal effects are strong enough to melt the solid object, and present
calculations of the temporal evolution of the light curve of infalling objects
as a function of various parameters. Our modelling of tidal disruption suggests
that during tidal squeezing, the conditions for synchrotron radiation can be
met. We show that the light curve of a flare can be deduced from dynamical
properties of geodesic orbits around black holes and that it depends only
weakly on the physical properties of the source.
