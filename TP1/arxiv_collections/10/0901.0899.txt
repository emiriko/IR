Memristors are passive circuit elements which behave as resistors with
memory. The recent experimental realization of a memristor has triggered
interest in this concept and its possible applications. Here, we demonstrate
memristive response in a thin film of Vanadium Dioxide. This behavior is driven
by the insulator-to-metal phase transition typical of this oxide. We discuss
several potential applications of our device, including high density
information storage. Most importantly, our results demonstrate the potential
for a new realization of memristive systems based on phase transition
phenomena.
