Numerical modeling of electrodynamic aggregation is carried out for a random
ensemble of magnetized nanodust taken as a many body system of strongly
magnetized thin rods (i.e., one-dimensional static magnetic dipoles), which
possess electric conductivity and static electric charge, screened with its own
static plasma sheath. The self-assembling of quasi-linear filaments from an
ensemble of randomly situated basic blocks and the electric short-circuiting
between biased electrodes are shown to be supported by the alignment of blocks
in an external magnetic field. Statistical analysis of short-circuiting time
allows tracing the dynamic percolation of electric conductivity and shows a
decrease of percolation threshold for volume fraction, as compared with the
observed percolation of carbon nanotubes in liquids and polymer composites.
Modeling of short-circuiting stage of evolution is continued with tracing the
dynamics of pinching of electric current filaments to show the interplay of all
the magnetic and electric mechanisms of filaments networking. A trend towards a
fractal skeletal structuring (namely, repeat of original basic block at a
larger length scale) is illustrated with the evidence for generation of a
bigger magnetic dipole.
