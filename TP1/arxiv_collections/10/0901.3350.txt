We revisit in more detail a model for element abundance fractionation in the
solar chromosphere, that gives rise to the "FIP Effect" in the solar corona and
wind. Elements with first ionization potential below about 10 eV, i.e. those
that are predominantly ionized in the chromosphere, are enriched in the corona
by a factor 3-4. We model the propagation of Alfven waves through the
chromosphere using a non-WKB treatment, and evaluate the ponderomotive force
associated with these waves. Under solar conditions, this is generally pointed
upwards in the chromosphere, and enhances the abundance of chromospheric ions
in the corona. Our new approach captures the essentials of the solar coronal
abundance anomalies, including the depletion of He relative to H, and also the
putative depletion of Ne, recently discussed in the literature. We also argue
that the FIP effect provides the strongest evidence to date for energy fluxes
of Alfven waves sufficient to heat the corona. However it appears that these
waves must also be generated in the corona, in order to preserve the rather
regular fractionation pattern without strong variations from loop to loop
observed in the solar corona and slow speed solar wind.
