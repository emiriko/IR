FoF1-ATP synthase is the enzyme that provides the 'chemical energy currency'
adenosine triphosphate, ATP, for living cells. The formation of ATP is
accomplished by a stepwise internal rotation of subunits within the enzyme.
Briefly, proton translocation through the membrane-bound Fo part of ATP
synthase drives a 10-step rotary motion of the ring of c subunits with respect
to the non-rotating subunits a and b. This rotation is transmitted to the gamma
and epsilon subunits of the F1 sector resulting in 120 degree steps. In order
to unravel this symmetry mismatch we monitor subunit rotation by a
single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach using
three fluorophores specifically attached to the enzyme: one attached to the F1
motor, another one to the Fo motor, and the third one to a non-rotating
subunit. To reduce photophysical artifacts due to spectral fluctuations of the
single fluorophores, a duty cycle-optimized alternating three-laser scheme
(DCO-ALEX) has been developed. Simultaneous observation of the stepsizes for
both motors allows the detection of reversible elastic deformations between the
rotor parts of Fo and F1.
