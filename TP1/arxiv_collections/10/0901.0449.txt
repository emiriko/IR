Phenomena of emergence of regular and chaotic fine structure (FS) in
stimulated emission (SE) power spectra of an autonomous microwave phonon laser
(phaser) have been revealed and investigated experimentally in pink ruby at
liquid helium temperatures. The phenomenon of a self-organized bottleneck in
evolution of the microwave acoustic FS lines has been observed by means of
narrow-range phonon SE spectral analysis. The large-scale phenomenon of
coexistence of incongruous (stationary, periodic and chaotic) states in the
whole spin-phonon phaser system has been revealed in experiments with panoramic
power spectra of phonon SE. We propose a possible direction for modeling of
both the observed phenomena on the basis of three-level cellular automata
(S.D.Makovetskiy and D.N.Makovetskii, arXiv:cond-mat/0410460v2;
S.D.Makovetskiy, arXiv:cond-mat/0602345v1) which emulate evolution of a bounded
phaser-like excitable system.
