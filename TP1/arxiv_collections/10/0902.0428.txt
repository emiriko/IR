In a previous paper (Gayon & Bois 2008a), we have shown the general
efficiency of retrograde resonances for stabilizing compact planetary systems.
Such retrograde resonances can be found when two-planets of a three-body
planetary system are both in mean motion resonance and revolve in opposite
directions. For a particular two-planet system, we have also obtained a new
orbital fit involving such a counter-revolving configuration and consistent
with the observational data.
  In the present paper, we analytically investigate the three-body problem in
this particular case of retrograde resonances. We therefore define a new set of
canonical variables allowing to express correctly the resonance angles and
obtain the Hamiltonian of a system harboring planets revolving in opposite
directions. The acquiring of an analytical "rail" may notably contribute to a
deeper understanding of our numerical investigation and provides the major
structures related to the stability properties. A comparison between our
analytical and numerical results is also carried out.
