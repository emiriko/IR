During the last few decades, great effort has been made towards understanding
hydrodynamical processes which determine the structure and evolution of stars.
Up to now, the most stringent constraints have been provided by helioseismology
and stellar cluster studies. However, the contribution of asteroseismology
becomes more and more important, giving us an opportunity to probe the
interiors and atmospheres of very different stellar objects. A variety of
pulsating variables allows us to test various parameters of micro- and
macrophysics by means of oscillation data. I will review the most outstanding
key problems, both observational and theoretical, of which our knowledge can be
improved by means of asteroseismology.
