We show that specific heat C$_p$ has non-Debye behavior for glassy states in
half-doped manganites. Irrespective of the magnetic order or electronic states,
these magnetic glasses have higher C$_p$ compared to their equilibrium
counterparts. The excess C$_p$ contributed by the glassy state varies linearly
with temperature similar to conventional glasses indicating tunneling in the
two-level systems. These glassy states show signature of zero point entropy.
Magnetic glasses can be produced simply by different field cooling protocols
and may be considered ideal magnetic counterpart of the conventional glass.
