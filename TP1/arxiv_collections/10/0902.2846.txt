When the atoms of a dimer remain most of the time very far apart, in
so-called long-range molecular states, their mutual interaction is ruled by
plain atomic properties. The high-resolution spectroscopic study of some
molecular excited states populated by photoassociation of cold atoms
(photoassociative spectroscopy) gives a good illustration of this property. It
provides accurate determinations of atomic radiative lifetimes, which are known
to be sensitive tests for atomic calculations. A number of such analyses has
been performed up to now, for all stable alkali atoms and for some other atomic
species (Ca, Sr, Yb). A systematic review of these determinations is attempted
here, with special attention paid to accuracy issues.
