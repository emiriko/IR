We discover an inherent mechanism for entanglement swap associated with
sequential superradiance from an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate. Based on
careful examinations with both analytical and numerical approaches, we conclude
that as a result of the swap mechanism, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)-type
quantum correlations can be detected among the scattered light pulses.
