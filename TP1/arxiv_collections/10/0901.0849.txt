We discuss a model which would explain neutrino oscillation, dark matter, and
baryon asymmetry of the Universe simultaneously by the physics at TeV scales.
Tiny neutrino masses are generated at the three loop level due to the exact
$Z_2$ symmetry, by which the stability of the dark matter candidate is also
guaranteed. The extra Higgs doublet is required not only for the tiny neutrino
masses but also for successful electroweak baryogenesis. The model provides
various discriminative predictions especially in charged Higgs phenomenology.
