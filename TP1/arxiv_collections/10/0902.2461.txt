We calculate equilibrium and nonequilibrium Casimir-Polder force felt by a
small particle (an atom)near a flat substrate using the framework of
fluctuation electrodynamics in configuration of a small sphere above a flat
substrate. A numerical example is given for a SiC micron -sized particle above
a SiC substrate. Different temperature configurations are considered.
