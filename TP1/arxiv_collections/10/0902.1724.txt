Errors in Eberly's derivation of several Bell inequalities are pointed out:
(1) it is based on an equation that is incorrect; (2) it uses neither
two-particle states nor locality to derive Bell's inequalities and; (3) it does
not use entanglement to obtain violations of Bell's inequalities. Even leading
and outstanding physicists -- as certainly is the case of Prof. Eberly --
sometimes make elementary mistakes, and this by no means diminishes the
importance of their scientific contribution. In general, this is a consequence
of an excessive attachment to an idea (nowadays it has become fashionable to be
against realism). This shows the importance of trying to keep an open mind.
