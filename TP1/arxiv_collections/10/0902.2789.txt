Red supergiants (RSGs) are a He-burning phase in the evolution of moderately
massive stars (10-25 solar masses). For many years, the assumed physical
properties of these stars placed them at odds with the predictions of
evolutionary theory. We have recently determined new effective temperatures and
luminosities for the RSG populations of galaxies with a factor of ~8 range in
metallicity, including the Milky Way, the Magellanic Clouds, and M31. We find
that these new physical properties greatly improve the agreement between the
RSGs and the evolutionary tracks, although there are still notable difficulties
with modeling the physical properties of RSGs at low metallicity. We have also
examined several unusual RSGs, including VY CMa in the Milky Way, WOH G64 in
the LMC, and a sample of four RSGs in the Magellanic Clouds that show
considerable variations in their physical parameters, most notably their
effective temperatures. For all of these stars we reexamine their placement on
the H-R diagram, where they have appeared to occupy the "forbidden" region to
the right of the Hayashi track. We have updated current understanding of the
physical properties of VY CMa and WOH G64; in the case of the unusual
Magellanic Cloud variables, we conclude that these stars are undergoing an
unstable evolutionary phase not previously associated with RSGs.
