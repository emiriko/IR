In a recent paper [V. Aji and C.M. Varma, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 99}, 167003
(2007) \cite{aji1}] we have shown that the dissipation driven quantum phase
transition of the 2D xy model represents a universality class where the
correlations at criticality is local in space and power law in time. Here we
provide a detailed analysis of the model. The local criticality is brought
about by the decoupling of infrared singularities in space and time. The former
leads to a Kosterlitz Thouless transition whereby the excitations of the
transverse component of the velocity field (vortices) unbind in space. The
latter on the other hand leads to a transition among excitations (warps) in the
longitudinal component of the velocity field, which unbind in time. The quantum
Ashkin-Teller model, with which the observed loop order in the Cuprates is
described maps in the critical regime to the quantum xy model. We also discuss
other models which are expected to have similar properties.
