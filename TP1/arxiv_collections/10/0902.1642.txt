Existing and planned radiotelescopes working in the millimetre (mm) and
sub-millimetre wavelengths range provide the possibility to be used for
atmospheric line observations. To scrutinize this potential, we outline the
differences and similarities in technical equipment and observing techniques
between ground-based aeronomy mm-wave radiometers and radiotelescopes.
Comprehensive tables summarizing the technical characteristics of existing and
future (sub)-mm radiotelescopes are given. The advantages and disadvantages
using radiotelescopes for atmospheric line observations are discussed. In view
of the importance of exploring the sub-mm and far-infrared wavelengths range
for astronomical observations and atmospheric sciences, we present model
calculations of the atmospheric transmission for selected telescope sites
(DOME-C/Antarctica, ALMA/Chajnantor, JCMT and CSO on Mauna Kea/Hawaii,
KOSMA/Swiss Alpes) for frequencies between 0 and 2000 GHz (150 micron) and
typical atmospheric conditions using the forward model MOLIERE (version~5). For
the DOME-C site, the transmission over a larger range of up to 10 THz (30
micron) is calculated in order to demonstrate the quality of an earth-bound
site for mid-IR observations. All results are available on a dedicated webpage
