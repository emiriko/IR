Bolometric Interferometry (BI) is one of the most promising techniques for
precise measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background polarization. In this
paper, we present the results of DIBO (Demonstrateur d'Interferometrie
Bolometrique), a single-baseline demonstrator operating at 90 GHz, built to
proof the validity of the BI concept applied to a millimeter-wave
interferometer. This instrument has been characterized in the laboratory with a
detector at room temperature and with a 4 K bolometer. This allowed us to
measure interference patterns in a clean way, both (1) rotating the source and
(2) varying with time the phase shift among the two interferometer's arms.
Detailed modelisation has also been performed and validated with measurements.
