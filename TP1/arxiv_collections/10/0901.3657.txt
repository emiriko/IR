We study the cost of multiplication modulo triangular families of
polynomials. Following previous work by Li, Moreno Maza and Schost, we propose
an algorithm that relies on homotopy and fast evaluation-interpolation
techniques. We obtain a quasi-linear time complexity for substantial families
of examples, for which no such result was known before. Applications are given
to notably addition of algebraic numbers in small characteristic.
