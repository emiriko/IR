We report quantum oscillation measurements that enable the direct observation
of the Fermi surface of the low temperature ground state of \ba122. From these
measurements we characterize the low energy excitations, revealing that the
Fermi surface is reconstructed in the antiferromagnetic state, but leaving
itinerant electrons in its wake. The present measurements are consistent with a
conventional band folding picture of the antiferromagnetic ground state,
placing important limits on the topology and size of the Fermi surface.
