Within the context of the EU Design Study Developmental Gene Expression Map,
we identify a set of challenges when facilitating collaborative research on
early human embryo development. These challenges bring forth requirements, for
which we have identified solutions and technology. We summarise our solutions
and demonstrate how they integrate to form an e-infrastructure to support
collaborative research in this area of developmental biology.
