We have studied the variation of critical current in
Superconductor/Ferromagnet/Superconductor (S/F/S) Josephson Junctions as a
function of ferromagnet thickness using a weakly-ferromagnetic alloy Pd82Ni12.
Measurements were performed for the thickness range 32 to 100 nm, over which
the critical current density decreases by five orders of magnitude. The
critical current density oscillates with a period of 12.9 +/- 0.3 nm, and
decays over a characteristic length of 8.0 +/- 0.5 nm. There is no evidence of
a crossover to a slower decay, which might indicate the presence of long-range
spin-triplet pair correlations. We discuss possible reasons for their absence,
including the possibility of strong spin flip scattering in PdNi.
