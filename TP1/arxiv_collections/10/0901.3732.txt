The partonic flux originated from a heavy nucleus is not the mere sum of the
fluxes coming from the individual nucleons. There are various effects that give
rise to modifications. One of these effects is here investigated i.e. the
presence of a cloud of virtual pions co-moving with the nucleus. It is found
that the contribution of these virtual particles to the total parton flux
should be rather small even if one includes the contribution of resonances.
