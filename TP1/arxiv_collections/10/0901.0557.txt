Although we have yet to determine whether the DAMA data represents a true
discovery of new physics, among such interpretations inelastic dark matter
(IDM) can match the energy spectrum of DAMA very well while not contradicting
the results of other direct detection searches. In this paper we investigate
the general properties that a viable IDM candidate must have and search for
simple models that realize these properties in natural ways. We begin by
determining the regions of IDM parameter space that are allowed by direct
detection searches including DAMA, paying special attention to larger IDM
masses. We observe that an inelastic dark matter candidate with electroweak
interactions can naturally satisfy observational constraints while
simultaneously yielding the correct thermal relic abundance. We comment on
several other proposed dark matter explanations for the DAMA signal and
demonstrate that one of the proposed alternatives -- elastic scattering of dark
matter off electrons -- is strongly disfavored when the modulated and
unmodulated DAMA spectral data are taken into account. We then outline the
general essential features of IDM models in which inelastic scattering off
nuclei is mediated by the exchange of a massive gauge boson, and construct
natural models in the context of a warped extra dimension and supersymmetry.
