This paper proposes a statistical mechanics approach to the analysis of
income distribution and inequality. A new distribution function, having its
roots in the framework of k-generalized statistics, is derived that is
particularly suitable to describe the whole spectrum of incomes, from the
low-middle income region up to the high-income Pareto power-law regime.
Analytical expressions for the shape, moments and some other basic statistical
properties are given. Furthermore, several well-known econometric tools for
measuring inequality, which all exist in a closed form, are considered. A
method for parameter estimation is also discussed. The model is shown to fit
remarkably well the data on personal income for the United States, and the
analysis of inequality performed in terms of its parameters reveals very
powerful.
