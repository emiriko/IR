An elementary calculation shows that Landau diamagnetism becomes
significantly altered and very large paramagnetic effects emerge at low
temperature in nanoscale 2DEG strips penetrated by a perpendicular applied
magnetic field and bounded by a parabolic potential, such as may arise from
negative voltage applied to a split gate. These novel results are described by
an expression which manifests the total system magnetization as a difference
between evolved orbital paramagnetism and altered diamagnetism. These predicted
effects correspond to drift motion of electrons parallel to the strip length
arising from Landau eigenstates that are non-degenerate in the combined
presence of a perpendicular applied magnetic field and electric fields
associated with a confining parabolic potential. A new heterostructured
magnetic material based on orbital electronic motion in 2DEG strips is
proposed.
