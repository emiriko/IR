We investigate theoretically spin relaxation in heavy hole quantum dots in
low external magnetic fields. We demonstrate that two-phonon processes and
spin-orbit interaction are experimentally relevant and provide an explanation
for the recently observed saturation of the spin relaxation rate in heavy hole
quantum dots with vanishing magnetic fields. We propose further experiments to
identify the relevant spin relaxation mechanisms in low magnetic fields.
