We study the multiagent epistemic logic CMAELCD with operators for common and
distributed knowledge for all coalitions of agents. We introduce Hintikka
structures for this logic and prove that satisfiability in such structures is
equivalent to satisfiability in standard models. Using this result, we design
an incremental tableau based decision procedure for testing satisfiability in
CMAELCD.
