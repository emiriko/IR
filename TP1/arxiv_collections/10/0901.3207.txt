The quantum theory of the vector field minimally coupled to the gravity of
the de Sitter spacetime is built in a canonical manner starting with a new
complete set of quantum modes of given momentum and helicity derived in the
moving chart of conformal time. It is shown that the canonical quantization
leads to new vector propagators which satisfy similar equations as the
propagators derived by Tsamis and Woodard [{\em J.Math.Phys.} {\bf 48} (2007)
052306] but having a different structure. The one-particle operators are also
written down pointing out that their properties are similar with those found
already in the quantum theory of the scalar, Dirac and Maxwell free fields.
