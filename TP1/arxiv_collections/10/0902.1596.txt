Placing a quantum dot close to a metal nanowire leads to drastic changes in
its radiative decay behavior because of evanescent couplings to surface
plasmons. We show how two non-Markovian effects, band-edge and retardation,
could be observed in such a system. Combined with a quantum dot p-i-n junction,
these effects could be readout via current-noise measurements. We also discuss
how these effects can occur in similar systems with restricted geometries, like
phononic cavities and photonic crystal waveguides. This work links two
previously separate topics: surface-plasmons and current-noise measurements.
