Interactions between mesoscopic devices induced by interface acoustic phonons
propagating in the plane of a two-dimensional electron system (2DES) are
investigated by phonon-spectroscopy. In our experiments ballistic electrons
injected from a biased quantum point contact emit phonons and a portion of them
are reabsorbed exciting electrons in a nearby degenerate 2DES. We perform
energy spectroscopy on these excited electrons employing a tunable
electrostatic barrier in an electrically separate and unbiased detector
circuit. The transferred energy is found to be bounded by a maximum value
corresponding to Fermi-level electrons excited and back-scattered by absorbing
interface phonons. Our results imply that phonon-mediated interaction plays an
important role for the decoherence of solid-state-based quantum circuits.
