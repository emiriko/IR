The theory of Andreev conductance is formulated for junctions involving
normal metals (N) and multiband superconductors (S) and applied to the case of
superconductors with nodeless extended $s_{\pm}$-wave order parameter symmetry,
as possibly realized in the recently discovered ferro pnictides. We find
qualitative differences from tunneling into s-wave or d-wave superconductors
that may help to identify such a state. First, interband interference leads to
a suppression of Andreev reflection in the case of a highly transparent N/S
interface and to a current deficit in the tunneling regime. Second, surface
bound states may appear, both at zero and at non-zero energies. These effects
do not occur in multiband superconductors without interband sign reversal,
though the interference can still strongly modify the conductance spectra.
