Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) with either a black hole or a neutron star
show power spectra characterised by Quasi Periodic Oscillations (QPOs). Twin
peak high frequency QPOs are characterised by frequencies that are typical for
matter orbiting within 10 r_g from the compact object. We consider clumps of
material orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole, that are deformed by tidal
interaction. We present some preliminary calculations of corresponding light
curves and power spectra. We were able to fit the simulated power spectra with
the high frequency part of the power spectra observed in the LMXB XTE J1550-564
containing a black hole. Our numerical simulations reproduce the twin high
frequency QPOs and the power-law. The lower peak corresponds to the Keplerian
frequency, the upper one to the sum of the Keplerian and the radial frequency.
