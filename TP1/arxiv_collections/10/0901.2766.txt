The rigorous on-shell $T$-matrices for $NN$ scattering in the coupled
channels $^3S_1$$-$$^3D_1$ are briefly presented in the context of
EFT($\not\pi$) with the contact potentials truncated at order $\Delta=4$. The
nonperturbative features of renormalization are highlighted and elaborated. A
simple scenario for EFT power counting's and renormalization prescriptions is
also presented with its consequences being roughly analyzed and discussed.
