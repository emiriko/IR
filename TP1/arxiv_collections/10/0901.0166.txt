A kinetic equation approach is applied to model anomalous J/psi suppression
at RHIC and SPS by absorption in a hadron resonance gas which successfully
describes statistical hadron production in both experiments. The puzzling
rapidity dependence of the PHENIX data is reproduced as a geometric effect due
to a longer absorption path for J/psi production at forward rapidity.
