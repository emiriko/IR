Linear codes with large minimal distances are important error correcting
codes in information theory.Orthogonal codes have more applications in the
other fields of mathematics. In this paper, we study the binary and ternary
orthogonal codes generated by the weight matrices on finite-dimensional modules
of simple Lie algebras. The Weyl groups of the Lie algebras act on these codes
isometrically. It turns out that certain weight matrices of $sl(n,\mbb{C})$ and
$o(2n,\mbb{C})$ generate doubly-even binary orthogonal codes and ternary
orthogonal codes with large minimal distances. Moreover, we prove that the
weight matrices of $F_4$, $E_6$, $E_7$ and $E_8$ on their minimal irreducible
modules and adjoint modules all generate ternary orthogonal codes with large
minimal distances. In determining the minimal distances, we have used the Weyl
groups and branch rules of the irreducible representations of the related
simple Lie algebras.
