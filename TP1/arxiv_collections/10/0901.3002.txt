We propose a model of magnetic connection (MC) of a black hole with its
surrounding accretion disc based on large-scale magnetic field. The MC gives
rise to transport of energy and angular momentum between the black hole and the
disc, and the closed field lines pipe the hot matter evaporated from the disc,
and shape it in the corona above the disc to form a magnetically induced
disc-corona system, in which the corona has the same configuration as the
large-scale magnetic field. We numerically solve the dynamic equations in the
context of the Kerr metric, in which the large-scale magnetic field is
determined by dynamo process and equipartition between magnetic pressure and
gas pressure. Thus we can obtain a global solution rather than assuming the
distribution of large-scale magnetic field beforehand. The main MC effects lie
in three aspects. (1) The rotational energy of a fast-spinning black hole can
be extracted, enhancing the dissipation in the accretion disc, (2) the closed
field lines provide a natural channel for corona matter escaping from disc and
finally falling into black hole, and (3) the scope of the corona can be bounded
by the conservation of magnetic flux. We simulate the high-energy spectra of
this system by using Monte-Carlo method, and find that the relative hardness of
the spectra decreases as accretion rate or black hole spin $a_*$ increases. We
fit the typical X-ray spectra of three black-hole binaries (GRO J1655-40, XTE
1118+480 and GX 339-4) in the low/hard or very high state.
