Kalman Filtering problems often have inherent and known constraints in the
physical dynamics that are not exploited despite potentially significant gains
(e.g., fixed speed of a motor). In this paper, we review existing methods and
propose some new ideas for filtering in the presence of equality constraints.
We then show that three methods for incorporating state space equality
constraints are mathematically equivalent to the more general "Projection"
method, which allows different weighting matrices when projecting the estimate.
Still, the different approaches have advantages in implementations that may
make one better suited than another for a given application.
