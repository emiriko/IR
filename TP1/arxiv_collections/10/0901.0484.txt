The classical theory of linear response applies to statistical mechanics
close to equilibrium. Away from equilibrium, one may describe the microscopic
time evolution by a general differentiable dynamical system, identify
nonequilibrium steady states (NESS), and study how these vary under
perturbations of the dynamics. Remarkably, it turns out that for uniformly
hyperbolic dynamical systems (those satisfying the "chaotic hypothesis"), the
linear response away from equilibrium is very similar to the linear response
close to equilibrium: the Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations hold, and the
fluctuation-dispersion theorem survives in a modified form (which takes into
account the oscillations around the "attractor" corresponding to the NESS). If
the chaotic hypothesis does not hold, two new phenomena may arise. The first is
a violation of linear response in the sense that the NESS does not depend
differentiably on parameters (but this nondifferentiability may be hard to see
experimentally). The second phenomenon is a violation of the dispersion
relations: the susceptibility has singularities in the upper half complex
plane. These "acausal" singularities are actually due to "energy
nonconservation": for a small periodic perturbation of the system, the
amplitude of the linear response is arbitrarily large. This means that the NESS
of the dynamical system under study is not "inert" but can give energy to the
outside world. An "active" NESS of this sort is very different from an
equilibrium state, and it would be interesting to see what happens for active
states to the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation theorem.
