We study the mathematical model of thermoacoustic tomography in media with a
variable speed for a fixed time interval, greater than the diameter of the
domain. In case of measurements on the whole boundary, we give an explicit
solution in terms of a Neumann series expansion. We give necessary and
sufficient conditions for uniqueness and stability when the measurements are
taken on a part of the boundary.
