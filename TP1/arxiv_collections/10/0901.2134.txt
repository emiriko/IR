M band spectra of two late-type T dwarfs, 2MASS J09373487+2931409, and Gliese
570D, confirm evidence from photometry that photospheric CO is present at
abundance levels far in excess of those predicted from chemical equilibrium.
These new and unambiguous detections of CO, together with an earlier
spectroscopic detection of CO in Gliese 229B and existing M band photometry of
a large selection of T dwarfs, suggest that vertical mixing in the photosphere
drives the CO abundance out of chemical equilibrium and is a common, and likely
universal feature of mid-to-late type T dwarfs. The M band spectra allow
determinations of the time scale of vertical mixing in the atmosphere of each
object, the first such measurements of this important parameter in late T
dwarfs. A detailed analysis of the spectral energy distribution of 2MASS
J09373487+2931409 results in the following values for metallicity, temperature,
surface gravity, and luminosity: [M/H]~-0.3, T_eff=925-975K, log g=5.20-5.47,
log L/L_sun=-5.308 +/- 0.027. The age is 3-10 Gyr and the mass is in the range
45-69 M_Jup.
