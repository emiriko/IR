Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) play an important role in astrophysics,
especially in the study of cosmic evolution. There are several progenitor
models for SNe Ia proposed in the past years. In this paper, we have carried
out a detailed study of the He star donor channel, in which a carbon-oxygen
white dwarf (CO WD) accretes material from a He main sequence star or a He
subgiant to increase its mass to the Chandrasekhar mass. Employing Eggleton's
stellar evolution code with an optically thick wind assumption, and adopting
the prescription of Kato & Hachisu (2004) for the mass accumulation efficiency
of the He-shell flashes onto the WDs, we performed binary evolution
calculations for about 2600 close WD binary systems. According to these
calculations, we mapped out the initial parameters for SNe Ia in the orbital
period--secondary mass ($\log P^{\rm i}-M^{\rm i}_2$) plane for various WD
masses from this channel. The study shows that the He star donor channel is
noteworthy for producing SNe Ia (i.e. $\sim 1.2\times10^{-3} {\rm yr}^{-1}$ in
the Galaxy), and that the progenitors from this channel may appear as supersoft
X-ray sources. Importantly, this channel can explain SNe Ia with short delay
times ($\la 10^{8}$ yr), which is consistent with recent observational
implications of young populations of SN Ia progenitors.
