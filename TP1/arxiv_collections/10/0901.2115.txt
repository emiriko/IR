Cluster galaxies moving through the intracluster medium (ICM) are expected to
lose some of their interstellar medium (ISM) through ISM-ICM interactions. We
perform high resolution (40 pc) three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of
a galaxy undergoing ram pressure stripping including radiative cooling in order
to investigate stripping of a multiphase medium. The clumpy, multiphase ISM is
self-consistently produced by the inclusion of radiative cooling, and spans six
orders of magnitude in gas density. We find no large variations in the amount
of gas lost whether or not cooling is involved, although the gas in the
multiphase galaxy is stripped more quickly and to a smaller radius. We also see
significant differences in the morphology of the stripped disks. This occurs
because the multiphase medium naturally includes high density clouds set inside
regions of lower density. We find that the lower density gas is stripped
quickly from any radius of the galaxy, and the higher density gas can then be
ablated. If high density clouds survive, through interaction with the ICM they
lose enough angular momentum to drift towards the center of the galaxy where
they are no longer stripped. Finally, we find that low ram pressure values
compress gas into high density clouds that could lead to enhanced star
formation, while high ram pressure leads to a smaller amount of high-density
gas.
