We present photometric evolution models of galaxies, in which, in addition to
the stellar component, the effects of an evolving dusty interstellar medium
have been included with particular care. Starting from the work of Calura,
Pipino & Matteucci (2008), in which chemical evolution models have been used to
study the evolution of both the gas and dust components of the interstellar
medium in the solar neighbourhood, elliptical and irregular galaxies, it has
been possible to combine these models with a spectrophotometric stellar code
that includes dust reprocessing (GRASIL) (Silva et al. 1998) to analyse the
evolution of the spectral energy distributions (SED) of these galaxies. We test
our models against observed SEDs both in the local universe and at high
redshift and use them to predict how the percentage of reprocessed starlight
evolves for each type of galaxy. The importance of following the dust evolution
is investigated by comparing our results with those obtained by adopting simple
assumptions to treat this component.
