The high arithmetic performance and intrinsic parallelism of recent graphical
processing units (GPUs) can offer a technological edge for molecular dynamics
simulations. ACEMD is a production-class bio-molecular dynamics (MD) simulation
program designed specifically for GPUs which is able to achieve supercomputing
scale performance of 40 nanoseconds/day for all-atom protein systems with over
23,000 atoms. We illustrate the characteristics of the code, its validation and
performance. We also run a microsecond-long trajectory for an all-atom
molecular system in explicit TIP3P water on a single workstation computer
equipped with just 3 GPUs. This performance on cost effective hardware allows
ACEMD to reach microsecond timescales routinely with important implications in
terms of scientific applications.
