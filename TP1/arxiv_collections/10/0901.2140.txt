Reconciliation is an essential part of any secret-key agreement protocol and
hence of a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol, where two legitimate
parties are given correlated data and want to agree on a common string in the
presence of an adversary, while revealing a minimum amount of information.
  In this paper, we show that for discrete-variable QKD protocols, this problem
can be advantageously solved with Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes
optimized for the BSC. In particular, we demonstrate that our method leads to a
significant improvement of the achievable secret key rate, with respect to
earlier interactive reconciliation methods used in QKD.
