The coefficients of symmetry energy term for fragments with Z=4,11,12
measured in multifragmentation reactions initiated by proton and deuteron with
energy of 3.65A GeV on enriched tin isotopes 112,118,120,124Sn are determined.
The dependence of isoscaling parameter on the excitation energy, the
temperature of fragmenting systems and the density ratio for heavy mass
products are analised.
