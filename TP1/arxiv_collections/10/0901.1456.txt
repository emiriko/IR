The observation of quantum phenomena in macroscopic mechanical oscillators
has been a subject of interest since the inception of quantum mechanics.
Prerequisite to this regime are both preparation of the mechanical oscillator
at low phonon occupancy and a measurement sensitivity at the scale of the
spread of the oscillator's ground state wavefunction. It has been widely
perceived that the most promising approach to address these two challenges are
electro nanomechanical systems. Here we approach for the first time the quantum
regime with a mechanical oscillator of mesoscopic dimensions--discernible to
the bare eye--and 1000-times more massive than the heaviest nano-mechanical
oscillators used to date. Imperative to these advances are two key principles
of cavity optomechanics: Optical interferometric measurement of mechanical
displacement at the attometer level, and the ability to use measurement induced
dynamic back-action to achieve resolved sideband laser cooling of the
mechanical degree of freedom. Using only modest cryogenic pre-cooling to 1.65
K, preparation of a mechanical oscillator close to its quantum ground state
(63+-20 phonons) is demonstrated. Simultaneously, a readout sensitivity that is
within a factor of 5.5+-1.5 of the standard quantum limit is achieved. The
reported experiments mark a paradigm shift in the approach to the quantum limit
of mechanical oscillators using optical techniques and represent a first step
into a new era of experimental investigation which probes the quantum nature of
the most tangible harmonic oscillator: a mechanical vibration.
