Dynamics of the neck degree of freedom during fusioning process between heavy
ions is studied. Time scales of the three degrees of freedom (the relative
distance, the neck and the mass-asymmetry) are studied, showing an early
equilibration of the neck. This means that a di-nucleus formed by the incident
combination of ions quickly forms a mono-nucleus with a superdeformation during
the fusion process and that the other two degrees of freedom have to be solved
in a coupled way. A brief introduction of Langevin approach and
dissipation-fluctuation dynamics is also given and of the application to the
synthesis of the superheavy elements.
