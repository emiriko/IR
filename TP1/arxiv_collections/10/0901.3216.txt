We present an all fiber source of frequency entangled photon pairs by using
four wave mixing in a Sagnac fiber loop. Special care is taken to suppress the
impurity of the frequency entanglement by cooling the fiber and by matching the
polarization modes of the photon pairs counter-propagating in the fiber loop.
Coincidence detection of signal and idler photons, which are created in pair
and in different spatial modes of the fiber loop, shows the quantum
interference in the form of spatial beating, while the single counts of the
individual signal (idler) photons keep constant. When the production rate of
photon pairs is about 0.013 pairs/pulse, the envelope of the quantum
interference reveals a visibility of $(95\pm 2)%$, which is close to the
calculated theoretical limit 97.4%
