We show that the addition of real scalars (gauge singlets) to the Standard
Model can both ameliorate the little hierarchy problem and provide realistic
Dark Matter candidates. To this end, the coupling of the new scalars to the
standard Higgs boson must be relatively strong and their mass should be in the
1-3 TeV range, while the lowest cutoff of the (unspecified) UV completion must
be >~ 5 TeV, depending on the Higgs boson mass and the number of singlets
present. The existence of the singlets also leads to realistic and surprisingly
reach neutrino physics. The resulting light neutrino mass spectrum and mixing
angles are consistent with the constraints from the neutrino oscillations.
