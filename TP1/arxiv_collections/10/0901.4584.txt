The Efimov effect represents a cornerstone in few-body physics. Building on
the recent experimental observation with ultracold atoms, we report the first
experimental signature of Efimov physics in a heteronuclear system. A mixture
of $^{41}$K and $^{87}$Rb atoms was cooled to few hundred nanoKelvins and
stored in an optical dipole trap. Exploiting a broad interspecies Feshbach
resonance, the losses due to three-body collisions were studied as a function
of the interspecies scattering length. We observe an enhancement of the
three-body collisions for three distinct values of the interspecies scattering
lengths, both positive and negative. We attribute the two features at negative
scattering length to the existence of two kind of Efimov trimers, namely KKRb
and KRbRb.
