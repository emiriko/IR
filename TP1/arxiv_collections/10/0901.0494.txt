It is shown that large Nc QCD must have a Hagedorn spectrum (i.e. a spectrum
of hadron which grows exponentially with the hadrons mass) provided that
certain technical assumptions concerning the applicability of perturbation
theory to a certain class of correlation functions apply. The basic argument
exploits the interplay of confinement and asymptotic freedom.
