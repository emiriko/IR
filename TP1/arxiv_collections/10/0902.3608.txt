The presence of baryonic matter leads to the mixing between transverse $\rho$
and $a_1$ mesons through a set of $\omega\rho a_1$-type interactions, which
results in the modification to the dispersion relation. We show that a clear
enhancement of the vector spectral function appears below $\sqrt{s}=m_\rho$ for
small three-momenta of the $\rho$ meson, and thus the vector spectrum exhibits
broadening. We also discuss its relevance to dilepton measurements.
