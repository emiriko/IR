of the INFN "Workshop on Monte Carlo's, Physics and Simulations at the LHC",
held at the Frascati National Laboratories in 2006. The first part of these
proceedings contains pedagogical introductions to several basic topics of both
theoretical and experimental high pT LHC physics. The second part collects more
