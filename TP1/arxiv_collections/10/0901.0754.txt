An one-step replica-symmetry-breaking solution for finite connectivity
spin-glass models with K body interaction is constructed at finite temperature
using the replica method and thermodynamic constraints. In the absence of
external fields, this construction provides a general extension of replica
symmetric solution at finite replica number to one-step
replica-symmetry-breaking solution. It is found that this result is formally
equivalent to that of the one-step replica-symmetry-breaking cavity method. To
confirm the validity of the obtained solution, Monte Carlo simulations are
performed for K = 2 and 3. The thermodynamic quantities of the Monte Carlo
results extrapolated to a large-size limit are consistent with those estimated
by our solution for K = 2 at all simulated temperatures and for K = 3 except
near the transition temperature.
