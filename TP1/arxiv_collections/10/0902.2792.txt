We review some general properties of assembling galactic dark matter (DM)
halos which have a direct effect on the baryon dynamics. Specifically, we focus
on the mutual dynamical feedback between baryons and DM which influence disk
formation and evolution, by comparing models with and without baryons evolved
from identical initial conditions. Baryons are found to be capable of modifying
the DM density profiles of inner halos, leading to isothermal profiles rather
than the NFW cusps. Those can be leveled off by the subsequent dynamical
friction of the subhalos at lower redshifts. Furthermore, subhalos appear
efficient in triggering galactic bars and ablating cold gas from the disks, and
therefore quenching of star formation there.
