We investigate the ground-state properties of polyacene in terms of an
extended Peierls-Hubbard Hamiltonian with particular emphasis on its structural
instability of two types: double bonds in a "cis" pattern and those in a
"trans" pattern. Calculating the polarized optical conductivity spectra within
and beyond the Hartree-Fock scheme, we reveal a striking contrast between the
"cis" and "trans" configurations. The two Peierls-distorted states are almost
degenerate in their energetics but quite distinct in their optics.
