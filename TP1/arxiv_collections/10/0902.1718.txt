A longstanding problem in Kaluza-Klein models is the description of matter
dynamics. Within the 5D model, the dimensional reduction of the geodesic motion
for a 5D free test particle formally restores electrodynamics, but the reduced
4D particle shows a charge-mass ratio that is upper bounded, such that it
cannot fit to any kind of elementary particle. At the same time, from the
quantum dynamics viewpoint, there is the problem of the huge massive modes
generation. We present a criticism against the 5D geodesic approach and face
the hypothesis that in Kaluza-Klein space the geodesic motion does not deal
with the real dynamics of test particle. We propose a new approach: starting
from the conservation equation for the 5D matter tensor, within the Papapetrou
multipole expansion, we prove that the 5D dynamical equation differs from the
5D geodesic one. Our new equation provides right coupling terms without
bounding and in such a scheme the tower of massive modes is removed.
