We analyzed simultaneous archival XMM-Newton and RXTE observations of the
X-ray binary and black hole candidate Swift J1753.5-0127. In a previous
analysis of the same data a soft thermal component was found in the X-ray
spectrum, and the presence of an accretion disk extending close to the
innermost stable circular orbit was proposed. This is in contrast with the
standard picture in which the accretion disk is truncated at large radii in the
low/hard state. We tested a number of spectral models and we found that several
of them fit the observed spectra without the need of a soft disk-like
component. This result implies that the classical paradigm of a truncated
accretion disk in the low/hard state can not be ruled out by these data. We
further discovered a broad iron emission line between 6 and 7 keV in these
data. From fits to the line profile we found an inner disk radius that ranges
between ~6-16 gravitational radii, which can be in fact much larger, up to ~250
gravitational radii, depending on the model used to fit the continuum and the
line. We discuss the implications of these results in the context of a fully or
partially truncated accretion disk.
