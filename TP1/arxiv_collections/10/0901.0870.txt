The Lie and module (Rinehart) algebraic structure of vector fields of compact
support over C infinity functions on a (connected) manifold M define a unique
universal non-commutative Poisson * algebra. For a compact manifold, a
(antihermitian) variable Z, central with respect to both the product and the
Lie product, relates commutators and Poisson brackets; in the non-compact case,
sequences of locally central variables allow for the addition of an element
with the same role.
  Quotients with respect to the (positive) values taken by Z* Z define
classical Poisson algebras and quantum observable algebras, with the Planck
constant given by -iZ. Under standard regularity conditions, the corresponding
states and Hilbert space representations uniquely give rise to classical and
quantum mechanics on M.
