We explain how (perturbed) boundary conformal field theory allows us to
understand the tunneling of edge quasiparticles in non-Abelian topological
states. The coupling between a bulk non-Abelian quasiparticle and the edge is
due to resonant tunneling to a zero mode on the quasiparticle, which causes the
zero mode to hybridize with the edge. This can be reformulated as the flow from
one conformally-invariant boundary condition to another in an associated
critical statistical mechanical model. Tunneling from one edge to another at a
point contact can split the system in two, either partially or completely. This
can be reformulated in the critical statistical mechanical model as the flow
from one type of defect line to another. We illustrate these two phenomena in
detail in the context of the nu=5/2 quantum Hall state and the critical Ising
model. We briefly discuss the case of Fibonacci anyons and conclude by
explaining the general formulation and its physical interpretation.
