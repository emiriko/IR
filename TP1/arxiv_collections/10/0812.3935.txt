Spatial heterogeneity in the elastic properties of soft random solids is
examined via vulcanization theory. The spatial heterogeneity in the
\emph{structure} of soft random solids is a result of the fluctuations
locked-in at their synthesis, which also brings heterogeneity in their
\emph{elastic properties}. Vulcanization theory studies semi-microscopic models
of random-solid-forming systems, and applies replica field theory to deal with
their quenched disorder and thermal fluctuations. The elastic deformations of
soft random solids are argued to be described by the Goldstone sector of
fluctuations contained in vulcanization theory, associated with a subtle form
of spontaneous symmetry breaking that is associated with the
liquid-to-random-solid transition. The resulting free energy of this Goldstone
sector can be reinterpreted as arising from a phenomenological description of
an elastic medium with quenched disorder. Through this comparison, we arrive at
the statistics of the quenched disorder of the elasticity of soft random
solids, in terms of residual stress and Lam\'e-coefficient fields. In
particular, there are large residual stresses in the equilibrium reference
state, and the disorder correlators involving the residual stress are found to
be long-ranged and governed by a universal parameter that also gives the mean
shear modulus.
