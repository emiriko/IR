The structure and energetics of superflow around quantized vortices, and the
motion inherited by these vortices from this superflow, are explored in the
general setting of the superfluidity of helium-four in arbitrary dimensions.
The vortices may be idealized as objects of co-dimension two, such as
one-dimensional loops and two-dimensional closed surfaces, respectively, in the
cases of three- and four-dimensional superfluidity. By using the analogy
between vorticial superflow and Ampere-Maxwell magnetostatics, the equilibrium
superflow containing any specified collection of vortices is constructed. The
energy of the superflow is found to take on a simple form for vortices that are
smooth and asymptotically large, compared with the vortex core size. The motion
of vortices is analyzed in general, as well as for the special cases of
hyper-spherical and weakly distorted hyper-planar vortices. In all dimensions,
vortex motion reflects vortex geometry. In dimension four and higher, this
includes not only extrinsic but also intrinsic aspects of the vortex shape,
which enter via the first and second fundamental forms of classical geometry.
For hyper-spherical vortices, which generalize the vortex rings of three
dimensional superfluidity, the energy-momentum relation is determined. Simple
scaling arguments recover the essential features of these results, up to
numerical and logarithmic factors.
