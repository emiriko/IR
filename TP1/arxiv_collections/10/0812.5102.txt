We consider discrete nets in Grassmannians $\mathbb{G}^d_r$ which generalize
Q-nets (maps $\mathbb{Z}^N\to\mathbb{P}^d$ with planar elementary
quadrilaterals) and Darboux nets ($\mathbb{P}^d$-valued maps defined on the
edges of $\mathbb{Z}^N$ such that quadruples of points corresponding to
elementary squares are all collinear). We give a geometric proof of
integrability (multidimensional consistency) of these novel nets, and show that
they are analytically described by the noncommutative discrete Darboux system.
