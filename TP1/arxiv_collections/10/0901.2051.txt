From optical photometry we show that SDSSJ121258.25-012310.1 is a new
eclipsing, post common-envelope binary with an orbital period of 8.06 hours and
an eclipse length of 23 minutes. We observed the object over 11 nights in
different bands and determined the ephemeris of the eclipse to HJD_mid =
2454104. 7086(2) + 0.3358706(5) x E, where numbers in parenthesis indicate the
uncertainties in the last digit. The depth of the eclipse is 2.85 +/- 0.17 mag
in the V band, 1.82 +/- 0.08 mag in the R band and 0.52 +/- 0.02 mag in the I
band. From spectroscopic observations we measured the semi-amplitude of the
radial velocity K_2 = 181 +/- 3 km/s for the secondary star. The stellar and
binary parameters of the system were constrained from a) fitting the SDSS
composite spectrum of the binary, b) using a K-band luminosty-mass relation for
the secondary star, and c) from detailed analyses of the eclipse light curve.
The white dwarf has an effective temperature of 17700 +/- 300 K, and its
surface gravity is logg =7.53 +/- 0.2. We estimate that the spectral type of
the red dwarf is M4 +/- 1 and the distance to the system is 230 +/- 20 parsec.
The mass of the secondary star is estimated to be in the range Msec = 0.26-0.29
Msun, while the mass of the white dwarf is most likely Mwd = 0.46-0.48 Msun.
  From an empirical mass-radius relation we estimate the radius of the red
dwarf to be in the range 0.28-0.31 Rsun, whereas we get Rwd = 0.016-0.018 Rsun
from a theoretical mass-radius realation. Finally we discuss the spectral
energy distribution and the likely evolutionary state of SDSS1212-0123.
