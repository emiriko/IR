In this short position paper we briefly review the development history of
automated inductive theorem proving and computer-assisted mathematical
induction. We think that the current low expectations on progress in this field
result from a faulty narrow-scope historical projection. Our main motivation is
to explain--on an abstract but hopefully sufficiently descriptive level--why we
believe that future progress in the field is to result from human-orientedness
and descente infinie.
