We derive the thermal conductivities of one-dimensional harmonic and
anharmonic lattices with self-consistent heat baths (BRV lattice) from the
Single-Mode Relaxation Time (SMRT) approximation. For harmonic lattice, we
obtain the same result as previous works. However, our approach is heuristic
and reveals phonon picture explicitly within the heat transport process. The
results for harmonic and anharmonic lattices are compared with numerical
calculations from Green-Kubo formula. The consistency between derivation and
simulation strongly supports that effective (renormalized) phonons are energy
carriers in anharmonic lattices although there exist some other excitations
such as solitons and breathers.
