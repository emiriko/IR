The performance of a Si PIN diode (type Hamamatsu S3590-06) as an energy sen-
sitive detector operating at cryogenic temperatures (~10 K) and in magnetic
fields up to 11 T was investigated, using a 207Bi conversion electron source.
It was found that the detector still performs well under these conditions, with
small changes in the response function being observed in high magnetic fields,
e.g. a 30% to 50% decrease in energy resolution. A GEANT4 Monte Carlo
simulation showed that the observed effects are mainly due to the modified
trajectories of the electrons due to the influence of the magnetic field, which
changes the scattering conditions, rather than to intrinsic changes of the
performance of the detector itself.
