The transiting "hot Saturn" HD 149026b, which has the highest mean density of
any confirmed planet in the Neptune-Jupiter mass range, has challenged theories
of planet formation since its discovery in 2005. Previous investigations could
not explain the origin of the planet's 45-110 Earth-mass solid core without
invoking catastrophes such as gas giant collisions or heavy planetesimal
bombardment launched by neighboring planets. Here we show that HD 149026b's
large core can be successfully explained by the standard core accretion theory
of planet formation. The keys to our reconstruction of HD 149026b are (1)
applying a model of the solar nebula to describe the protoplanet nursery; (2)
placing the planet initially on a long-period orbit at Saturn's heliocentric
distance of 9.5 AU; and (3) adjusting the solid mass in the HD 149026 disk to
twice that of the solar nebula in accordance with the star's heavy element
enrichment. We show that the planet's migration into its current orbit at 0.042
AU is consistent with our formation model. Our study of HD 149026b demonstrates
that it is possible to discover the growth history of any planet with a
well-defined core mass that orbits a solar-type star.
