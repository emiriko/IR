A new numerical algorithm for solving the symmetric eigenvalue problem is
presented. The technique deviates fundamentally from the traditional Krylov
subspace iteration based techniques (Arnoldi and Lanczos algorithms) or other
Davidson-Jacobi techniques, and takes its inspiration from the contour
integration and density matrix representation in quantum mechanics. It will be
shown that this new algorithm - named FEAST - exhibits high efficiency,
robustness, accuracy and scalability on parallel architectures. Examples from
electronic structure calculations of Carbon nanotubes (CNT) are presented, and
numerical performances and capabilities are discussed.
