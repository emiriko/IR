Eukaryotic cells are often exposed to fluctuations in growth conditions as
well as endogenous and exogenous stress-related agents. In addition, during
development global patterns of gene transcription change dramatically, and
these changes are associated with altered patterns of DNA replication. In
metazoan embryos, for example, transcription is repressed globally and any
sequence in the genome can serve as a site for the start of DNA synthesis. As
transcription is activated and a G1 phase imposed, the pattern of replication
adapts to these changes by restricting the sites where DNA synthesis begins.
Recent evidence indicates that each unit of replication, or replicon, is
specified by two or more potential replication origins, but only one is
selected to initiate replication of the replicon. How the cell distinguishes
between potential origins, and how it selects a given origin of replication
remain unclear. This raises important questions concerning the nature and
definition of the eukaryotic replicon. In the following we will review emerging
evidence concerning the mechanisms involved in regulating replication origins
during both the normal and perturbed eukaryotic cell cycle.
