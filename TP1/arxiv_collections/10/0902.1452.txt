The Rayleigh--Taylor (RT) turbulence is investigated by means of high
resolution numerical simulations. The main question addressed here is on
whether RT phenomenology can be considered as a manifestation of universality
of Navier--Stokes equations with respect to forcing mechanisms. At a
theoretical level the situation is far from being firmly established and,
indeed, contrasting predictions have been formulated. Our first aim here is to
clarify the above controversy through a deep analysis of scaling behavior of
relevant statistical observables. The effects of intermittency on the mean
field scaling predictions is also discussed.
