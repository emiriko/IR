Spin excitations in an ordered Heisenberg magnet are magnons--bosons with
spin 1. That may change when frustration and quantum fluctuations suppress the
order and restore the spin-rotation symmetry. We show that spin excitations in
the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on kagome are spinons--fermions with
spin 1/2. In the ground state the system can be described as a collection of
small, heavy pairs of spinons with spin 0. A magnetic excitation of lowest
energy amounts to breaking up a pair into two spinons at a cost of $0.06 J$.
