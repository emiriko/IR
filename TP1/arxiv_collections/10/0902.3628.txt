For a real symmetric domain $G_{\mathbb R}/K_{\mathbb R}$, with
complexification $G_{\mathbb C}/K_{\mathbb C}$, we introduce the concept of
"star-restriction" (a real analogue of the "star-products" for quantization of
K\"ahler manifolds) and give a geometric construction of the $G_{\mathbb
R}$-invariant differential operators yielding its asymptotic expansion.
