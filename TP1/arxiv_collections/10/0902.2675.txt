We report on electrical measurements of the effective density of states in
the ferromagnetic semiconductor material (Ga,Mn)As. By analyzing the
conductivity correction due to enhanced electron-electron interaction the
electrical diffusion constant was extracted for (Ga,Mn)As samples of different
dimensionality. Using the Einstein relation allows to deduce the effective
density of states of (Ga,Mn)As at the Fermi energy.
