We prove the existence of a Hawking Killing vector-field in a full
neighborhood of a local, regular, bifurcate, non-expanding horizon embedded in
a smooth vacuum Einstein space-time. We do not assume analyticity of the
space-time. This result will be applied in a second paper to prove a
perturbative version of the uniqueness of smooth, stationary black holes in
vacuum.
