Motivated by many recent works (by L. Charles, V. Guillemin, T. Paul, J.
Sj\"ostrand, A. Uribe, S. Vu Ngoc, S. Zelditch and others) on the
semi-classical Birkhoff normal forms, we investigate the structure of the group
of automorphisms of the graded semi-classical Weyl algebra which is used to get
the normal forms. The answer is quite similar to the Theorem of Duistermaat and
Singer for the usual algebra of pseudo-differential operators where all
automorphisms are given by conjugation by an elliptic Fourier Integral Operator
(a FIO). Here what replaces general non-linear symplectic diffeomeorhisms is
just linear complex symplectic maps, because everything is localized at a
single point.
