A solution to the dark matter problem is set forth in the framework of
reductive semiclassical gravity, i.e., semiclassical gravity involving quantum
state reduction. In that theory, the Einstein equation includes the
energy-momentum tensor originating from pseudomatter and partially compensating
for quantum jumps of the matter energy-momentum tensor. The compensation
ensures the continuity of metric and of its first time derivative. Pseudomatter
is actualized as pseudodust and perceived as a dark matter. The necessity of
compensating for quantum jumps makes pseudomatter, i.e., dark matter of such a
form, an indispensable rather than ad hoc element of the theory. Applications:
The Schwarzschild solution with pseudomatter, pseudomatter halo, collapse
involving pseudomatter, pseudomatter in the FLRW universe.
