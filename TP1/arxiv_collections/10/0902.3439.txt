A new metric is introduced, inspired by the Hirsch {\it h-index}, to measure
the impact of a wiki site. A table of wikiFactors is presented for a number of
wikis, in particular those oriented towards scientific topics. The wikiFactor
is defined as the number of web pages, wF, that have had $\ge 1000$wF visits.
