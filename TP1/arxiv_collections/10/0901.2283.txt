Sharp threshold-like transitions between two stable nuclear spin
polarizations are observed in optically pumped individual InGaAs self-assembled
quantum dots embedded in a Schottky diode when the bias applied to the diode is
tuned. The abrupt transitions lead to the switching of the Overhauser field in
the dot by up to 3 Tesla. The bias-dependent photoluminescence measurements
reveal the importance of the electron-tunneling-assisted nuclear spin pumping.
We also find evidence for the resonant LO-phonon-mediated electron
co-tunneling, the effect controlled by the applied bias and leading to the
reduction of the nuclear spin pumping rate.
