The monitoring of quiescent emission from neutron star transients with
accretion outbursts long enough to significantly heat the neutron star crust
has opened a new vista onto the physics of dense matter. In this paper we
construct models of the thermal relaxation of the neutron star crust following
the end of a protracted accretion outburst. We confirm the finding of Shternin
et al., that the thermal conductivity of the neutron star crust is high,
consistent with a low impurity parameter. We describe the basic physics that
sets the broken power-law form of the cooling lightcurve. The initial power law
decay gives a direct measure of the temperature profile, and hence the thermal
flux during outburst, in the outer crust. The time of the break, at hundreds of
days post-outburst, corresponds to the thermal time where the solid transitions
from a classical to quantum crystal, close to neutron drip. We calculate in
detail the constraints on the crust parameters of both KS 1731-260 and MXB
1659-29 from fitting their cooling lightcurves. Our fits to the lightcurves
require that the neutrons do not contribute significantly to the heat capacity
in the inner crust, and provide evidence in favor of the existence of a neutron
superfluid throughout the inner crust. Our fits to both sources indicate an
impurity parameter of order unity in the inner crust.
