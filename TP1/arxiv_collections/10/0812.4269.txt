We give shorter proofs of the following known results: the radial Dunkl
process associated with a reduced system and a strictly positive multiplicity
function is the unique strong solution for all times of a stochastic
differential equation with a singular drift, the first hitting time of the Weyl
chamber by a radial Dunkl process is finite almost surely for small values of
the multiplicity function. Compared to the original proofs, ours give more
information on the behavior of the process. More precisely, the first proof
allows to give a positive answer to a conjecture announced by Gallardo and Yor
for the finiteness of the total length of the jumps performed by the Dunkl
process during a finite amount of time, while the second one shows that the
process hits almost surely the wall corresponding to the simple root with a
small multiplicity value. Further results on the jumps of the Dunkl process
(communicated by D. L\'epingle) and and additional references are included.
