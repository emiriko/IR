The production of two high-p_T jets in the interactions of quasi-real photons
in e+e- collisions at sqrt{s_ee} from 189 GeV to 209 GeV is studied with data
corresponding to an integrated e+e- luminosity of 550 pb^{-1}. The jets
reconstructed by the k_T cluster algorithm are defined within the
pseudo-rapidity range -1 < eta < 1 and with jet transverse momentum, p_T, above
3 GeV/c. The differential di-jet cross-section is measured as a function of the
mean transverse momentum ptmean of the jets and is compared to perturbative QCD
calculations.
