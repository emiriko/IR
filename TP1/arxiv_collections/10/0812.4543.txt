We have studied the muon neutrino and antineutrino quasi-elastic (QEL)
scattering reactions ($\nu_\mu n\to \mu^- p$ and $\bar{\nu}_\mu p\to \mu^+ n$)
using a set of experimental data collected by the NOMAD collaboration. We have
performed measurements of the cross-section of these processes on a nuclear
target (mainly Carbon) normalizing it to the total $\nu_\mu$ ($\bar{\nu}_\mu$)
charged current cross-section. The results for the flux averaged QEL
cross-sections in the (anti)neutrino energy interval 3-100 GeV are
$\sigma^{qel}_{\nu_\mu} = (0.92 \pm 0.02 (stat) \pm 0.06 (syst))\times 10^{-38}
\cm^2$ and $\sigma{qel}_{\bar{\nu}_\mu} = (0.81 \pm 0.05 (stat) \pm 0.08
(syst))\times 10^{-38} \cm^2$ for neutrino and antineutrino, respectively. The
axial mass parameter $M_A$ was extracted from the measured quasi-elastic
neutrino cross-section. The corresponding result is $M_A = 1.05 \pm 0.02 (stat)
\pm 0.06 (syst) GeV$. It is consistent with the axial mass values recalculated
from the antineutrino cross-section and extracted from the pure $Q^2$ shape
analysis of the high purity sample of $\nu_\mu$ quasi-elastic 2-track events,
but has smaller systematic error and should be quoted as the main result of
this work. Our measured $M_A$ is found to be in good agreement with the world
average value obtained in previous deuterium filled bubble chamber experiments.
The NOMAD measurement of $M_A$ is lower than those recently published by K2K
and MiniBooNE collaborations. However, within the large errors quoted by these
experiments on $M_A$, these results are compatible with the more precise NOMAD
value.
