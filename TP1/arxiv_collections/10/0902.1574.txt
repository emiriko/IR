We present a beam steering system based on micro-electromechanical systems
technology that features high speed steering of multiple laser beams over a
broad wavelength range. By utilizing high speed micromirrors with a broadband
metallic coating, our system has the flexibility to simultaneously incorporate
a wide range of wavelengths and multiple beams. We demonstrate reconfiguration
of two independent beams at different wavelengths (780 and 635 nm) across a
common 5x5 array with 4 us settling time. Full simulation of the optical system
provides insights on the scalability of the system. Such a system can provide a
versatile tool for applications where fast laser multiplexing is necessary.
