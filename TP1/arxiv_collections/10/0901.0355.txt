We address the issue of the effects of considering a network of contacts on
the emergence of cooperation on social dilemmas under myopic best response
dynamics. We begin by summarizing the main features observed under less
intellectually demanding dynamics, pointing out their most relevant general
characteristics. Subsequently we focus on the new framework of best response.
By means of an extensive numerical simulation program we show that, contrary to
the rest of dynamics considered so far, best response is largely unaffected by
the underlying network, which implies that, in most cases, no promotion of
cooperation is found with this dynamics. We do find, however, nontrivial
results differing from the well-mixed population in the case of coordination
games on lattices, which we explain in terms of the formation of spatial
clusters and the conditions for their advancement, subsequently discussing
their relevance to other networks.
