The aim of this work was to answer the question: Is the direct physical
realization of the Higgs mechanism possible? It is shown that this mechanism
cannot have a direct physical realization since the condition for this
realization is not fulfilled. It means that if in the new collider at CERN a
scalar particle is detected, it does not mean that it is a Higgs particle.
