We present several protocols for reliable quantum state transfer through a
spin chain. We use a simple two-spin encoding to achieve a remarkably high
fidelity transfer for an arbitrary quantum state. The fidelity of the transfer
also decreases very slowly with increasing chain length. We find that we can
also increase the reliability by taking advantage of a local memory and/or
confirm transfer using a second spin-chain.
