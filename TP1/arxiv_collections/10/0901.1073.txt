This report describes a method for the primary calibration of phase noise and
amplitude noise measurement systems.
  In the field of metrology, the term "primary" refers to a standard whose
quantity value and measurement uncertainty are established without relation to
another measurement standard for a quantity of the same kind; or to a procedure
used to realize the definition of a measurement unit and obtain the quantity
value and measurement uncertainty of a primary measurement standard.
Accordingly, a phase and a normalized amplitude have to rely on ratio
measurements.
