In a left-right gauge model of particle interactions, the left-handed fermion
doublet (nu,e)_L is connected to its right-handed counterpart (n,e)_R through a
scalar bidoublet so that e_L pairs with e_R, and nu_L with n_R to form mass
terms. Suppose the latter link is severed without affecting the former, then
n_R is not the mass partner of nu_L, and as we show in this paper, becomes a
candidate for dark matter which is relevant for the recent PAMELA and ATIC
observations. We accomplish this in a specific nonsupersymmetric model, where a
generalized lepton number can be defined, so that n_R and W_R are odd under R =
(-1)^{3B+L+2j}. Fermionic leptoquarks are also predicted.
