We study a resistively and capacitively shunted Josephson junction, which is
driven by a combination of time-periodic and constant currents. Our
investigations concern three main problems: (A) The voltage fluctuations across
the junction; (B) The quality of transport expressed in terms of the P\'eclet
number; (C) The efficiency of energy transduction from external currents. These
issues are discussed in different parameter regimes that lead to: (i) absolute
negative conductance; (ii) negative differential conductance, and (iii) normal,
Ohmic-like conductance. Conditions for optimal operation of the system are
studied.
