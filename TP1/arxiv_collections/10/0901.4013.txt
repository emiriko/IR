We revisit the WMAP dark matter constraints on Yukawa Unification in the
presence of massive neutrinos. The large lepton mixing indicated by the data
may modify the predictions for the bottom quark mass, enabling Yukawa
unification also for large $\tan\beta$, and for positive $\mu$ that was
previously disfavoured. As a result, the allowed parameter space for neutralino
dark matter increases for positive $\mu$, particularly for areas with resonant
enhancement of the neutralino relic density. On the contrary, a negative $\mu$
is not easily compatible with large lepton mixing and Dirac neutrino Yukawa
couplings, and the WMAP allowed parameter space is in this case strongly
constrained.
