The density of non-quasiparticle states in the ferrimagnetic full-Heuslers
Mn$_2$VAl alloy is calculated from first principles upon appropriate inclusion
of correlations. In contrast to most half-metallic compounds, this material
displays an energy gap in the majority-spin spectrum. For this situation,
non-quasiparticle states are located below the Fermi level, and should be
detectable by spin-polarized photoemission. This opens a new way to study
many-body effects in spintronic-related materials.
