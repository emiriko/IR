Glycerol and trehalose-glycerol binary solutions are glass-forming liquids
with remarkable bioprotectant properties. In this paper, we address the effects
of confining of these solutions in straight channels of diameter D=8 nm formed
by porous silicon. Neutron diffraction and incoherent quasielastic neutron
scattering are used to reveal the different effects of nanoconfinement and
addition of trehalose on the intermolecular structure and molecular dynamics of
the liquid and glassy phases, on a nanosecond timescale.
