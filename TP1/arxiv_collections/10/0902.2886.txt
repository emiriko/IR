The Dark Energy problem is forcing us to re-examine our models and our
understanding of relativity and space-time. The Standard Model of particle
physics and its extensions are already in crisis. Having failed so far to
include gravity in a proper unified framework, these are now faced with an
additional unwanted fifth force of repulsion. How does one understand this
3+1+1 fundamental force dilemma? Quite clearly this points to a limitation of
our present understanding and demands extension of our theoretical framework.
To be able to go beyond these limitations, here we introduce a novel idea of
the Fundamental Forces. This allows us to perceive the General Theory of
Relativity and Einstein's Equation from a different perspective. This will give
us an additional and an all-encompassing way of classifying these five
fundamental forces in a consistent manner. In addition to providing us with an
improved understanding of space and time, it will be shown how it leads to a
resolution of the Dark Energy problem.
