In this paper, we study the effects of introducing contrarians in a model of
Opinion Dynamics where the agents have internal continuous opinions, but
exchange information only about a binary choice that is a function of their
continuous opinion, the CODA model. We observe that the hung election scenario
still exists here, but it is weaker and it shouldn't be expected in every
election. Finally, we also show that the introduction of contrarians make the
tendency towards extremism of the original model weaker, indicating that the
existence of agents that prefer to disagree might be an important aspect and
help society to diminish extremist opinions.
