In this paper we consider tandem error control coding and cryptography in the
setting of the {\em wiretap channel} due to Wyner. In a typical communications
system a cryptographic application is run at a layer above the physical layer
and assumes the channel is error free. However, in any real application the
channels for friendly users and passive eavesdroppers are not error free and
Wyner's wiretap model addresses this scenario. Using this model, we show the
security of a common cryptographic primitive, i.e. a keystream generator based
on linear feedback shift registers (LFSR), can be strengthened by exploiting
properties of the physical layer. A passive eavesdropper can be made to
experience greater difficulty in cracking an LFSR-based cryptographic system
insomuch that the computational complexity of discovering the secret key
increases by orders of magnitude, or is altogether infeasible. This result is
shown for two fast correlation attacks originally presented by Meier and
Staffelbach, in the context of channel errors due to the wiretap channel model.
