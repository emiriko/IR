The recent discovery of "dark energy" has challenged Einstein's general
theory of relativity as a complete model for our macroscopic universe. From a
theoretical view, the challenge is even stronger: general relativity clearly
does not extend to the very small, where quantum mechanics holds sway.
Fundamental physics models thus require some major revisions. We must explore
deeper to both constrain and inspire this needed new physics. In the realm of
the solar-system, we can effectively probe for small deviations from the
predictions of general relativity: Technology now offers a wide range of
opportunities to pursue experiments with accuracies orders of magnitude better
than yet achieved. We describe both the relevant theoretical backgrounds and
the opportunities for far more accurate solar system experiments.
