Given any global field k of characteristic 2, we construct a Chatelet surface
over k which fails to satisfy the Hasse principle. This failure is due to a
Brauer-Manin obstruction. This construction extends a result of Poonen to
characteristic 2, thereby showing that the etale-Brauer obstruction is
insufficient to explain all failures of the Hasse principle over a global field
of any characteristic.
