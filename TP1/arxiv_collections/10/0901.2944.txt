We investigate thermodynamic geometries of two families of asymptotically
Anti-de Sitter black holes, i.e. the Reissner-Nordstr\"om Anti-de Sitter in
four dimensions and the BTZ black hole. It is found that the Anti-de Sitter
space renders the geometry nontrivial (c.f. the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole
in asymptotically flat background). The BTZ black hole's thermodynamic geometry
is trivial despite the fact that it is characterized by the (negative)
cosmological constant. As a matter of curiosity we compute thermodynamic
geometry of these black holes regarding the cosmological constant as a true
parameter but no physically significant results can be derived.
