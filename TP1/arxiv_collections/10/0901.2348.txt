We calculate the normal state Nernst signal in the cuprates resulting from a
reconstruction of the Fermi surface due to spin density wave order. An order
parameter consistent with the reconstruction of the Fermi surface detected in
electron-doped materials is shown to sharply enhance the Nernst signal close to
optimal doping. Within a semiclassical treatment, the obtained magnitude and
position of the enhanced Nernst signal agrees with Nernst measurements in
electron-doped cuprates.
