We discuss the production of heavy colored paricles at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) through gluon-gluon fusion process. A factorization theorem is
obtained for this process using Soft Collinear Effective Theory. Our
factorization theorem does not depend on any assumptions regarding the physics
above the mass of the heavy colored particle. In this sense it is universal.
The matching coefficient at the heavy particle mass scale depends however on
the unkown physics above that scale and thus it is model dependent.
  Due to the large mass of the heavy colored particle, i.e., the hard scale and
near the partonic kinematic threshold for production of such particles a
resummation of large logarithms needs to be performed. The resummation is
justified due to the dominance of the gluon distribution function at small $x$.
For phenomenological purposes we utilize the Manohar-Wise model.
