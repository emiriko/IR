We propose to model the dissipative hydrodynamics used in description of the
multiparticle production processes ($d$-hydrodynamics) by a special kind of the
perfect nonextensive fluid ($q$-fluid) where $q$ denotes the nonextensivity
parameter appearing in the nonextensive Tsallis statistics. The advantage of
$q$-hydrodynamics lies in its formal simplicity in comparison to the
$d$-hydrodynamics. We argue that parameter $q$ describes summarily (at least to
some extent) all dynamical effects behind the viscous behavior of the hadronic
fluid.
