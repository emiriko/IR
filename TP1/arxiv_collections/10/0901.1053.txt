In this paper we propose an explicit two-level conservative scheme based on a
TE/TM like splitting of the field components in time. Its dispersion properties
are adjusted to accelerator problems. It is simpler and faster than the
implicit version [1]. It does not have dispersion in the longitudinal direction
and the dispersion properties in the transversal plane are improved. The
explicit character of the new scheme allows a uniformly stable conformal method
without iterations and the scheme can be parallelized easily. It assures energy
and charge conservation. A version of this explicit scheme for rotationally
symmetric structures is free from the progressive time step reducing for higher
order azimuthal modes as it takes place for Yee's explicit method used in the
most popular electrodynamics codes.
