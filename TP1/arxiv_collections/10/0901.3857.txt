Twisting transformations for the heat operator are introduced. They are used,
at the same time, to superimpose a` la Darboux N solitons to a generic smooth,
decaying at infinity, potential and to generate the corresponding Jost
solutions. These twisting operators are also used to study the existence of the
related extended resolvent. Existence and uniqueness of the extended resolvent
in the case of $N$ solitons with N "ingoing" rays and one "outgoing" ray is
studied in details.
