The radiative and leptonic decays of $\eta_c\to \gamma\gamma$ and $\eta_c\to
l^+l^-$ are studied. For $\eta_c\to \gamma\gamma$ decay, the second-order
electromagnetic tree-level diagram gives the leading contribution. The decay
rate of $\eta_c\to \gamma\gamma$ is calculated, the prediction is in good
agreement with the experimental data. For $\eta_c\to l^+\l^-$, both the tree
and loop diagrams are calculated. The analysis shows that the loop contribution
dominates, the contribution of tree diagram with $Z^0$ intermediate state can
only modifies the decay rate by less than 1%. The prediction of the branching
ratios of $\eta_c\to e^+e^-$ and $\mu^+\mu^-$ are very tiny within the standard
model. The smallness of these predictions within the standard model makes the
leptonic decays of $\eta_c$ sensitive to physics beyond the standard model.
Measurement of the leptonic decay may give information of new physics.
