We constrain the number density and evolution of Compton-thick Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN). In the local Universe we use the wide area surveys from
the Swift and INTEGRAL satellites, while for high redshifts we explore
candidate selections based on a combination of X-ray and mid-IR parameters. We
find a significantly lower space density of Compton-thick AGN in the local
Universe than expected from published AGN population synthesis models to
explain the X-ray background. This can be explained by the numerous
degeneracies in the parameters of those models; we use the high-energy surveys
described here to remove those degeneracies. We show that only direct
observations of CT AGN can currently constrain the number of heavily-obscured
supermassive black holes. At high redshift, the inclusion of IR-selected
Compton-thick AGN candidates leads to a much higher space density, implying (a)
a different (steeper) evolution for these sources compared to less-obscured
AGN, (b) that the IR selection includes a large number of interlopers, and/or
(c) that there is a large number of reflection-dominated AGN missed in the
INTEGRAL and Swift observations. The contribution of CT AGN to the X-ray
background is small, ~9%, with a comparable contribution to the total cosmic
accretion, unless reflection-dominated CT AGN significantly outnumber
transmission-dominated CT AGN, in which case their contribution can be much
higher. Using estimates derived here for the accretion luminosity over cosmic
time we estimate the local mass density in supermassive black holes and find a
good agreement with available constraints for an accretion efficiency of ~10%.
Transmission-dominated CT AGN contribute only ~8% to total black hole growth.
