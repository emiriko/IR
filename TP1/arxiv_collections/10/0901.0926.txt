It has been shown that the combining of the electrical effect on the exchange
bias field with giant magneto-resistance effect of the graphene/ferromagnet
hybrid structures reveals a new non-volatile magnetic random access memory
device conception. In such device an electric bias realizes the writing bits
instead a magnetic field of remote word line with high energy consumption.
Interplay of two graphene mediated exchange bias fields applied to different
sides of free ferromagnet results in programable logic operations that depends
on specific realization of the structure.
