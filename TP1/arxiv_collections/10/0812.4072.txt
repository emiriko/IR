We show that an electrostatic qubit located near a Bose-Einstein condensate
trapped in a symmetric double-well potential can be used to measure the
duration the qubit has spent in one of its quantum states. The stronq, medium
and weak measurement regimes are analysed and a new type of Zeno effect is
discussed. The analogy between the residence and the traversal (tunnelling)
times is highlighted.
