A microscopic nuclear level-density model is presented. The model is a
completely combinatorial (micro-canonical) model based on the folded-Yukawa
single-particle potential and includes explicit treatment of pairing,
rotational and vibrational states. The microscopic character of all states
enables extraction of level distribution functions with respect to pairing
gaps, parity and angular momentum. The results of the model are compared to
available experimental data: neutron separation energy level spacings, data on
total level-density functions from the Oslo method, cumulative level densities
from low-lying discrete states, and data on parity ratios.
