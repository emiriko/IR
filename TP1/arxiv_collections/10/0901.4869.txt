Alignment of the ILC main linac will be more critical than for any currently
existing accelerators due to its long length and the ultra low emittance
required. There are several techniques for measuring the ILC reference network;
in this report conventional methods for measuring the network and aligning the
main linac are simulated. Dispersion Matched Steering (DMS) is applied to the
simulated accelerators to determine their final emittance. Simulations and
reconstructions of the ILC reference network usually require very resource
intensive programs, the RTRSM has been developed to rapidly generate networks
with the required statistical properties. The RTRSM is discussed in this report
and some problems are demonstrated.
