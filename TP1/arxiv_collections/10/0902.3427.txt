Positive exchange bias has been observed in the
Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$/Ir$_{20}$Mn$_{80}$ bilayer system via soft x-ray resonant
magnetic scattering. After field cooling of the system through the blocking
temperature of the antiferromagnet, an initial conventional negative exchange
bias is removed after training i. e. successive magnetization reversals,
resulting in a positive exchange bias for a temperature range down to 30 K
below the blocking temperature (450 K). This new manifestation of magnetic
training is discussed in terms of metastable magnetic disorder at the
magnetically frustrated interface during magnetization reversal.
