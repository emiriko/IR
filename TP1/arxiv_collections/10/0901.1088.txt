I outline the basic strategies for the computation of charm and bottom quark
masses by means of lattice QCD, where particular emphasis is placed on the
non-perturbative renormalization of the effective theory for the b-quark in
heavy-light systems. A few selected results in the quenched approximation are
reviewed, and the current status of extending these calculations to QCD with
dynamical quarks is summarized.
