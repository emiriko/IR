This paper presents how photonics associated with new arising detection
technologies is able to provide fully integrated instrument for coherent beam
combination applied to astrophysical interferometry. The feasibility and
operation of on-chip coherent beam combiners has been already demonstrated
using various interferometric combination schemes. More recently we proposed a
new detection principle aimed at directly sampling and extracting the spectral
information of an input signal together with its flux level measurement. The
so-called SWIFTS demonstrated concept that stands for Stationary-Wave
Integrated Fourier Transform Spectrometer, provides full spectral and spatial
information recorded simultaneously thanks to a motionless detecting device.
  Due to some newly available detection principles considered for the
implementation of the SWIFTS concept, some technologies can even provide
photo-counting operation that brought a significant extension of the
interferometry domain of investigation in astrophysics . The proposed concept
is applicable to most of the interferometric instrumental modes including
fringe tracking, fast and sensitive detection, Fourier spectral reconstruction
and also to manage a large number of incoming beams. The paper presents three
practical implementations, two dealing with pair-wise integrated optics beam
combinations and the third one with an all-in-one 8 beam combination. In all
cases the principles turned into a pair wise baseline coding after proper data
processing.
