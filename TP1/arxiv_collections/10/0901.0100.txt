In Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 170502 (2007) (arXiv:quant-ph/0703227), we prove that
resonating-valence-bond (RVB) states on arbitrary lattices possess genuine
multiparty entanglement, and provide bounds on two-particle entanglement (and
correlators). We also conjecture on the entanglement in large and small
portions of the whole lattice. The proof, bound, and conjecture are not
considered in the Comment in Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 248901 (2008)
(arXiv:0812.1932v1 [quant-ph]).
  Next we take two examples: "RVB gas" and "RVB liquid". RVB liquid for
arbitrary lattice size is not considered in the Comment. Two-party entanglement
of RVB gas for relatively large lattice size is derived by an independent
method in the Comment, and it agrees with our result. Multi-party entanglement
of RVB gas is not considered in the Comment.
  Lastly, we consider an RVB liquid on a 4x4 square lattice and there was an
error in the calculation of two-party entanglement in the second decimal place,
as noted in the Comment. Note that this calculation was nowhere used in our
Letter to derive other results. Moreover, the conclusion of "no two-particle
entanglement" is still true for the RVB liquid on a 4x4 square lattice.
