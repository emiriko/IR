We have manufactured more than 250 nominally identical paraffin-coated Cs
vapor cells (30 mm diameter bulbs) for multi-channel atomic magnetometer
applications. We describe our dedicated cell characterization apparatus. For
each cell we have determined the intrinsic longitudinal, $\sGamma{01}$, and
transverse, $\sGamma{02}$, relaxation rates. Our best cell shows
$\sGamma{01}/2\pi\approx 0.5 Hz, and $\sGamma{02}/2\pi\approx 2 Hz. We find a
strong correlation of both relaxation rates which we explain in terms of
reservoir and spin exchange relaxation. For each cell we have determined the
optimal combination of rf and laser powers which yield the highest sensitivity
to magnetic field changes. Out of all produced cells, 90% are found to have
magnetometric sensitivities in the range of 9 to 30 fTHz. Noise analysis shows
that the magnetometers operated with such cells have a sensitivity close to the
fundamental photon shot noise limit.
