The discovery of the new class of pnictide superconductors has engendered a
controversy about their pairing symmetry, with proposals ranging from an
extended s-wave or "s$_{\pm}$" symmetry to nodal or nodeless d-wave symmetry to
still more exotic order parameters such as p-wave. In this paper, building on
the earlier, similar work performed for the cuprates, we propose several
phase-sensitive Josephson interferometry experiments, each of which may allow
resolution of the issue.
