We consider the model for the distribution of a long homopolymer in a
potential field. The typical shape of the polymer depends on the temperature
parameter. We show that at a critical value of the temperature the transition
occurs from a globular to an extended phase. For various values of the
temperature, including those at or near the critical value, we consider the
limiting behavior of the polymer when its size tends to infinity.
