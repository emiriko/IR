A problem with an instructive description of measurement process for
sufficiently separated entangled quantum systems is well known. More precise
and crafty experiments together with new technological challenges raise
questions about sufficiency of formal use of "black-box" Copenhagen paradigm
without subtleties of transition between quantum and classical worlds. In this
work are discussed applications both standard interpretation of quantum
mechanics and "unconventional" models, like relative state formulation,
multiple clocks formalism, and extended probabilities.
