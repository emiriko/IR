The quest to know the structure of matter has resulted in various theoretical
speculations wherein additional colored fermions are postulated. Arising either
as Kaluza-Klein excitations of ordinary quarks, or as excited states in
scenarios wherein the quarks themselves are composites, or even in theories
with extended gauge symmetry, the presence of such fermions ($q^*$) can
potentially be manifested in $\gamma + jet$ final states at the LHC. Using
unitarized amplitudes and the CMS setup, we demonstrate that in the initial
phase of LHC operation (with an integrated luminosity of $200 \pb^{-1}$) one
can discover such states for a mass upto 2.0 TeV. The discovery of a $q^*$ with
a mass as large as $\sim$5 TeV can be acheived for an integrated luminosity of
$\sim 140 \fb^{-1}$. We also comment on the feasibility of mass determination.
