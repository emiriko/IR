We study noise and noise energy of a high-T$_c$ dc SQUID fabricated on a
high-$\epsilon_R$ substrate whose conduction properties are given by
transmission line physics. We show that transmission line resonances greatly
enhance the noise. Remarkably, resistance asymmetry enhances these resonances
even more. However, as the transfer function scales the same way, the noise
energy is reduced by asymmetry greatly enhancing the flexibility and
performance of the SQUID.
