We consider spin-polarized electrons in a single Landau level on a cylinder
as the circumference of the cylinder goes to infinity. This gives a model of
interacting electrons on a circle where the momenta of the particles are
restricted and there is no kinetic energy. Quantum Hall states are exact ground
states for appropriate short range interactions, and there is a gap to
excitations. These states develop adiabatically from this one-dimensional
quantum Hall circle to the bulk quantum Hall states and further on into the
Tao-Thouless states as the circumference goes to zero. For low filling
fractions a gapless state is formed which we suggest is connected to the Wigner
crystal expected in the bulk.
