We propose an information theoretic framework for the secure two-party
function computation (SFC) problem and introduce the notion of SFC capacity. We
study and extend string oblivious transfer (OT) to sample-wise OT. We propose
an efficient, perfectly private OT protocol utilizing the binary erasure
channel or source. We also propose the bootstrap string OT protocol which
provides disjoint (weakened) privacy while achieving a multiplicative increase
in rate, thus trading off security for rate. Finally, leveraging our OT
protocol, we construct a protocol for SFC and establish a general lower bound
on SFC capacity of the binary erasure channel and source.
