We present a unified approach to the study of Radon transforms related to
symmetric groups and to general linear groups GL(n,q) regarded as q-analogues
of the former. In both cases, we define a sequence of generalized Radon
transforms which are intertwining operators for natural representations
associated to Gel'fand spaces for our groups. This sequence enables us to
decompose in a recursive way these natural representations and to compute
explicitly the associated spherical functions. Our methods and results are
related by q-analogy.
