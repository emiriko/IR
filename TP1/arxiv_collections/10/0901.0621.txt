We investigate an effective low energy theory of HgTe quantum wells near
their mass inversion thickness in a perpendicular magnetic field. By comparison
of the effective band structure with a more elaborated and well-established
model, the parameter regime and the validity of the effective model is
scrutinized. Optical transitions in HgTe quantum wells are analyzed. We find
selection rules which we functionalize to optically manipulate edge state
transport. Qualitatively, our findings equally apply to optical edge current
manipulation in graphene.
