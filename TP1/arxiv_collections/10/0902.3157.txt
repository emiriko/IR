Microstrip transducers used for the excitation of spin waves in magnetic
films possess two characteristic properties: high spatial localization of the
microwave magnetic field and the presence of field components parallel and
perpendicular to the bias field.
  Here, the effects of these features on the process of parametric pumping are
presented. By microwave measurements of the spin-wave instability threshold a
transition from parallel pumping to perpendicular pumping at the critical field
$H_{\rm c}$ with the minimal threshold is observed. This transition is
accompanied by a sharp threshold increase above the critical field due to the
spatial confinement of the pump region.
