We compute the spectral measure of the standard generators $u_{ij}$ of the
Wang algebra $A_o(n)$. We show in particular that this measure has support
$[-2/\sqrt{n+2},2/\sqrt{n+2}]$, and that it has no atoms. The computation is
done by using various techniques, involving the general Wang algebra $A_o(F)$,
a representation of $SU^q_2$ due to Woronowicz, and several calculations with
orthogonal polynomials.
