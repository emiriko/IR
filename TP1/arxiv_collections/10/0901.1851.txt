The presence of oligomeric aggregates, which is often observed during the
process of amyloid formation, has recently attracted much attention since it
has been associated with neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and
Parkinson's diseases. We provide a description of a sequence-indepedent
mechanism by which polypeptide chains aggregate by forming metastable
oligomeric intermediate states prior to converting into fibrillar structures.
Our results illustrate how the formation of ordered arrays of hydrogen bonds
drives the formation of beta-sheets within the disordered oligomeric aggregates
that form early under the effect of hydrophobic forces. Initially individual
beta-sheets form with random orientations, which subsequently tend to align
into protofilaments as their lengths increases. Our results suggest that
amyloid aggregation represents an example of the Ostwald step rule of first
order phase transitions by showing that ordered cross-beta structures emerge
preferentially from disordered compact dynamical intermediate assemblies.
