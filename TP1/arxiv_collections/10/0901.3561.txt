The nucleon final-state interaction in inclusive electron-nucleus
quasielastic scattering is studied. Based on the unitarity equation satisfied
by the scattering-wave operators, a doorway model is developed to take into
account the final-state interaction including the Pauli blocking of nucleon
knockout. The model uses only experimental form factors as the input and can be
readily applied to light- and medium-mass nuclei. Pauli blocking effects in
these latter nuclei are illustrated with the case of the Coulomb interaction.
Significant effects are noted for beam energies below ~ 350 MeV and for low
momentum transfers.
