The giant transmission of light through a metallic nano-slit surrounded by
periodic grooves on the input surface is revisited theoretically. It is shown
that the influence to the transmission comes from three parts: the
groove-generated surface plasmon wave (SPW), the nano-slit-generated SPW and
the incident wave. The groove-generated SPW is the main factor determining the
local field distribution around the nano-slit opening, which is directly
related to the transmission through the nano-slit. The nano-slit-generated SPW
can be considered as a disturbance to the light distribution on the input
surface. The influence of the incident wave can be strongly reduced when strong
surface plasmon wave is generated on the input surface by many periods of deep
grooves. Our study shows that the slit-to-groove distance for a maximal
transmission through the nano-slit surrounded with periodic grooves can not be
predicted by several previous theories, including the magnetic field phase
theory of a recent work (Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 043902, 2007). A clear physical
explanation is given for the dependence of the transmission on the
slit-to-groove distance.
