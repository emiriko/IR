We study Minkowski supersymmetric flux vacua of type II string theory. Based
on the work by M. Grana, R. Minasian, M. Petrini and A. Tomasiello, we briefly
explain how to reformulate things in terms of Generalized Complex Geometry,
which appears to be a natural framework for these compactifications. In
particular, it provides a mathematical characterization of the internal
manifold, and one is then able to find new solutions, which cannot be
constructed as usual via T-dualities from a warped T^6 solution. Furthermore,
we discuss how, thanks to a specific change of variables, one can ease the
resolution of the orientifold projection constraints pointed out by P. Koerber
and D. Tsimpis. One is then able to find new solutions with intermediate SU(2)
structure.
