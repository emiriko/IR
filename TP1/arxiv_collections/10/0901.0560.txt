Rotational motion of heated 72-Ge is studied within the microscopic Shell
Model Monte Carlo approach. We investigate the the angular momentum alignment
and nuclear pairing correlations associated with J-pi Cooper pairs as a
function of the rotational frequency and temperature. The reentrance of pairing
correlations with temperature is predicted at high rotational frequencies. It
manifests itself through the anomalous behavior of specific heat and level
density.
