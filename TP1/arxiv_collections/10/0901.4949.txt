The problem of kinematic effects in the gluon and color dipole cascades is
addressed in the large N_c limit of SU(N_c) Yang--Mills theory. We investigate
the tree level multi-gluon components of the gluon light cone wave functions in
the light cone gauge keeping the exact kinematics of the gluon emissions. We
focus on the components with all helicities identical to the helicity of the
incoming gluon. The recurrence relations for the gluon wave functions are
derived. In the case when the virtuality of the incoming gluon is neglected the
exact form of the multi-gluon wave function is obtained. Furthermore, we
propose an approximate scheme to treat the kinematic effects in the color
dipole evolution kernel. The new kernel entangles longitudinal and transverse
degrees of freedom and leads to a reduced diffusion in the impact parameter.
When evaluated in the next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy, the kernel
reproduces the correct form of the double logarithmic terms of the dipole size
ratios present in the exact NLL dipole kernel. Finally, we analyze the
scattering of the incoming gluon light cone components off a gluon target and
the fragmentation of the scattered state into the final state. The equivalence
of the resulting amplitudes and the maximally-helicity-violating amplitudes is
demonstrated in the special case when the target gluon is far in rapidity from
the evolved gluon wave function.
