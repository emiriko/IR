Spatial correlation characteristics of the anomalous density matrix $\kappa$
in a slab of nuclear matter with the Paris and Argonne v18 forces are
calculated. A detailed comparison with predictions of the effective Gogny force
is made. It is found that the two realistic forces lead to very close results
which are qualitatively similar to those for the Gogny force. At the same time,
the magnitude of $\kappa$ for realistic forces is essentially smaller than the
one for the Gogny force. The correlation characteristics are practically
independent of the magnitude of $\kappa$ and turn out to be quite close for the
three kinds of the force. In particular, all of them predict a small value of
the local correlation length at the surface of the slab and a big one, inside.
These results are in agreement with those obtained recently by Pillet at al.
for finite nuclei with the Gogny force.
