Constituting a part of odd electrons that are excluded from the covalent
bonding, effectively unpaired electrons are posed by the singlet instability of
the single-determinant broken spin-symmetry unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UBS HF)
SCF solution. A correct determination of the total number of effectively
unpaired electrons ND and its fraction on each atom NDA is well provided by the
UBS HF solution. The NDA value is offered to be a quantifier of atomic chemical
susceptibility (or equivalently, reactivity) thus highlighting targets that are
the most favorable for addition reactions of any type. The approach is
illustrated for two families involving fragments of arm-chair (n,n) and zigzag
(m,0) single-walled nanotubes differing by length and end structure. Short and
long tubes as well as tubes with capped end and open end, in the latter case,
both hydrogen terminated and empty, are considered. Algorithms of the
quantitative description of any length tubes are suggested.
