We propose quantum stirring with a laser beam as a probe of superfluid
behavior for a strongly interacting one-dimensional Bose gas confined to a
ring. Within the Luttinger liquid theory framework, we calculate the fraction
of stirred particles per period as a function of the stirring velocity, the
interaction strength and the coupling between the stirring beam and the bosons.
The fraction of stirred particles allows to probe superfluidity of the system.
We find that it crosses over at a critical velocity, lower than the sound one,
from a characteristic power law at high velocities to a constant at low
velocities. Some experimental issues on quantum stirring in ring-trapped
condensates are discussed.
