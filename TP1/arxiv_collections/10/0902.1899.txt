We study a one dimensional gas of needle-like objects as a testing ground for
a formalism that relates the thermodynamic properties of "hard" potentials to
the probabilities for contacts between particles. Specifically, we use Monte
Carlo methods to calculate the pressure and elasticity coefficient of the
hard-needle gas as a function of its density. The results are then compared to
the same quantities obtained analytically from a transfer matrix approach.
