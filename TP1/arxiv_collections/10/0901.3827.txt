We study a perfect fluid Bianchi II models with time varying constants under
the self-similarity approach. In the first of the studied model, we consider
that only vary $G$ and $\Lambda.$ The obtained solution is more general that
the obtained one for the classical solution since it is valid for an equation
of state $\omega\in(-1,\infty) $ while in the classical solution
$\omega\in(-1/3,1) .$ Taking into account the current observations, we conclude
that $G$ must be a growing time function while $\Lambda$ is a positive
decreasing function. In the second of the studied models we consider a variable
speed of light (VSL). We obtain a similar solution as in the first model
arriving to the conclusions that $c$ must be a growing time function if
$\Lambda$ is a positive decreasing function.
