A new delay equation is introduced to describe the punctuated evolution of
complex nonlinear systems. A detailed analytical and numerical investigation
provides the classification of all possible types of solutions for the dynamics
of a population in the four main regimes dominated respectively by: (i) gain
and competition, (ii) gain and cooperation, (iii) loss and competition and (iv)
loss and cooperation. Our delay equation may exhibit bistability in some
parameter range, as well as a rich set of regimes, including monotonic decay to
zero, smooth exponential growth, punctuated unlimited growth, punctuated growth
or alternation to a stationary level, oscillatory approach to a stationary
level, sustainable oscillations, finite-time singularities as well as
finite-time death.
