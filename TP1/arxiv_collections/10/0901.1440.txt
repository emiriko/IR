In quantum field theory in curved spacetimes the construction of the algebra
of observables of linear fields is today well understood. However, it remains a
non-trivial task to construct physically meaningful states on the algebra. For
instance, we are in the unsatisfactory situation that there exist no examples
of states suited to describe local thermal equilibrium in a non-stationary
spacetime. In this thesis, we construct a class of states for the Klein-Gordon
field in Robertson-Walker spacetimes, which seem to provide the first example
of thermal states in a spacetime without time translation symmetry. More
precisely, in the setting of real, linear, scalar fields in Robertson-Walker
spacetimes we define on the set of homogeneous, isotropic, quasi-free states a
free energy functional that is based on the averaged energy density measured by
an isotropic observer along his worldline. This functional is well defined and
lower bounded by a suitable quantum energy inequality. Subsequently, we
minimize this functional and obtain states that we interpret as 'almost
equilibrium states'. It turns out that the states of low energy, which were
recently introduced by Olbermann, are the ground states of the almost
equilibrium states. Finally, we prove that the almost equilibrium states
satisfy the Hadamard condition, which qualifies them as physically meaningful
states.
