We have studied electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in diatomic
cesium molecules in a vapor cell by using tunable diode lasers. We have
observed a sub-natural Lambda-resonance in an absorption molecular band at
different cesium vapor pressures. The width of the EIT resonance shows a linear
dependence on cesium vapor pressure. Narrow Lambda-resonances in molecules can
be used as frequency references for femtosecond laser frequency combs.
