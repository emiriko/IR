The mathematical content of the interaction term of quantum electrodynamics
is examined under the following assumption: It is presumed that the apparent
degrees-of-freedom of the photon field reflect the kinematical
degrees-of-freedom of the two-particle state space of massive fermions, rather
than independent degrees-of-freedom of the photon field. This assumption is
verified by reproducing the numerical value of the fine-structure constant.
