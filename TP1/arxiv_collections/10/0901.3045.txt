We have investigated electronic cooling of suspended nanowires with SINIS
tunnel junction coolers. The suspended samples consist of a free standing
nanowire suspended by four narrow ($\sim$ 200 nm) bridges. We have compared two
different cooler designs for cooling the suspended nanowire. We demonstrate
that cooling of the nanowire is possible with a proper SINIS cooler design.
