We present a self-consistent calculation of the interlayer asymmetry in
bilayer graphene caused by an applied electric field in magnetic fields. We
show how this asymmetry influences the Landau level spectrum in bilayer
graphene and the observable inter-Landau level transitions when they are
studied as a function of high magnetic field at fixed filling factor as
measured experimentally by E.A. Henriksen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 100 (2008),
087403. We also analyze the magneto-optical spectra of bilayer flakes in the
photon-energy range corresponding to transitions between degenerate and split
bands of bilayers.
