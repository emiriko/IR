We measure the complex scattering amplitudes of a flat microwave cavity (a
"chaotic billiard"). Time-reversal T-invariance is partially broken by a
magnetized ferrite placed within the cavity. We extend the random-matrix
approach to T-violation in scattering, fit some of the properties of the
scattering amplitudes, and then successfully predict others. Our work
constitutes the most precise test of the theoretical approach to T-violation
within the framework of random-matrix theory so far available.
