Obtaining ultracold samples of dipolar molecules is a current challenge which
requires an accurate knowledge of their electronic properties to guide the
ongoing experiments. Alkali hydride molecules have permanent dipole
significantly larger than those of mixed alkali species and, as pointed out by
Taylor-Juarros et al. [Eur. Phys. J. D 31, 213 (2004)] and by Juarros et al.
[Phys. Rev. A 73, 041403 (2006)], are thus good candidates for molecule
formation. In this paper, using a standard quantum chemistry approach based on
pseudopotentials for atomic core representation, large Gaussian basis sets, and
effective core polarization potential, we systematically investigate the
electronic properties of the alkali hydrides LiH to CsH, in order to discuss
general trends of their behavior. We computed (for the first time for NaH, KH,
RbH, and CsH) the variation of their static polarizability with the
internuclear distance. Moreover, in addition to potential curves, we determine
accurate values of permanent and transition dipole moments for ground and
excited states depending on the internuclear distance. The behavior of
electronic properties of all alkali hydrides is compared to each other, in the
light of the numerous other data available in the literature. Finally, the
influence of the quality of the representation of the hydrogen electronic
affinity in the approach on the results is discussed.
