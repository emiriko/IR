We propose a flexible statistical model for high-dimensional quantitative
data on a hypercube. Our model, called the structural gradient model (SGM), is
based on a one-to-one map on the hypercube that is a solution for an optimal
transport problem. As we show with many examples, SGM can describe various
dependence structures including correlation and heteroscedasticity. The maximum
likelihood estimation of SGM is effectively solved by the
determinant-maximization programming. In particular, a lasso-type estimation is
available by adding constraints. SGM is compared with graphical Gaussian models
and mixture models.
