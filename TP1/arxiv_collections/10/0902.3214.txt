We investigate in detail the focusing of a circularly polarized
Laguerre-Gaussian laser beam ($\hbar \ell$ orbital angular momentum per photon;
$\sigma=1/-1$ for left/right-handed polarization) by a high numerical aperture
objective. The diffraction-limited focused beam has unexpected properties,
resulting from a strong interplay between the angular spatial structure and the
local polarization in the non-paraxial regime. In the region near the beam
axis, and provided that $|\ell|\ge 2$ and $\ell$ and $\sigma$ have opposite
signs, the energy locally counter-propagates and the projection of the electric
field onto the focal plane counter-rotates with respect to the circular
polarization of the incident beam. We explicitly show that the total angular
momentum flux per unit power is conserved after focusing, as expected by
rotational symmetry, but the spin and orbital separate contributions change.
