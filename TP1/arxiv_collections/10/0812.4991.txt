Anisotropies of electrical resistivity, upper critical field, London
penetration depth and critical currents have been measured in single crystals
of the optimally doped iron pnictide superconductor
Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$, $x$=0.074 and $T_c \sim$23 K. The normal state
resistivity anisotropy was obtained by employing both the Montgomery technique
and direct measurements on samples cut along principal crystallographic
directions. The ratio $\gamma_{\rho} = \rho_c /\rho_a$ is about 4$\pm$1 just
above $T_c$ and becomes half of that at room temperature. The anisotropy of the
upper critical field, $\gamma_{H} = H_{c2,ab} /H_{c2,c} $, as determined from
specific heat measurements close to $T_c$, is in the range of 2.1 to 2.6,
depending on the criterion used. A comparable low anisotropy of the London
penetration depth, $\gamma_{\lambda}=\lambda_{c}/\lambda_{ab}$, was recorded
from TDR measurements and found to persist deep into the superconducting state.
An anisotropy of comparable magnitude was also found in the critical currents,
$\gamma_j=j_{c,ab}/j_{c,c}$, as determined from both direct transport
measurements ($\sim$1.5) and from the analysis of the magnetization data
($\sim$3). Overall, our results show that iron pnictide superconductors
manifest anisotropies consistent with essentially three-dimensional
intermetallic compound and bear little resemblance to cuprates.
