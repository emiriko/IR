The superfluid transition of a three-dimensional gas of hard-sphere bosons in
a disordered medium is studied using quantum Monte Carlo methods. Simulations
are performed in continuous space both in the canonical and in the
grand-canonical ensemble. At fixed density we calculate the shift of the
transition temperature as a function of the disorder strength, while at fixed
temperature we determine both the critical chemical potential and the critical
density separating normal and superfluid phases. In the regime of strong
disorder the normal phase extends up to large values of the degeneracy
parameter and the critical chemical potential exhibits a linear dependence in
the intensity of the random potential. The role of interactions and disorder
correlations is also discussed.
