An oscillatory dependence of the drain current on the drain voltage is found
in a nanostructure consisting of two crossing semiconductor carbon nanotubes
that are suspended over a dielectric trench, which is backed by a doped silicon
substrate that acts as a gate. Alternating positive and negative differential
resistance regions are generated as a function of the drain source values and
can be slightly shifted by the gate voltage. Moreover, the negative
differential resistance is retrieved in a large bandwidth, of up to 100 MHz,
when the structure is excited with ac signals.
