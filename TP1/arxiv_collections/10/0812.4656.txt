Laumon moduli spaces are certain smooth closures of the moduli spaces of maps
from the projective line to the flag variety of $GL_n$. We construct the action
of the Yangian of $sl_n$ in the cohomology of Laumon spaces by certain natural
correspondences. We construct the action of the affine Yangian (two-parametric
deformation of the universal enveloping algebra of the universal central
extension of $sl_n[s^{\pm1},t]$) in the cohomology of the affine version of
Laumon spaces. We compute the matrix coefficients of the generators of the
affine Yangian in the fixed point basis of cohomology. This basis is an affine
analogue of the Gelfand-Tsetlin basis. The affine analogue of the
Gelfand-Tsetlin algebra surjects onto the equivariant cohomology rings of the
affine Laumon spaces. The cohomology ring of the moduli space $M_{n,d}$ of
torsion free sheaves on the plane, of rank $n$ and second Chern class $d$,
trivialized at infinity, is naturally embedded into the cohomology ring of
certain affine Laumon space. It is the image of the center $Z$ of the Yangian
of $gl_n$ naturally embedded into the affine Yangian. In particular, the first
Chern class of the determinant line bundle on $M_{n,d}$ is the image of a
noncommutative power sum in $Z$.
