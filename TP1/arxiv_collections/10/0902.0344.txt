We analyze time-resolved spontaneous emission from excitons confined in
self-assembled $\mathrm{InAs}$ quantum dots placed at various distances to a
semiconductor-air interface. The modification of the local density of optical
states due to the proximity of the interface enables unambiguous determination
of the radiative and non-radiative decay rates of the excitons. From
measurements at various emission energies we obtain the frequency dependence of
the radiative decay rate, which is only revealed due to the separation of the
radiative and non-radiative parts. It contains detailed information about the
dependence of the exciton wavefunction on quantum dot size. The experimental
results are compared to the quantum optics theory of a solid state emitter in
an inhomogeneous environment. Using this model, we extract the frequency
dependence of the overlap between the electron and hole wavefunctions. We
furthermore discuss three models of quantum dot strain and compare the measured
wavefunction overlap to these models. The observed frequency dependence of the
wavefunction overlap can be understood qualitatively in terms of the different
compressibility of electrons and holes originating from their different
effective masses.
