We have recently started to investigate 2D arrays of confocal lens pairs.
Miniaturization of the lens pairs can make the array behave ray-optically like
a homogeneous medium. Here we generalize the geometry of the lens pairs. These
generalisations include a sideways shift of the lens centres and a change in
the orientation of both lenses in each pair. We investigate the basic ray
optics of the resulting arrays, and illustrate these with movies rendered using
ray-tracing software. We suggest that confocal lenslet arrays could be used to
realize ray-optically some recent metamaterials concepts such as the
coordinate-transform design paradigm.
