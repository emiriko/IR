A notion of open bisimulation is formulated for the spi calculus, an
extension of the pi-calculus with cryptographic primitives. In this
formulation, open bisimulation is indexed by pairs of symbolic traces, which
represent the history of interactions between the environment with the pairs of
processes being checked for bisimilarity. The use of symbolic traces allows for
a symbolic treatment of bound input in bisimulation checking which avoids
quantification over input values. Open bisimilarity is shown to be sound with
respect to testing equivalence, and futher, it is shown to be an equivalence
relation on processes and a congruence relation on finite processes. As far as
we know, this is the first formulation of open bisimulation for the spi
calculus for which the congruence result is proved.
