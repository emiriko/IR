We present an alternative geometric inspired derivation of the quantum
cosmology arising from a brane universe in the context of {\it geodetic
gravity}. We set up the Regge-Teitelboim model to describe our universe, and we
recover its original dynamics by thinking of such field theory as a
second-order derivative theory. We refer to an Ostrogradski Hamiltonian
formalism to prepare the system to its quantization. Our analysis highlights
the second-order derivative nature of the RT model and the inherited
geometrical aspect of the theory. A canonical transformation brings us to the
internal physical geometry of the theory and induces its quantization
straightforwardly. By using the Dirac canonical quantization method our
approach comprises the management of both first- and second-class constraints
where the counting of degrees of freedom follows accordingly. At the quantum
level our Wheeler-De Witt Wheeler equation agrees with previous results
recently found. On these lines, we also comment upon the compatibility of our
approach with the Hamiltonian approach proposed by Davidson and coworkers.
