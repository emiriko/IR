We use published optical spectral and IR excess data from nine young clusters
and associations to study the stellar mass dependent dispersal of circumstellar
disks. All clusters older than ~3 Myr show a decrease in disk fraction with
increasing stellar mass for Solar to higher mass stars. This result is
significant at about the 1 $\sigma$ level in each cluster. For the complete set
of clusters we reject the null hypothesis--that Solar and intermediate-mass
stars lose their disks at the same rate--with 95-99.9% confidence. To interpret
this behaviour, we investigate the impact of grain growth, binary companions,
and photoevaporation on the evolution of disk signatures. Changes in grain
growth timescales at fixed disk temperature may explain why early-type stars
with IR excesses appear to evolve faster than their later-type counterparts.
Little evidence that binary companions affect disk evolution suggests that
photoevaporation is the more likely mechanism for disk dispersal. A simple
photoevaporation model provides a good fit to the observed disk fractions for
Solar and intermediate-mass stars. Although the current mass-dependent disk
dispersal signal is not strong, larger and more complete samples of clusters
with ages of 3-5 Myr can improve the significance and provide better tests of
theoretical models. In addition, the orbits of extra-Solar planets can
constrain models of disk dispersal and migration. We suggest that the signature
of stellar mass dependent disk dispersal due to photoevaporation may be present
in the orbits of observed extra Solar planets. Planets orbiting hosts more
massive than ~1.6 Msun may have larger orbits because the disks in which they
formed were dispersed before they could migrate.
