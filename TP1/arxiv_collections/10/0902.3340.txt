We propose a new formalism of quantum subsystems which allows to unify the
existing and new methods of reduced description of quantum systems. The main
mathematical ingredients are completely positive maps and correlation
functions. In this formalism generalized quantum systems can be composed and
there is a notion of generalized entanglement. Models of fermionic and bosonic
systems and also quantum systems described by the SU(2) symmetry are studied.
