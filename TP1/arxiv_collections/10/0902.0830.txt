A detailed analysis of the use of an optical cavity to enhance picosecond
ultrasonic signals is presented. The optical cavity is formed between a
distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) and the metal thin film samples to be
studied. Experimental results for Al and Cu films show enhancement of acoustic
signals by up to two orders of magnitude and are in good agreement with
calculated results based on a previously established model. This technique
provides an efficient method for detecting sound in materials with small
piezo-optic coefficients and makes it possible to determine the actual pulse
shape of the returning acoustic echoes.
