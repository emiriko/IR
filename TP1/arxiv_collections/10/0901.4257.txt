Different strategies for the computation of QCD low-energy couplings by
matching lattice results with the chiral effective theory are reviewed. After
recalling some relevant predictions from the effective theory, the current
status of leading order (\Sigma,F, Sigma_0,F_0) and next-to-leading order (l_i,
L_i) low-energy constants is summarized, focusing on recent results obtained
with N_f=2 and N_f=2+1 lattice simulations.
