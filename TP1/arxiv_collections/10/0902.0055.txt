In view of the photon-number tomograms of two-mode light states, using the
qubit-portrait method for studying the probability distributions with infinite
outputs, the separability and entanglement detection of the states are studied.
Examples of entangled Gaussian state and Schr\"{o}dinger cat state are
discussed.
