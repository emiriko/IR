We study the the electroweak symmetry breaking induced by the interaction of
unparticles and the SM Higgs with an additional complex scalar. Furthermore, we
estimate the contribution of the mixing scalars on the muon anomalous magnetic
moment. We observe that this contribution is at least two order less than the
discrepancy between the experimental and the SM results of the muon anomalous
magnetic moment.
