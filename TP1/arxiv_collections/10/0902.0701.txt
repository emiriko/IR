Diffusion of transported particles in the intracellular medium is described
by means of a generalized diffusion equation containing forces due to the
cytoskeleton network and to the protein motors. We find that the enhanced
diffusion observed in experiments depends on the nature of the force exerted by
the protein motors and on parameters characterizing the intracellular medium
which is described in terms of a generalized Debye spectrum for the noise
density of states.
