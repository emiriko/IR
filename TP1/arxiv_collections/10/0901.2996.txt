We propose a new method for estimating the change-points of heart rate in the
orthosympathetic and parasympathetic bands, based on the wavelet transform in
the complex domain and the study of the change-points in the moments of the
modulus of these wavelet transforms. We observe change-points in the
distribution for both bands.
