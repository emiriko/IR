We describe students revising the mathematical form of physics equations to
match the physical situation they are describing, even though their revision
violates physical laws. In an unfamiliar air resistance problem, a majority of
students in a sophomore level mechanics class at some point wrote Newton's
Second Law as F = -ma; they were using this form to ensure that the sign of the
force pointed in a direction consistent with the chosen coordinate system while
assuming that some variables have only positive value. We use one student's
detailed explanation to suggest that students' issues with variables are
context-dependent, and that much of their reasoning is useful for productive
instruction.
