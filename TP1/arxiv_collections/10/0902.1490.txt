We study polar Alfv\'en oscillations of relativistic stars endowed with a
strong global poloidal dipole magnetic field. Here we focus only on the
axisymmetric oscillations which are studied by evolving numerically the
two-dimensional perturbation equations. Our study shows that the spectrum of
the polar Alfv\'{e}n oscillations is discrete in contrast to the spectrum of
axial Alfv\'{e}n oscillations which is continuous. We also show that the
typical fluid modes, such as the f and p modes, are not significantly affected
by the presence of the strong magnetic field.
