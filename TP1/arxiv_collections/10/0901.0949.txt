The present article is based on a previous one, where a second quantized
field theory on the world sheet for summing the planar graphs of phi^3 theory
was developed. In this earlier work, the ground state of the model was
determined using a variational approximation. Here, starting with the same
world sheet theory, we instead use the mean field method to compute the ground
state, and find results in agreement with the variational calculation. Apart
from serving as a check on the variational calculation, the mean field method
enables us to go beyond the ground state to compute the excited states of the
model. The spectrum of these states is that of a string with linear
trajectories, plus a continuum that starts at higher energy. We show that, by
appropriately tuning the parameters of the model, the string spectrum can be
cleanly seperated from the continuum.
