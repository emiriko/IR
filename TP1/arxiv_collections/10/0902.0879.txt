The paper concerns the classical occupancy scheme with infinitely many boxes.
We establish approximations to the distributions of the number of occupied
boxes, and of the number of boxes containing exactly r balls, within the family
of translated Poisson distributions. These are shown to be of ideal asymptotic
order, with respect both to total variation distance and to the approximation
of point probabilities. The proof is probabilistic, making use of a translated
Poisson approximation theorem of R\"ollin (2005).
