We show that the gauge field induced due to non-uniform hopping, in gapped
graphene, can give rise to a non-BCS type of superconductivity. Unlike the
conventional mechanisms, this superconductivity phenomena does not require any
pairing. We estimate the critical temperature for superconducting-to-normal
transition via Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless mechanism. Possibility of
observing the same in ultra cold atomic gases is also pointed out.
