The Baxter-like functional equation encoding the spectrum of anomalous
dimensions of Wilson operators in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory
available to date ceases to work just before the onset of wrapping corrections.
In this paper, we work out an improved finite-difference equation by
incorporating nonpolynomial effects in the transfer matrix entering as its
ingredient. This yields a self-consistent asymptotic finite-difference equation
valid at any order of perturbation theory. Its exact solutions for fixed spins
and twists at and beyond wrapping order give results coinciding with the ones
obtained from the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz. Correcting the asymptotic energy
eigenvalues by the Luescher term, we compute anomalous dimensions for a number
of short operators beyond wrapping order.
