The longitudinal-transverse spin asymmetry $A_{LT}$ in the polarized
Drell-Yan process depends on twist-3 quark distributions of nucleon. In
addition to the contributions associated with the twist-3 operators, these
distributions contain the "Wandzura-Wilczek (WW)" part, which is determined by
a certain integral of twist-2 distributions. The recently obtained empirical
information on the transversity allows a realistic estimate of the WW
contribution to $A_{LT}$ for the polarized $p\bar{p}$ collisions. Our results
indicate that rather large $A_{LT}$ ($\sim 10$%) can be observed in the
proposed spin experiments at GSI, with novel pattern as a function of dilepton
mass compared with $A_{TT}$ and $A_{LL}$.
