We show effects of the event-by-event fluctuation of the initial conditions
(IC) in hydrodynamic description of high-energy nuclear collisions on some
observables. Such IC produce not only fluctuations in observables but, due to
their bumpy structure, several non-trivial effects appear. They enhance
production of isotropically distributed high-pT particles, making v2 smaller
there. Also, they reduce v2 in the forward and backward regions where the
global matter density is smaller, so where such effects become more
efficacious. They may also produce the so-called ridge effect in the two
large-pT particle correlation.
