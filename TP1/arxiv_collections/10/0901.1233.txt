A complete list of homogeneous operators in the Cowen-Douglas class $B_n(D)$
is given. This classification is obtained from an explicit realization of all
the homogeneous Hermitian holomorphic vector bundles on the unit disc under the
action of the universal covering group of the bi-holomorphic automorphism group
of the unit disc.
