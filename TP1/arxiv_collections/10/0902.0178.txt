A model of graviton momentum transfer was constructed to investigate a
conjecture that gravitons are fused photons propagating in four dimensions. The
model describes gravitational attraction between two bodies, each of simplified
geometric shape and comprised of a calculable number of massive particles
(quarks and leptons), as a probabilistic quantized mechanism of graviton
scattering that gives rise to gravitational momentum flux. Earth-Human,
Moon-Human, and Earth-Moon gravitational systems were investigated to solve for
the wavelength of photons that comprise the graviton. The calculated wavelength
for each system was approximately equal to the predicted value of the Planck
length, which is interpreted as evidence that gravitons may be formed as fused
four dimensional photons. The results corroborate current thinking about the
temperature at which gravity separated from a unified force during the Big
Bang, while explaining the weakness of the gravitational force from the atomic
to the sub-planetary scale. Extension of the model produces unique, testable
predictions arising from the averaged quantum properties of the graviton as
fused photons, and the general model approach may be compatible with other
efforts to describe the inner structure of the graviton.
