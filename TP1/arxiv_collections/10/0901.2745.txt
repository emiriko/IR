Magnetic configurations in heterostructures are often difficult to probe when
the magnetic entities are buried inside. In this study we have captured
magnetic and magnetoresistance "fingerprints" of Co nanodiscs embedded in Co/Cu
multilayered nanowires using a first-order reversal curve method. In 200nm
diameter nanowires, the magnetic configurations can be tuned by adjusting the
Co nanodisc aspect ratio. Nanowires with the thinnest Co nanodiscs exhibit
single domain behavior, while those with thicker Co reverse via vortex states.
A superposition of giant and anisotropic magnetoresistance is observed, which
corresponds to the different magnetic configurations of the Co nanodiscs.
