Recent transport experiments in the original cuprate high temperature
superconductor, {La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$}, have revealed a remarkable sequence
of transitions and crossovers which give rise to a form of dynamical
dimensional reduction, in which a bulk crystal becomes essentially
superconducting in two directions while it remains poorly metallic in the
third. We identify these phenomena as arising from a distinct new
superconducting state, the "striped superconductor," in which the
superconducting order is spatially modulated, so that its volume average value
is zero. Here, in addition to outlining the salient experimental findings, we
sketch the order parameter theory of the state, stressing some of the ways in
which a striped superconductor differs fundamentally from an ordinary (uniform)
superconductor, especially concerning its response to quenched randomness. We
also present the results of DMRG calculations on a model of interacting
electrons in which sign oscillations of the superconducting order are
established. Finally, we speculate concerning the relevance of this state to
experiments in other cuprates, including recent optical studies of
{La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$} in a magnetic field, neutron scattering experiments
in underdoped {YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$}, and a host of anomalies seen in STM and
ARPES studies of {Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta} $}.
