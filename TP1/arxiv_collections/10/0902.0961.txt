A new framework to perturbative quantum gravity is proposed following the
geometry of nonholonomic distributions on (pseudo) Riemannian manifolds. There
are considered such distributions and adapted connections, also completely
defined by a metric structure, when gravitational models with infinite many
couplings reduce to two--loop renormalizable effective actions. We use a key
result from our partner work arXiv:0902.0911 that the classical Einstein
gravity theory can be reformulated equivalently as a nonholonomic gauge model
in the bundle of affine/de Sitter frames on pseudo-Riemannian spacetime. It is
proven that (for a class of nonholonomic constraints and splitting of the
Levi-Civita connection into a "renormalizable" distinguished connection, on a
base background manifold, and a gauge like distortion tensor, in total space) a
nonholonomic differential renormalization procedure for quantum gravitational
fields can be elaborated. Calculation labor is reduced to one- and two-loop
levels and renormalization group equations for nonholonomic configurations.
