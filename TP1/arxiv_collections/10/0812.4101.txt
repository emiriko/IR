A theoretical study of magnetic field (h) effects on single-particle spectra
and transport quantities of heavy fermion metals in the paramagnetic phase is
carried out. We have employed a non-perturbative local moment approach (LMA) to
the asymmetric periodic Anderson model within the dynamical mean field
framework. The lattice coherence scale $\om_L$, which is proportional within
the LMA to the spin-flip energy scale, and has been shown in earlier studies to
be the energy scale at which crossover to single impurity physics
occurs,increases monotonically with increasing magnetic field. The many body
Kondo resonance in the density of states at the Fermi level splits into two
with the splitting being proportional to the field itself. For h$\geq$ 0, we
demonstrate adiabatic continuity from the strongly interacting case to a
corresponding non-interacting limit, thus establishing Fermi liquid behaviour
for heavy fermion metals in the presence of magnetic field. In the Kondo
lattice regime, the theoretically computed magnetoresistance is found to be
negative in the entire temperature range. We argue that such a result could be
understood at $T\gtrsim \om_L$ by field-induced suppression of spin-flip
scattering and at $T\lesssim \om_L$ through lattice coherence. The coherence
peak in the heavy fermion resistivity diminishes and moves to higher
temperatures with increasing field. Direct comparison of the theoretical
results to the field dependent resistivity measurements in CeB$_6$ yields good
agreement.
