We study two quantum dots embedded in the arms of an Aharonov-Bohm ring
threaded by a magnetic flux. The system can be described by an effective
one-impurity Anderson model with an energy- and flux-dependent density of
states. For specific values of the flux, this density of states vanishes at the
Fermi energy, yielding a controlled realization of the pseudogap Kondo effect.
The conductance and transmission phase shifts reflect a nontrivial interplay
between wave interference and interactions, providing clear signatures of
quantum phase transitions between Kondo and non-Kondo ground states.
