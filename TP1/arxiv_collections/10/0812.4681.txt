Using geometrical approach exposed in arXiv:math/0304245 and
arXiv:nlin/0511012, we explore the Camassa-Holm equation (both in its initial
scalar form, and in the form of 2x2-system). We describe Hamiltonian and
symplectic structures, recursion operators and infinite series of symmetries
and conservation laws (local and nonlocal).
