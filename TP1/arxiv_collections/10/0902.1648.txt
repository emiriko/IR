We report the discovery of the first symbiotic star (V=21.6, K_S=15.8 mag) in
the Local Group dwarf irregular galaxy NGC6822. This star was identified during
a spectral survey of Ha emission-line objects using the Southern African Large
Telescope (SALT) during its performance-verification phase. The observed strong
emission lines of HI and HeII suggest a high electron density and T* < 130 000
K for the hot companion. The infrared colours allow us to classify this object
as an S-type symbiotic star, comprising a red giant losing mass to a compact
companion. The red giant is an AGB carbon star, and a semi-regular variable,
pulsating in the first overtone with a period of 142 days. Its bolometric
magnitude is M_bol=-4.4 mag.
  We review what is known about the luminosities of extragalactic symbiotic
stars, showing that most, possibly all, contain AGB stars. We suggest that a
much larger fraction of Galactic symbiotic stars may contain AGB stars than was
previously realised.
