We present a brief summary of results from our FUSE program designed to study
OVI absorption in the disk of the Milky Way. As a full analysis of our data has
now been published, we focus on the improvements that FUSE afforded us compared
to Copernicus data published thirty years ago. We discuss FUSE's limitations in
studying OVI absorption from nearby galaxies using background QSOs, but present
FUSE spectra of two probes which indicate the absence of OVI (but the presence
of Lyman-beta) absorption 8 and 63 kpc from a foreground galaxy. Finally, we
discuss the need for a more sensitive UV spectrograph to map out the physical
conditions of baryons around galaxies.
