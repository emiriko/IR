In this paper we report an experiment on the observation of the
recoil-induced resonances (RIR) and electromagnetically induced absorption
(EIA) of cold Rb87 atoms in diffuse light. The pump light of the RIR and the
EIA comes from the diffuse light in an integrating sphere, which also serves
the cooling light. The probe light beam is a weak laser split from the cooling
laser in order to keep the cooling and probe lasers correlated. We measured the
RIR and the EIA signal varying with the detuning of the diffuse laser light,
and also measured the temperature of the cold atoms at the different detunings.
The mechanism of RIR and EIA in the configuration with diffuse-light pumping
and laser probing is discussed, and the difference of nonlinear spectra of cold
atoms between in diffuse-light cooling system and in optical molasses as well
as in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) are studied.
