After a brief introduction to the physics of soft gluons in QCD we present a
surprising prediction. Dijet production in hadron-hadron collisions provides
the paradigm, i.e. h_1 +h_2 \to jj+X. In particular, we look at the case where
there is a restriction placed on the emission of any further jets in the region
in between the primary (highest p_T) dijets. Logarithms in the ratio of the jet
scale to the veto scale can be summed to all orders in the strong coupling.
Surprisingly, factorization of collinear emissions fails at scales above the
veto scale and triggers the appearance of double logarithms in the hard
sub-process. The effect appears first at fourth order relative to the leading
order prediction and is subleading in the number of colours.
