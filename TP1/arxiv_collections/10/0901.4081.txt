An adaptive FPGA architecture based on the NoC (Network-on-Chip) approach is
used for the multispectral image correlation. This architecture must contain
several distance algorithms depending on the characteristics of spectral images
and the precision of the authentication. The analysis of distance algorithms is
required which bases on the algorithmic complexity, result precision, execution
time and the adaptability of the implementation. This paper presents the
comparison of these distance computation algorithms on one spectral database.
The result of a RGB algorithm implementation was discussed.
