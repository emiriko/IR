We show that a Dicke-type pseudo-hermitian Hamiltonian undergoes quantum
phase transition by mapping it to the "Dressed Dicke Model" through a
similarity transformation. We find the positive-definite metric in the Hilbert
space of the pseudo-hermitian Hamiltonian so that it is unitary and allows a
consistent quantum description. Further, we obtain the limit in which the
pseudo-hermitian Hamiltonian is exactly solvable.
