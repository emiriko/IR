Motivated by recent experimental results in ultra-thin helimagnetic Holmium
films, we have performed an extensive classical Monte Carlo simulation of films
of different thickness, assuming a Hamiltonian with six inter-layer exchange
constants. Both magnetic structure and critical properties have been analyzed.
For n>16 (n being the number of spin layers in the film) a correct bulk limit
is reached, while for lower n the film properties are clearly affected by the
strong competition among the helical pitch and the surface effects, which
involve the majority of the spin layers: In the thickness range n=9-16 three
different magnetic phases emerge, with the high-temperature, disordered,
paramagnetic phase and the low-temperature, long-range ordered one separated by
an intriguing intermediate-temperature block phase, where outer ordered layers
coexist with some inner, disordered ones. The phase transition of these inner
layers displays the signatures of a Kosterlitz-Thouless one. Finally, for n<~7
the film collapse once and for all to a quasi-collinear order. A comparison of
our Monte Carlo simulation outcomes with available experimental data is also
proposed, and further experimental investigations are suggested.
