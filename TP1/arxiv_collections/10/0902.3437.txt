We present numerical calculations of the electron effective mass in an
interacting, ferromagnetic, two-dimensional electron system. We consider
quantum interaction effects associated with the charge-density fluctuation
induced many-body vertex corrections. Our theory, which is free of adjustable
parameters, reveals that the effective mass is suppressed (relative to its band
value) in the strong coupling limit, in good agreement with the results of
recent experimental measurements.
