We derive the structural relations between the Mellin transforms of weighted
Nielsen integrals emerging in the calculation of massless or massive
single--scale quantities in QED and QCD, such as anomalous dimensions and
Wilson coefficients, and other hard scattering cross sections depending on a
single scale. The set of all multiple harmonic sums up to weight five cover the
sums needed in the calculation of the 3--loop anomalous dimensions. The
relations extend the set resulting from the quasi-shuffle product between
harmonic sums studied earlier. Unlike the shuffle relations, they depend on the
value of the quantities considered. Up to weight {\sf w = 5}, 242 nested
harmonic sums contribute. In the present physical applications it is sufficient
to consider the sub-set of harmonic sums not containing an index $i = -1$,
which consists out of 69 sums. The algebraic relations reduce this set to 30
sums. Due to the structural relations a final reduction of the number of
harmonic sums to {15} basic functions is obtained. These functions can be
represented in terms of factorial series, supplemented by harmonic sums which
are algebraically reducible. Complete analytic representations are given for
these {15} meromorphic functions in the complex plane deriving their
asymptotic- and recursion relations. A general outline is presented on the way
nested harmonic sums and multiple zeta values emerge in higher order
calculations of zero- and single scale quantities.
