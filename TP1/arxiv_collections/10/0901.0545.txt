Properties of strongly interacting, two-component finite Fermi systems are
discussed within the recently developed coordinate-space
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) code {\hfbax}. Two illustrative examples are
presented: (i) weakly bound deformed Mg isotopes, and (ii) spin-polarized
atomic condensates in a strongly deformed harmonic trap.
