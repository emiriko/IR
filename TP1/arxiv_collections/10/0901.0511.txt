From the homotopy groups of two cubic spherical 3-manifolds we construct the
isomorphic groups of deck transformations acting on the 3-sphere. These groups
become the cyclic group of order eight and the quaternion group respectively.
By reduction of representations from the orthogonal group to the identity
representation of these subgroups we provide two subgroup-periodic bases for
the harmonic analysis on the 3-manifolds. This harmonic analysis has
applications to cosmic topology.
