In theories with many copies of the Standard Model virtual black hole
exchange may produce effective higher dimensional operators that can be treated
below the cutoff scale as fundamental vertices of interspecies
non-gravitational interaction. We consider the vertex that couples fermions of
one species through magnetic moment to photons of other species, and study the
quantum corrections it generates. In particular, we find kinetic mixing between
photons of different species produced via fermion loops. Diagonalization of
gauge kinetic terms then renders the fermions millicharged under other species'
electromagnetism. We explore some phenomenological consequences of such effects
by considering possible observable signatures in collider experiments and
constraining the interaction strength. The derived bounds are in agreement with
non-democratic nature of micro black hole coupling.
