Microwave spectroscopy of individual vortex-state magnetic nano-disks in a
perpendicular bias magnetic field, $H$, is performed using a magnetic resonance
force microscope (MRFM). It reveals the splitting induced by $H$ on the
gyrotropic frequency of the vortex core rotation related to the existence of
the two stable polarities of the core. This splitting enables spectroscopic
detection of the core polarity. The bistability extends up to a large negative
(antiparallel to the core) value of the bias magnetic field $H_r$, at which the
core polarity is reversed. The difference between the frequencies of the two
stable rotational modes corresponding to each core polarity is proportional to
$H$ and to the ratio of the disk thickness to its radius. Simple analytic
theory in combination with micromagnetic simulations give quantitative
description of the observed bistable dynamics.
