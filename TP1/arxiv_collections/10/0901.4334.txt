We present measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation
temperature anisotropy in the multipole range 2000<ell<3000 from the QUaD
telescope's second and third observing seasons. After masking the brightest
point sources our results are consistent with the primary LCDM expectation
alone. We estimate the contribution of residual (un-masked) radio point sources
using a model calibrated to our own bright source observations, and a full
simulation of the source finding and masking procedure. Including this
contribution slightly improves the chi^2. We also fit a standard SZ template to
the bandpowers and see no strong evidence of an SZ contribution, which is as
expected for sigma_8 approx 0.8.
