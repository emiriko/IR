In order to test the hypothesis that Class I protostellar binary stars are a
product of ejections during the dynamical decay of non-hierarchical multiple
systems, we combined the results of new adaptive optics (AO) observations of
Class I protostars with our previously published AO data to investigate whether
Class I protostars with a widely separated companion (r>200 AU) are more likely
to also have a close companion (r<200 AU). In total, we observed 47 embedded
young stellar objects (YSOs) with either the Subaru natural guide star AO
system or the Keck laser guide star AO system. We found that targets with a
widely separated companion within 5,000 AU are not more likely to have a close
companion. However, targets with another YSO within a projected separation of
25,000 AU are much more likely to have a close companion. Most importantly,
every target with a close companion has another YSO within a projected
separation of 25,000 AU. We came to the same conclusions after considering a
restricted sample of targets within 500 pc and close companions wider than 50
AU to minimize incompleteness effects. The Orion star forming region was found
to have an excess of both close binaries and YSOs within 25,000 AU compared to
other star forming regions. We interpret these observations as strong evidence
that many close Class I binary stars form via ejections and that many of the
ejected stars become unbound during the Class I phase.
