We report the measurement of charged $D^*$ mesons in inclusive jets produced
in proton-proton collisions at a center of mass energy $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV
with the STAR experiment at RHIC. For $D^{*}$ mesons with fractional momenta
$0.2 < z < 0.5$ in inclusive jets with 11.5 GeV mean transverse energy, the
production rate is found to be $N(D^{*+}+D^{*-})/N(\mathrm{jet}) = 0.015 \pm
0.008 (\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.007 (\mathrm{sys})$. This rate is consistent with
perturbative QCD evaluation of gluon splitting into a pair of charm quarks and
subsequent hadronization.
