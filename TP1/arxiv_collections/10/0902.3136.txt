XML is based on two essential aspects: the modelization of data in a tree
like structure and the separation between the information itself and the way it
is displayed. XML structures are easily serializable. The separation between an
abstract representation and one or several views on it allows the elaboration
of specialized interfaces to visualize or modify data. A lot of developments
were made to interact with XML data but the use of these applications over the
Internet is just starting. This paper presents a prototype of a distributed
editing environment over the Internet. The key point of our system is the way
user interactions are handled. Selections and modifications made by a user are
not directly reflected on the concrete view, they are serialized in XML and
transmitted to a server which applies them to the document and broadcasts
updates to the views. This organization has several advantages. XML documents
coding selection and modification operations are usually smaller than the
edited document and can be directly processed with a transformation engine
which can adapt them to different representations. In addition, several
selections or modifications can be combined into an unique XML document. This
allows one to update multiple views with different frequencies and fits the
requirement of an asynchronous communication mode like HTTP.
