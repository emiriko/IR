A theoretical investigation of the trion formation process from free carriers
in a single GaAs/Al_{1-x}Ga_{x}As quantum well is presented. The mechanism for
the formation process is provided by the interaction of the electrons and holes
with phonons. The contributions from both the acoustic and optical phonons are
considered. The dependence of both bi-molecular and tri-molecular formation
rates on temperature is calculated. We demonstrate that they are equivalent for
negatively and positively charged excitons.
