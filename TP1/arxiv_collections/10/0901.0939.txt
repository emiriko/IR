We report on the storage of orbital angular momentum of light in a cold
ensemble of cesium atoms. We employ Bragg diffraction to retrieve the stored
optical information impressed into the atomic coherence by the incident light
fields. The stored information can be manipulated by an applied magnetic field
and we were able to observe collapses and revivals due to the rotation of the
stored atomic Zeeman coherence for times longer than 15 $\mu s$.
