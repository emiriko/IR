Whereas the classical sphere $C P^1$ can be defined as the coordinate algebra
generated by the matrix entries of a projector $e$ with $\trace(e)=1$, the
fuzzy-sphere is defined in the same way by $\trace(e)=1+\lambda$. We show that
the standard $q$-sphere is similarly defined by $\trace_q(e)=1$ and the Podles
2-spheres by $\trace_q(e)=1+\lambda$, thereby giving a unified point of view in
which the 2-parameter Podles spheres are $q$-fuzzy spheres. We show further
that they arise geometrically as `constant time slices' of the unit hyperboloid
in $q$-Minkowski space viewed as the braided group $B_q[SU_2]$. Their
localisations are then isomorphic to quotients of $U_q(su_2)$ at fixed values
of the $q$-Casimir precisely $q$-deforming the fuzzy case. We use transmutation
and twisting theory to introduce a $C_q[G_C]$-covariant calculus on general
$B_q[G]$ and $U_q(g)$, and use $\Omega(B_q[SU_2])$ to provide a unified point
of view on the 3D calculi on fuzzy and Podles spheres. To complete the picture
we show how the covariant calculus on the 3D bicrossproduct spacetime arises
from $\Omega(C_q[SU_2])$ prior to twisting.
