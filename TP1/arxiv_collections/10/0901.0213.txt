Our results demonstrated that a previously reported protein name
co-occurrence method (5-mention PubGene) which was not based on a hypothesis
testing framework, it is generally statistically more significant than the 99th
percentile of Poisson distribution-based method of calculating co-occurrence.
It agrees with previous methods using natural language processing to extract
protein-protein interaction from text as more than 96% of the interactions
found by natural language processing methods to overlap with the results from
5-mention PubGene method. However, less than 2% of the gene co-expressions
analyzed by microarray were found from direct co-occurrence or interaction
information extraction from the literature. At the same time, combining
microarray and literature analyses, we derive a novel set of 7 potential
functional protein-protein interactions that had not been previously described
in the literature.
