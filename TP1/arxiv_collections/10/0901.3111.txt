We propose a beta decay experiment based on a sample of ultracold atomic
tritium. These initial conditions enable detection of the helium ion in
coincidence with the beta. We construct a two-dimensional fit incorporating
both the shape of the beta-spectrum and the direct reconstruction of the
neutrino mass peak. We present simulation results of the feasible limits on the
neutrino mass achievable in this new type of tritium beta-decay experiment.
