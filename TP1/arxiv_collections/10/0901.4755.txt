We give an explicit description of the Lie algebra of derivations for a class
of infinite dimensional algebras which are given by \'etale descent. The
algebras under consideration are twisted forms of central algebras over rings,
and include the multiloop algebras that appear in the construction of extended
affine Lie algebras.
