Measurements are presented of R_b, the ratio of the b bbar cross-section to
the q qbar cross-section in e+e- collisions, and the forward-backward asymmetry
A^b_FB at twelve energy points in the range sqrt(s) = 130-207 GeV. These
results are found to be consistent with the Standard Model expectations. The
measurements are used to set limits on new physics scenarios involving contact
interactions.
