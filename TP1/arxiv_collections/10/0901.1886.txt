We present a practical algorithm to decode erasures of Reed-Solomon codes
over the q elements binary field in O(q \log_2^2 q) time where the constant
implied by the O-notation is very small. Asymptotically fast algorithms based
on fast polynomial arithmetic were already known, but even if their complexity
is similar, they are mostly impractical. By comparison our algorithm uses only
a few Walsh transforms and has been easily implemented.
