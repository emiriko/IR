We introduce detector-level entanglement, a unified entanglement concept for
identical particles that takes into account the possible deletion of
many-particle which-way information through the detection process. The concept
implies a measure for the effective indistinguishability of the particles,
which is controlled by the measurement setup and which quantifies the extent to
which the (anti-)symmetrization of the wave-function impacts on physical
observables. Initially indistinguishable particles can gain or loose
entanglement on their transition to distinguishability, and their quantum
statistical behavior depends on their initial entanglement. Our results show
that entanglement cannot be attributed to a state of identical particles alone,
but that the detection process has to be incorporated in the analysis.
