We perform quantum mechanically exact calculations of resonances in the
spectrum of the hydrogen atom in crossed external fields and establish a close
connection between the classical transition state in phase space and features
in the quantum spectrum. By varying the external field strengths, structures
are revealed which are surprisingly similar to the quantized energy levels of
the classical electron motion in the vicinity of the saddle point obtained with
an approximation of the potential. The results give clear evidence for
signatures of the transition state in quantum spectra.
