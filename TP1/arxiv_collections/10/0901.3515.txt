Using small-angle neutron scattering, we demonstrate that the complex
magnetic domain patterns at the surface of Nd2Fe14B, revealed by quantitative
Kerr and Faraday microscopy, propagate into the bulk and exhibit structural
features with dimensions down to 6 nm, the domain wall thickness. The observed
fractal nature of the domain structures provides an explanation for the
anomalous increase in the bulk magnetization of Nd2Fe14B below the
spin-reorientation transition. These measurements open up a rich playground for
studies of fractal structures in highly anisotropic magnetic systems.
