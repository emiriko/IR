We derive the ranking of the astronomical observatories with the highest
impact in astronomy based on the citation analysis of papers published in 2006.
We also present a description of the methodology we use to derive this ranking.
The current ranking is lead by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, followed by Swift
and the Hubble Space Telescope.
