In illiquid markets, option traders may have an incentive to increase their
portfolio value by using their impact on the dynamics of the underlying. We
provide a mathematical framework within which to value derivatives under market
impact in a multi-player framework by introducing strategic interactions into
the Almgren & Chriss (2001) model. Specifically, we consider a financial market
model with several strategically interacting players that hold European
contingent claims and whose trading decisions have an impact on the price
evolution of the underlying. We establish existence and uniqueness of
equilibrium results and show that the equilibrium dynamics can be characterized
in terms of a coupled system of possibly non-linear PDEs. For the linear cost
function used in Almgren & Chriss (2001), we obtain (semi) closed form
solutions for risk neutral or CARA investors. Finally, we indicate how spread
crossing costs discourage market manipulation.
