An analysis including most recent Belle data on X(3872) is performed, using
coupled channel Flatt\'e formula. A third sheet pole close to but
\textit{below} $D^0D^{*0}$ threshold is found, besides the bound state/virtual
state pole discussed in previous literature. The co-existence of two poles near
the $D^0D^{*0}$ threshold indicates that the X(3872) may be of ordinary $c\bar
c$ $2 ^3P_1$ state origin, distorted by strong coupled channel effects. The
latter manifests itself as a molecular bound state (or a virtual state).
