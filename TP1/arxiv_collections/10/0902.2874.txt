By comparing an optically selected sample of narrow lines AGN with an X-ray
selected sample of AGN we have recently derived an estimate of the intrinsic
(i.e. before absorption) 2-10 keV luminosity function (XLF) of Compton Thick
AGNs. We will use this XLF to derive the number of Compton Thick AGN that will
be found in the SIMBOL-X survey(s).
