We present a hybrid RSI/RSII model in which we both solve the hierarchy
problem and produce a continuum of KK graviton modes. In this model, four
dimensional gravity can be reproduced and the radion mode can be stabilized. We
then modify the hybrid gravity model to include SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x U(1)_(B-L)
bulk gauge fields. Electroweak symmetry is broken by the choice of appropriate
boundary conditions. By adjusting the size of one region of the extra
dimension, we show that the S parameter can be decreased while protecting the
rho parameter from corrections. We find that as the S parameter is decreased by
~ 60%, M_Z' and M_W' stay below 1800 GeV, protecting unitarity.
