Ferroelectric BiFeO3 thin films and artificial superlattices of
(BiFeO3)m(SrTiO3)m (m~ 1 to 10 unit cells) were fabricated on (001)-oriented
SrTiO3 substrates by pulsed laser ablation. The variation of leakage current
and macroscopic polarization with periodicity was studied. Piezo force
microscopy studies revealed the presence of large ferroelectric domains in the
case of BiFeO3 thin films while a size reduction in ferroelectric domains was
observed in the case of superlattice structures. The results show that the
modification of ferroelectric domains through superlattice, could provide an
additional control on engineering the domain wall mediated functional
properties.
