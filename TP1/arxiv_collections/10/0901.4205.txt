We study the small weight codewords of the functional code C_2(Q), with Q a
non-singular quadric of PG(N,q). We prove that the small weight codewords
correspond to the intersections of Q with the singular quadrics of PG(N,q)
consisting of two hyperplanes. We also calculate the number of codewords having
these small weights.
