In this letter, we have considered the universe is filled with the mixture of
tachyonic field and scalar or phantom field. If the tachyonic field interacts
with scalar or phantom field, the interaction term decays with time and the
energy for scalar field is transferred to tachyonic field or the energy for
phantom field is transferred to tachyonic field. The tachyonic field and scalar
field potentials always decrease, but phantom field potential always increases.
