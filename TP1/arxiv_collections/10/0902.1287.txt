Gravitational wave emission from extreme mass ratio binaries (EMRBs) should
be detectable by the joint NASA-ESA LISA project, spurring interest in
analytical and numerical methods for investigating EMRBs. We describe a
discontinuous Galerkin (dG) method for solving the distributionally forced 1+1
wave equations which arise when modeling EMRBs via the perturbation theory of
Schwarzschild blackholes. Despite the presence of jump discontinuities in the
relevant polar and axial gravitational "master functions", our dG method
achieves global spectral accuracy, provided that we know the instantaneous
position, velocity, and acceleration of the small particle. Here these
variables are known, since we assume that the particle follows a timelike
geodesic of the Schwarzschild geometry. We document the results of several
numerical experiments testing our method, and in our concluding section discuss
the possible inclusion of gravitational self-force effects.
