In this second paper of the sequel of two papers, we further investigate the
problem of molecular cloud (MC) collision. Anathpindika (2009) (hereafter paper
I) considered highly supersonic cloud collisions and examined the effect of
bending and shearing instabilities on the shocked gas slab. We now consider
moderately supersonic cloud collisions (precollision cloud velocities of order
1.2 km s$^{-1}$ to 2.4 km s$^{-1}$).
  In the current paper, we present five SPH simulations of fast head-on and/or
off-centre cloud collisions to study the evolution of ram pressure confined gas
slabs. The relevant thermodynamics in the problem is simplified by adopting a
simple barytropic equation of state. We explore the parameter space by varying
the pre-collision velocity and the temperature of the post collision gas slab.
  The temperature in a pressure compressed gas slab is crucial to its dynamical
evolution. The pressure confined gas slabs become Jeans unstable if the average
sound crossing time, $t_{cr}$, of putative clumps condensing out of them, is
much larger than their free fall time, $t_{ff}$. Self gravitating clumps may
spawn multiple/larger $N$-body star clusters. Warmer gas slabs are unlikely to
fragment and may end up as diffuse gas clouds.
