Transport properties of an interacting triple quantum dot system coupled to
three leads in a triangular geometry has been studied in the Kondo regime.
Applying mean-field finite-U slave boson and embedded cluster approximations to
the calculation of transport properties unveils a set of rich features
associated to the high symmetry of this system. Results using both calculation
techniques yield excellent overall agreement and provide additional insights
into the physical behavior of this interesting geometry. In the case when just
two current leads are connected to the three-dot system, interference effects
between degenerate molecular orbitals are found to strongly affect the overall
conductance. An S=1 Kondo effect is also shown to appear for the perfect
equilateral triangle symmetry. The introduction of a third current lead results
in an `amplitude leakage' phenomenon, akin to that appearing in beam splitters,
which alters the interference effects and the overall conductance through the
system.
