We present updated predictions for the total cross section for Higgs boson
production by gluon--gluon fusion in hadron collisions. Our calculation
includes the most advanced theoretical information available at present for
this observable: soft-gluon resummation up to next-to-next-to-leading
logarithmic accuracy, the exact treatment of the bottom-quark contribution up
to next-to-leading order, and two-loop electroweak effects. We adopt the most
recent parametrization of parton distribution functions at
next-to-next-to-leading order, and we evaluate the corresponding uncertainties.
In comparison with our previous central predictions, at the Tevatron the
difference ranges from +9% for m_H=115 GeV to -9% for m_H=200 GeV. At the LHC
the cross section is instead significantly increased. The effect goes from +30%
for m_H=115 GeV to +9% for m_H=300 GeV, and is mostly due to the new parton
distribution functions. We also provide new predictions for the LHC at
sqrt{s}=10 TeV.
