We demonstrate purely resonant continuous-wave optical laser excitation to
coherently prepare an excitonic state of a single semiconductor quantum dot
(QDs) inside a high quality pillar microcavity. As a direct proof of QD
resonance fluorescence, the evolution from a single emission line to the
characteristic Mollow triplet10 is observed under increasing pump power. By
controlled utilization of weak coupling between the emitter and the fundamental
cavity mode through Purcell-enhancement of the radiative decay, a strong
suppression of pure dephasing is achieved, which reflects in close to Fourier
transform-limited and highly indistinguishable photons with a visibility
contrast of 90%. Our experiments reveal the model-like character of the coupled
QD-microcavity system as a promising source for the generation of ideal photons
at the quantum limit. From a technological perspective, the vertical cavity
symmetry -- with optional dynamic tunability -- provides strongly directed
light emission which appears very desirable for future integrated emitter
devices.
