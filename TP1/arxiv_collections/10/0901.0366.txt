This paper is devoted to characterizing the Riemann-Stieltjes operators and
pointwise multipliers acting on M${\rm \ddot{o}}$bius invariant spaces $Q_p$,
which unify BMOA and Bloch space in the scale of $p$. The boundedness and
compactness of these operators on $Q_p$ spaces are determined by means of an
embedding theorem, i.e. $Q_p$ spaces boundedly embedded in the non-isotropic
tent type spaces $T_q^\infty$.
