Let $\Gamma =(V,E)$ be a reflexive relation having a transitive group of
automorphisms and let $v\in V.$ Let $F$ be a subset of $V$ with $F\cap \Gamma
^-(v)=\{v\}$.
  (i) If $F$ is finite, then $| \Gamma (F)\setminus F|\ge |\Gamma (v)|-1.$ (ii)
If $F$ is cofinite, then $| \Gamma (F)\setminus F|\ge |\Gamma ^- (v)|-1.$
  In particular, let $G$ be group, $B$ be a finite subset of $G$ and let $F$ be
a finite or a cofinite subset of $G$ such that $F\cap B^{-1}=\{1\}$. Then $|
(FB)\setminus F|\ge |B|-1.$ The last result (for $F$ finite), is famous
Moser-Scherck-Kemperman-Wehn Theorem. Its extension to cofinite subsets seems
new. We give also few applications.
