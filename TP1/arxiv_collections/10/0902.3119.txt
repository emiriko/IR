Using the numerical renormalization group method, we study the splitting of
the Kondo resonance by a magnetic field applied in different directions in the
Kondo model for anisotropic magnetic impurities. Several types of magnetic
anisotropy are considered: the XXZ exchange coupling anisotropy J_perp J_z, the
longitudinal magnetic anisotropy DS_z^2, and the transverse magnetic anisotropy
E(S_x^2-S_y^2). In the spin-1/2 model with the XXZ exchange coupling anisotropy
we find very small direction dependence in the magnitude of the splitting. In
the spin-3/2 model with the easy-plane (D>0) anisotropy, we observe very
unequal magnitudes with further differences between x and y directions in the
presence of an additional transverse anisotropy. A simple and rather intuitive
interpretation is that the splitting is larger in magnetically soft directions.
The magnitude of the splitting is directly related to the energy differences
between spin states and it is only weakly modified by some multiplicative
factor due to Kondo screening. The results for the S=3/2 model are in good
agreement with recent scanning tunneling spectroscopy studies of Co impurities
adsorbed on CuN islands on Cu(100) surfaces [A. F. Otte et al., Nature Physics
