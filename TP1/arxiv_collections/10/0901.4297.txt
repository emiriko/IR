We present a thermal analysis of a patterned mesa on a Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 (Bi2212)
single crystal that is based on tunneling characteristics of the c-axis stack
of ~800 intrinsic Josephson junctions in the mesa. Despite the large mesa
volume (e.g., 40x300x1.2 micron3) and power dissipation that result in
selfheating and backbending of the current-voltage curve (I-V), there are
accessible bias conditions for which significant polarized THz-wave emission
can be observed. We estimate the mesa temperature by equating the quasiparticle
resistance, Rqp(T), to the ratio V/I over the entire I-V including the
backbending region. These temperatures are used to predict the unpolarized
black-body radiation reaching our bolometer and there is substantial agreement
over the entire I-V. As such, backbending results from the particular Rqp(T)
for Bi2212, as first discussed by Fenton, rather than a significant suppression
of the energy gap. This model also correctly predicts the observed
disappearance of backbending above ~60 K.
