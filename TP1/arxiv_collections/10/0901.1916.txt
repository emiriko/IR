Recently a moving boundary approximation for the minimal model for negative
streamer ionization fronts was extended with effects due to front curvature;
this was done through a systematic solvability analysis. A central prediction
of this analysis is the existence of a nonvanishing electric field in the
streamer interior, whose value is proportional to the front curvature. In this
paper we compare this result and other predictions of the solvability analysis
with numerical simulations of the minimal model.
