In one-dimensional quantum lattice models with open boundaries, we find and
study localization at the lattice edge. We show that edge-localized eigenstates
can be found in both bosonic and fermionic systems, specifically, in the
Bose-Hubbard model with on-site interactions and in the spinless fermion model
with nearest-neighbor interactions. We characterize the localization through
spectral studies via numerical diagonalization and perturbation theory, through
considerations of the eigenfunctions, and through the study of explicit time
evolution. We concentrate on few-particle systems, showing how more complicated
edge states appear as the number of particles is increased.
