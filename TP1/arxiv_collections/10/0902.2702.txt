We check against exact finite order three-loop results for the non-singlet
F_2 and F_3 structure functions the validity of a class of momentum space
ansaetze for threshold resummation at the next-to-leading order in 1-x, which
generalize results previously obtained in the large-\beta_0 limit. We find that
the ansaetze do not work exactly, pointing towards an obstruction to threshold
resummation at this order, but still yield correct results at the leading
logarithmic level for each color structures, as well as at the
next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic level for the specific C_F^3 color factor.
A universality of the leading logarithm contributions to the physical evolution
kernels of F_2 and F_3 at the next-to-leading order in 1-x is observed.
