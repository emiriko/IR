The new setup of the CODALEMA experiment installed at the Radio Observatory
in Nancay, France, is described. It includes broadband active dipole antennas
and an extended and upgraded particle detector array. The latter gives access
to the air shower energy, allowing us to compute the efficiency of the radio
array as a function of energy. We also observe a large asymmetry in counting
rates between showers coming from the North and the South in spite of the
symmetry of the detector. The observed asymmetry can be interpreted as a
signature of the geomagnetic origin of the air shower radio emission. A simple
linear dependence of the electric field with respect to vxB is used which
reproduces the angular dependencies of the number of radio events and their
electric polarity.
