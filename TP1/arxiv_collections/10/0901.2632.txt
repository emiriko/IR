AM CVn systems are interacting binaries similar to cataclysmic variables
(CVs), but more compact with orbital periods of less than 80 minutes. The
primary is a white dwarf, whereas the nature of the secondary is not completely
clear, yet. Abundances and composition of the outer layer of the secondary can
be found by analysis of the accretion disk (presented by Nagel et al. these
proceedings). Spectra from high-state AM CVn systems do not only show typical
signatures of accretion disks, but also P Cygni line profiles, a sign of
outflow being present in the system. Here we present the first quantitative
spectral analysis of an accretion-disk wind in AM CVn systems. Emergent wind
spectra are modeled with our 3-D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code WOMPAT. We
show that P Cygni profiles can be reproduced with our wind models.
