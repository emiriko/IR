We outline an interferometric scheme for the detection of bi-mode and
multi-mode spatial entanglement of finite-temperature,interacting Bose gases of
fixed particle number. Whether entanglement is present in the gas depends on
the existence of the single-particle reduced density matrix between different
regions of space. We apply the scheme to the problem of a harmonically trapped
boson pair and show that while entanglement is rapidly decreasing with
temperature, a significant amount remains for all interaction strengths at zero
temperature.Thus, by tuning the interaction parameter, the distribution of
entanglement between many spatial modes can be modified.
