We have performed polarization spectroscopy and sub-Doppler DAVLL on the
(5s5s) 1^S_0 -> (5s5p) 1^P_1 transition of atomic strontium. Both techniques
generated a dispersion-type lineshape suitable for laser stabilization, without
the need for frequency modulation. In both cases the signal is generated
primarily by saturation effects, rather than optical pumping. The dependence of
the amplitude and gradient on intensity and magnetic field were also
investigated.
