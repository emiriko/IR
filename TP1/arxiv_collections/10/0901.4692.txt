The Physics First movement - teaching a true physics course to ninth grade
students - is gaining popularity in high schools. There are several different
rhetorical arguments for and against this movement, and it is quite
controversial in physics education. However, there is no actual evidence to
assess the success, or failure, of this substantial shift in the science
teaching sequence. We have undertaken a comparison study of physics classes
taught in ninth- and 12th grade classes in Maine. Comparisons of student
understanding and gains with respect to mechanics concepts were made with
excerpts from well-known multiple-choice surveys and individual student
interviews. Results indicate that both populations begin physics courses with
similar content knowledge and specific difficulties, but that in the learning
of the concepts ninth graders are more sensitive to the instructional method
used.
