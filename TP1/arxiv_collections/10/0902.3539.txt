We present an equation of state and the composition of low-density supernova
matter composed of light nuclei with mass number A \le 13. We work within the
quasiparticle gas model, which accounts for bound states with decay time scales
larger than the relevant time scale of supernova and protoneutron star
evolution. The mean-field contribution is included in terms of Skyrme density
functional. Deuterons, tritons, and 3H(e) nuclei appear in matter in
concentrations that are substantially higher than those of heavier nuclei. We
calculate the critical temperature of deuteron condensation in such matter, and
demonstrate that the appearance of clusters substantially lowers the critical
temperature.
