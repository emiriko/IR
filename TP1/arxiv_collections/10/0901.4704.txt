We present a particular warped extra dimensional model, where the flavour
diagonal and flavour non-diagonal Z boson couplings to left-handed down quarks
are protected by the custodial symmetry P_LR. After a brief introduction of the
model and of its main theoretical motivations, we present a complete study of
rare K and B meson decays, including K+ --> pi+ nu anti-nu, K_L --> pi0 nu
anti-nu, B_{s,d} --> mu+ mu- and B_{s,d} --> X_{s,d} nu anti-nu. In particular
we restrict the parameter space of the model to the subspace which fits all
quark masses, CKM mixing parameters and all the measured Delta F=2 observables,
keeping the Kaluza-Klein scale in the reach of LHC (~(2-3)TeV). There we show
that, in addition to the one loop contribution of the Standard Model (SM), the
dominating new physics contribution to the rare decays of K and B_{s,d} mesons
is the tree level exchange of the Z boson of the SM governed by right-handed
couplings to down-type quarks. In order to reduce the parameter dependence, we
study correlations between various branching ratios of B and K mesons and
between Delta F=1 and Delta F=2 observables. The patterns that we find allow to
distinguish this new physics scenario from the SM and can offer an opportunity
to future experiments to confirm or rule out the model.
