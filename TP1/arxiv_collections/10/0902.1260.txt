We study online nonclairvoyant speed scaling to minimize total flow time plus
energy. We first consider the traditional model where the power function is P
(s) = s\^\propto. We give a nonclairvoyant algorithm that is shown to be
O(\propto\^3)-competitive. We then show an \Omega(\propto\^(1/3-\epsilon))
lower bound on the competitive ratio of any nonclairvoyant algorithm. We also
show that there are power functions for which no nonclairvoyant algorithm can
be O(1)-competitive.
