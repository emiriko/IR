Heavy gauge bosons such as $W^{\prime}$ are expected to exist in many
extensions of the Standard Model. In this paper, it is shown that the most
general Lagrangian for the interaction of $W^{\prime}$ with top and bottom
quarks which consists of V-A and V+A structure with in general complex
couplings produces an Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) for the top quark at one
loop level. We predict the allowed ranges for the mass and couplings of
$W^{\prime}$ by using the upper limit on the top quark EDM.
