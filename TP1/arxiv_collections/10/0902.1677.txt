Precision experiments at low energies probing weak interaction are a very
promising and complementary tool for investigating the structure of the
electro-weak sector of the standard model, and for searching for new phenomena
revealing signs for an underlaying new symmetry. With the advent of new
technologies in particle trapping and production of beams for exotic nuclei as
well as ultracold neutrons, we expect one or two orders of magnitude gain in
precision. This corresponds to the progress expected by new high luminosity
B-factories or the LHC. Domains studied are $\beta$-decays where decay
correlations, partial or total decay rates may reveal the nature of the
left-right structure of the interaction and the investigation of discrete
symmetries. Here the search for a finite electric dipole moment which, due to
its CP-violating nature were sensational by itself, could shed light on the
structure of the vacuum at very small distances. Last but not least ideas of a
mirror world can be extended to the sector of baryons which can be studied with
neutrons.
