The 138La (T1/2=102 Gyr) - 138Ce - 136Ce system is proposed to be used as a
nuclear cosmochronometer for measuring the time elapsed from a supernova
neutrino process. This chronometer is applied to examine a sample affected by a
single nucleosynthesis episode as presolar grains in primitive meteorites. A
feature of this chronometer is to evaluate the initial abundance ratio of
136Ce/138Ce using an empirical scaling law, which was found in the solar
abundances. We calculate the age of the sample as a function of isotopic
ratios, 136Ce/138Ce, and 138La/138Ce, and evaluate the age uncertainty due to
theoretical and observational errors. It is concluded that this chronometer can
work well for a sample with the abundance ratio of 138La/138Ce >= 20 when the
ratios of 136Ce/138Ce and 138La/138Ce are measured within the uncertainty of
20%. The availability of such samples becomes clear in recent studies of the
presolar grains. We also discuss the effect of the nuclear structure to the
neutrino process origin of 138La.
