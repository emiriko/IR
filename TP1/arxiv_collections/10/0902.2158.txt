This paper presents a study of the atmospheric refraction and its effect on
the light coupling efficiency in an instrument using single-mode optical
fibers. We show the analytical approach which allowed us to assess the need to
correct the refraction in J- and H-bands while observing with an 8-m Unit
Telescope. We then developed numerical simulations to go further in
calculations. The hypotheses on the instrumental characteristics are those of
AMBER (Astronomical Multi BEam combineR), the near infrared focal beam combiner
of the Very Large Telescope Interferometric mode (VLTI), but most of the
conclusions can be generalized to other single-mode instruments. We used the
software package caos (Code for Adaptive Optics Systems) to take into account
the atmospheric turbulence effect after correction by the ESO system MACAO
(Multi-Application Curvature Adaptive Optics). The opto-mechanical study and
design of the system correcting the atmospheric refraction on AMBER is then
detailed. We showed that the atmospheric refraction becomes predominant over
the atmospheric turbulence for some zenith angles z and spectral conditions:
for z larger than 30{\circ} in J-band for example. The study of the optical
system showed that it allows to achieve the required instrumental performance
in terms of throughput in J- and H-bands. First observations in J-band of a
bright star, alpha Cir star, at more than 30{\circ} from zenith clearly showed
the gain to control the atmospheric refraction in a single mode instrument, and
validated the operating law.
