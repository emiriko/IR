Traditionally a tiling is defined with a finite number of finite forbidden
patterns. We can generalize this notion considering any set of patterns.
Generalized tilings defined in this way can be studied with a dynamical point
of view, leading to the notion of subshift. In this article we establish a
correspondence between an order on subshifts based on dynamical transformations
on them and an order on languages of forbidden patterns based on computability
properties.
