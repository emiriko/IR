In this letter we report the first experimental observation of temporal delay
control of large-spectral-bandwidth multimode laser pulses by means of
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). We achieved controllable
retardation with limited temporal distortion of optical pulses with an input
spectral bandwidth of 3.3 GHz. The experimental results compare favorably with
theoretical predictions.
