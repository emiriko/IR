We show how to obtain the first multipole contributions to the
electromagnetic radiation emited by an arbitrary localized source directly from
the Jefimenko equation for the magnetic field and the Panofsky-Phillips
equation for the electric field. This procedure avoids the unnecessary
calculation of the electromagnetic potentials.
