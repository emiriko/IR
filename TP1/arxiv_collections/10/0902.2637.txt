A random, hydrogen-free, assembly of microscopic sp2 carbon chips, forming a
macroscopically homogeneous and isotropic solid, is proposed as a model carrier
for the UV interstellar extinction band . The validity of this model is based
on the calculation of the Bruggeman average dielectric function of a mixture of
the known parallel and perpendicular dielectric functions of graphite. The pi
absorption feature of Rayleigh-sized spheres of this mixture falls near 4.6
mu-1 (2175 Angstroms), but its width is 1.5 mu-1, somewhat larger than the
astronomically observed average, 1 mu-1. This is confirmed by measurements of
the reflectance of an industrial material, polycrystalline graphite. A better
fit to the IS feature position and width is obtained with a hypothetical
material, having the same dielectric functions as natural graphite, except for
less extended wings of the pi resonance. Physically, this could result from
changes in the electronic band structure due to previous thermal histories. On
this model, the Frolich feature central wavelength depends only on the pi
resonance frequency, while its width depends only on the damping constant of
the same resonance. This explains the range of observed feature widths at
constant feature wavelength.
