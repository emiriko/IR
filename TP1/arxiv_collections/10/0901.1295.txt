We analyze the observed distribution of the orbital eccentricity and period
of binary radio pulsars in globular clusters using computational tools to
simulate binary-single star interactions. Globular clusters have different
groups of pulsars arising from separate interaction scenarios. Intermediate
eccentricities of cluster pulsars can be mostly accounted by fly-bys although
locally lower stellar densities at pulsar positions may alter the situation.
Very high eccentricities are likely to be results of exchanges and/or mergers
of single stars with the binary companion of the pulsar.
