The generalized Einstein action is treated quantum mechanically by using a
quadratic lagrangian form. The canonical quantization of this action is
obtained by using the auxiliary variable to define the generalized momentum.
Physical constraints are imposed on the surface term, which is defined to be
the cosmological constant. One obtains the familiar Wheeler-de Witt equation.
The solution of this equation is in conformity with General Relativity (GR) .In
addition to the fact that it is free from GR setbacks at the early universe,
since it gives time decaying cosmological constant. The wave function of the
universe and the cosmic scale factor are complex quantities, which indicates
the existance of quantum effects.2.7k, CBR temperature is calculated.
