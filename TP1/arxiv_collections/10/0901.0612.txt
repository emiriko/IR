We propose and experimentally investigate a fibre-based quantum key
distribution system, which employs polarization qubits encoded into faint laser
pulses. As a novel feature, it allows sending of classical framing information
via sequences of strong laser pulses that precede the quantum data. This allows
synchronization, sender and receiver identification, and compensation of
time-varying birefringence in the communication channel. In addition, this
method also provides a platform to communicate implementation specific
information such as encoding and protocol in view of future optical quantum
networks. Furthermore, we report on our current effort to develop high-rate
error correction.
