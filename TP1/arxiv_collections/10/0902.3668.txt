A database can be accessed on the web at http://edd.ifa.hawaii.edu that was
developed to promote access to information related to galaxy distances. The
database has three functional components. First, tables from many literature
sources have been gathered and enhanced with links through a distinct galaxy
naming convention. Second, comparisons of results both at the levels of
parameters and of techniques have begun and are continuing, leading to
increasing homogeneity and consistency of distance measurements. Third, new
material are presented arising from ongoing observational programs at the
University of Hawaii 2.2m telescope, radio telescopes at Green Bank, Arecibo,
and Parkes and with Hubble Space Telescope. This new observational material is
made available in tandem with related material drawn from archives and passed
through common analysis pipelines.
