We simulate the indirect exchange interaction between Mn-rich Mn(Ga)As
nanoclusters in GaAs by analytical means. In contrast to the conventional
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) formula which considers the mediation by
the carriers in the medium, we also include the contribution from those inside
the clusters. Since the carrier concentration is higher in the clusters, this
modification allows the RKKY oscillation to change sign. Consequently, while
the previous approach only favors ferromagnetism for this system, an
antiferromagnetic coupling is in fact possible. Since the Mn-rich Mn(Ga)As
nanoclusters are naturally formed and bound to have different sizes, their spin
orientation is likely to be frustrated due to mixed preferences from different
neighbors. We argue that this is likely the source of the spin-glass-like
behavior which plagues this system. By tuning the size and narrowing its
distribution, normal ferromagnetism can be restored with an Curie temperature
higher than previously thought.
