In this article, we study the mass spectrum of the scalar hidden charm and
bottom tetraquark states with the QCD sum rules. The numerical results are
compared with the corresponding ones from a relativistic quark model based on a
quasipotential approach in QCD. The relevant values from the constituent
diquark model based on the constituent diquark masses and the spin-spin
interactions are also discussed.
