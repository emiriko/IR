We present the first formal algebraic specification of a hypertext reference
model. It is based on the well-known Dexter Hypertext Reference Model and
includes modifications with respect to the development of hypertext since the
WWW came up. Our hypertext model was developed as a product model with the aim
to automatically support the design process and is extended to a model of
hypertext-systems in order to be able to describe the state transitions in this
process. While the specification should be easy to read for non-experts in
algebraic specification, it guarantees a unique understanding and enables a
close connection to logic-based development and verification.
