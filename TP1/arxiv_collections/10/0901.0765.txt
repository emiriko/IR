The distribution of property is established through various mechanisms. In
this paper we study the acreage distribution of land plots owned by natural
persons in the Zl\'{\i}n Region of the Czech Republic. We show that the data
are explained in terms of a simple model in which the inheritance and market
behavior are combined.
