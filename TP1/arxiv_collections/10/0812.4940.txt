X-ray structural and spectral analyses, X-ray diffraction topography and
metallography were used to study dendrite structure of Al-4 wt % Cu single
crystals grown by the Bridgman technique at a rate of 1 mm/min and on seeds
with <001> orientation. The single crystals were obtained upon the
crystallization of the melt under the action of a pressure and the
gravitational-field component directed along the surface of the crystallization
front. Non-uniform distribution of copper in the solid solution and the
eutectic content has been found in transverse section of single crystals and
strong increase in their concentration was observed at the lateral side of the
samples in the direction of the gravitational-field component action.
Distribution of copper and the eutectic phase depend on pressure.
