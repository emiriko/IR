We survey a new application of the Weil representation to construct a
canonical basis of eigenvectors for the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The
transition matrix from the standard basis to the canonical basis defines a
novel transform which we call the discrete oscillator transform (DOT for
short). In addition, we describe a fast algorithm for computing the DOT in
certain cases.
