We present a study of transport in multiple-band non-interacting Fermi
metallic systems based on the Keldysh formalism, taking into account the
effects of Berry curvature due to spin-orbit coupling. We apply this formalism
to a Rashba 2DEG ferromagnet and calculate the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and
anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR). The numerical calculations reproduce
analytical results in the metallic regime revealing the crossover between the
skew scattering mechanism dominating in the clean systems and intrinsic
mechanism dominating in the moderately dirty systems. As we increase the
disorder further, the AHE starts to diminish due to the spectral broadening of
the quasiparticles. Although for certain parameters this reduction of the AHE
can be approximated as $\sigma_{xy}\thicksim\sigma_{xx}^{\varphi}$ with
$\varphi$ varying around 1.6, this is found not to be true in general as
$\sigma_{xy}$ can go through a change in sign as a function of disorder
strength in some cases. The reduction region in which the quasiparticle
approximation is meaningful is relatively narrow; therefore, a theory with a
wider range of applicability is called for. By considering the higher order
skew scattering processes, we resolve some discrepancies between the AHE
results obtained by using the Keldysh, Kubo and Boltzmann approaches. We also
show that similar higher order processes are important for the AMR when the
nonvertex and vertex parts cancel each other. We calculate the AMR in
anisotropic systems properly taking into account the anisotropy of the
non-equilibrium distribution function. These calculations confirm recent
findings on the unreliability of common approximations to the Boltzmann
equation.
