The direct measuring method is considered to get nuclear reactor antineutrino
spectrum. We suppose to isolate partial spectra of the fissile isotopes by
using the method of antineutrino spectrum extraction from the inverse beta
decay positron spectrum applied at Rovno experiment. This admits to increase
the accuracy of partial antineutrino spectra forming the total nuclear reactor
spectrum. It is important for the analysis of the reactor core fuel composition
and could be applied for non-proliferation purposes.
