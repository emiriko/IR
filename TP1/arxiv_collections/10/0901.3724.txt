In this manuscript, we present a generalization of the interacting
holographic dark energy model using the viscous generalized Chaplygin gas. We
also study the model by considering a dynamical Newton's constant $G$. Then we
reconstruct the potential and the dynamics of the scalar field which describe
the viscous Chaplygin cosmology.
