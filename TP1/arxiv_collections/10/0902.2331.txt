The kinematic end-point technique for measuring the masses of supersymmetric
particles in R-Parity conserving models at hadron colliders is re-examined with
a focus on exploiting additional constraints arising from correlations in
invariant mass observables. The use of such correlations is shown to
potentially resolve the ambiguity in the interpretation of quark+lepton
end-points and enable discrimination between sequential two-body and three-body
lepton-producing decays. The use of these techniques is shown to improve the
SUSY particle mass measurement precision for the SPS1a benchmark model by at
least 20-30% compared to the conventional end-point technique.
