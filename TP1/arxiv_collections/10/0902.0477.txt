Super-leading logarithmic terms have previously been observed in non-global
QCD observables. In this paper we re-calculate the first super-leading
contribution to the `gaps between jets' cross-section using a diagrammatic
fixed order approach. We calculate for the first time the super-leading
contribution at fifth order in alpha_s.
