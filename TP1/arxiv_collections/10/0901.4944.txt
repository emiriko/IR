On May 23, 2006 we used the ACIS-S instrument on the Chandra X-ray
Observatory (CXO) to study the X-ray emission from the B fragment of comet
73P/2006 (Schwassmann-Wachmann 3) (73P/B). We obtained a total of 20 ks of CXO
observation time of Fragment B, and also investigated contemporaneous ACE and
SOHO solar wind physical data. The CXO data allow us to spatially resolve the
detailed structure of the interaction zone between the solar wind and the
fragment's coma at a resolution of ~ 1,000 km, and to observe the X-ray
emission due to multiple comet--like bodies. We detect a change in the spectral
signature with the ratio of the CV/OVII line increasing with increasing
collisional opacity as predicted by Bodewits \e (2007). The line fluxes arise
from a combination of solar wind speed, the species that populate the wind and
the gas density of the comet. We are able to understand some of the observed
X-ray morphology in terms of non-gravitational forces that act upon an actively
outgassing comet's debris field. We have used the results of the Chandra
observations on the highly fragmented 73P/B debris field to re-analyze and
interpret the mysterious emission seen from comet C/1999 S4 (LINEAR) on August
1st, 2000, after the comet had completely disrupted. We find the physical
situations to be similar in both cases, with extended X-ray emission due to
multiple, small outgassing bodies in the field of view. Nevertheless, the two
comets interacted with completely different solar winds, resulting in
distinctly different spectra.
