Using Bridge Theory to describe the electromagnetic interactions occurring
between high energy pairs of particles, we predict an anomalous
self-gravitational red-shift in the frequency of the EM source produced during
the interaction. The extreme consequence is the introduction of an upper limit
in the electromagnetic spectrum. Hypothesizing a scattering energy greater than
5.55 10^22 Mev,the source collapses under his events horizon, becoming a
neutral spin less micro-black hole: perfect candidates to contribute to the
dark matter of the Universe.
