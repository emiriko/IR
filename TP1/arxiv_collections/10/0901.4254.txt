We analyze the statistical properties of the turbulent velocity field in the
deflagration model for Type Ia supernovae. In particular, we consider the
question of whether turbulence is isotropic and consistent with the Kolmogorov
theory at small length scales. Using numerical data from a high-resolution
simulation of a thermonuclear supernova explosion, spectra of the turbulence
energy and velocity structure functions are computed. We show that the
turbulent velocity field is isotropic at small length scales and follows a
scaling law that is consistent with the Kolmogorov theory until most of the
nuclear fuel is burned. At length scales greater than a certain characteristic
scale, turbulence becomes anisotropic. Here, the radial velocity fluctuations
follow the scaling law of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, whereas the angular
component still obeys Kolmogorov scaling. In the late phase of the explosion,
this characteristic scale drops below the numerical resolution of the
simulation. The analysis confirms that a subgrid-scale model for the unresolved
turbulence energy is required for the consistent calculation of the flame speed
in deflagration models of Type Ia supernovae, and that the assumption of
isotropy on these scales is appropriate.
