The X-ray emission from the super-massive star Eta Carinae is simulated using
a three dimensional model of the wind-wind collision. In the model the
intrinsic X-ray emission is spatially extended and energy dependent. Absorption
due to the unshocked stellar winds and the cooled postshock material from the
primary LBV star is calculated as the intrinsic emission is ray-traced along
multiple sightlines through the 3D spiral structure of the circumstellar
environment. The observable emission is then compared to available X-ray data,
including the lightcurve observed by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and
spectra observed by XMM-Newton. The orientation and eccentricity of the orbit
are explored, as are the wind parameters of the stars and the nature and
physics of their close approach. Our modelling supports a viewing angle with an
inclination of ~ 42 degrees, consistent with the polar axis of the Homunculus
nebula (Smith 2006), and the projection of the observer's line-of-sight onto
the orbital plane has an angle of ~ 0 - 30 degrees in the prograde direction on
the apastron side of the semi-major axis. However, there are significant
discrepancies between the observed and model lightcurves and spectra through
the X-ray minimum. In particular, the hard flux in our synthetic spectra is an
order of magnitude greater than observed. Further calculations reveal that
radiative inhibition significantly reduces the preshock velocity of the
companion wind. As a consequence the hard X-ray emission is quenched, but it is
unclear whether the long duration of the minimum is due solely to this
mechanism alone. Models incorporating a collapse/disruption of the WCR and/or
reduced preshock companion wind velocities bring the predicted emission and the
observations into much better agreement (abridged).
