Experimental data available in the literature on the diagonal resistivity of
GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures in a magnetic field at the filling factor 1/2 have
been compared with the existing theoretical prediction [B. I. Halperin et al.,
Phys. Rev. B 47, 7312 (1993) and F. Evers et al., Phys. Rev. B 60, 8951
(1999)]. It has been found that the experimental results disagree with the
prediction.
