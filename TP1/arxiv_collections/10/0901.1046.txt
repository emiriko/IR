The Langmuir-Blodgett technique was utilized and optimized to produce closed
monolayers of cobalt-platinum nanoparticles over vast areas. It is shown that
sample preparation, "dipping angle", and subphase type have a strong impact on
the quality of the produced films. The amount of ligands on the nanoparticles
surface must be minimized, the dipping angle must be around 105$^{\circ}$,
while the glycol subphase is necessary to obtain nanoparticle monolayers. The
achieved films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
grazing incidence x-ray scattering (GISAXS). The electrical properties of the
deposited films were studied by direct current (DC) measurements showing a
discrepancy to the variable range hopping transport from the granular metal
model, and favoring the simple thermal activated charge transport. SEM, GISAXS
as well as DC measurements confirm a narrow size distribution and high ordering
of the deposited films.
