We consider atomic system of $\Lambda-$type 3-level coupled to 2 mode fields,
and derive an effective Maxwell-Bloch equation designed for two photon emission
between two lower levels. We find axially symmetric, topologically stable
soliton solutions made of condensed fields. Immediate implication of soliton
formation to radiative neutrino pair emission is to enhance its rate, larger
than the usual $\propto N^2$ factor of target number dependence, along with
another merit of increasing the signal to the background photon emission.
