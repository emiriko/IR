The Breit-Wigner enhancement of the thermally averaged annihilation cross
section <\sigma v> is shown to provide a large boost factor when the dark
matter annihilation process nears a narrow resonance. We explicitly demonstrate
the evolution behavior of the Breit-Wigner enhanced <\sigma v> as the function
of universe temperature for both the physical and unphysical pole cases. It is
found that both of the cases can lead an enough large boost factor to explain
the recent PAMELA, ATIC and PPB-BETS anomalies. We also calculate the coupling
of annihilation process, which is useful for an appropriate model building to
give the desired dark matter relic density.
