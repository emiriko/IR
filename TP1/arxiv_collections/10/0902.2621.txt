In this paper we present Grammatic -- a tool for textual syntax definition.
Grammatic serves as a front-end for parser generators (and other tools) and
brings modularity and reuse to their development artifacts. It adapts
techniques for separation of concerns from Apsect-Oriented Programming to
grammars and uses templates for grammar reuse. We illustrate usage of Grammatic
by describing a case study: bringing separation of concerns to ANTLR parser
generator, which is achieved without a common time- and memory-consuming
technique of building an AST to separate semantic actions from a grammar
definition.
