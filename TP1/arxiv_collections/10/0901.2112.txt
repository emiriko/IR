The turbulent diffusion tensor describing the evolution of the mean
concentration of a passive scalar is investigated for non-helically forced
turbulence in the presence of rotation or a magnetic field. With rotation, the
Coriolis force causes a sideways deflection of the flux of mean concentration.
Within the magnetohydrodynamics approximation there is no analogous effect from
the magnetic field because the effects on the flow do not depend on the sign of
the field. rotation and magnetic fields tend to suppress turbulent transport,
but this suppression is weaker in the direction along the magnetic field.
Turbulent transport along the rotation axis is not strongly affected by
rotation, except on shorter length scales, i.e., when the scale of the
variation of the mean field becomes comparable with the scale of the
energy-carrying eddies. These results are discussed in the context of
anisotropic convective energy transport in the Sun.
