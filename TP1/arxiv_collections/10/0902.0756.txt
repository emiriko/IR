The electronic structure of electron doped iron-arsenide superconductors
Ba(Fe1- xCox)2As2 has been measured with Angle Resolved Photoemission
Spectroscopy. The data reveal a marked photon energy dependence of points in
momentum space where the bands cross the Fermi energy, a distinctive and direct
signature of three-dimensionality in the Fermi surface topology. By providing a
unique example of high temperature superconductivity hosted in layered
compounds with three-dimensional electronic structure, these findings suggest
that the iron-arsenides are unique materials, quite different from the cuprates
high temperature superconductors.
