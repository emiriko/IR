This paper addresses the data transfer scheduling problem for Grid
environments, presenting a centralized scheduler developed with dynamic and
adaptive features. The algorithm offers a reservation system for user transfer
requests that allocates them transfer times and bandwidth, according to the
network topology and the constraints the user specified for the requests. This
paper presents the projects related to the data transfer field, the design of
the framework for which the scheduler was built, the main features of the
scheduler, the steps for transfer requests rescheduling and two tests that
illustrate the system's behavior for different types of transfer requests.
