We present two ultra-stable lasers based on two vibration insensitive cavity
designs, one with vertical optical axis geometry, the other horizontal.
Ultra-stable cavities are constructed with fused silica mirror substrates,
shown to decrease the thermal noise limit, in order to improve the frequency
stability over previous designs. Vibration sensitivity components measured are
equal to or better than 1.5e-11 per m.s^-2 for each spatial direction, which
shows significant improvement over previous studies. We have tested the very
low dependence on the position of the cavity support points, in order to
establish that our designs eliminate the need for fine tuning to achieve
extremely low vibration sensitivity. Relative frequency measurements show that
at least one of the stabilized lasers has a stability better than 5.6e-16 at 1
second, which is the best result obtained for this length of cavity.
