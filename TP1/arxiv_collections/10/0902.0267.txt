Branching ratios of $\alpha $-decay to members of the ground state rotational
band and excited 0$^{+}$ states of even-even nuclei are calculated in the
framework of the generalized liquid drop model (GLDM) by taking into account
the angular momentum of the $\alpha$-particle and the excitation probability of
the daughter nucleus. The calculation covers isotopic chains from Hg to Fm in
the mass regions $180< A <202$ and A$\geq 224$. The calculated branching ratios
of the $\alpha $-transitions are in good agreement with the experimental data
and some useful predictions are provided for future experiments.
