We present and analyze a model of the frequency of severe terrorist attacks,
which generalizes the recently proposed model of Johnson et al. This model,
which is based on the notion of self-organized criticality and which describes
how terrorist cells might aggregate and disintegrate over time, predicts that
the distribution of attack severities should follow a power-law form with an
exponent of alpha=5/2. This prediction is in good agreement with current
empirical estimates for terrorist attacks worldwide, which give alpha=2.4 \pm
0.2, and which we show is independent of certain details of the model. We close
by discussing the utility of this model for understanding terrorism and the
behavior of terrorist organizations, and mention several productive ways it
could be extended mathematically or tested empirically.
