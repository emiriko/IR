In the framework of the Inert Doublet Model, a very simple extension of the
Standard Model, we study the production and propagation of antimatter in cosmic
rays coming from annihilation of a scalar dark matter particle. We consider
three benchmark candidates, all consistent with the WMAP cosmic abundance and
existing direct detection experiments, and confront the predictions of the
model with the recent PAMELA, ATIC and HESS data. For a light candidate, M_{DM}
= 10 GeV, we argue that the positron and anti-proton fluxes may be large, but
still consistent with expected backgrounds, unless there is an enhancement
(boost factor) in the local density of dark matter. There is also a substantial
anti-deuteron flux which might be observable by future experiments. For a
candidate with M_{DM} = 70 GeV, the contribution to positron and anti-proton
fluxes is much smaller than the expected backgrounds. Even if a boost factor is
invoked to enhance the signals, the candidate is unable to explain the observed
positron and anti-proton excesses. Finally, for a heavy candidate, M_{DM} = 10
TeV, it is possible to fit the PAMELA excess (but, unfortunately, not the ATIC
one) provided there is a large enhancement, either in the local density of dark
matter or through the Sommerfeld effect.
