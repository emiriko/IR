We explore joint observations of the South-East limb made by Hinode, TRACE
and SOHO/SUMER on April 12, 2008 as part of the Whole Heliosphere Interval
(WHI) Quiet Sun Characterization targeted observing program. During the
sequence a large, 10Mm long, macro-spicule was sent upward and crossed the
line-of-sight of the SUMER slit, an event that affords us an opportunity to
study the coupling of cooler chromospheric material to transition region
emission formed as hot as 600,000K. This short article provides preliminary
results of the data analysis.
