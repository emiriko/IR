W-based granular metals have been prepared by electron beam induced
deposition from the tungsten-hexacarbonyl W(CO)6 precursor. In situ electrical
conductivity measurements have been performed to monitor the growth process and
to investigate the behavior of the deposit under electron beam post irradiation
and by exposure to air. During the first part of the growth process, the
electrical conductivity grows non-linearly, independent of the electron beam
parameters. This behavior is interpreted as the result of the increase of the
W-particles diameter. Once the growth process is terminated, the electrical
conductivity decreases with the logarithm of time, sigma ln(t).
Temperature-dependent conductivity measurements of the deposits reveal that the
electrical transport takes place by means of electron tunneling either between
W-metal grains or between grains and trap sites in the matrix. After venting
the electron microscope the electrical conductivity of the deposits shows a
degradation behavior, which depends on the composition. Electron
post-irradiation increases the electrical conductivity of the deposits.
