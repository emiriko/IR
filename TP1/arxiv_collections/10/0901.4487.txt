The effect of a single static impurity on the many-body states and on the
spin and thermal transport in the one-dimensional anisotropic Heisenberg chain
at finite temperatures is studied. Whereas the pure Heisenberg model reveals
Poisson level statistics and dissipationless transport due to integrability, we
show using the numerical approach that a single impurity induces Wigner-Dyson
level statistics and at high enough temperature incoherent transport within the
chain, whereby the relaxation time and d.c. conductivity scale linearly with
length.
