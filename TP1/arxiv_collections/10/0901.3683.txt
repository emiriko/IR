In recent work by two of us, [Durrer & Ruser, PRL 99, 071601 (2007); Ruser &
Durrer PRD 76, 104014 (2007)], graviton production due to a moving spacetime
boundary (braneworld) in a five dimensional bulk has been considered. In the
same way as the presence of a conducting plate modifies the electromagnetic
vacuum, the presence of a brane modifies the graviton vacuum. As the brane
moves, the time dependence of the vacuum leads to particle creation via the so
called 'dynamical Casimir effect'. In our previous work a term in the boundary
condition which is linear in the brane velocity has been neglected. In this
work we develop a new approach which overcomes this approximation. We show that
the previous results are not modified if the brane velocity is low.
