We analyze two different confining mechanisms for L\'{e}vy flights in the
presence of external potentials. One of them is due to a conservative force in
the corresponding Langevin equation. Another is implemented by
Levy-Schroedinger semigroups which induce so-called topological Levy processes
(Levy flights with locally modified jump rates in the master equation). Given a
stationary probability function (pdf) associated with the Langevin-based
fractional Fokker-Planck equation, we demonstrate that generically there exists
a topological L\'{e}vy process with the very same invariant pdf and in the
reverse.
