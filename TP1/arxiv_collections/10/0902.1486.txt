Flavor physics, like cosmology, is likely in need of new basic ideas; the
puzzles of elementary particle mass hierarchies and in particular the e-mu-tau
and neutrino ones still remain mysteries. In this paper a new idea of dynamical
connection between low energy 3-flavor particle mass hierarchies and
electroweak charges is studied with restriction to the simplest case of lepton
flavor phenomenology. The main inference is that it can be only two types of
lepton 3-flavor particle-copy groups: 1) with large and strongly hierarchical
mass ratios and 2) with close to 1 mass ratios. From experimental data
definitely follows that the three charged leptons belong to the first type
whereas the three neutrinos belong to the second type and so are
quasi-degenerate. The inferences of QD-neutrinos with realistic small masses
and oscillation hierarchy parameter and quark-QD-neutrino mixing angle
complementarity follow from the fact of small EW charges and their relation to
the concept of benchmark flavor pattern.
