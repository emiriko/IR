The boson mass spectrum of the electro-weak \textbf{$SU(4)_{L}\otimes
U(1)_{Y}$} model with exotic electric charges is investigated by using the
algebraical approach supplied by the method of exactly solving gauge models
with high symmetries. Our approach predicts for the boson sector a
one-parameter mass scale to be tuned in order to match the data obtained at
LHC, LEP, CDF.
