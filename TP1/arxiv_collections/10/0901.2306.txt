In this paper the effects of vibrations at high frequencies onto a freely
falling two-body system in Schwarzschild spacetime are investigated. As
reference motion of the same system without vibrations a circular orbit around
the central body is considered. The vibrations induce a perturbation on this
motion, whose period is close to the orbital period, in agreement with the
simpler situation of the Shirokov effect \cite{Shirokov:1973gr}. In general
relativity the amplitude of the perturbation is dominated by high velocity
effects, which grow linearly in the radius $r$ of the circular orbit, while the
leading term surviving the Newtonian limit decays as $1/r$. Thus even for very
large radii a significant difference between Newtonian physics and general
relativity is found. We give an estimate of this effect for some molecular
vibrations of a system orbiting around the Earth.
