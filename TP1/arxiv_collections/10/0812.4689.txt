Energy structure of the Peierls gap in orthorhombic TaS$_3$ is examined by
spectral study of photoconduction. The gap edge and energy levels inside the
Peierls gap are observed. The amplitude of the energy levels is found to depend
on both the temperature and the electric field. The electric field of the order
of 10 V/cm affects the energy levels and leads to the redistribution of
intensity between peaks. The small value of the electric field indicates
participation of the collective state in formation of the energy levels inside
the Peierls gap.
