In this paper we show that the space of nodal rational curves, which is so
called a Severi variety (of rational curves), on any non-singular projective
surface is always equipped with a natural Einstein-Weyl structure, if the space
is 3-dimensional. This is a generalization of the Einstein-Weyl structure on
the space of smooth rational curves on a complex surface, given by N.Hitchin.
As geometric objects naturally associated to Einstein-Weyl structure, we
investigate null surfaces and geodesics on the Severi varieties. Also we see
that if the projective surface has an appropriate real structure, then the real
locus of the Severi variety becomes a positive definite Einstein-Weyl manifold.
Moreover we construct various explicit examples of rational surfaces having
3-dimensional Severi varieties of rational curves.
