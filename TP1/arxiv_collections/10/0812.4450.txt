The program of constructing spacetime geometry from string theoretic modular
forms is extended to Calabi-Yau varieties of dimensions two, three, and four,
as well as higher rank motives. Modular forms on the worldsheet can be
constructed from the geometry of spacetime by computing the L-functions
associated to omega motives of Calabi-Yau varieties, generated by their
holomorphic $n-$forms via Galois representations. The modular forms that emerge
from the omega motive and other motives of the intermediate cohomology are
related to characters of the underlying rational conformal field theory. The
converse problem of constructing space from string theory proceeds in the class
of diagonal theories by determining the motives associated to modular forms in
the category of motives with complex multiplication. The emerging picture
indicates that the L-function can be interpreted as a map from the geometric
category of motives to the category of conformal field theories on the
worldsheet.
