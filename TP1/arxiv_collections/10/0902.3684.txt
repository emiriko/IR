A superparamagnetic nanoparticle (SPN) is a nanometre-sized piece of a
material that would, in bulk, be a permanent magnet. In the SPN the individual
atomic spins are aligned via Pauli effects into a single giant moment that has
easy orientations set by shape or magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Above a
size-dependent blocking temperature $T_{b}(V,\tau_{obs})$, thermal fluctuations
destroy the average moment by flipping the giant spin between easy orientations
at a rate that is rapid on the scale of the observation time $\tau_{obs}$.
  We show that, depite the vanising of the average moment, two SPNs experience
a net attractive force of magnetic origin, analogous to the van der Waals force
between molecules that lack a permanent electric dipole. This could be relevant
for ferrofluids, for the clumping of SPNs used for drug delivery, and for
ultra-dense magnetic recording media.
