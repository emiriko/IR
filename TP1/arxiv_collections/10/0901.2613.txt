Supersymmetric models with extended group structure beyond the standard model
are revisited in the framework of general gauge mediation. Sum rules for
sfermion masses are shown to depend genuinely on the group structure, which can
serve as important probes for specific models. The left-right model and models
with extra U(1) are worked out for illustrations. If the couplings of extra
gauge groups are small, supersymmetric hidden valleys of the scale 10-100 GeV
can be naturally constructed in companion of a TeV-scale supersymmetric visible
sector.
