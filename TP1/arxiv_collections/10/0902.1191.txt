Inelastic neutron-scattering experiments on the high-temperature
superconductor La$_{1.855}$Sr$_{0.145}$CuO$_{4}$ reveal a magnetic excitation
gap $\Delta$ that decreases continuously upon application of a magnetic field
perpendicular to the CuO$_2$ planes. The gap vanishes at the critical field
required to induce long-range incommensurate antiferromagnetic order, providing
compelling evidence for a field-induced soft-mode driven quantum phase
transition.
