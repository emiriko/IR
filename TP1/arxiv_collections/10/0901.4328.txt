Blue straggler stars (BSSs) are stars observed to be hotter and bluer than
other stars with the same luminosity in their environment. As such they appear
to be much younger than the rest of the stellar population. Two main channels
have been suggested to produce such stars: (1) collisions between stars in
clusters or (2) mass transfer between, or merger of, the components of
primordial short-period binaries. Here we suggest a third scenario, in which
the progenitor of BSSs are formed in primordial (or dynamically formed)
hierarchical triple stars. In such configurations the dynamical evolution of
the triples through the Kozai mechanism and tidal friction can induce the
formation of very close inner binaries. Angular momentum loss in a magnetized
wind or stellar evolution could then lead to the merger of these binaries (or
to mass transfer between them) and produce BSSs in binary (or triple) systems.
We study this mechanism and its implications and show that it could naturally
explain many of the characteristics of the BSS population in clusters, most
notably the large binary fraction of long period BSS binaries; their unique
period-eccentricity distribution (with typical periods > 700 days); and the
typical location of these BSSs in the color-magnitude diagram, far from the
cluster turn-off point of their host clusters. We suggest that this scenario
has a major (possibly dominant) role in the formation of BSSs in open clusters
and give specific predictions for the the BSSs population formed in this
manner. We also note that triple systems may be the progenitors of the
brightest planetary nebulae in old elliptical galaxies, which possibly evolved
from BSSs.
