It is commonly accepted that Commodities futures and forward prices, in
principle, agree under some simplifying assumptions. One of the most relevant
assumptions is the absence of counterparty risk. Indeed, due to margining,
futures have practically no counterparty risk. Forwards, instead, may bear the
full risk of default for the counterparty when traded with brokers or outside
clearing houses, or when embedded in other contracts such as swaps. In this
paper we focus on energy commodities and on Oil in particular. We use a hybrid
commodities-credit model to asses impact of counterparty risk in pricing
formulas, both in the gross effect of default probabilities and on the subtler
effects of credit spread volatility, commodities volatility and
credit-commodities correlation. We illustrate our general approach with a case
study based on an oil swap, showing that an accurate valuation of counterparty
risk depends on volatilities and correlation and cannot be accounted for
precisely through a pre-defined multiplier.
