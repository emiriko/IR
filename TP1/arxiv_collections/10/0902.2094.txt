Investigating the canonical problem of a periodic multilayered stack
containing isotropic chiral layers, we homogenized it as a uniaxial
bianisotropic medium and derived its effective constitutive parameters. The
stack shows a resonant behavior, when its unit cell consists of a metallic
layer and an isotropic chiral layer. The presence of isotropic chirality can
result in small shifts of the resonance frequency for reasonably large values
of the chirality parameter, implying that the sign of an effective permittivity
can be switched. Such spectral shifts in the dielectric properties can be
potentially useful for spectroscopic purposes.
