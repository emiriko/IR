We present a supersymmetric model with two dark matter (DM) components
explaining the galactic positron excess observed by PAMELA/HEAT and
ATIC/PPB-BETS: One is the conventional (bino-like) lightest supersymmetric
particle (LSP) \chi, and the other is a TeV scale meta-stable neutral singlet
N_D, which is a Dirac fermion (N,N^c). In this model, N_D decays dominantly
into \chi e^+e^- through an R parity preserving dimension 6 operator with the
life time \tau_N\sim 10^{26} sec. We introduce a pair of vector-like superheavy
SU(2) lepton doublets (L,L^c) and lepton singlets (E,E^c). The dimension 6
operator leading to the N_D decay is generated from the leptophilic Yukawa
interactions by W\supset Ne^cE+Lh_dE^c+m_{3/2}l_1L^c with the dimensionless
couplings of order unity, and the gauge interaction by {\cal L}\supset \sqrt{2}
g'\tilde{e}^{c*}e^c\chi + h.c. The superheavy masses of the vector-like leptons
(M_L, M_E\sim 10^{16} GeV) are responsible for the longevity of N_D. The low
energy field spectrum in this model is just the MSSM fields and N_D. Even for
the case that the portion of N_D is much smaller than that of \chi in the total
DM density [{\cal O}(10^{-10}) \lesssim n_{N_D}/n_\chi], the observed positron
excess can be explained by adopting relatively lighter masses of the
vector-like leptons (10^{13} GeV \lesssim M_{L,E} \lesssim 10^{16} GeV). The
smallness of the electron mass is also explained. This model is easily embedded
in the flipped SU(5) grand unification, which is a leptophilic unified theory.
