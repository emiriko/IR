We report density functional calculations of electronic structure and
magnetic properties of ternary iron chalcogenide TlFe$_{2}$Se$_{2}$, which
occurs in the ThCr$_{2}$Si$_{2}$ structure and discuss the results in relation
to the iron-based superconductors. The ground state is antiferromagnetic with
checkerboard order and Fe moment $\sim$ 1.90 $\mu$B. There is strong
magnetoelastic coupling similar to the Fe-based superconductors, reflected in a
sensitivity of the Se position to magnetism. Tl is monovalent in this compound,
providing heavy electron-doping of 0.5 additional carriers per Fe relative to
the parent compounds of the Fe-based superconductors. Other than the change in
electron count, the electronic structure is rather similar to those materials.
In particular, the Fermi surface is closely related to those of the Fe-based
superconductors, except that the electron cylinders are larger, and the hole
sections are suppressed. This removes the tendency towards a spin density wave.
