We present an approach to calculate the atomic bulk solubility in binary
alloys based on the statistical-thermodynamic theory of dilute lattice gas. The
model considers all the appropriate ground states of the alloy and results in a
simple Arrhenius-type temperature dependence determined by a {\it
"low-solubility formation enthalpy"}. This quantity, directly obtainable from
first-principle calculations, is defined as the composition derivative of the
compound formation enthalpy with respect to nearby ground states. We apply the
framework and calculate the solubility of the A specie in A-Ti alloys
(A=Ag,Au,Cd,Co,Cr,Ir,W,Zn). In addition to determining unknown low-temperature
ground states for the eight alloys, we find qualitative agreements with
solubility experimental results. The presented formalism, correct in the
low-solubility limit, should be considered as an appropriate starting point for
determining if more computationally expensive formalisms are otherwise needed.
