We study topological phases of time-reversal invariant singlet
superconductors in three spatial dimensions. In these particle-hole symmetric
systems the topological phases are characterized by an even-numbered winding
number $\nu$. At a two-dimensional (2D) surface the topological properties of
this quantum state manifest themselves through the presence of $\nu$ flavors of
gapless Dirac fermion surface states, which are robust against localization
from random impurities. We construct a tight-binding model on the diamond
lattice that realizes a topologically nontrivial phase, in which the winding
number takes the value $\nu =\pm 2$. Disorder corresponds to a (non-localizing)
random SU(2) gauge potential for the surface Dirac fermions, leading to a
power-law density of states $\rho(\epsilon) \sim \epsilon^{1/7}$. The bulk
effective field theory is proposed to be the (3+1) dimensional SU(2) Yang-Mills
theory with a theta-term at $\theta=\pi$.
