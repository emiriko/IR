In the original BB84 protocol by Bennett and Brassard, an eavesdropper is
detected because his attempts to intercept information result in a quantum bit
error rate (QBER) of at least 25%. Here we design an alternative quantum key
distribution protocol, where Alice and Bob use two mutually unbiased bases with
one of them encoding a "0" and the other one encoding a "1." The security of
the scheme is due to a minimum index transmission error rate (ITER) introduced
by an eavesdropper which increases significantly for higher-dimensional photon
states. This allows for more noise in the transmission line, thereby increasing
the possible distance between Alice and Bob without the need for intermediate
nodes.
