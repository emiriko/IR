We study the entanglement creation between two flux qubits interacting with
electromagnetic field modes. No direct interaction between the qubits exists.
Entanglement is reached using entanglement swapping method by an interference
measurement performed on photons. We discuss the influence of off-resonance and
multi-photon initial states on the qubit-qubit entanglement. The presented
scheme is able to drive an initially separable state of two qubits into an
highly entangled state suitable for quantum information processing.
