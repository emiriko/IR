Using non-equilibrium renormalized perturbation theory, we calculate the
conductance G as a function of temperature T and bias voltage V for an Anderson
model, suitable for describing transport properties through a quantum dot. For
renormalized parameters that correspond to the extreme Kondo limit, we do not
find a simple scaling formula beyond a quadratic dependence in T and V.
However, if valence fluctuations are allowed, we find agreement with recent
experiments.
