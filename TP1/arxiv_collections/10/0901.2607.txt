Nonsequential double ionization (NSDI) of helium in an intense few-cycle
laser pulse is investigated by applying the three-dimensional semi-classical
re-scattering method. It is found that the momentum distribution of He$^{2+}$
shows a single-double-single peak structure as the pulse intensity increases.
According to the different mechanisms dominating the NSDI process, the laser
intensity can be classified into three regimes where the momentum distribution
of He$^{2+}$ exhibits different characteristics. In the relatively high
intensity regime, an NSDI mechanism named the "laser-assisted collision
ionization" is found to be dominating the NSDI process and causing the single
peak structure. This result can shed light on the study of non-sequential
ionization of a highly charged ion in a relatively intense laser pulse.
