The transition magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments of the
radiative decays of the sextet heavy flavored spin 3/2 to the heavy spin 1/2
baryons are calculated within the light cone QCD sum rules approach. Using the
obtained results, the decay rate for these transitions are also computed and
compared with the existing predictions of the other approaches.
