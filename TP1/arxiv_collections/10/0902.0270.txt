This paper presents a study of electron spin dynamics in bulk GaAs at low
temperatures for elevated optical excitation conditions. Our time-resolved
Faraday rotation measurements yield sub-nanosecond electron spin
dephasing-times over a wide range of n-doping concentrations in quantitative
agreement with a microscopic treatment of electron spin dynamics. The
calculation shows the occurrence and breakdown of motional narrowing for spin
dephasing under elevated excitation conditions. We also find a peak of the spin
dephasing time around a doping density for which, under lower excitation
conditions, a metal-insulator transition occurs. However, the experimental
results for high excitation can be explained without a metal-insulator
transition. We therefore attribute the peak in spin-dephasing times to the
influence of screening and scattering on the spin-dynamics of the excited
electrons.
