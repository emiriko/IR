Translocation through a nanopore is a new experimental technique to probe
physical properties of biomolecules. A bulk of theoretical and computational
work exists on the dependence of the time to translocate a single unstructured
molecule on the length of the molecule. Here, we study the same problem but for
RNA molecules for which the breaking of the secondary structure is the main
barrier for translocation. To this end, we calculate the mean translocation
time of single-stranded RNA through a nanopore of zero thickness and at zero
voltage for many randomly chosen RNA sequences. We find the translocation time
to depend on the length of the RNA molecule with a power law. The exponent
changes as a function of temperature and exceeds the naively expected exponent
of two for purely diffusive transport at all temperatures. We interpret the
power law scaling in terms of diffusion in a one-dimensional energy landscape
with a logarithmic barrier.
