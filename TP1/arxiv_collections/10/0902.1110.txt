We investigate the possibility of calculating the parameters of few-body
resonances using the oscillator trap boundary conditions. We place the few-body
system in an oscillator trap and calculate the energy spectrum and the strength
function of a suitably chosen transition. Broader resonances are identified as
Lorentzian peaks in the strength function. Narrower resonances are identified
through the pattern of avoided crossings in the spectrum of the system as
function of the trap size. As an example we calculate 0+ resonances in 12C
within the 3-alpha model.
