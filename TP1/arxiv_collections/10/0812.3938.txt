We present a new formulation of effective field theory for nucleon-nucleon
(NN) interactions which treats pion interactions perturbatively, and we offer
evidence that the expansion converges satisfactorily to third order in the
expansion, which we have computed analytically for s and d wave NN scattering.
Starting with the Kaplan-Savage-Wise (KSW) expansion about the nontrivial fixed
point corresponding to infinite NN scattering length, we cure the convergence
problems with that theory by summing to all orders the singular short distance
part of the pion tensor interaction. This method makes possible a host of high
precision analytic few-body calculations in nuclear physics.
