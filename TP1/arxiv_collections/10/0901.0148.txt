In order to achieve both fast and coordinated data transfer to collaborative
sites as well as to create a distribution of data over multiple sites,
efficient data movement is one of the most essential aspects in distributed
environment. With such capabilities at hand, truly distributed task scheduling
with minimal latencies would be reachable by internationally distributed
collaborations (such as ones in HENP) seeking for scavenging or maximizing on
geographically spread computational resources. But it is often not all clear
(a) how to move data when available from multiple sources or (b) how to move
data to multiple compute resources to achieve an optimal usage of available
resources. We present a method of creating a Constraint Programming (CP) model
consisting of sites, links and their attributes such as bandwidth for grid
network data transfer also considering user tasks as part of the objective
function for an optimal solution. We will explore and explain trade-off between
schedule generation time and divergence from the optimal solution and show how
to improve and render viable the solution's finding time by using search tree
time limit, approximations, restrictions such as symmetry breaking or grouping
similar tasks together, or generating sequence of optimal schedules by
splitting the input problem. Results of data transfer simulation for each case
will also include a well known Peer-2-Peer model, and time taken to generate a
schedule as well as time needed for a schedule execution will be compared to a
CP optimal solution. We will additionally present a possible implementation
aimed to bring a distributed datasets (multiple sources) to a given site in a
minimal time.
