We work out a superstatistical description of high-energy scattering
processes that takes into account temperature fluctuations in small volume
elements. For Gamma-distributed fluctuations of the inverse temperature one
effectively obtains formulas similar to those used in nonextensive statistical
mechanics, whereas for other temperature distributions more general
superstatistical models arise. We consider two main examples: Scattering
processes of cosmic ray particles and e+e- annihilation processes. In both
cases one obtains excellent fits of experimentally measured energy spectra and
cross sections.
