We prove clustering estimates for the truncated correlations, i.e., cumulants
of an unbounded spin system on the lattice. We provide a unified treatment,
based on cluster expansion techniques, of four different regimes: large mass,
small interaction between sites, large self-interaction, as well as the more
delicate small self-interaction or `low temperature' regime. A clustering
estimate in the latter regime is needed for the Bosonic case of the recent
result obtained by Lukkarinen and Spohn on the rigorous control on kinetic
scales of quantum fluids.
