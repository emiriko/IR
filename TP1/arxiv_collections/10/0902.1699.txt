A small prototype of a finely granulated digital hadron calorimeter with
Resistive Plate Chambers as active elements was exposed to positrons of 1 . 16
GeV energy from the Fermilab test beam. The response function, energy
resolution, as well as measurements of the shape of electromagnetic showers are
presented. The data are compared to a Monte Carlo simulation of the set-up.
