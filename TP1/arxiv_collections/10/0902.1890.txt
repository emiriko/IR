Using in-field single crystal neutron diffraction we have determined the
magnetic structure of TbMnO3 in the high field P||a phase. We unambiguously
establish that the ferroelectric polarization arises from a cycloidal Mn spins
ordering, with spins rotating in the ab plane. Our results demonstrate directly
that the flop of the ferroelectric polarization in TbMnO3 with applied magnetic
field is caused from the flop of the Mn cycloidal plane.
