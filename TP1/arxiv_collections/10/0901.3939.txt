Maps are an important source of information in archaeology and other
sciences. Users want to search for historical maps to determine recorded
history of the political geography of regions at different eras, to find out
where exactly archaeological artifacts were discovered, etc. Currently, they
have to use a generic search engine and add the term map along with other
keywords to search for maps. This crude method will generate a significant
number of false positives that the user will need to cull through to get the
desired results. To reduce their manual effort, we propose an automatic map
identification, indexing, and retrieval system that enables users to search and
retrieve maps appearing in a large corpus of digital documents using simple
keyword queries. We identify features that can help in distinguishing maps from
other figures in digital documents and show how a Support-Vector-Machine-based
classifier can be used to identify maps. We propose map-level-metadata e.g.,
captions, references to the maps in text, etc. and document-level metadata,
e.g., title, abstract, citations, how recent the publication is, etc. and show
how they can be automatically extracted and indexed. Our novel ranking
algorithm weights different metadata fields differently and also uses the
document-level metadata to help rank retrieved maps. Empirical evaluations show
which features should be selected and which metadata fields should be weighted
more. We also demonstrate improved retrieval results in comparison to
adaptations of existing methods for map retrieval. Our map search engine has
been deployed in an online map-search system that is part of the Blind-Review
digital library system.
