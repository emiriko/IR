We present interferometric angular sizes for 12 stars with known planetary
companions, for comparison with 28 additional main-sequence stars not known to
host planets. For all objects we estimate bolometric fluxes and reddenings
through spectral energy distribution fits, and in conjunction with the angular
sizes, measurements of effective temperature. The angular sizes of these stars
are sufficiently small that the fundamental resolution limits of our primary
instrument, the Palomar Testbed Interferometer, are investigated at the
sub-milliarcsecond level and empirically established based upon known
performance limits. We demonstrate that the effective temperature scale as a
function of dereddened $(V-K)_0$ color is statistically identical for stars
with and without planets. A useful byproduct of this investigation is a direct
calibration of the $T_{\rm EFF}$ scale for solar-like stars, as a function of
both spectral type and $(V-K)_0$ color, with an precision of $\bar{\Delta
T}_{\rm {(V-K)}_0} = 138$K over the range $(V-K)_0=0.0-4.0$ and $\bar{\Delta
T}_{\rm {SpType}} = 105$K for the range F6V -- G5V. Additionally, we provide in
an appendix spectral energy distribution fits for the 166 stars with known
planets which have sufficient photometry available in the literature for such
fits; this derived "{\tt XO-Rad}" database includes homogenous estimates of
bolometric flux, reddening, and angular size.
