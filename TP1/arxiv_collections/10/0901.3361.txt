We prove the Morrison-Kawamata cone conjecture for klt Calabi-Yau pairs in
dimension 2. That is, for a large class of rational surfaces as well as K3
surfaces and abelian surfaces, the action of the automorphism group of the
surface on the convex cone of ample divisors has a rational polyhedral
fundamental domain. More concretely: there many be infinitely many curves with
negative self-intersection on the surface, but all such curves fall into
finitely many orbits under the automorphism group of the surface. The proof
uses the geometry of groups acting on hyperbolic space.
  We deduce a characterization of the surfaces in this class with finitely
generated Cox ring.
