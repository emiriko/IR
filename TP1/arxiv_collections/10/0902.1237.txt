Graphene epoxide, with oxygen atoms lining up on pristine graphene sheets, is
investigated theoretically in this Letter. Two distinct phases: metastable
clamped and unzipped structures are unveiled in consistence with experiments.
In the stable (unzipped) phase, epoxy group breaks underneath sp2 bond and
modifies the mechanical and electronic properties of graphene remarkably. The
foldable epoxy ring structure reduces its Young's modulus by 42.4%, while
leaves the tensile strength almost unchanged. Epoxidation also perturbs the pi
state and opens semiconducting gap for both phases, with dependence on the
density of epoxidation. In the unzipped structures, localized states revealed
near the Fermi level resembles the edge states in graphene nanoribbons. The
study reported here paves the way for oxidation-based functionalization of
graphene-related materials.
