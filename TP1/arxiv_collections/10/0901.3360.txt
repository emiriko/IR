The PHENIX experiment at RHIC has measured $\omega$ and $\phi$ mesons in
$p+p$, $d+Au$ and $Au+Au$ collisions at \sqn = 200 GeV via both hadronic and
di-electron decay channels. The transverse momentum spectra as measured in
different decay modes and at different centralities are shown and discussed
here.
