We consider the problem of uniform sampling of points on an algebraic
variety. Specifically, we develop a randomized algorithm that, given a small
set of multivariate polynomials over a sufficiently large finite field,
produces a common zero of the polynomials almost uniformly at random. The
statistical distance between the output distribution of the algorithm and the
uniform distribution on the set of common zeros is polynomially small in the
field size, and the running time of the algorithm is polynomial in the
description of the polynomials and their degrees provided that the number of
the polynomials is a constant.
