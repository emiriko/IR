We study the influence of field diffusion on the spatial localized structures
(cavity solitons) recently predicted in bidirectional lasers. We find twofold
positive role of the diffusion: 1) it increases the stability range of the
individual (isolated) solitons; 2) it reduces the long-range interaction
between the cavity solitons. Latter allows the independent manipulation
(writing and erasing) of individual cavity solitons.
