Many X-ray observations of GigaHertz Peaked Spectrum and Compact Steep
Spectrum sources have been made with Chandra X-ray Observatory and XMM-Newton
Observatory over the last few years. The X-ray spectra contribute the important
information to the total energy distribution of the compact radio sources. In
addition the spatial resolution of Chandra allows for studies of the X-ray
morphology of these sources on arcsec scales and provide a direct view of their
environments. This paper gives a review of the current status of the X-ray
observations and their contribution to our understanding of the nature of these
compact radio sources. It also describes primary physical processes that lead
to the observed X-ray emission and summarize X-ray emission properties expected
from interactions between an expanding radio source and the intergalactic
environment.
