We present a continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocol combining
a discrete modulation and reverse reconciliation. This protocol is proven
unconditionally secure and allows the distribution of secret keys over long
distances, thanks to a reverse reconciliation scheme efficient at very low
signal-to-noise ratio.
