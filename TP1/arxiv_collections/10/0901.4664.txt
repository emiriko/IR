Let Q_0 denote the rational numbers expanded to a meadow by totalizing
inversion such that 0^{-1}=0. Q_0 can be expanded by a total sign function s
that extracts the sign of a rational number. In this paper we discuss an
extension Q_0(s ,\sqrt) of the signed rationals in which every number has a
unique square root.
