We revisit the problem of why stars become red giants. We modify the physics
of a standard stellar evolution code in order to determine what does and what
does not contribute to a star becoming a red giant. In particular, we have run
tests to try to separate the effects of changes in the mean molecular weight
and in the energy generation. The implications for why stars become red giants
are discussed. We find that while a change in the mean molecular weight is
necessary (but not sufficient) for a 1 solar mass star to become a red giant,
this is not the case in a star of 5 solar masses. It therefore seems that there
may be more than one way to make a giant.
