We reappraise the question whether the Standard Model, and Minimal Flavor
Violating (MFV) models at large, can simultaneously describe the observed CP
violation in the K- and Bd-systems. We find that CP violation in the Bd-system,
measured most precisely through (sin 2 beta)_{J/psi Ks}, implies
|epsilon_K^{SM}| = 1.78(25) x 10^{-3} for the parameter epsilon_K, measuring
indirect CP violation in the K-system, to be compared with the experimental
value |epsilon_K^{exp}| = 2.23(1) x 10^{-3}. To bring this prediction to 1
sigma agreement with experiment, we explore then the simplest new-physics
possibility not involving new phases, namely that of MFV scenarios with no new
effective operators besides the Standard Model ones. We emphasize the crucial
input and/or measurements to be improved in order to probe this case. In
particular we point out that this tension could be removed in this framework,
with interesting signatures, e.g. correlated suppression patterns for rare K
decay branching ratios. On the other hand, MFV contributions from new operators
appear, in the calculable case of the MSSM, to worsen the situation. We finally
explore some well-motivated new-physics scenarios beyond MFV, like those
involving generic new contributions in Z-penguins.
