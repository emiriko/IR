In enlarging the field content of pure Yang-Mills theory to a cutoff
dependent matrix valued complex scalar field, we construct a vectorial
operator, which is by definition invariant with respect to the gauge
transformation of the Yang-Mills field and with respect to a Stueckelberg type
gauge transformation of the scalar field. This invariant operator converges to
the original Yang-Mills field as the cutoff goes to infinity. With the help of
cutoff functions, we construct with this invariant a regularized action for the
pure Yang-Mills theory. In order to be able to define both the gauge and scalar
fields kinetic terms, other invariant terms are added to the action. Since the
scalar fields flat measure is invariant under the Stueckelberg type gauge
transformation, we obtain a regularized gauge-invariant path integral for pure
Yang-Mills theory that is mathematically well defined. Moreover, the
regularized Ward-Takahashi identities describing the dynamics of the gauge
fields are exactly the same as the formal Ward-Takahashi identities of the
unregularized theory.
