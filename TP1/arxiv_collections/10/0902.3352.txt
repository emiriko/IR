We consider nonlinear parabolic evolution equations of the form
$\partial_{t}u=F(t,x,Du,D^{2}u) $, subject to noise of the form $H(x,Du) \circ
dB$ where $H$ is linear in $Du$ and $\circ dB$ denotes the Stratonovich
differential of a multidimensional Brownian motion. Motivated by the
essentially pathwise results of [Lions, P.-L. and Souganidis, P.E.; Fully
nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris
S\'{e}r. I Math. 326 (1998), no. 9] we propose the use of rough path analysis
[Lyons, T. J.; Differential equations driven by rough signals. Rev. Mat.
Iberoamericana 14 (1998), no. 2, 215--310] in this context. Although the core
arguments are entirely deterministic, a continuity theorem allows for various
probabilistic applications (limit theorems, support, large deviations, ...).
