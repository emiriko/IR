We introduce a class of Markov processes, called $m$-polynomial, for which
the calculation of (mixed) moments up to order $m$ only requires the
computation of matrix exponentials. This class contains affine processes,
processes with quadratic diffusion coefficients, as well as L\'evy-driven SDEs
with affine vector fields. Thus, many popular models such as exponential L\'evy
models or affine models are covered by this setting. The applications range
from statistical GMM estimation procedures to new techniques for option pricing
and hedging. For instance, the efficient and easy computation of moments can be
used for variance reduction techniques in Monte Carlo methods.
