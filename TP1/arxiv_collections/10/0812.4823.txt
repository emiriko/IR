Departing from a system of two non-autonomous amplitude equations,
demonstrating hyperbolic chaotic dynamics, we construct a 1D medium as ensemble
of such local elements introducing spatial coupling via diffusion. When the
length of the medium is small, all spatial cells oscillate synchronously,
reproducing the local hyperbolic dynamics. This regime is characterized by a
single positive Lyapunov exponent. The hyperbolicity survives when the system
gets larger in length so that the second Lyapunov exponent passes zero, and the
oscillations become inhomogeneous in space. However, at a point where the third
Lyapunov exponent becomes positive, some bifurcation occurs that results in
violation of the hyperbolicity due to the emergence of one-dimensional
intersections of contracting and expanding tangent subspaces along trajectories
on the attractor. Further growth of the length results in two-dimensional
intersections of expanding and contracting subspaces that we classify as a
stronger type of the violation. Beyond of the point of the hyperbolicity loss,
the system demonstrates an extensive spatiotemporal chaos typical for extended
chaotic systems: when the length of the system increases the Kaplan-Yorke
dimension, the number of positive Lyapunov exponents, and the upper estimate
for Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy grow linearly, while the Lyapunov spectrum tends
to a limiting curve.
