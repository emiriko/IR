We give various estimates of the minimal number of self-intersections of a
nontrivial element of the kth term of the lower central series and derived
series of the fundamental group of a surface. As an application, we obtain a
new topological proof of the fact that free groups and fundamental groups of
closed surfaces are residually nilpotent. Along the way, we prove that a
nontrivial element of the kth term of the lower central series of a nonabelian
free group has to have word length at least $k$ in a free generating set.
