The layered manganese oxides LnBaMn1.96Fe0.04Oy (Ln=Y, Gd, Sm, Nd, Pr, La)
have been synthesized for y=5, 5.5 and 6. In the oxygen-saturated state (y=6)
they exhibit the charge and orbital order at ambient temperature for Ln=Y, Gd,
Sm, but unordered eg-electronic system for Ln=La,Pr,Nd. Fourfold increase of
quadrupole splitting was observed owing to the charge and orbital ordering.
This is in agreement with the jumplike increase in distortion of the reduced
perovskite-like cell for the charge and orbitally ordered manganites compared
to the unordered ones. Substitution of 2 percents of Mn by Fe suppresses the
temperatures of structural and magnetic transitions by 20 to 50 K. Parameters
of the crystal lattices and the room-temperature M\"{o}ssbauer spectra were
studied on forty samples whose structures were refined within five symmetry
groups: P4/mmm, P4/nmm, Pm-3m, Icma and P2/m. Overwhelming majority of the Fe
species are undifferentiated in the M\"{o}ssbauer spectra for most of the
samples. Such the single-component spectra in the two-site structures are
explained by the preference of Fe towards the site of Mn(III) and by the
segmentation of the charge and orbitally ordered domains.
