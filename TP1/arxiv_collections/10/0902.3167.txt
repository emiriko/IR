We investigate the capability of the UBVRIJHK photometric system to quantify
star clusters in terms of age, metallicity and color excess by their integrated
photometry in the framework of PEGASE single stellar population (SSP) models.
The age-metallicity-extinction degeneracy was analyzed for various parameter
combinations, assuming different levels of photometric accuracy. We conclude,
that most of the parameter degeneracies, typical to the UBVRI photometric
system, are broken in the case when the photometry data are supplemented with
at least one infrared magnitude of the JHK passbands, with an accuracy better
than ~0.05 mag. The presented analysis with no preassumptions on the
distribution of photometric errors of star cluster models, provides estimate of
the intrinsic capability of any photometric system to determine star cluster
parameters from integrated photometry.
