The strange quark helicity distribution Delta s(x)is derived at LO from the
semi-inclusive and inclusive spin asymmetries measured by the COMPASS
experiment at CERN. The significance of the results is found to depend
critically on the ratio of the sbar and u quark fragmentation functions into
positive kaons.
