This thesis discusses how the pure spinor formalism can be used to
efficiently compute superstring scattering amplitudes. We emphasize the pure
spinor superspace form of the kinematic factors, where the simplifying features
of this language have allowed an explicit relation among the massless
four-point amplitudes at tree-level, one- and two-loops to be found. We show
how these identities elegantly simplify the task of computing the amplitudes
for all possible external state combination related by supersymmetry. In
particular, the two-loop amplitudes involving fermionic states had never been
computed before.
  By explicit calculation we show that the one- and two-loop amplitudes
computed with the minimal and non-minimal formalisms are equivalent.
Furthermore we compute the gauge variation of the massless six-point open
string amplitude and obtain the kinematic factor related to the anomaly
cancellation. We also discuss some preliminary results regarding the massless
five-point amplitude at one-loop.
