We consider here a generalization of a well known discrete dynamical system
produced by the bisection of reflection angles that are constructed recursively
between two lines in the Euclidean plane. It is shown that similar properties
of such systems are observed when the plane is replaced by a regular surface in
${\mathbb R}^3$ and lines are replaced by geodesics. An application of our
results to the classification of points on the surface as elliptic, hyperbolic
or parabolic is also presented.
