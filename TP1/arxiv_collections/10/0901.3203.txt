We present an algorithm to detect the time and frequency difference of
independent clocks based on observation of time-correlated photon pairs. This
enables remote coincidence identification in entanglement-based quantum key
distribution schemes without dedicated coincidence hardware, pulsed sources
with a timing structure or very stable reference clocks. We discuss the method
for typical operating conditions, and show that the requirement in reference
clock accuracy can be relaxed by about 5 orders of magnitude in comparison with
previous schemes.
