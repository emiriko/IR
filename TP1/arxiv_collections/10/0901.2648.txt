The equations describing the Kaluza-Klein reduction of conformally flat
spaces are investigated in arbitrary dimensions. Special classes of solution
related to pseudo-Kahler and para-Kahler structures are constructed and
classified according to spacetime dimension, signature and gauge field rank.
Remarkably, rank two solutions include gravitational kinks together with their
centripetal and centrifugal deformations.
