The anomalous magneto-transport properties in electron doped (n-type)
cuprates were investigated using Hall measurements at THz frequencies. The
complex Hall angle was measured in overdoped Pr$_{\rm 2-x}$Ce$_{\rm
x}$CuO$_{\rm 4}$ samples (x=0.17 and 0.18) as a continuous function of
temperature above $T_c$ at excitation energies 5.24 and 10.5 meV. The results,
extrapolated to low temperatures, show that inelastic scattering introduces
electron-like contributions to the Hall response. First principle calculations
of the Hall angle that include current vertex corrections (CVC) induced by
electron interactions mediated by magnetic fluctuations in the Hall
conductivity reproduce the temperature, frequency, and doping dependence of the
experimental data. These results show that CVC effects are the source of the
anomalous Hall transport properties in overdoped n$\text{-}$type cuprates.
