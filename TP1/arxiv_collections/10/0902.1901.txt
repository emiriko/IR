In this work we study the properties of maximal and minimal curves of genus 3
over finite fields with discriminant -19. We prove that any such curve can be
given by an explicit equation of certain form. Using these equations we obtain
a table of maximal and minimal curves over finite fields with discriminant -19
of cardinality up to 997. We also show that existence of a maximal curve
implies that there is no minimal curve and vice versa.
