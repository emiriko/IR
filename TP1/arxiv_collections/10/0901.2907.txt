We present mid-infrared Period-Luminosity relations for Cepheids in the Local
Group galaxy IC1613. Using archival IRAC imaging data from Spitzer we were able
to measure single-epoch magnitudes for five, 7 to 50-day, Cepheids at 3.6 and
4.5 microns. When fit to the calibrating relations, measured for the Large
Magellanic Cloud Cepheids, the data give apparent distance moduli of 24.29 +/-
0.07 and 24.28 +/- 0.07 at 3.6 and 4.5 microns, respectively. A
multi-wavelength fit to previously published BVRIJHK apparent moduli and the
two IRAC moduli gives a true distance modulus of 24.27 +/- 0.02 mag with E(B-V)
= 0.08 mag, and a corresponding metric distance of 715 kpc. Given that these
results are based on single-phase observations derived from exposures having
total integration times of only 1,000 sec/pixel we suggest that Cepheids out to
about 2 Mpc are accessible to Spitzer with modest integration times during its
warm mission. We identify the main limiting factor to this method to be
crowding/contamination induced by the ubiquitous population of infrared-bright
AGB stars.
