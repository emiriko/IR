A generalized notion of higher order nonclassicality (in terms of higher
order moments) is introduced. Under this generalized framework of higher order
nonclassicality, conditions of higher order squeezing and higher order
subpoissonian photon statistics are derived. A simpler form of the Hong-Mandel
higher order squeezing criterion is derived under this framework by using an
operator ordering theorem introduced by us in [J. Phys. A. 33 (2000) 5607]. It
is also generalized for multi-photon Bose operators of Brandt and Greenberg.
Similarly, condition for higher order subpoissonian photon statistics is
derived by normal ordering of higher powers of number operator. Further, with
the help of simple density matrices, it is shown that the higher order
antibunching (HOA) and higher order subpoissonian photon statistics (HOSPS) are
not the manifestation of the same phenomenon and consequently it is incorrect
to use the condition of HOA as a test of HOSPS. It is also shown that the HOA
and HOSPS may exist even in absence of the corresponding lower order
phenomenon. Binomial state, nonlinear first order excited squeezed state
(NLESS) and nonlinear vacuum squeezed state (NLVSS) are used as examples of
quantum state and it is shown that these states may show higher order
nonclssical characteristics. It is observed that the Binomial state which is
always antibunched, is not always higher order squeezed and NLVSS which shows
higher order squeezing does not show HOSPS and HOA. The opposite is observed in
NLESS and consequently it is established that the HOSPS and HOS are two
independent signatures of higher order nonclassicality
