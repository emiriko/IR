Using soft-collinear effective theory (SCET), which provides a unified
framework for factorization, resummation of logarithms, and incorporation of
universal nonperturbative functions in hard-scattering QCD cross-sections, we
present a new prediction of angularity distributions in e+e- annihilation.
Angularities tau_a are an infinite class of event shapes which vary in their
sensitivity to the substructure of jets in the final state, controlled by a
continuous parameter a<2. We calculate angularity distributions for all a<1 to
first order in the strong coupling alpha_s and resum large logarithms in these
distributions to next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy. Our expressions
for the next-to-leading order (NLO) O(alpha_s) partonic jet and soft functions
in the factorization theorem for angularity distributions are given for the
first time. We employ a model for the nonperturbative soft function with a gap
parameter which cancels the renormalon ambiguity in the partonic soft function.
We explore the relation between the SCET approach to resummation and past
approaches in QCD, and discuss the advantages of the effective theory approach.
In addition, we draw from the NLO calculations of the jet and soft functions an
intuitive lesson about how factorization breaks down in the effective theory as
a->1.
