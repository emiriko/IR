Infrared modifications of gravity have been proposed over the years as
potentially useful phenomenological models. Massive (multi)-gravity is an
interesting class of such theories. The true nature and the ultimate
consistency of many of these models remains, however, unclear as one is
frequently faced with important problems, e.g. classical instabilities and
strong coupling problems which are hard to resolve without a known UV
completion of the theory. In this note, we review a recent attempt to study
some of these well known problems with the use of the AdS/CFT correspondence.
In this context, products of large-N conformal field theories coupled by
multi-trace interactions in diverse dimensions are used to define quantum
multi-gravity (multi-string/M theory) on a union of (asymptotically) AdS
spaces. One-loop effects generate a small O(1/N) mass for the gravitons and
provide non-trivial examples of massive multi-graviton theories.
