In this article, we consider the finite temperature Casimir effect in
Kaluza-Klein spacetime due the the vacuum fluctuation of massless scalar field
with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We consider the general case where the
extra dimensions (internal space) can be any compact connected manifold or
orbifold without boundaries. Using piston analysis, we show that the Casimir
force is always attractive at any temperature, regardless of the geometry of
the internal space. Moreover, the magnitude of the Casimir force increases as
the size of the internal space increases and it reduces to the Casimir force in
(3+1)-dimensional Minskowski spacetime when the size of the internal space
shrinks to zero. In the other extreme where the internal space is large, the
Casimir force can increase beyond all bound. Asymptotic behaviors of the
Casimir force in the low and high temperature regimes are derived and it is
observed that the magnitude of the Casimir force grows linearly with
temperature in the high temperature regime.
