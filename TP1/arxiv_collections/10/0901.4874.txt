The LCTPC collaboration is developing a time projection chamber (TPC) for a
future linear collider. In the ILD concept for an ILC detector a TPC is
foreseen as main tracking device. In order to get measurable signals on the
anode, the primary electrons, produced by charged particles traversing the TPC,
have to be multiplied. For this purpose gas electron multipliers (GEMs) can be
used. Studies of these GEMs are performed at the DESY FLC group and presented
in the following.
