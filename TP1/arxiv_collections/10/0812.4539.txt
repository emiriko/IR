We present tunneling data from optimally-doped, superconducting
BaFe1.86Co0.14As2 and its parent compound, BaFe2As2. In the superconductor,
clear coherence-like peaks are seen across the whole field of view, and their
analysis reveals nanoscale variations in the superconducting gap value, Delta.
The average magnitude of 2Delta is ~7.4 kBTC, which exceeds the BCS weak
coupling value for either s- or d-wave superconductivity. The characteristic
length scales of the deviations from the average gap value, and of an
anti-correlation discovered between the gap magnitude and the zero bias
conductance, match well with the average separation between the Co dopant ions
in the superconducting FeAs planes. The tunneling spectra themselves possess a
peak-dip-hump lineshape, suggestive of a coupling of the superconducting
electronic system to a well-defined bosonic mode of energy 4.7 kBTC, such as
the spin resonance observed recently in inelastic neutron scattering.
