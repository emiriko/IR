It was shown recently that Frobenius reduction of the matrix fields reveals
interesting relations among the nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)
integrable by the Inverse Spectral Transform Method ($S$-integrable PDEs),
linearizable by the
  Hoph-Cole substitution ($C$-integrable PDEs) and integrable by the method of
characteristics ($Ch$-integrable PDEs). However, only two classes of
$S$-integrable PDEs have been involved: soliton equations like Korteweg-de
Vries, Nonlinear Shr\"odinger, Kadomtsev-Petviashvili and Davey-Stewartson
equations, and $GL(N,\CC)$ Self-dual type PDEs, like Yang-Mills equation. In
this paper we consider the simple five-dimensional nonlinear PDE from another
class of $S$-integrable PDEs, namely, scalar nonlinear PDE which is
commutativity condition of the pair of vector fields. We show its origin from
the (1+1)-dimensional hierarchy of $Ch$-integrable PDEs after certain
composition of Frobenius type and differential reductions imposed on the matrix
fields. Matrix generalization of the above scalar nonlinear PDE will be derived
as well.
