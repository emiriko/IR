Making use of numerous resonances discovered by the Crystal Barrel
Collaboration we discuss some possible relations between the baryon and meson
spectra of resonances composed of the light non-strange quarks. Our goal is to
indicate new features that should be reproduced by the realistic dynamical
models describing the hadron spectrum in the sector of light quarks.
