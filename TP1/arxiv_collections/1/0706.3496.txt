The contribution to the eighth-order anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) of the
electron from a set of diagrams without closed lepton loops is recalculated
using a new FORTRAN code generated by an automatic code generator. Comparing
the contributions of individual diagrams of old and new calculations, we found
an inconsistency in the old treatment of infrared subtraction terms in two
diagrams. Correcting this error leads to the revised value -1.9144 (35)
(alpha/pi)^4 for the eighth-order term. This theoretical change induces the
shift of the inverse of the fine structure constant by -6.41180(73)x10^{-7}.
