Matter-wave interferometry has been largely studied in the last few years.
Usually, the main problem in the analysis of the diffraction experiments is to
establish the causes for the loss of coherence observed in the interference
pattern. In this work, we use different type of environmental couplings to
model a two slit diffraction experiment with massive particles. For each model,
we study the effects of decoherence on the interference pattern and define a
visibility function that measures the loss of contrast of the interference
fringes on a distant screen. Finally, we apply our results to the experimental
reported data on massive particles $C_{70}$.
