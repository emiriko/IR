In recent years, advances in computational power and spatial data analysis
(GIS, remote sensing, etc) have led to an increase in attempts to model the
spread and behaviour of wildland fires across the landscape. This series of
review papers endeavours to critically and comprehensively review all types of
surface fire spread models developed since 1990. This paper reviews models of
an empirical or quasi-empirical nature. These models are based solely on the
statistical analysis of experimentally obtained data with or without some
physical framework for the basis of the relations. Other papers in the series
review models of a physical or quasi-physical nature, and mathematical
analogues and simulation models. The main relations of empirical models are
that of wind speed and fuel moisture content with rate of forward spread.
Comparisons are made of the different functional relationships selected by
various authors for these variables.
