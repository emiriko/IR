A persistent kink in the pressure dependence of the \hidden order" (HO)
transition temperature of URu2-xRexSi2 is observed at a critical pressure Pc=15
kbar for 0 < x < 0.08. In URu2Si2, the kink at Pc is accompanied by the
destruction of superconductivity; a change in the magnitude of a spin
excitation gap, determined from electrical resistivity measurements; and a
complete gapping of a portion of the Fermi surface (FS), inferred from a change
in scattering and the competition between the HO state and superconductivity
for FS fraction.
