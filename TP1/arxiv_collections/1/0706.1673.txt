Two concepts named atom solution and combinatory solution are defined. The
classification of all single traveling wave atom solutions to Sinh-G{\"o}rdon
equation is obtained, and qualitative properties of solutions are discussed. In
particular, we point out that some qualitative properties derived intuitively
from dynamic system method aren't true. In final, we prove that our solutions
to Sinh-G{\"o}rdon equation include all solutions obtained in the paper[Fu Z T
et al, Commu. in Theor. Phys.(Beijing) 2006 45 55]. Through an example, we show
how to give some new identities on Jacobian elliptic functions.
