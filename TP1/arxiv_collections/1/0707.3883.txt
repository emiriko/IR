Nanocrystalline (Th1-xFex)O2-d particles with different Fe concentrations (x
= 0.0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 and 0.25) have been prepared by a gel combustion
method. Rietveld refinement analyses of X-ray diffraction data revealed the
formation of an impurity free cubic type Th1-xFexO2-d structure up to x = 0.20.
This observation is further confirmed from the detailed studies conducted on 10
at. percent Fe doped ThO2 using high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM) imaging and indexing of the selected-area electron
diffraction (SAED) patterns. DC Magnetization studies as a function field
indicate that they are ferromagnetic with Curie temperature (Tc) well above
room temperature.
