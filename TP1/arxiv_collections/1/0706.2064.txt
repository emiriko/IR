This paper presents a modeling study of the oxidation of cyclohexane from low
to intermediate temperature (650-1050 K), including the negative temperature
coefficient (NTC) zone. A detailed kinetic mechanism has been developed using
computer-aided generation. This comprehensive low-temperature mechanism
involves 513 species and 2446 reactions and includes two additions of
cyclohexyl radicals to oxygen, as well as subsequent reactions. The rate
constants of the reactions involving the formation of bicyclic species
(isomerizations, formation of cyclic ethers) have been evaluated from
literature data. This mechanism is able to satisfactorily reproduce
experimental results obtained in a rapid-compression machine for temperatures
ranging from 650 to 900 K and in a jet-stirred reactor from 750 to 1050 K.
Flow-rate analyses have been performed at low and intermediate temperatures.
