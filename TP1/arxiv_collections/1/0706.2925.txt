We consider the theoretical description of real-time counting of electrons
tunneling through a Coulomb-blockade quantum dot using a detector with finite
bandwidth. By tracing out the quantum dot we find that the dynamics of the
detector effectively is non-Markovian. We calculate the cumulant generating
function corresponding to the resulting non-Markovian rate equation and find
that the measured current cumulants behave significantly differently compared
to those of a Markovian transport process. Our findings provide a novel
interpretation of noise suppression found in a number of systems.
