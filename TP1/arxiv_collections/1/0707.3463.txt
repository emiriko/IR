Distribution of charge induced by a gate voltage in a graphene strip is
investigated. We calculate analytically the charge profile and demonstrate a
strong(macroscopic) charge accumulation along the boundaries of a
micrometers-wide strip. This charge inhomogeneity is especially important in
the quantum Hall regime where we predict the doubling of the number of edge
states and coexistence of two different types of such states. Applications to
graphene-based nanoelectronics are discussed.
