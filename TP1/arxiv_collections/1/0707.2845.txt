We report the experimental realization of squeezed quantum states of light,
tailored for new applications in quantum communication and metrology. Squeezed
states in a broad Fourier frequency band down to 1 Hz has been observed for the
first time. Nonclassical properties of light in such a low frequency band is
required for high efficiency quantum information storage in electromagnetically
induced transparency (EIT) media. The states observed also cover the frequency
band of ultra-high precision laser interferometers for gravitational wave
detection and can be used to reach the regime of quantum non-demolition
interferometry. And furthermore, they cover the frequencies of motions of
heavily macroscopic objects and might therefore support the attempts to observe
entanglement in our macroscopic world.
