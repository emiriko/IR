Recent investigations of the dynamic compressive strength of cold
isostatically pressed composites of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), tungsten
(W) and aluminum (Al) powders show significant differences depending on the
size of metallic particles. The addition of W increases the density and overall
strength of the sample. To investigate relatively large deformations
multi-material Eulerian and arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian methods, which have
the ability to efficiently handle the formation of free surfaces, were used.
The calculations indicate that the increased strength of the sample with fine
metallic particles is due to the formation of force chains under dynamic
loading. This phenomenon occurs even at larger porosity of the PTFE matrix in
comparison with samples with larger particle size of W and higher density of
the PTFE matrix.
