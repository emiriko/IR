Metapopulation models describing cities with different populations coupled by
the travel of individuals are of great importance in the understanding of
disease spread on a large scale. An important example is the Rvachev-Longini
model [{\it Math. Biosci.} {\bf 75}, 3-22 (1985)] which is widely used in
computational epidemiology. Few analytical results are however available and in
particular little is known about paths followed by epidemics and disease
arrival times. We study the arrival time of a disease in a city as a function
of the starting seed of the epidemics. We propose an analytical Ansatz, test it
in the case of a spreading on the world wide air transportation network, and
show that it predicts accurately the arrival order of a disease in world-wide
cities.
