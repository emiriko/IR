It is proposed that the equations of motion in periodic relativity which
yielded major predictions of general relativity without utilizing Riemannian
geometry and geodesic trajectories are exact in nature and can be applied to
pulsars and inspiraling compact binaries for analyzing orbital period
derivative and two polarization gravitational wave forms. Exactness of these
equations eliminates the need for higher order xPN corrections to the orbital
energy part of the balance equation. This is mainly due to the introduction of
dynamic WEP which states that the gravitational mass is equal to the
relativistic mass.
