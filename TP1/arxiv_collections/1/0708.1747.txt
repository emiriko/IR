Orbits of test particles and light rays are an important tool to study the
properties of space-time metrics. Here we systematically study the properties
of the gravitational field of a globally regular magnetic monopole in terms of
the geodesics of test particles and light. The gravitational field depends on
two dimensionless parameters, defined as ratios of the characteristic mass
scales present. For critical values of these parameters the resulting metric
coefficients develop a singular behavior, which has profound influence on the
properties of the resulting space-time and which is clearly reflected in the
orbits of the test particles and light rays.
