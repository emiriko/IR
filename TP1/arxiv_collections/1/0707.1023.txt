Screening of a large external charge in graphene is studied. The charge is
assumed to be displaced away or smeared over a finite region of the graphene
plane. The initial decay of the screened potential with distance is shown to
follow the 3/2 power. It gradually changes to the Coulomb law outside of a
hypercritical core whose radius is proportional to the external charge.
