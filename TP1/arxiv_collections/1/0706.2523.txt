A microscopic description of the quasielastic (p,n) charge-exchange reaction
(here, charge-exchange scattering between analogue states) is presented and
discussed. Emphasis is focused on the spin-isospin structure of the
projectile-target coupling. The model is a coupled-channel extension of the
full-folding optical model approach (OMP) developed for nucleon elastic
scattering, where emphasis is placed on retaining the genuine off-shell
behavior of realistic effective interactions in the nuclear medium. The
resulting non-local optical potentials are applied to the calculation of (p,n)
differential cross sections, with particular emphasis on small-angle Fermi
($\Delta S=0$) cross-sections to isobaric analog states. These parameter-free
results provide a reasonable description of the $^{14}$C(p,n)-data at proton
energies above $\sim$100 MeV, but deteriorate for heavier targets. These
shortcomings are analyzed and possible ways to correct them are discussed.
