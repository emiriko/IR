The behaviour of the geomagnetic field characteristics (mean values of the
paleointensity, amplitude of its variations and reversal frequency) during the
last 170 million years was analyzed. It was found that the mean values of the
paleointensity were in direct relation to amplitude of its variations and in
reverse relation to reversal frequency. The most considerable changes of the
Earth magnetic field characteristics occurred in Early Cretaceous, Middle
Paleogene and Neogene. The analysis of conformity of the reconstructed
characteristics behaviour of a geomagnetic field to an alfa-omega- dynamo model
was made.
