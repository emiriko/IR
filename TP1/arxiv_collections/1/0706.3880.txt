We present a new benchmarking procedure that is unambiguous and specific to
local community-finding methods, allowing one to compare the accuracy of
various methods. We apply this to new and existing algorithms. A simple class
of synthetic benchmark networks is also developed, capable of testing
properties specific to these local methods.
