The maintainance of a stable periodicity during the yeast metabolic cycle
involving approximately half of the genome requires a very strict and efficient
control of gene expression. For this reason, the metabolic cycle is a very good
candidate for testing the role of a class of post-transcriptional regulators,
the so called PUF-family, whose genome-wide mRNA binding specificity was
recently experimentally assessed. Here we show that an integrated computational
analysis of gene expression time series during the metabolic cycle and the mRNA
binding specificity of PUF-family proteins allow for a clear demonstration of
the very specific role exerted by selective post-transcriptional mRNA
degradation in yeast metabolic cycle global regulation.
