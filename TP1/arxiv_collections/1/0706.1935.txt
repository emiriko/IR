During inter-eruption periods, magma pressurization yields subtle changes of
the elastic properties of volcanic edifices. We use the reproducibility
properties of the ambient seismic noise recorded on the Piton de la Fournaise
volcano to measure relative seismic velocity variations of less than 0.1 % with
a temporal resolution of one day. Our results show that five studied volcanic
eruptions were preceded by clearly detectable seismic velocity decreases within
the zone of magma injection. These precursors reflect the edifice dilatation
induced by magma pressurization and can be useful indicators to improve the
forecasting of volcanic eruptions.
