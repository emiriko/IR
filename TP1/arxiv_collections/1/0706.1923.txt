In view of the newly discovered and physically acceptable $PT$ symmetric and
non-Hermitian models, we reinvestigated the phase structure of the
($g\phi^{4}+h\phi^{6}$)$_{1+1}$ Hermitian model. The reinvestigation concerns
the possibility of a phase transition from the original Hermitian and $PT$
symmetric phase to a non-Hermitian and $PT$ symmetric one. This kind of phase
transition, if verified experimentally, will lead to the first proof that
non-Hermitian and $PT$ symmetric models are not just a mathematical research
framework but are a nature desire. To do the investigation, we calculated the
effective potential up to second order in the couplings and found a Hermitian
to Non-Hermitian phase transition. This leads us to introduce, for the first
time, hermiticity as a symmetry which can be broken due to quantum corrections,
\textit{i.e.}, when starting with a model which is Hermitian in the classical
level, quantum corrections can break hermiticity while the theory stays
physically acceptable. In fact, ignoring this phase will lead to violation of
universality when comparing this model predictions with other models in the
same class of universality. For instance, in a previous work we obtained a
second order phase transition for the $PT$ symmetric and non-Hermitian
$(-g\phi^{4})$ and according to universality, this phase should exist in the
phase structure of the ($g\phi^{4}+h\phi^{6}$) model for negative $g$. Finally,
among the novelties in this letter, in our calculation for the effective
potential, we introduced a new renormalization group equation which describes
the invariance of the bare vacuum energy under the change of the scale. We
showed that without this invariance, the original theory and the effective one
are inequivalent.
