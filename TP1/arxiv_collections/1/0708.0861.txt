We have operated a quantum point contact (QPC) charge detector in a radio
frequency (RF) mode that allows fast charge detection in a bandwidth of tens of
megahertz. We find that the charge sensitivity of the RF-QPC is limited not by
the noise of a secondary amplifier, but by non-equilibrium noise f the QPC
itself. We have performed frequency-resolved measurements of the noise within a
10 MHz bandwidth around our carrier wave. When averaged over our bandwidth, we
find that the noise is in good agreement with the theory of photon-assisted
shot noise. Our measurements also reveal strong frequency dependence of the
noise, asymmetry with respect to the carrier wave, the appearance of sharp
local maxima that are correlated with mechanical degrees of freedom in the
sample, and noise suppression indicative of many-body physics near the 0.7
structure.
