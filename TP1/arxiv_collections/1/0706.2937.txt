It is widely discussed in the literature that the wave function of the
nucleon bound in a nucleus is modified due to the interaction with the
surrounding medium. We argue that the modification should strongly depend on
the momentum of the nucleon. We study such an effect in the case of the
point-like configuration component of the wave function of a nucleon bound in a
nucleus A, considering the case of arbitrary final state of the spectator A-1
system. We show that for non relativistic values of the nucleon momentum, the
momentum dependence of the nucleon deformation appears to follow from rather
general considerations and discuss the implications of our theoretical
observation for two different phenomena: i) the search for medium induced
modifications of the nucleon radius of a bound nucleon through the measurement
of the electromagnetic nucleon form factors via the A(e,e'p)X process, and ii)
the A-dependence of the EMC effect; in this latter case we also present a new
method of estimating the fraction of the nucleus light-cone momentum carried by
the photons and find that in a heavy nuclei protons loose about 2% of their
momentum.
