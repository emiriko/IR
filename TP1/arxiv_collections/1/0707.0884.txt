Distributional sources of matter on codimension-two and higher branes are
only well-defined as regularized objects. Nevertheless, intuition from
effective field theory suggests that the low-energy physics on such branes
should be independent of any high-energy regularization scheme. In this paper,
we address this issue in the context of a scalar field model where matter
fields (the standard model) living on such a brane interact with bulk fields
(gravity). The low-energy effective theory is shown to be consistent and
independent of the regularization scheme, provided the brane couplings are
renormalized appropriately at the classical level. We perform explicit
computations of the classical renormalization group flows at tree and one-loop
level, demonstrate that the theory is renormalizable against codimension-two
divergences, and extend the analysis to several physical applications such as
electrodynamics and brane localized kinetic terms.
