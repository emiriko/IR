Shell model calculations for low lying energy states of neutron rich oxygen
isotopes 19O, 20O, 21O, 22O, 23O, 24O, 25O, 26O have been performed using
OXBASH code. The configuration space consists of 0d5/2, 1s1/2, 0d3/2 orbital
for neutrons outside the 16O core. Different interactions namely, Wildenthal,
Preedom-Wildenthal, Wildenthal-Mcgrory and renormalized Kuo and Brown, which
are either empirical or realistic in nature have been used in the calculation,
The calculated energy spectrum are in good agreement with the experimental data
wherever available for the empirical interactions and the correct ordering of
levels is reproduced. The levels obtained from realistic interactions, though
have a small rms deviation, do not reproduce the correct ordering in some of
the cases. In the case of 21O, realistic interactions predict a much too
compressed 1/2+ state at energy 0.157 MeV compared to the experimental value of
1.218 MeV. For even isotopes the variation of the energy of the first 2+exited
state has been studied as a function of neutron number N. A sharp rise in the
value is observed at N=16 for both empirical and realistic interactions and
only at N=14 for empirical interactions. Significantly higher energy of first
2+ exited state compared to the value in the neighboring even-even nuclei is
considered as a signature for magic nuclei at N=14 and N=16.
