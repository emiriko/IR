Ru{1-x}Sn{x}Sr2EuCu2O8 and Ru{1-x}Sn{x}Sr2GdCu2O8 have been comprehensively
studied by microwave and dc resistivity and magnetoresistivity and by the dc
Hall measurements. The magnetic ordering temperature T_m is considerably
reduced with increasing Sn content. However, doping with Sn leads to only
slight reduction of the superconducting critical temperature T_c accompanied
with the increase of the upper critical field B_c2, indicating an increased
disorder in the system and a reduced scattering length of the conducting holes
in CuO2 layers. In spite of the increased scattering rate, the normal state
resistivity and the Hall resistivity are reduced with respect to the pure
compound, due to the increased number of itinerant holes in CuO2 layers, which
represent the main conductivity channel. Most of the electrons in RuO2 layers
are presumably localized, but the observed negative magnetoresistance and the
extraordinary Hall effect lead to the conclusion that there exists a small
number of itinerant electrons in RuO$_2$ layers that exhibit colossal
magnetoresistance.
