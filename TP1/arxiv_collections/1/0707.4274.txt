This work establishes a firm relationship between classical nonlinear
resonances and the phenomenon of dynamical tunneling. It is shown that the
classical phase space with its hierarchy of resonance islands completely
characterizes dynamical tunneling and explicit forms of the dynamical barriers
can be obtained only by identifying the key resonances. Relationship between
the phase space viewpoint and the quantum mechanical superexchange approach is
discussed in near-integrable and mixed regular-chaotic situations. For
near-integrable systems with sufficient anharmonicity the effect of multiple
resonances {\it i.e.,} resonance-assisted tunneling can be incorporated
approximately. It is also argued that the, presumed, relation of avoided
crossings to nonlinear resonances does not have to be invoked in order to
understand dynamical tunneling. For molecules with low density of states the
resonance-assisted mechanism is expected to be dominant.
