We study the transmission through a double quantum-dot system in the Kondo
regime. An exact expression for the transmission coefficient in terms of fully
interacting many-body Green's functions is obtained. By mapping the system into
an effective Anderson impurity model, one can determine the transmission using
numerical renormalization-group methods. The transmission exhibits signatures
of the different Kondo regimes of the effective model, including an unusual
Kondo phase with split peaks in the spectral function, as well as a
pseudogapped regime exhibiting a quantum critical transition between Kondo and
unscreened phases.
