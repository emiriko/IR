We investigate theoretically the violations of Einstein and Onsager
relations, and the efficiency for a single processive motor operating far from
equilibrium using an extension of the two-state model introduced by Kafri {\em
et al.} [Biophys. J. {\bf 86}, 3373 (2004)]. With the aid of the Fluctuation
Theorem, we analyze the general features of these violations and this
efficiency and link them to mechanochemical couplings of motors. In particular,
an analysis of the experimental data of kinesin using our framework leads to
interesting predictions that may serve as a guide for future experiments.
