The time-dependent non-crossing approximation is used to study the transient
current in a single electron transistor attached asymmetrically to two leads
following a sudden change in the energy of the dot level. We show that for
asymmetric coupling, sharp features in the density of states of the leads can
induce oscillations in the current through the dot. These oscillations persist
to much longer timescales than the timescale for charge fluctuations. The
amplitude of the oscillations increases as the temperature or source-drain bias
across the dot is reduced and saturates for values below the Kondo temperature.
We discuss the microscopic origin of these oscillations and comment on the
possibility for their experimental detection.
