The pseudospin degree of freedom in a semiconductor bilayer gives rise to a
collective mode analogous to the ferromagnetic resonance mode of a ferromagnet.
We present a theory of the dependence of the energy and the damping of this
mode on layer separation $d$. Based on these results, we discuss the
possibility of realizing transport-current driven pseudospin-transfer
oscillators in semiconductors.
