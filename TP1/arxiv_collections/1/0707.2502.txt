The electronic and transport property of a radially deformed double-walled
carbon nanotube (DWNT) intramolecular junction (IMJ) has been studied by the
tight-binding (TB) model combined with the first-principle calculations. The
geometrical structures of the DWNT IMJ have been first optimized in energy by
the universal force field (UFF) method. It is found that when heavily squashed,
the DWNT will become an insulator-coated metallic wire, and the conductance
near the Fermi level has been significantly changed by the radial squash.
Specially, several resonance conductance peaks appear at some energies in the
conduction band of the squashed DWNT IMJ. Finally, we have also investigated
the conductance variation due to change of the length of the central
semiconductor in the squashed DWNT IMJ. Furthermore, a promising pure carbon
nanoscale electronic device is proposed based on the DWNT IMJ.
