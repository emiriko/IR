Experimentally fixed sound pulse beyond of light speed in the region of
anomalous dispersion [W. M. Robertson, e. a. Appl. Phys. Lett, 90, 014102
(2007)] can be explained, as well as the similar superluminal phenomena, by
"the nonlocality in the small" of near electromagnetic field at transferring of
relevanted excitations.
