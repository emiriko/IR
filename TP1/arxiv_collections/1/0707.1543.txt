Fermilab operates the world's most intense antiproton source, now exclusively
dedicated to serving the needs of the Tevatron Collider. The anticipated 2009
shutdown of the Tevatron presents the opportunity for a world-leading low- and
medium-energy antiproton program. We summarize the status of the Fermilab
antiproton facility and review physics topics for which a future experiment
could make the world's best measurements.
