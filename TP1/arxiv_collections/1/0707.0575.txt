The two time-dependent Schrodinger equations in a potential V(s,u), $u$
denoting time, can be interpreted geometrically as a moving interacting curves
whose Fermi-Walker phase density is given by -dV/ds. The Manakov model appears
as two moving interacting curves using extended da Rios system and two Hasimoto
transformations.
