We briefly review an effective theory of QCD at high baryon density,
describing the relevant modes near the Fermi surface. The high density
effective theory has properties of reparametrization invariance and gauge
invariance, maintained in a subtle way. It also has a positive measure,
allowing lattice simulations at high baryon density. We then apply it to
gapless superconductors and discuss recent proposals to resolve the magnetic
instability of gapless superconductivity.
