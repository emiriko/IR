We report tensile failure experiments on polyurethane (PU) foams. Experiments
have been performed by imposing a constant strain rate. We work on
heterogeneous materials for whom the failure does not occur suddenly and can
develop as a multistep process through a succession of microcracks that end at
pores. The acoustic energy and the waiting times between acoustic events follow
power-law distributions. This remains true while the foam density is varied.
However, experiments at low temperatures (PU foams more brittle) have not
yielded power-laws for the waiting times. The cumulative acoustic energy has no
power law divergence at the proximity of the failure point which is
qualitatively in agreement with other experiments done at imposed strain. We
notice a plateau in cumulative acoustic energy that seems to occur when a
single crack starts to propagate.
