Generalized Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar (GDMPK) equation [K. A. Muttalib and
J. R. Klauder, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 82}, 4272 (1999)] has been proposed for
the description of the electron transport in strongly localized systems. We
develop an algorithm for the numerical solution of this equation and confirm
that GDMPK equation correctly describes the critical and localized regimes.
Contrary to the original DMPK equation, the generalized one contains also an
information about the dimension of the system. In particular, it distinguishes
between the two and the three dimensional models with the same number of
transmission channels.
