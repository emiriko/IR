Magnetic switching of a single-molecule magnet (SMM) due to spin-polarized
current is investigated theoretically. The charge transfer between the
electrodes takes place via the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of
the SMM. Generally, the double occupancy of the LUMO level, and a finite
on-site Coulomb repulsion, is taken into account. Owing to the exchange
interaction between electrons in the LUMO level and the SMM's spin, the latter
can be reversed. The perturbation approach (Fermi golden rule) is applied to
calculate current-voltage characteristics. The influence of Coulomb
interactions on the switching process is also analyzed.
