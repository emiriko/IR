We review recent advances on the theory of spin qubits in nanostructures. We
focus on four selected topics. First, we show how to form spin qubits in the
new and promising material graphene. Afterwards, we discuss spin relaxation and
decoherence in quantum dots. In particular, we demonstrate how charge
fluctations in the surrounding environment cause spin decay via spin--orbit
coupling. We then turn to a brief overview of how one can use electron-dipole
spin resonance (EDSR) to perform single spin rotations in quantum dots using an
oscillating electric field. The final topic we cover is the spin-spin coupling
via spin-orbit interaction which is an alternative to the usual spin-spin
coupling via the Heisenberg exchange interaction.
