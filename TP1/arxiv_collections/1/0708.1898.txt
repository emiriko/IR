The dynamics of one and two pointlike vortices in a planar quantum gas of
spin-0 particles confined in an annular region is considered. New analytical
and numerical solutions are found. The concept of stationarity radius, related
to the doubly connected nature of the annulus, is defined. It is seen that the
existence of these radii has great impact on the behaviour of the vortices. It
is shown that, because of the existence of the stationarity radii, vortices
exhibit similar behaviour regardless of the sign of their winding number. The
energetically stable vortex solutions are studied qualitatively.
