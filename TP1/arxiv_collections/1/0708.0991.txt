Light transmission through 2D subwavelength hole arrays in perfect-conductor
films is shown to be complete (100%) at some resonant wavelengths even for
arbitrarily narrow holes. Conversely, the reflection on a 2D planar array of
non-absorbing scatterers is shown to be complete at some wavelengths regardless
how weak the scatterers are. These results are proven analytically and
corroborated by rigorous numerical solution of Maxwell's equations. This work
supports the central role played by dynamical diffraction during light
transmission through subwavelength hole arrays and it provides a systematics to
analyze more complex geometries and many of the features observed in connection
with transmission through hole arrays.
