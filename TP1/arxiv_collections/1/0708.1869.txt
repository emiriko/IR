We present a scheme for broadcasting of continuous variable entanglement. We
show how an initial two-mode squeezed state of the electromagnetic field shared
by two distant parties can be broadcasted into two nonlocal bipartite entangled
states. Our protocol uses a local linear amplifier and a beam splitter at each
end. We compute the fidelity of the output entangled states and show that the
broadcasting can be implemented for a variety of input squeezed states and
amplifier phases.
