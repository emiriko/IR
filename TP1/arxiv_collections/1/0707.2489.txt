Comment on paper by P.W. Anderson is presented. This Anderson's work is shown
to contain a number of inaccurate and ungrounded statements. We point out, in
particular, that the total static dielectric function not only can be negative,
but inevitably has a minus sign in many stable systems. We also demonstrate
that in many metals, the effective electron-phonon interaction is stronger than
the direct Coulomb repulsion, without taking into account the ladder-sum
renormalization or pseudization of the Coulomb repulsion. Other issues touched
in Anderson's paper are also discussed.
