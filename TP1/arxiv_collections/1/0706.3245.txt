We investigate the conservation law of energy-momentum in teleparallel
gravity by using general Noether theorem. The energy-momentum current has also
superpotential and is therefore identically conserved. The total
energy-momentum, which includes the contributions of both matter and
gravitational fields, is given by the integral of scalar densities over a
three-dimensional spacelike hypersurface. As an example, the universe in
teleparallel gravity is investigated. It is shown that the total
energy-momentum vanishes independently of both the curvature parameter and the
three dimensionless coupling constants of teleparallel gravity.
