New expansions for some functions related to the Zeta function in terms of
the Pochhammer's polynomials are given (coefficients b(k), d(k), d_(k) and
d__(k). In some formal limit our expansion b(k) obtained via the alternating
series gives the regularized expansion of Maslanka for the Zeta function. The
real and the imaginary part of the function on the critical line is obtained
with a good accuracy up to Im(s) = t < 35.
  Then, we give the expansion (coefficient d_(k)) for the derivative of
ln((s-1)\zeta(s)). The critical function of the derivative, whose bounded
values for Re(s) > 1/2 at large values of k should ensure the truth of the
Riemann Hypothesis (RH), is obtained either by means of the primes or by means
of the zeros (trivial and non-trivial) of the Zeta function. In a numerical
experiment performed up to high values of k i.e. up to k = 10^13 we obtain a
very good agreement between the two functions, with the emergence of twelve
oscillations with stable amplitude.
  For a special case of values of the two parameters entering in the general
Pochhammer's expansion it is argued that the bound on the critical function
should be given by the Euler constant gamma.
