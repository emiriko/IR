We discuss the physics of large impact parameter interactions at the LHC:
ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs). The dominant processes in UPCs are
photon-nucleon (nucleus) interactions. The current LHC detector configurations
can explore small $x$ hard phenomena with nuclei and nucleons at photon-nucleon
center-of-mass energies above 1 TeV, extending the $x$ range of HERA by a
factor of ten. In particular, it will be possible to probe diffractive and
inclusive parton densities in nuclei using several processes. The interaction
of small dipoles with protons and nuclei can be investigated in elastic and
quasi-elastic $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ production as well as in high $t$
$\rho^0$ production accompanied by a rapidity gap. Several of these phenomena
provide clean signatures of the onset of the new high gluon density QCD regime.
The LHC is in the kinematic range where nonlinear effects are several times
larger than at HERA. Two-photon processes in UPCs are also studied. In
addition, while UPCs play a role in limiting the maximum beam luminosity, they
can also be used a luminosity monitor by measuring mutual electromagnetic
dissociation of the beam nuclei. We also review similar studies at HERA and
RHIC as well as describe the potential use of the LHC detectors for UPC
measurements.
