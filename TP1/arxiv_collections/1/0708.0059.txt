It is becoming common to hear teaching advice about spending more time on the
"physics of the problem" so that students will get more physical insight and
develop a stronger intuition that can be very helpful when thinking about
physics problems. Based on this type of justification, mathematical skills such
as the ability to compute moments of inertia, center of mass, or gravitational
fields from mass distributions, and electrical fields from charge distributions
are considered "distracting mathematics" and therefore receive less attention.
We argue a) that this approach can have a negative influence on student
reasoning when dealing with questions of rotational dynamics, a highly
non-intuitive subject where even instructors may fail to provide correct
answers, and b) that exposure of students to mathematical reasoning and to a
wide range of computational techniques to obtain the moment of inertia of
different mass distributions will make students more comfortable with the
subject of rotational dynamics, thus improving their physical insight on the
topic.
