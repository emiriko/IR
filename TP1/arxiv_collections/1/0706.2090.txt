It is shown that the flavour projection of staggered fermions can be written
as a projection between the fields on four separate, but parallel, lattices,
where the fields on each are modified forms of the standard staggered fermion
field. Because the staggered Dirac operator acts equally on each lattice, it
respects this flavour projection. We show that the system can be gauged in the
usual fashion and that this does not interfere with flavour projection. We also
consider the path integral, showing that, prior to flavour projection, it
evaluates to the same form on each lattice and that this form is equal to that
used in the quarter-root trick. The flavour projection leaves a path integral
for a single flavour of field on each lattice.
