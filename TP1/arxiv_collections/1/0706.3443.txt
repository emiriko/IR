State Space Models (SSM) is a MATLAB 7.0 software toolbox for doing time
series analysis by state space methods. The software features fully interactive
construction and combination of models, with support for univariate and
multivariate models, complex time-varying (dynamic) models, non-Gaussian
models, and various standard models such as ARIMA and structural time-series
models. The software includes standard functions for Kalman filtering and
smoothing, simulation smoothing, likelihood evaluation, parameter estimation,
signal extraction and forecasting, with incorporation of exact initialization
for filters and smoothers, and support for missing observations and multiple
time series input with common analysis structure. The software also includes
implementations of TRAMO model selection and Hillmer-Tiao decomposition for
ARIMA models. The software will provide a general toolbox for doing time series
analysis on the MATLAB platform, allowing users to take advantage of its
readily available graph plotting and general matrix computation capabilities.
