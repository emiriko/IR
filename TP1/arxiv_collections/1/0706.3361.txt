We study spin-polarized states and their stability in anti-ferromagnetic
states of spinor (F=1) quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates. Using
analytical approximations and numerical methods, we find various types of
polarized states, including: patterns of the Thomas-Fermi type; structures with
a pulse-shape in one component inducing a hole in the other components; states
with holes in all three components; and domain walls. A Bogoliubov-de Gennes
analysis reveals that families of these states contain intervals of a weak
oscillatory instability, except for the domain walls, which are always stable.
The development of the instabilities is examined by means of direct numerical
simulations.
