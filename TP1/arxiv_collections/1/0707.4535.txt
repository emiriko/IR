The interaction between itinerant and Mott localized electronic states in
strongly correlated materials is studied within dynamical mean field theory in
combination with the numerical renormalization group method. A novel
nonmagnetic zero temperature quantum phase transition is found in the
bad-metallic orbital-selective Mott phase of the two-band Hubbard model, for
values of the Hund's exchange which are relevant to typical transition metal
oxides.
