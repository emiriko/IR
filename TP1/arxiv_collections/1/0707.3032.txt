We study a supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model based on discrete
A4xZ3xZ4 flavor symmetry. We obtain quark mixing angles as well as a realistic
fermion mass spectrum and we predict tribimaximal leptonic mixing by a
spontaneous breaking of A4. The top quark Yukawa interaction is present at the
renormalizable level in the superpotential while all the other Yukawa
interactions arise only at higher orders. We study the Higgs potential and show
that it can potentially solve the so called vacuum alignment problem. The
leading order predictions are not spoiled by subleading corrections.
