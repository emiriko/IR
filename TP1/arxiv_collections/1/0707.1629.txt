Considering a network of dissipative quantum harmonic oscillators we deduce
and analyze the optimum topologies which are able to store, for the largest
period of time, a quantum superposition previously prepared in one of the
network oscillators. The storage of the superposition is made dynamically, in
that the state to be protected evolves through the network before being
retrieved back in the oscillator where it was prepared. The decoherence time
during the dynamic storage process is computed and we demonstrate that it is
proportional to the number of oscillators in the network for a particular
regime of parameters.
