In a brief article [1], Seife refers to works by Einstein and Schroedinger
and concludes that there is a relentless murmur of confusion underneath the
chorus of praise for quantum theory. It is noteworthy that a "murmur" is not
necessarily a cause for replacement of any scientific theory, and that the
issues raised by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, and Schroedinger's responses to
the EPR paper have been satisfactorily resolved by Gyftopoulos and von
Spakovsky [2] in a manner that renders the relentless murmur mute and
unwarranted.
