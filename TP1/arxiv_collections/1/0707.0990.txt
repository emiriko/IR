We develop a systematic theory of microwave-induced oscillations in
magnetoresistivity of a 2D electron gas in the vicinity of fractional harmonics
of the cyclotron resonance, observed in recent experiments. We show that in the
limit of well-separated Landau levels the effect is dominated by a change of
the distribution function induced by multiphoton processes. At moderate
magnetic field, a single-photon mechanism originating from the
microwave-induced sidebands in the density of states of disorder-broadened
Landau levels becomes important.
