Electrical resistivity $\rho$, specific heat C, and magnetic susceptibility
$\chi$ measurements made on the filled skutterudite CeRu_4As_{12} reveal
non-Fermi liquid (NFL) T - dependences at low T, i.e., $\rho$(T) $\sim$ T^{1.4}
and weak power law or logarithmic divergences in C(T)/T and $\chi$(T).
Measurements also show that the T - dependence of the thermoelectric power S(T)
deviates from that seen in other Ce systems. The NFL behavior appears to be
associated with fluctuations of the Ce valence between 3^+ and 4^+ rather than
a typical Kondo lattice scenario that would be appropriate for an integral Ce
valence of 3^+.
