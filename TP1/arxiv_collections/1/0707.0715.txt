Two-component submonolayer growth on triangular lattice is qualitatively
studied by kinetic Monte Carlo techniques. The hopping barrier governing
surface diffusion of the atoms is estimated with an improved formula and using
realistic pair interaction potentials. Realistic degrees of freedoms enhancing
the surface diffusion of atoms are also introduced. The main advantages of the
presented technique are the reduced number of free parameters and the clear
diffusion activated mechanism for the segregation of different types of atoms.
The potential of this method is exemplified by reproducing (i) vacancy and
stacking fault related phase-boundary creation and dynamics; (ii) a special
co-deposition and segregation process where the segregated atoms of the second
component surrounds the islands formed by the first type of atoms.
