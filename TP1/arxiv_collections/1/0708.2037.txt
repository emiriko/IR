The energy--momentum tensor in general relativity contains only localized
contributions to the total energy--momentum. Here, we consider a static,
spherically symmetric object consisting of a charged perfect fluid. For this
object, the total gravitational mass contains a non--localizable contribution
of electric coupling (ordinarily associated with electromagnetic mass). We
derive an explicit expression for the total mass which implies that the
non--localizable contribution of electric coupling is not bound together by
gravity, thus ruling out existence of the objects with pure Lorentz
electromagnetic mass in general relativity.
