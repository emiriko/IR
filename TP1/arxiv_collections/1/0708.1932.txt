One more derivation of the quantum probability rule is presented in order to
shed more light on the versatile aspects of this fundamental law. It is shown
that the change of state in minimal quantum non-demolition measurement, also
known as ideal measurement, implies the probability law in a simple way.
Namely, the very requirement of minimal change of state, put in proper
mathematical form, gives the well known Lueders formula, which contains the
probability rule.
