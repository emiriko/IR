The paper studies some properties of the ring of integer-valued
quasi-polynomials. On this ring, theory of generalized Euclidean division and
generalized GCD are presented. Applications to finite simple continued fraction
expansion and Smith normal form of integral matrices with integer parameters
are also given.
