This is basically the text of a survey talk (entitled 'Painleve, Klein and
the icosahedron') given at Hitchin's 60th birthday conference. It discusses the
search for and construction of algebraic solutions of the sixth Painleve
differential equation, which may be viewed as a nonlinear analogue of the Gauss
hypergeometric equation. Both algebraic and transcendental methods are used and
the story involves affine Weyl groups, braid groups and cubic surfaces. Some
emphasis is given to the interpretation of the sixth Painleve equation as the
explicit form of the simplest nonabelian Gauss-Manin connection, i.e. as a
nonlinear differential equation 'coming from geometry', much as Picard-Fuchs
equations arise in the case of cohomology with abelian coefficients.
