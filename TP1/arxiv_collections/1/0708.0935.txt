Recently a formulation of overlap fermions at finite density based on an
analytic continuation of the sign function was proposed. We study this proposal
by analyzing the energy and number densities for free fermions as a function of
the chemical potential and the temperature. Our results show that overlap
fermions with chemical potential give rise to the correct continuum behavior.
