We study the physics reach of an experiment where neutrinos produced in a
beta-beam facility at CERN are observed in a large magnetized iron calorimeter
(ICAL) at the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO). The CERN-INO distance is
close to the so-called "magic" baseline which helps evade some of the parameter
degeneracies and allows for a better measurement of the neutrino mass hierarchy
and $\theta_{13}$.
