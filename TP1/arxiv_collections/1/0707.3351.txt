The position of the various tired light theories is reviewed briefly and it
is noted that one of the biggest objections to them concerns the mechanism by
which light might lose energy as it travels through space. Here some new work
relating to the constancy of the speed of light is highlighted as providing a
possible solution to this conundrum, thus making more feasible explanation of
phenomena via theories involving the notion of tired light.
