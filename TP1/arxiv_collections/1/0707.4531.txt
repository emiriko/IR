We investigate the algebraic structure of the Feynman propagator with a
general time-dependent quadratic Hamiltonian system. Using the Lie-algebraic
technique we obtain a normal-ordered form of the time-evolution operator, and
then the propagator is easily derived by a simple ``Integration Within Ordered
Product" (IWOP) technique.It is found that this propagator contains a classical
generating function which demonstrates a new correspondence between classical
and quantum mechanics.
