A general nonperturbative theory of the low-energy electron propagator is
developed and used to calculate the single-particle density of states in a
variety of systems. This method involves the decoupling of the
electron-electron interaction through a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation,
followed by a saddle-point approximation of the remaining functional integral.
The final expression is found to be the tunneling analog of the infrared
catastrophe that occurs in the x-ray edge problem; here, the host system
responds to the potential produced by the abrupt addition of an electron during
a tunneling event. This response can lead to a suppression in the tunneling
density of states near the Fermi energy. This method is adaptable to lattice or
continuum models of any dimensionality, with or without translational
invariance. When applied, the exact density of states is obtained for the
Tomonaga-Luttinger model, and the pseudogap of a fractional quantum Hall fluid
is recovered.
