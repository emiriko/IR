We show that a three-level lambda quantum emitter with equal spontaneous
emission rates on both optically active transitions can absorb an incident
light field with a probability approaching unity, provided that the focused
light profile matches that of the emitter dipole emission pattern. Even with
realistic focusing geometries, our results could find applications in
long-distance entanglement of spin qubits.
