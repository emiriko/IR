We demonstrated that dipole-exchange spin waves traveling in geometrically
restricted magnetic thin films satisfy the same laws of reflection and
refraction as light waves. Moreover, we found for the first time novel wave
behaviors of dipole-exchange spin waves such as total reflection and negative
refraction. The total reflection in laterally inhomogeneous thin films composed
of two different magnetic materials is associated with the forbidden modes of
refracted dipole-exchange spin waves. The negative refraction occurs at a 90
degree domain-wall magnetic interface that is introduced by a cubic magnetic
anisotropy in the media, through the anisotropic dispersion of dipole-exchange
spin waves.
