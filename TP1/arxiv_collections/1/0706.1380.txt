We examine the relationship between little Higgs and 5d composite models with
identical symmetry structures. By performing an "extreme" deconstruction, one
can reduce any warped composite model to a little Higgs theory on a handful of
sites. This allows us to use 4d intuition and the powerful constraints of
nonlinear sigma models to elucidate obscure points in the original setup. We
find that the finiteness of the Higgs potential in 5d is due to the same
collective symmetry breaking as in the little Higgs. We compare a 4d and a 5d
model with the same symmetry to the data. Reviewing the constraints on models
related to the Minimal Composite Higgs (hep-ph/0412089), we see that it has
difficulty in producing acceptable values for S, T, and m_{top} simultaneously.
By contrast, in a global analysis, the Minimal Moose with custodial symmetry is
viable in a large region of its parameter space and suffers from no numeric
tunings. We conjecture that this result is generic for 4d and 5d models with
identical symmetries. The data will less strongly constrain the little theory.
