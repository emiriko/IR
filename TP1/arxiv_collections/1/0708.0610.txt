We study the three-body problem for three atomic fermions, in the same spin
state, experiencing a resonant interaction in the p-wave channel via a Feshbach
resonance represented by a two-channel model. The rate of inelastic processes
due to recombination to deeply bound dimers is then estimated from the
three-body solution using a simple prescription. We obtain numerical and
analytical predictions for most of the experimentally relevant quantities that
can be extracted from the three-body solution: the existence of weakly bound
trimers and their lifetime, the low-energy elastic and inelastic scattering
properties of an atom on a weakly bound dimer (including the atom-dimer
scattering length and scattering volume), and the recombination rates for three
colliding atoms towards weakly bound and deeply bound dimers. The effect of
"background" non-resonant interactions in the open channel of the two-channel
model is also calculated and allows to determine which three-body quantities
are `universal' and which on the contrary depend on the details of the model.
