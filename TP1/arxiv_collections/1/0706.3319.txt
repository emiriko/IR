We review the case for the photon having a tiny mass compatible with the
experimental limits. We go over some possible experimental tests for such a
photon mass including the violation of Lorentz symmetry. We point out that such
violations may already have been witnessed in tests involving high energy gamma
rays from outer space as also ultra high energy cosmic rays.
