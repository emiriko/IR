Mass spectra of the ground-state baryons consisting of three or two heavy (b
or c) and one light (u,d,s) quarks are calculated in the framework of the
relativistic quark model and the hyperspherical expansion. The predictions of
masses of the triply and doubly heavy baryons are obtained by employing the
perturbation theory for the spin-independent and spin-dependent parts of the
three-quark Hamiltonian.
