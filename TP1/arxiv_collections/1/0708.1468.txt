Structures with self-organised InAs quantum dots in a GaAs matrix were grown
by the low pressure metal-organic vapour phase epitaxy (LP-MOVPE) technique.
Photoluminescence in combination with photomodulated reflectance spectroscopy
were used as the main characterisation methods for the growth optimisation.
Results show that photoreflectance spectroscopy is an excellent tool for
characterisation of QD structures wetting layers (thickness and composition)
and for identification of spacers in vertically stacked QDs structures.
