Kainate induces a marked expression of cyclooxygenase-2 after its systemic
administration. Because cyclooxygenase-2 activity is associated to the
production of reactive oxygen species, we investigated the effects of
nimesulide, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, on kainate-induced in vivo
oxidative damage in the rat hippocampus. A clinically relevant dose of
nimesulide (6 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered three times following kainate
application (9 mg/kg, i.p.). After 24 h of kainate administration, the drastic
decrease in hippocampal glutathione content and the significant increase in
lipid peroxidation were attenuated in nimesulide-treated rats, suggesting that
the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 is involved in kainate-mediated free radicals
formation.
