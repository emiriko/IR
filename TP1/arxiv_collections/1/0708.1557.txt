We present a construction of the formalism where fundamental variables are
nilpotent, but in contrast to the supermathematics, commutative. This gives
another possibility to realize classically the Pauli exclusion principle. We
sketch the relevant formalism and discuss simple model of the nilpotent
oscillator to illustrate the generalized nilpotent mechanics.
