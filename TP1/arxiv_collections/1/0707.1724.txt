Macroscopic mechanical objects and electromagnetic degrees of freedom couple
to each other via radiation pressure. Optomechanical systems with sufficiently
strong coupling are predicted to exhibit quantum effects and are a topic of
considerable interest. Devices reaching this regime would offer new types of
control of the quantum state of both light and matter and would provide a new
arena in which to explore the boundary between quantum and classical physics.
Experiments to date have achieved sufficient optomechanical coupling to
laser-cool mechanical devices but have not yet reached the quantum regime. The
outstanding technical challenge in this field is integrating sensitive
micromechanical elements (which must be small, light, and flexible) into high
finesse cavities (which are typically much more rigid and massive) without
compromising the mechanical or optical properties of either. A second, and more
fundamental, challenge is to read out the mechanical element's quantum state:
displacement measurements (no matter how sensitive) cannot determine the energy
eigenstate of an oscillator, and measurements which couple to quantities other
than displacement have been difficult to realize. Here we present a novel
optomechanical system which seems to resolve both these challenges. We
demonstrate a cavity which is detuned by the motion of a thin dielectric
membrane placed between two macroscopic, rigid, high-finesse mirrors. This
approach segregates optical and mechanical functionality to physically distinct
structures and avoids compromising either. It also allows for direct
measurement of the square of the membrane's displacement, and thus in principle
the membrane's energy eigenstate. We estimate it should be practical to use
this scheme to observe quantum jumps of a mechanical system.
