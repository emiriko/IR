We consider a system of two interacting particles with like but unequal
charges in a magnetic field in the planar geometry. We construct a complete
basis of states compatible with both the axial symmetry and magnetic
translations. The basis is obtained using a canonical transformation that
generates effective quasiparticles with modified interactions. We establish a
connection of this transformation with the SU(2) algebra and make use of the
SU(2) Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formulas for evaluating the interaction matrix
elements. We calculate analytically the eigenenergies of the problem (Haldane
pseudopotentials) in the first few Landau levels for a relatively wide class of
interaction potentials.
