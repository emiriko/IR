Preliminary measurements of the cross-section for the processes ppbar --> W
--> mu nu, e nu; ppbar --> Z --> mu mu, e e, tau tau from the D0 detector are
presented. Integrated luminosities for these data samples are 96 pb-1 for W -->
mu nu, 177.3 pb-1 for W --> e nu and Z --> e e, 148pb-1 for Z --> mu mu and 207
pb-1 for Z --> tau tau. A measurement of the muon charge asymmetry from W boson
decays (integrated luminosity 230 pb-1) and Z/gamma* --> e e inclusive
differential cross section as a function of boson rapidity (integrated
luminosity 337 pb-1) are presented as well. The results are in generally good
agreement with SM predictions.
