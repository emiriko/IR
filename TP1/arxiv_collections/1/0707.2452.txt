We present a new prescription for the resummation of the divergent series of
perturbative corrections, due to soft gluon emission, to hard processes near
threshold in perturbative QCD (threshold resummation). This prescription is
based on Borel resummation, and contrary to the commonly used minimal
prescription, it does not introduce a dependence of resummed physical
observables on the kinematically unaccessible x->0 region of parton
distributions. We compare results for resummed deep-inelastic scattering
obtained using the Borel prescription and the minimal prescription and exploit
the comparison to discuss the ambiguities related to the resummation procedure.
