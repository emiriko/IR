We present new sets of fragmentation functions for protons and inclusive
charged hadrons obtained in combined NLO QCD analyses of single-inclusive
hadron production in electron-positron annihilation, proton-proton collisions,
and deep-inelastic lepton-proton scattering. These analyses complement previous
results for pion and kaon fragmentation functions with charge and flavor
discrimination. The Lagrange multiplier technique is used to assess the
uncertainties in the extraction of the new sets of fragmentation functions.
