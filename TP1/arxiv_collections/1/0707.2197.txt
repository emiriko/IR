We demonstrate that an equilibrium spin current in a 2D electron gas with
Rashba spin-orbit interaction (Rashba medium) results in a mechanical torque on
a substrate near an edge of the medium. If the substrate is a cantilever, the
mechanical torque displaces the free end of the cantilever. The effect can be
enhanced and tuned by a magnetic field. Observation of this displacement would
be an effective method to prove existence of equilibrium spin currents. The
analysis of edges of the Rashba medium demonstrates the existence of localized
edge states. They form a 1D continuum of states. This suggests a new type of
quantum wire: spin-orbit quantum wire.
