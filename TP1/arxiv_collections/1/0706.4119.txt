Relations between scattering and production amplitudes are studied in a
microscopic multichannel model for meson-meson scattering, with coupling to
confined quark-antiquark channels. Overlapping resonances and a proper
threshold behaviour are treated exactly in the model. Under the spectator
assumption, it is found that the two-particle production amplitude shares a
common denominator with the elastic scattering amplitude, besides a numerator
consisting of a linear combination of all elastic and some inelastic matrix
elements. The coefficients in these linear combinations are shown to be
generally complex. Finally, the standard operator expressions relating
production and scattering amplitudes, viz. A=T/V and Im(A)=T*A, are fulfilled,
while in the small-coupling limit the usual isobar model is recovered.
