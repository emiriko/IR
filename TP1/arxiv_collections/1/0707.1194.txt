Optical techniques are finding widespread use in analytical chemistry for
chemical and bio-chemical analysis. During the past decade, there has been an
increasing emphasis on miniaturization of chemical analysis systems and
naturally this has stimulated a large effort in integrating microfluidics and
optics in lab-on-a-chip microsystems. This development is partly defining the
emerging field of optofluidics. Scaling analysis and experiments have
demonstrated the advantage of micro-scale devices over their macroscopic
counterparts for a number of chemical applications. However, from an optical
point of view, miniaturized devices suffer dramatically from the reduced
optical path compared to macroscale experiments, e.g. in a cuvette. Obviously,
the reduced optical path complicates the application of optical techniques in
lab-on-a-chip systems. In this paper we theoretically discuss how a strongly
dispersive photonic crystal environment may be used to enhance the light-matter
interactions, thus potentially compensating for the reduced optical path in
lab-on-a-chip systems. Combining electromagnetic perturbation theory with
full-wave electromagnetic simulations we address the prospects for achieving
slow-light enhancement of Beer-Lambert-Bouguer absorption, photonic band-gap
based refractometry, and high-Q cavity sensing.
