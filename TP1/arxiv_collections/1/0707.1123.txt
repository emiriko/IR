A self-consistent Thomas-Fermi-Poisson based calculation scheme is used to
achieve spin resolved incompressible strips (ISs). The effect of exchange and
correlation is incorporated by an empirically induced g factor. A local version
of the Ohm's law describes the imposed fixed current, where the discrepancies
of this model are resolved by a relevant spatial averaging process. The
longitudinal resistance is obtained as a function of the perpendicular (strong)
magnetic field at filling factor one and two plateaus. Interrelation between
the ISs and the longitudinal zeros is explicitly shown.
