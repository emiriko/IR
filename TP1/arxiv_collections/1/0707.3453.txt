We generalize the idea of supertwistors and introduce a new supersymmetric
object - the $\theta$-twistor which includes the composite Ramond vector [11]
well known from the spinning string dynamics. The symmetries of the chiral
$\theta$-twistor superspace are studied. It is shown that the chiral spin
structure introduced by the $\theta$-twistor breaks the superconformal boost
symmetry but preserves the scale symmetry and the super-Poincare symmetry. This
geometrical effect of breaking correlates with the Gross-Wess effect of the
conformal boost breaking for bosonic scattering amplitudes.
