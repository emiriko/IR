We propose a possibility of spontaneous CP-violation (SCPV) at high scale in
a SUSY SO(10) theory. The model is L-R symmetric SUSY SO(10) with
\textbf{\noun{10}} and \textbf{126} dimensional Higgs generating fermion
masses, and the CP phase is generated through complex VEV of B-L breaking
\textbf{126} Higgs . The model can have potential application in explaining
$\nu$ masses and leptogenesis as well.
