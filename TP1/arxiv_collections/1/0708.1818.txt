An adventure at engineering design and modeling is possible with a Virtual
Reality Environment (VRE) that uses multiple computer-generated media to let a
user experience situations that are temporally and spatially prohibiting. In
this paper, an approach to developing some advanced architecture and modeling
tools is presented to allow multiple frameworks work together while being
shielded from the application program. This architecture is being developed in
a framework of workbench interactive tools for next generation
nanoparticle-reinforced damping/dynamic systems. Through the use of system, an
engineer/programmer can respectively concentrate on tailoring an engineering
design concept of novel system and the application software design while using
existing databases/software outputs.
