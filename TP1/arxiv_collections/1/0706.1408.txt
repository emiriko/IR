We provide sensitivity comparisons for two competing versions of the
dimension reduction method principal Hessian directions (pHd). These
comparisons consider the effects of small perturbations on the estimation of
the dimension reduction subspace via the influence function. We show that the
two versions of pHd can behave completely differently in the presence of
certain observational types. Our results also provide evidence that outliers in
the traditional sense may or may not be highly influential in practice. Since
influential observations may lurk within otherwise typical data, we consider
the influence function in the empirical setting for the efficient detection of
influential observations in practice.
