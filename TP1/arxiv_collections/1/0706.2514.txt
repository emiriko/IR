The relationship between the length gauge (LG) and the velocity gauge (VG)
exact forms of the photoionization probability amplitude is considered. Our
motivation for this paper comes from applications of the Keldysh-Faisal-Reiss
(KFR) theory, which describes atoms (or ions) in a strong laser field (in the
nonrelativistic approach, in the dipole approximation). On the faith of a
certain widely-accepted assumption, we present a simple proof that the
well-known LG form of the exact photoionization (or photodetachment)
probability amplitude is indeed the gauge-invariant result. In contrast, to
obtain the VG form of this probability amplitude, one has to either (i) neglect
the well-known Goeppert-Mayer exponential factor (which assures gauge
invariance) during all the time evolution of the ionized electron or (ii) put
some conditions on the vector potential of the laser field.
