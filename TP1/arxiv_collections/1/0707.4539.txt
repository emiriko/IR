In periodic relativity (PR), the curved space time of general relativity are
eliminated by making use of an alternative flat metric without weak field
approximation. PR satisfies Einstein's field equations. Theory allows every two
body system to deviate differently from the flat Minkowski metric. PR differs
from general relativity (GR) in predictions of the proper time intervals of
distant objects. PR proposes a definite connection between the proper time
interval of an object and gravitational frequency shift of its constituent
particles as the object travels through the gravitational field. This is
because fundamentally time is periodic in nature. Coordinate and proper time in
GR are linear time. Periodic time of PR is the key parameter in development of
quantum gravity theory in which the universe begins with a quantum fluctuation
in the fundamental substance of the universe which is infinite, motionless and
indivisible. PR is based on the dynamic weak equivalence principle which
equates the gravitational mass with the relativistic mass. PR provides accurate
solutions for the rotation curves of galaxies and the energy levels of the
Hydrogen spectra including Lamb shift. Flat space time with Lorentz invariant
acceleration presented here makes it possible to unite PR with quantum
mechanics. PR satisfies Einstein's field equations with respect to the three
major GR tests within the solar system and with respect to the derivation of
Friedmann equation in cosmology. PR predicts limiting radius of the event
horizon of M87 black hole to be 3Rg and the range of prograde and retrograde
spin a_* between \pm0.385 and \pm0.73.
