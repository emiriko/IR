We derive generic phase and amplitude coupling relations for beam
splitters-combiners that couple a single port with three output ports or input
ports, respectively. We apply the coupling relations to a reflection grating
that serves as a coupler to a single-ended Fabry-Perot ring cavity. In the
impedance-matched case such an interferometer can act as an all-reflective ring
mode cleaner. It is further shown that in the highly undercoupled case almost
complete separation of carrier power and phase signal from a cavity strain can
be achieved.
