We prove that second-order hyperbolic Monge-Ampere equations for one function
of two variables are connected to the wave equation by a Backlund
transformation if and only if they are integrable by the method of Darboux at
second order. One direction of proof, proving Darboux integrability, follows
the implications of the wave equation for the invariants of the G-structure
associated to the Backlund transformation. The other direction constructs
Backlund transformations for Darboux integrable equations as solutions of an
involutive exterior differential system. Explicit transformations are given for
several equations on the Goursat-Vessiot list of Darboux-integrable equations.
