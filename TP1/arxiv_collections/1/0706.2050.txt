We provide the perturbative and non-perturbative arguments showing that
theories with large number of species of the quantum fields, imply an
inevitable hierarchy between the masses of the species and the Planck scale,
shedding a different light on the hierarchy problem. In particular, using the
black hole physics, we prove that any consistent theory that includes N number
of the Z_2-conserved species of the quantum fields of mass \Lambda, puts a
lower bound on the Planck mass, which in large N limit is given by N\Lambda^2.
An useful byproduct of this proof is that any exactly conserved quantum charge,
not associated with a long-range classical field, must be defined maximum
modulo N, bounded by the the ratio of the Planck to the unit charge masses
squared. For example, a continuous global U(1) `baryon number' symmetry, must
be explicitly broken by gravity, at least down to a Z_N subgroup, with N
bounded by the ratio of the Planck to baryon masses squared. The same
constraint applies to any discrete gauge symmetry, as well as to other
quantum-mechanically detectable black hole charges that are associated with the
massive quantum hair of the black hole. We show that the
gravitationally-coupled N-species sector that solves the gauge hirearchy
problem, should be probed by LHC.
