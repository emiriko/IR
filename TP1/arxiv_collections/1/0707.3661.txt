It is shown that it is possible to create successful models of flavor for
both quarks and leptons using the discrete non-abelian group $T^{\prime}$ by
itself. Two simple realizations are presented that can be used as the starting
point for more general scenarios. In addition to the Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model particle content, the models include three generations of right
handed neutrinos and four scalar flavon fields. Three of the flavons are needed
in the quark and charged lepton sector of the models and the fourth flavon
participates only in the neutrino sector.
