Quantum pseudo-telepathy is an intriguing phenomenon which results from the
application of quantum information theory to communication complexity. To
demonstrate this phenomenon researchers in the field of quantum communication
complexity devised a number of quantum non-locality games. The setting of these
games is as follows: the players are separated so that no communication between
them is possible and are given a certain computational task. When the players
have access to a quantum resource called entanglement, they can accomplish the
task: something that is impossible in a classical setting. To an observer who
is unfamiliar with the laws of quantum mechanics it seems that the players
employ some sort of telepathy; that is, they somehow exchange information
without sharing a communication channel. This paper provides a formal framework
for specifying, implementing, and analysing quantum non-locality games.
