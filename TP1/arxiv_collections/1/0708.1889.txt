We solve the Edwards-Anderson model (EA) in different Husimi lattices. We
show that, at T=0, the structure of the solution space depends on the parity of
the loop sizes. Husimi lattices with odd loop sizes have always a trivial
paramagnetic solution stable under 1RSB perturbations while, in Husimi lattices
with even loop sizes, this solution is absent. The range of stability under
1RSB perturbations of this and other RS solutions is computed analytically
(when possible) or numerically. We compute the free-energy, the complexity and
the ground state energy of different Husimi lattices at the level of the 1RSB
approximation. We also show, when the fraction of ferromagnetic couplings
increases, the existence, first, of a discontinuous transition from a
paramagnetic to a spin glass phase and latter of a continuous transition from a
spin glass to a ferromagnetic phase.
