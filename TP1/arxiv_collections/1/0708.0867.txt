Majorana features of neutrinos and SO(3) gauge symmetry of three families
enable us to construct a gauge model of neutrino for understanding naturally
the observed smallness of neutrino masses and the nearly tri-bimaximal neutrino
mixing when combining together with the mechanism of approximate global U(1)
family symmetry. The vacuum structure of SO(3) symmetry breaking is found to
play an important role. The mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ and CP-violating phases
governed by the vacuum of spontaneous symmetry breaking are in general non-zero
and testable experimentally at the allowed sensitivity. The model predicts the
existence of vector-like SO(3) triplet charged leptons and vector-like SO(3)
triplet Majorana neutrinos as well as SO(3) tri-triplet Higgs bosons, some of
them can be light and explored at the colliders LHC and ILC.
