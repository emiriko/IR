We have investigated in detail a model that contains an additional SU(2)
singlet and triplet scalar fields than the Standard Model (SM). This allows the
radiative generation of Majorana neutrino masses at two-loop order with the
help of doubly charged Higgs bosons that arise from the extended Higgs sector.
We studied in detail the phenomenology of the Higgs and neutrino sectors of the
model. We give the analytical form of the masses of scalar and pseudoscalar
bosons and their mixings, and the structure of the active neutrino mass matrix.
It is found that the model accommodates only normal neutrino mass hierarchy,
and that there is a large parameter space where the doubly charged Higgs can be
observed at the LHC, thereby making it testable at the LHC. Furthermore, the
neutrino-less double beta ($\nonu$) decays arise predominantly from exchange
processes involving the doubly charged Higgs, whose existence is thus
unmistakable if $\nonu$ decays are observed. The production and decays of the
doubly charged Higgs are analyzed, and distinct and distinguishing signals are
discussed.
