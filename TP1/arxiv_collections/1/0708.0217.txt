We obtain general expressions for the residual density of states, electrical
conductivity and thermal conductivity for non-unitary superconductors due to
impurity scattering. We apply the results to the so-called `B phase' of
PrOs4Sb12, which we describe using a non-unitary gap function derived from
symmetry considerations. The conductivity tensor has inequivalent diagonal
components due to off-axis nodal positions which may be detectable in
experiments.
