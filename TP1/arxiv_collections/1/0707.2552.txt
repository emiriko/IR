We propose asymmetric resonant cavities with rational caustics and
experimentally demonstrate interior whispering gallery modes in monolithic
silicon mesoscopic microcavities. These microcavities demonstrate unique
robustness of cavity quality factor (Q) against roughness Rayleigh scattering.
Angle-resolved tapered fiber measurements and near-field images observe
distinct resonant families and asymmetric emission from interior whispering
gallery modes, which can be used for microcavity laser and CQED applications.
