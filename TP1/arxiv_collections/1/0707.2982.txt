The planned Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to detect
the inspiral and merger of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) at z <~ 5 with
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of hundreds to thousands. Because of these high
SNRs, and because these SNRs accrete over periods of weeks to months, it should
be possible to extract the physical parameters of these systems with high
accuracy; for instance, for a ~ 10^6 Msun MBHBs at z = 1 it should be possible
to determine the two masses to ~ 0.1% and the sky location to ~ 1 degree.
However, those are just the errors due to noise: there will be additional
"theoretical" errors due to inaccuracies in our best model waveforms, which are
still only approximate. The goal of this paper is to estimate the typical
magnitude of these theoretical errors. We develop mathematical tools for this
purpose, and apply them to a somewhat simplified version of the MBHB problem,
in which we consider just the inspiral part of the waveform and neglect
spin-induced precession, eccentricity, and PN amplitude corrections. For this
simplified version, we estimate that theoretical uncertainties in sky position
will typically be ~ 1 degree, i.e., comparable to the statistical uncertainty.
For the mass and spin parameters, our results suggest that while theoretical
errors will be rather small absolutely, they could still dominate over
statistical errors (by roughly an order of magnitude) for the strongest
sources. The tools developed here should be useful for estimating the magnitude
of theoretical errors in many other problems in gravitational-wave astronomy.
