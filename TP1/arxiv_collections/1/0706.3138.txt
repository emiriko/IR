Recent work in light flavour hadron physics is reviewed. In particular, I
discuss the significance of the progress achieved with light dynamical quarks
on the lattice for the effective low energy theory of QCD. Also, I draw
attention to some puzzling results from NA48 and KTeV concerning the scalar
form factor relevant for Kmu3 decay -- taken at face value, these indicate
physics beyond the Standard Model.
