This paper gives a simple derivation of the well-known expression of the
frequency dependent complex heat capacity in modulated temperature experiments.
It aims at clarified again that the generalized calorimetric susceptibility is
only due to the non-equilibrium behaviour occurring in the vicinity of
thermodynamic equilibrium of slow internal degrees of freedom of a sample when
the temperature oscillates at a well determined frequency.
