In this work, we revisit the electron transfer rate theory, with particular
interests in the distinct quantum solvation effect, and the characterizations
of adiabatic/nonadiabatic and Markovian/non-Markovian rate processes. We first
present a full account for the quantum solvation effect on the electron
transfer in Debye solvents, addressed previously in J. Theore. & Comput. Chem.
{\bf 5}, 685 (2006). Distinct reaction mechanisms, including the quantum
solvation-induced transitions from barrier-crossing to tunneling, and from
barrierless to quantum barrier-crossing rate processes, are shown in the fast
modulation or low viscosity regime. This regime is also found in favor of
nonadiabatic rate processes. We further propose to use Kubo's motional
narrowing line shape function to describe the Markovian character of the
reaction. It is found that a non-Markovian rate process is most likely to occur
in a symmetric system in the fast modulation regime, where the electron
transfer is dominant by tunneling due to the Fermi resonance.
