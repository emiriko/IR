We theoretically study a parallel optical configuration which includes N
periodically coupled whispering-gallery-mode resonators. The model shows an
obvious effect which has a direct analogy with the phenomenon of multiple
electromagnetically induced transparency in quantum systems. The numerical
simulations illuminate that the frequency transparency windows are sharp and
highly transparent. We also briefly discuss the experimental feasibility of the
current scheme in two practical systems, microrings and microdisks.
