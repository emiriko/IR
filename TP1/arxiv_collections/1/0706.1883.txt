The extended Falicov-Kimball model, with both an on-site hybridization
potential and dispersive narrow band, is examined within the saddle-point
approximation to the Kotliar-Ruckenstein slave boson theory. We first set the
hybridization potential to zero and find that the phase diagram depends
strongly upon the orbital structure: for degenerate orbitals, a
correlated-insulating state is found at sufficiently strong interaction
strengths, whereas a finite orbital energy difference can lead to discontinuous
valence transitions. The obtained phase diagram is very sensitive to the
presence of a finite hybridization potential. As in Hartree-Fock theory, we
find an enhancement of the hybridization by the inter-orbital Coulomb
repulsion. The more precise treatment of correlation effects, however, leads to
large deviations from the Hartree-Fock results. In the limit of vanishing
hybridization an excitonic insulator state is only found when the orbitals are
degenerate, which restricts this phase to a much smaller parameter space than
in other available mean-field theories.
