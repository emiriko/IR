Effective low energy models arising in the context of D-brane configurations
with Standard Model (SM) gauge symmetry extended by several gauged abelian
factors are discussed. The models are classified according to their hypercharge
embeddings consistent with the SM spectrum hypercharge assignment. Particular
cases are analyzed according to their perspectives and viability as low energy
effective field theory candidates. The resulting string scale is determined by
means of a two-loop renormalization group calculation. Their implications in
Yukawa couplings, neutrinos and flavor changing processes are also presented.
