We propose and analyze a general mechanism of disorder-induced order in
two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, analogous to corresponding effects
established for XY spin models. We show that a random Raman coupling induces a
relative phase of pi/2 between two BECs and that the effect is robust. We
demonstrate it in 1D, 2D and 3D at T=0 and present evidence that it persists at
small T>0. Applications to phase control in ultracold spinor condensates are
discussed.
