A Multi-Channel Algebraic Scattering (MCAS) theory is presented with which
the properties of a compound nucleus are found from a coupled-channel problem.
The method defines both the bound states and resonances of the compound
nucleus, even if the compound nucleus is particle unstable. All resonances of
the system are found no matter how weak and/or narrow. Spectra of mass-7 nuclei
and of {}^{15}F, and MCAS results for a radiative capture cross section are
presented.
