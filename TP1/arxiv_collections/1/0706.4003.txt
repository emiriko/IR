The shot noise power and the Fano factor of a spinless resonant level model
is calculated. The Coulomb interaction which in this model acts between the
lead electron and the impurity is considered in the first order approximation.
The logarithmic divergencies which appeared in the expressions for shot noise
and the transport current are removed by renormalization group analysis. It is
shown that Keldysh technique gives an adequate description of perturbation
theory results. By passing to the bosonized form of the resonance model it is
proven that in the strong interaction limit the tunnelling becomes irrelevant
and decreases.
