We have studied the annealing effect in transport properties of High
temperature Josephson Junctions (HTc JJ) made by ion irradiation. Low
temperature annealing (80 degrees Celsius) increases the JJ transition
temperature (TJ) and the Ic.Rn product, where Ic is the critical current and Rn
the normal resistance. We found that the spread in JJ characteristics can be
lowered by sufficient long annealing times. Using random walk numerical
simulations, we showed that the characteristic annealing time and the evolution
of the spread in JJ characteristics can be explained by a vacancy-interstitial
annihilation process rather than by an oxygen diffusion one.
