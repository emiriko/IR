Considering very high energy peripheral electron-hadron scattering with a
production of hadronic state X moving closely to the direction of initial
hadron the Weizs\"acker-Williams like expression, relating the difference of
q^2-dependent differential cross-sections of DIS processes to the convergent
integral over the difference of the total hadron photo-production
cross-sections on hadros, is derived. Then, exploiting analytic properties of
the forward retarded Compton scattering amplitude on the same hadrons, first,
the sum rules are derived bringing into relation hadron electromagnetic form
factors with the difference of the q^2-dependent differential cross-sections of
DIS, then using Weizs\"acker-Williams like expression and taking the derivative
of both sides according to ${\bf q^2}$ for ${\bf q^2} \to 0$ one comes to new
universal hadron sum rules relating hadron static parameters to the convergent
integral over the difference of the total hadron photo-production
cross-sections on hadrons.
