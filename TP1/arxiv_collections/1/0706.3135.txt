The masses of positive parity $(70,0^+)$ and $(70,2^+)$ nonstrange and
strange baryons are calculated in the relativistic quark model. The
relativistic three-quark equations of the $(70,L^+)$ multiplets are found in
the framework of the dispersion relation technique. The approximate solutions
of these equations using the method based on the extraction of leading
singularities of the amplitude are obtained. The calculated mass values of the
$(70,L^+)$ multiplets are in good agreement with the experimental ones.
