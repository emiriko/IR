For the gluon propagator of pure SU(2) lattice gauge theory in the Landau
gauge we investigate the effect of Gribov copies and finite-volume effects.
Concerning gauge fixing, we enlarge the accessible gauge orbits by adding
non-periodic Z(2) gauge transformations and systematically employ the simulated
annealing algorithm. Strategies to keep all Z(2) sectors under control within
reasonable CPU time are discussed. We demonstrate that the finite-volume
effects in the infrared regime become ameliorated. Reaching a physical volume
of about (6.5 fm)^4, we find that the propagator, calculated with the indicated
improvements, becomes flat in the region of smallest momenta. First signs in 4d
of a final decrease towards vanishing momentum are discussed.
