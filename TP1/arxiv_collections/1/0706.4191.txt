We consider the Randall-Sundrum extra dimensional model with fields
propagating in the bulk based on an extended electroweak gauge symmetry with
specific fermion charges and localizations that allow to explain the LEP
anomaly of the forward--backward asymmetry for $b$--quarks, $A_{FB}^b$. We
study the manifestations of the strongly--interacting and electroweak gauge
boson Kaluza--Klein excitations $\vkk$ at the LHC, with masses of the order of
a few TeV, which dominantly decays into top and bottom quark pairs. We first
analyze the two--body tree--level production processes $pp \to t\bar t$ and
$b\bar b$ in which the Kaluza--Klein (KK) excitations of gauge bosons are
exchanged. We find that the additional channels can lead to a significant
excess of events with respect to the Standard Model prediction; characteristic
top quark polarization and angular asymmetries are quantitatively studied and
turn out to probe the chiral structure of couplings to excited states. We then
analyze higher order production processes for the gauge boson excitations which
have too weak or no couplings to light quarks and, in particular, the loop
induced process $gg \to \vkk \to t\bar t$ and $b\bar b$ in which the anomalous
$gg \vkk $ four--dimensional vertex has to be regulated. The RS effects in this
process, as well as in the four--body reactions $pp \to t\bar t b\bar b$,
$t\bar t t\bar t$, $b\bar b b\bar b$ and in the related three--body reactions
$gb \to b t \bar t$, $b b\bar b$, in which the $\vkk$ excitations are mainly
radiated off the eavy quarks, are shown to be potentially difficult to test at
LHC, due to small hase space and low parton density for $\mkk \gsim 3$ TeV.
