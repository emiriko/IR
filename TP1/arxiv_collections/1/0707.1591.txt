We show that there are regions in the parameter space of the Littlest Higgs
model with T-parity, allowed by electroweak precision data, where the Higgs
boson can decay invisibly into a pair of heavy photons A_H with a substantial
branching ratio. For a symmetry breaking scale f in the range 450-600 GeV, the
BR(H -> A_H A_H) can be up to 95% for an intermediate mass Higgs, and from 20%
down to a few percents for a Higgs boson of mass 200 GeV or above. The total
decay width of the Higgs boson can thereby be enhanced by an order of magnitude
compared to the Standard Model for Higgs masses around 130 GeV.
