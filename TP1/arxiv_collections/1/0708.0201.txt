The possibility of compensating absorption in negative-index metatamterials
(NIMs) doped by resonant nonlinear-optical centers is shown. The role of
quantum interference and extraordinary properties of four-wave parametric
amplification of counter-propagating electromagnetic waves in NIMs are
discussed.
