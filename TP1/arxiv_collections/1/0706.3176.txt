Using the gauge-invariant but path-dependent variables formalism, we compute
the static quantum potential for noncommutative axionic electrodynamics, and
find a radically different result than the corresponding commutative case. We
explicitly show that the static potential profile is analogous to that
encountered in both non-Abelian axionic electrodynamics and in Yang-Mills
theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking of scale symmetry.
