We study various solutions of the Sine Gordon model in (1+1) dimensions. We
use the Hirota method to construct some of them and then show that the wobble,
discussed in detail by K\"alberman, is one of such solutions. We concentrate
our attention on a kink and its bound states with one or two breathers. We
study their stability and some aspects of their scattering properties on
potential wells and on fixed boundary conditions.
