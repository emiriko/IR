In microwave resonant systems with ferrite samples, one becomes faced with
specific phase relations for the electromagnetic fields. Such specific phase
relations may lead to appearance of nontrivial states: electromagnetic
vortices. This paper provides some general ideas and design principles for
microwave devices with the field vortex structures.
