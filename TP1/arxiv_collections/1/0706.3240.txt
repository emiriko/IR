Tunnel spin polarization in a piezoelectric AlGaN/GaN double barrier
structure is calculated. It is shown that the piezoelectric field and the
spontaneous electrical polarization increase an efficiency of the tunnel spin
injection. The relation between the electrical polarization and the spin
orientation allows engineering a zero magnetic field spin injection
manipulating the lattice-mismatch strain with an Al-content in the barriers.
