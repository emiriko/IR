An attempt is made to resolve the controversy related to the low temperature
phase (ground state) of the low-doped ferromagnetic (FM)- insulator(I)
manganite through bulk magnetic measurements on La${_{0.9}}$Sr$_{0.1}$MnO${_3}$
sample. It is shown that the FM phase, formed out of well defined transition in
the low-doped system, becomes inhomogeneous with decrease in temperature. This
inhomogeniety is considered to be an outcome of the formation of orbital domain
state of e$_g$-electrons having hole rich (metallic) walls separating the hole
deficient (insulating) regions. The resulting complexity brings in
metastability and glassy behaviour within the FM phase at low temperature,
however, with no resemblance to spin glass, cluster glass or reentrant phases.
It shows ageing effect without memory but magnetic relaxation shows signatures
of inter-cluster interaction. The energy landscape picture of this glassy phase
is described in terms of hierarchical model. Further, it is shown that this
inhomogeneity disappear in La${_{0.9}}$Sr$_{0.1}$MnO$_{3.08}$ where, the
orbital domain state is destroyed by self doping resulting in reduction of
Mn$^{3+}$ and hence e$_g$-electrons. The ferromagnetic phase of the
non-stoichiometric sample, does not show glassy behaviour. It neither follows
'hierarchical model' nor 'droplet model' generally used to explain glassy or
inhomogeneous systems. Its magnetic response can be explained simply from the
domain wall dynamics of otherwise homogeneous ferromagnet.
