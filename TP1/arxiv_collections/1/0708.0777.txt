In this work the authors implemented a resonator based upon microstrip
cavities that permits the generation of microwaves with arbitrary polarization.
Design, simulation, and implementation of the resonators were performed using
standard printed circuit boards. The electric field distribution was mapped
using a scanning probe cavity perturbation technique. Electron spin resonance
using a standard marker was carried out in order to verify the polarization
control from linear to circular.
