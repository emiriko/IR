Various types of surface functionalized nanosilica (50-60 nm size with 3-10
nm inner pore size range) have been used to kill insect pests by sucking up
cuticular lipids and breaking the water barrier. We have also utilized
nanosilica for mopping up host lipids induced by the malarial parasite, P.
gallinaceum in poultry birds; VLDL cholesterol and serum triglycerides are
brought back to the normal level with a concomitant check in parasite growth.
While this work continues, we have explored another more convenient system,
silkworm (Bombyx mori) that is frequently decimated by a baculovirus, NPV for
which no antidote is known so far. Here, too, viral infection enhances host
lipids. Eight different types of nanosilica were injected in the virus infected
silkworm (batches of 10 worms) after ensuring 100% survival up to cocoon
formation in control larvae (injected with the same volume of ethanol, the
medium of nanosilica). Of these 8, AL60102 and AL60106, have the most marked
effect on infected silkworm, both as prophylactic and pharmaceutical agents.
Normal larvae injected with these nanosilica survive up to cocoon formation.
