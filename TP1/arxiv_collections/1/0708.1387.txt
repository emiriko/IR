We have performed an {\it in-situ} photoemission study of Pr_{1-x}Ca_xMnO_3
(PCMO) thin films grown on LaAlO_3 (001) substrates and observed the effect of
epitaxial strain on the electronic structure. We found that the chemical
potential shifted monotonically with doping, unlike bulk PCMO, implying the
disappearance of incommensurate charge fluctuations of bulk PCMO. In the
valence-band spectra, we found a doping-induced energy shift toward the Fermi
level (E_F) but there was no spectral weight transfer, which was observed in
bulk PCMO. The gap at E_F was clearly seen in the experimental band dispersions
determined by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and could not be
explained by the metallic band structure of the C-type antiferromagnetic state,
probably due to localization of electrons along the ferromagnetic chain
direction or due to another type of spin-orbital ordering.
