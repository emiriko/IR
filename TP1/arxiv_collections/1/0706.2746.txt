A quantum storage device differs radically from a conventional physical
storage device. Its state can be set to any value in a certain (infinite) state
space, but in general every possible read operation yields only partial
information about the stored state.
  The purpose of this paper is to initiate the study of a combinatorial
abstraction, called abstract storage device (ASD), which models deterministic
storage devices with the property that only partial information about the state
can be read, but that there is a degree of freedom as to which partial
information should be retrieved.
  This concept leads to a number of interesting problems which we address, like
the reduction of one device to another device, the equivalence of devices,
direct products of devices, as well as the factorization of a device into
primitive devices. We prove that every ASD has an equivalent ASD with minimal
number of states and of possible read operations. Also, we prove that the
reducibility problem for ASD's is NP-complete, that the equivalence problem is
at least as hard as the graph isomorphism problem, and that the factorization
into binary-output devices (if it exists) is unique.
