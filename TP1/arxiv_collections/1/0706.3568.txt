The data on the tensor Ayy, Axx, Axz and vector Ay analyzing powers in the
dd->3Hen obtained at Td= 270 MeV in the angular range 0 - 110 degrees in the
c.m. are presented. The observed negative sign of the tensor analyzing powers
Ayy, Axx and Axz at small angles clearly demonstrate the sensitivity to the
ratio of the D and S wave component of the 3He wave function. However, the
one-nucleon exchange calculations by using the standard 3He wave functions have
failed to reproduce the strong variation of the tensor analyzing powers as a
function of the angle in the c.m.
