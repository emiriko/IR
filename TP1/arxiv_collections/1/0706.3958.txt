In jet quenching, a hard QCD parton, before fragmenting into a jet of
hadrons, deposits a fraction of its energy in the medium, leading to suppressed
production of high-$p_T$ hadrons. Assuming that the deposited energy quickly
thermalizes, we simulate the subsequent hydrodynamic evolution of the QGP
fluid. Hydrodynamic evolution and subsequent particle emission depend on the
jet trajectories. Azimuthal distribution of excess $\pi^-$ due to quenching
jet, averaged over all the trajectories, reasonably well reproduce the
di-hadron correlation as measured by the STAR and PHENIX collaboration in
central and in peripheral Au+Au collisions.
