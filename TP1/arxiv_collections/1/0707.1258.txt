The PHENIX experiment at RHIC measured K0S, eta and omega-meson production at
high pT in p+p, d+Au and Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV. Measurements
performed in different hadronic decay channels give consistent results. This
paper presents measured meson-to-pi0 ratios and Nuclear Modification factors in
the most central d+Au and Au+Au collisions. No suppression seen in d+Au
interactions is in contrast to a strong suppression of meson yields revealed in
central Au+Au collisions at the same energy.
