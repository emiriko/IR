In statistical mechanics Gibbs' paradox is avoided if the particles of a gas
are assumed to be indistinguishable. The resulting entropy then agrees with the
empirically tested thermodynamic entropy up to a term proportional to the
logarithm of the particle number. We discuss here how analogous situations
arise in the statistical foundation of black-hole entropy. Depending on the
underlying approach to quantum gravity, the fundamental objects to be counted
have to be assumed indistinguishable or not in order to arrive at the
Bekenstein--Hawking entropy. We also show that the logarithmic corrections to
this entropy, including their signs, can be understood along the lines of
standard statistical mechanics. We illustrate the general concepts within the
area quantization model of Bekenstein and Mukhanov.
