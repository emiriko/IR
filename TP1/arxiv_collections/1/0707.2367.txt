We outline the qualitatively different physics behind charging-induced
current asymmetries in molecular conductors operating in the weakly interacting
self-consistent field (SCF) and the strongly interacting Coulomb Blockade (CB)
regimes. A conductance asymmetry arises in SCF because of the unequal
mean-field potentials that shift a closed-shell conducting level differently
for positive and negative bias. A very different current asymmetry arises for
CB due to the unequal number of open-shell excitation channels at opposite bias
voltages. The CB regime, dominated by single charge effects, typically requires
a computationally demanding many-electron or Fock space description. However,
our analysis of molecular Coulomb Blockade measurements reveals that many novel
signatures can be explained using a {{simpler}} orthodox model that involves an
incoherent sum of Fock space excitations and {\it{hence treats the molecule as
a metallic dot or an island}}. This also reduces the complexity of the Fock
space description by just including various charge configurations only, thus
partially underscoring the importance of electronic structure, while retaining
the essence of the single charge nature of the transport process. We finally
point out, however, that the inclusion of electronic structure and hence
well-resolved Fock space excitations is crucial in some notable examples.
