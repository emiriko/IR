We study the two-dimensional paramagnetic Anderson-Hubbard model using an
extension of dynamical mean-field theory that allows us to treat disorder and
strong electronic correlations on equal footing. We investigate the scaling of
the inverse participation ratio at quarter- and half-filling and find a
nonmonotonic dependence of the localization length on the interaction strength.
We do not find evidence for an insulator-metal transition. The disorder
potential becomes unscreened near the Mott transition. Furthermore, strong
correlations suppress the Altshuler-Aronov density of states anomaly near
half-filling.
