The paper is devoted to the presentation of the non-spectral methods of
analysis of the natural measurements of the internal gravity waves in the ocean
with the purpose to determine characteristics of the wave-trains composing the
measured field, the forms and parameters of the ocean along the pass of these
wave-trains propagation. The problem of the analysis of the data of the natural
measurements of the internal waves with the purpose to separate the single
wave-trains from the measured field, and on this basis to determine the
characteristics of these wave-trains, to receive the information on the sources
of excitation of the waves, and the information on the properties of the ocean
along the pass of the waves propagation, is directly connected with the
problems of the wave dynamics. The basis of the offered algorithms of the
analysis is the supposition, that the measured wave field represents the sum of
the plane wave-trains having the certain speed and directions of propagation.
Transformation of the packages of the internal waves, which can be determined
by the given methods, may testify about the passage of the wave-trains through
the big-size oceanic formations, that makes it possible to remotely determine
the characteristics of these formations.
