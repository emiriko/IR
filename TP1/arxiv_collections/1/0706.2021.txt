This paper illustrates the prospective need for structural fingerprinting
methods for nanocrystals. A review of the existing fingerprinting methods for
crystal structures by means of transmission electron microscopy which work for
a single setting of the specimen goniometer is given. Suggestions are made on
how some of these methods could be enhanced when nanocrystals and novel
instrumentation are involved, i.e. when either the kinematic or quasi-kinematic
scattering approximations are sufficiently well satisfied. A novel strategy for
lattice-fringe fingerprinting of nanocrystals from Fourier transforms of
high-resolution phase contrast transmission electron microscopy images is
briefly outlined. Nanocrystal structure specific limitations to the application
of this strategy are discussed. An appeal is made to share the structural data
of nanocrystals freely over the internet and infrastructure that would allow
this sharing is mentioned. A shorter version of this paper has been accepted
for publication in a special issue on the Structure of Nanocrystals of the
Zeitschrift fuer Kristallographie, International journal for structural,
physical, and chemical aspects of crystalline materials.
