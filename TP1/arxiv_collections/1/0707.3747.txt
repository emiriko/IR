The specializations of the motivic elliptic polylog are called motivic
Eisenstein classes. For applications to special values of L-Functions, it is
important to compute the realizations of these classes. In this paper, we prove
that the syntomic realization of the motivic Eisenstein classes, restricted to
the ordinary locus of the modular curve, may be expressed using p-adic
Eisenstein-Kronecker series. These p-adic modular forms are defined using the
two-variable p-adic measure with values in p-adic modular forms constructed by
Katz.
