The light output, $\alpha/\beta$ ratio, and pulse shape have been
investigated at $-25^\circ$ C with PbWO$_4$ crystal scintillators undoped, and
doped by F, Eu, Mo, Gd and S. The fast $0.01-0.06 \mu$s and middle $0.1-0.5
\mu$s components of scintillation decay were observed for all the samples. Slow
components of scintillation signal with the decay times $1-3 \mu$s and $13-28
\mu$s with the total intensity up to $\approx50%$ have been recognized for
several samples doped by Molybdenum. We found some indications of a pulse-shape
discrimination between $\alpha$ particles and $\gamma$ quanta with PbWO$_4$ (Mo
doped) crystal scintillators.
