Single crystals of the dilute, rare earth bearing, pseudo-ternary series,
Gd_xY_{1-x}Fe_2Zn_{20} were grown out of Zn-rich solution. Measurements of
magnetization, resistivity and heat capacity on Gd_xY_{1-x}Fe_2Zn_{20} samples
reveal ferromagnetic order of Gd^{3+} local moments across virtually the whole
series ($x \geq 0.02$). The magnetic properties of this series, including the
ferromagnetic ordering, the reduced saturated moments at base temperature, the
deviation of the susceptibilities from Curie-Weiss law and the anomalies in the
resistivity, are understood within the frame work of dilute, $\textbf {S}$
moments (Gd^{3+}) embedded in a nearly ferromagnetic Fermi liquid
(YFe_2Zn_{20}). The s-d model is employed to further explain the variation of
$T_{\mathrm{C}}$ with x as well as the temperature dependences of of the
susceptibilities.
