Quantum chaotic maps can efficiently generate pseudo-random states carrying
almost maximal multipartite entanglement, as characterized by the probability
distribution of bipartite entanglement between all possible bipartitions of the
system. We show that such multipartite entanglement is robust, in the sense
that, when realistic noise is considered, distillable entanglement of
bipartitions remains almost maximal up to a noise strength that drops only
polynomially with the number of qubits.
