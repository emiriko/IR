Having calculated the light-cone wave function of the pseudoscalar meson by
using two equivalent and fully covariant methods, we generalize such methods to
the valence Fock states of the vector meson in the light-cone formalism. We
investigate the decay constant of the $\rho$ meson $f_{\rho}$, the
$\gamma^{\ast} \pi \to \rho $ and $\gamma^* \rho \to \pi $ transition form
factors and especially the transition magnetic moments. By using two groups of
constraint parameters, we predict the space-like and time-like form factors
$F_{\pi \rho}(Q^2)$ and $F_{\rho \pi}(Q^2)$ at low and moderate energy scale
and the electromagnetic radius of these transition processes. In addition, we
extend our calculation to $\gamma^* \pi \to \omega$ space-like and time-like
form factors by using the same sets of parameters.
