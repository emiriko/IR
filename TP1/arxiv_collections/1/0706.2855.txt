We show that the system of weakly bound molecules of heavy and light
fermionic atoms is characterized by a long-range intermolecular repulsion and
can undergo a gas-crystal quantum transition if the mass ratio exceeds a
critical value. For the critical mass ratio above 100 obtained in our
calculations, this crystalline order can be observed as a superlattice in an
optical lattice for heavy atoms with a small filling factor. We also find that
this novel system is sufficiently stable with respect to molecular relaxation
into deep bound states and to the process of trimer formation.
