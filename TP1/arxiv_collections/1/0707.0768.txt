A direct correlation is seen between the coercive field (HC) and the
magnetic-field-dependent resistivity (MR) in SrMnO3/SrRuO3 superlattices of
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The magnetoresistance shows a sharp jump at
Hc for in-plane current and the out-of-plane magnetic field. Both HC and
high-field MR also oscillate with the thickness of the SrMnO3 spacer layers
separating the metallic ruthenate. Since the spacer in these superlattices has
no mobile carriers to facilitate an oscillatory coupling, we attribute the
observed behavior to the spin-polarized quantum tunneling of electrons between
the ferromagnetic layers and antiferromagnetically ordered t2g spins of SrMnO3.
