We prove that the algebra of endomorphisms of a Weyl module of critical level
is isomorphic to the algebra of functions on the space of monodromy-free opers
on the disc with regular singularity and residue determined by the highest
weight of the Weyl module. This result may be used to test the local geometric
Langlands correspondence proposed in our earlier work arXiv:math/0508382.
