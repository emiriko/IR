We obtain a vanishing theorem for the half-kernel of a transverse ${\rm
Spin}\sp c$ Dirac operator on a compact manifold endowed with a transversely
almost complex Riemannian foliation twisted by a sufficiently large power of a
line bundle, whose curvature vanishes along the leaves and is transversely
non-degenerate at any point of the ambient manifold.
