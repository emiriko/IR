Rotating black hole solutions in the (3+1)-dimensional Chern-Simons modified
gravity theory are discussed by taking account of perturbation around the
Schwarzschild solution. The zenith-angle dependence of a metric function
related to the frame-dragging effect is determined from a constraint equation
independently of a choice of the embedding coordinate. We find that at least
within the framework of the first-order perturbation method, the black hole
cannot rotate for finite black hole mass if the embedding coordinate is taken
to be a timelike vector. However, the rotation can be permitted in the limit of
$M/r \to 0$ (where $M$ is the black hole mass and $r$ is the radius). For a
spacelike vector, the rotation can also be permitted for any value of the black
hole mass.
