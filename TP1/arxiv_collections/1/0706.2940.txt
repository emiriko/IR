The Large Hadron Collider is an ideal place for precision measurements of the
properties of the electroweak gauge bosons W^\pm, Z^0, as well as of the top
quark. In this article, a few highlights of the prospects for performing such
measurements with the CMS detector are summarized, with an emphasis on the
first few 1/fb of data.
