Three-body recombination, an important collisional process in plasmas,
increases dramatically at low electron temperatures, with an accepted scaling
of T_e^-9/2. We measure three-body recombination in an ultracold neutral xenon
plasma by detecting recombination-created Rydberg atoms using a
microwave-ionization technique. With the accepted theory (expected to be
applicable for weakly-coupled plasmas) and our measured rates we extract the
plasma temperatures, which are in reasonable agreement with previous
measurements early in the plasma lifetime. The resulting electron temperatures
indicate that the plasma continues to cool to temperatures below 1 K.
