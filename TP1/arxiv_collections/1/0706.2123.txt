A two-dimensional Minkowski spacetime diagram is neatly represented on a
Euclidean ordinary plane. However the Euclidean lengths of the lines on the
diagram do not correspond to the true values of physical quantities in
spacetime, except for those referring to the stationary reference frame. In
order to extend its abilities to other inertial reference frames, we derive a
factor which, multiplied by the magnitude of the actually displayed values (on
the diagram), leads to the corresponding true measured values by any other
inertial observers. Doing so, the student can infer from the Euclidean diagram
plot the expressions that account for Lorentz length contraction, time dilation
and also Lorentz Transformations just by using regular trigonometry.
