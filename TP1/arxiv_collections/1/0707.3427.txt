An implementation of weak values is investigated in solid-state qubits. We
demonstrate that a weak value can be non-classical if and only if a
Leggett-Garg inequality can also be violated. Generalized weak values are
described, where post-selection on a range of weak measurement results.
Imposing classical weak values permits the derivation of Leggett-Garg
inequalities for bounded operators. Our analysis is presented in terms of
kicked quantum nondemolition measurements on a quantum double-dot charge qubit.
