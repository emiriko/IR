The specific heat of the layered organic superconductor $\kappa$-%
(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu(NCS)$_2$, where BEDT-TTF is bisethylenedithio-%
tetrathiafulvalene, has been studied in magnetic fields up to 28 T applied
perpendicular and parallel to the superconducting layers. In parallel fields
above 21 T, the superconducting transition becomes first order, which signals
that the Pauli-limiting field is reached. Instead of saturating at this field
value, the upper critical field increases sharply and a second first-order
transition line appears within the superconducting phase. Our results give
strong evidence that the phase, which separates the homogeneous superconducting
state from the normal state is a realization of a
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state.
