We derive a simplified representation for the pion mass to two loops in
three-flavour chiral perturbation theory. For this purpose, we first determine
the reduced expressions for the tensorial two-loop 2-point sunset integrals
arising in chiral perturbation theory calculations. Making use of those
relations, we obtain the expression for the pion mass in terms of the minimal
set of master integrals. On the basis of known results for these, we arrive at
an explicit analytic representation, up to the contribution from K-K-eta
intermediate states where a closed-form expression for the corresponding sunset
integral is missing. However, the expansion of this function for a small pion
mass leads to a simple representation which yields a very accurate
approximation of this contribution. Finally, we also give a discussion of the
numerical implications of our results.
