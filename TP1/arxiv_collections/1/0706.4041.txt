Elongated Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) exhibit strong spatial phase
fluctuations even well below the BEC transition temperature. We demonstrate
that atom interferometers using such condensates are robust against phase
fluctuations, i.e. the relative phase of the split condensate is reproducible
despite axial phase fluctuations. However, larger phase fluctuations limit the
coherence time, especially in the presence of some asymmetries in the two wells
of the interferometer.
