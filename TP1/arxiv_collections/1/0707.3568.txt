The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will start operation in the end of 2007
colliding proton and lead beams at \surd S = 14 TeV and \surd S_{NN} = 5.5 TeV,
respectively. The accelerator and the experiments are under construction and
detailed studies of the physics program are being prepared. I will in this
paper review the current status of the ALICE experiment and the heavy ion
physics aspects that are unique at LHC.
