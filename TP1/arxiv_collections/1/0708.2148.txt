The single- and two-channel Kondo lattice model consisting of localized spins
interacting antiferromagnetically with the itinerent electrons, are studied
using dynamical mean field theory. As an impurity solver for the effective
single impurity Anderson model we used the exact diagonalization (ED) method.
Using ED allowed us to perform calculations for low temperatures and couplings
of arbitrary large strength. Our results for the single-channel case confirm
and extend the recent investigations. In the two-channel case we find a
symmetry breaking phase transition with increasing coupling strength.
