We calculate the real and imaginary electron self-energy as well as the
quasiparticle spectral function in doped graphene taking into account
electron-electron interaction in the leading order dynamically screened Coulomb
coupling. Our theory provides the basis for calculating {\it all} one-electron
properties of extrinsic graphene. Comparison with existing ARPES measurements
shows broad qualitative agreement between theory and experiment. We also
calculate the renormalized graphene momentum distribution function, finding a
typical Fermi liquid discontinuity at k_F. We also provide a critical
discussion of the relevant many body approximations (e.g. RPA) for graphene.
