Magnetic tunnel junctions with a ferrimagnetic barrier layer have been
studied to understand the role of the barrier layer in the tunneling process -
a factor that has been largely overlooked until recently. Epitaxial oxide
junctions of highly spin polarized La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 and Fe3O4 electrodes with
magnetic NiMn2O4 (NMO) insulating barrier layers provide a magnetic tunnel
junction system in which we can probe the effect of the barrier by comparing
junction behavior above and below the Curie temperature of the barrier layer.
When the barrier is paramagnetic, the spin polarized transport is dominated by
interface scattering and surface spin waves; however, when the barrier is
ferrimagnetic, spin flip scattering due to spin waves within the NMO barrier
dominates the transport.
