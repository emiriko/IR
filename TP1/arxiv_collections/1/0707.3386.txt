Galilei invariant equations for massless fields are obtained via contractions
of relativistic wave equations. It is shown that the collection of
non-equivalent Galilei-invariant wave equations for massless fields with spin
equal 1 and 0 is very broad and describes many physically consistent systems.
In particular, there exist a huge number of such equations for massless fields
which correspond to various contractions of representations of the Lorentz
group to those of the Galilei one.
