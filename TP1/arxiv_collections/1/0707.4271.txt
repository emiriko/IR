Inherent asymmetry in the tunneling barriers of few-electron quantum dots
induces intrinsically different tunneling currents for forward and reverse
source-drain biases in the non-linear transport regime. Here we show that in
addition to spin selection rules, overlap matrix elements between many-body
states are crucial for the correct description of tunneling transmission
through quantum dots at large magnetic fields. Signatures of excited
(N-1)-electron states in the transport process through the N-electron system
are clearly identified in the measured transconductances. Our analysis clearly
confirms the validity of single-electron quantum transport theory in quantum
dots.
