Multiferroic CuFe1-xAlxO2 (x=0.02) exhibits a ferroelectric ordering
accompanied by a proper helical magnetic ordering below T=7K under zero
magnetic field. By polarized neutron diffraction and pyroelectric measurements,
we have revealed a one-to-one correspondence between the spin helicity and the
direction of the spontaneous electric polarization. This result indicates that
the spin helicity of the proper helical magnetic ordering is essential for the
ferroelectricity in CuFe1-xAlxO2. The induction of the electric polarization by
the proper helical magnetic ordering is, however, cannot be explained by the
Katsura-Nagaosa-Balatsky model, which successfully explains the
ferroelectricity in the recently explored ferroelectric helimagnets, such as
TbMnO3. We thus conclude that CuFe1-xAlxO2 is a new class of magnetic
ferroelectrics.
