An experiment is proposed, on the coherent quantum dynamics of a
semiconductor microcavity containing quantum dots. Modeling the experiment
using a generalized Dicke model, we show that a tailored excitation pulse can
create an energy-dependent population of excitons, which subsequently evolves
to a quantum condensate of excitons and photons. The population is created by a
generalization of adiabatic rapid passage, and then condenses due to a
dynamical analog of the BCS instability.
