In this paper we present an improved process for producing elastomer
transistor stamps and high-mobility organic field-effect transistors (FETs)
based on semiconducting acene molecular crystals. In particular, we have
removed the need to use a silanized Si wafer for curing the stamps and to
handle a fragile micron-thickness polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) insulating film
and laminate it, bubble free, against the PDMS transistor stamp. We find that
despite the altered design, rougher PDMS surface, and lamination and
measurement of the device in air, we still achieve electrical mobilities of
order 10 cm^2/Vs, comparable to the current state of the art in organic FETs.
Our device shows hole conduction with a threshold voltage of order -9V, which
corresponds to a trap density of 1.4 x 10^10 cm^-2.
