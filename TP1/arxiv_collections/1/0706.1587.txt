We report the observation of high order resonances of the quantum
$\delta$-kicked accelerator using a BEC kicked by a standing wave of light. The
signature of these resonances is the existence of quantum accelerator modes.
For the first time quantum accelerator modes were seen near 1/4 and 1/3 of the
Talbot time. Using a BEC enabled us to study the detailed structure of the
modes and resonances which are related to the fractional Talbot effect. We
present a general theory for this system and apply it to predict the behavior
of the accelerator modes.
