The electronic transport in polypyrrole thin films synthesized chemically
from the vapor phase is studied as a function of temperature as well as of
electric and magnetic fields. We find distinct differences in comparison to the
behavior of both polypyrrole films prepared by electrochemical growth as well
as of the bulk films obtained from conventional chemical synthesis. For small
electric fields F, a transition from Efros-Shklovskii variable range hopping to
Arrhenius activated transport is observed at 30 K. High electric fields induce
short range hopping. The characteristic hopping distance is found to be
proportional to F^(-1/2). The magnetoresistance R(B) is independent of F below
a critical magnetic field, above which F counteracts the magnetic field induced
localization.
