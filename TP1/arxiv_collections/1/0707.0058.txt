Planck introduced his famous units of mass, length and time a hundred years
ago. The many interesting facets of the Planck mass and length are explored.
The Planck mass ubiquitously occurs in astrophysics, cosmology, quantum
gravity, string theory, etc. Current aspects of its implications for
unification of fundamental interactions, energy dependence of coupling
constants, dark energy, etc. are discussed.
