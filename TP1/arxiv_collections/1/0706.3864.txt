We estimate the ratios of bare astrophysical S-factors at zero incident
energy for proton and deuteron induced reactions in a model which assumes a
compound nucleus formation probability plus a statistical decay. The obtained
ratios agree well with available experimental values, as far as the reactions
which have dominant s-wave entrance channel components are investigated. Due to
its simplicity the model could be used as a guidance for predictions on
reactions which have not been investigated yet.
