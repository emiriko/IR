We highlight the conceptual issues that arise when one applies the
quasi-Hermitian framework to analyze scattering from localized non-Hermitian
potentials, in particular complex square-wells or delta-functions. When treated
in the framework of conventional quantum mechanics, these potentials are
generally considered as effective theories, in which probability is not
conserved because of processes that have been ignored. However, if they are
treated as fundamental theories, the Hilbert-space metric must be changed. In
order for the newly-defined probability to be conserved, it must differ from
the standard one, even at asymptotically large distances from the scattering
centre, and the mechanism for this is the non-locality of the new metric, as we
show in detail in the model of a single complex delta function. However,
properties of distant bound-state systems, which do not interact physically
with the non-Hermitian scattering potential, should not be affected. We analyze
a model Hamiltonian that supports this contention.
