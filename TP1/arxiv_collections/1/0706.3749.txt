The dynamics of an open quantum system can be described by a quantum
operation, a linear, complete positive map of operators. Here, I exhibit a
compact expression for the time reversal of a quantum operation, which is
closely analogous to the time reversal of a classical Markov transition matrix.
Since open quantum dynamics are stochastic, and not, in general, deterministic,
the time reversal is not, in general, an inversion of the dynamics. Rather, the
system relaxes towards equilibrium in both the forward and reverse time
directions. The probability of a quantum trajectory and the conjugate, time
reversed trajectory are related by the heat exchanged with the environment.
