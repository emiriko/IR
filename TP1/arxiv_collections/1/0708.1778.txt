Elemental chromium orders antiferromagnetically near room temperature, but
the ordering temperature can be driven to zero by applying large pressures. We
combine diamond anvil cell and synchrotron x-ray diffraction techniques to
measure directly the spin and charge order in the pure metal at the approach to
its quantum critical point. Both spin and charge order are suppressed
exponentially with pressure, well beyond the region where disorder cuts off
such a simple evolution, and they maintain a harmonic scaling relationship over
decades in scattering intensity. By comparing the development of the order
parameter with that of the magnetic wavevector, it is possible to ascribe the
destruction of antiferromagnetism to the growth in electron kinetic energy
relative to the underlying magnetic exchange interaction.
