A new phenomenological theory for the expansion of our universe is presented.
Because fundamental supporting theory is still in development, its discussion
is not presented in this paper. The theory is based on a new algebraic
expression for cosmic time G Rho t^2=3/32Pi, which correctly predicts the WMAP
measured cosmological constants and the fundamental Hubble parameter H(t) for
the expansion of the universe. A replacement for dark matter, called here "dark
mass", is proposed which scales as with the expansion and incorporated. It does
not react with ordinary matter, except gravitationally, and produces flat
rotational curves for spiral galaxies. Also a new expression for the
approaching velocity of radiation in a closed 3-sphere expanding universe is
given that accounts for the early degrading negative approach of radiation for
z > 1.7. The expression is v = Hr-c. Combining these three elements produces a
luminosity distance dL that successfully predicts the apparent magnitude of
exploding supernova Ia stars and even the new gamma ray bursts with no need for
dark energy or acceleration of the expansion of the universe.
