We present evidence of direct electron tunneling across intrinsic insulating
regions in sub-micrometer wide bridges of the phase separated ferromagnet
(La,Pr,Ca)MnO$_3$. Upon cooling below the Curie temperature, a predominantly
ferromagnetic supercooled state persists where tunneling across the intrinsic
tunnel barriers (ITBs) results in metastable, temperature-independent,
high-resistance plateaus over a large range of temperatures. Upon application
of a magnetic field, our data reveal that the ITBs are extinguished resulting
in sharp, colossal, low-field resistance drops. Our results compare well to
theoretical predictions of magnetic domain walls coinciding with the intrinsic
insulating phase.
