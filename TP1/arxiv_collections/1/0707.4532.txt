We establish the superconductor-insulator phase diagram for quasi-one
dimensional wires by measuring a large set of MoGe nanowires. This diagram is
consistent with the Chakravarty-Schmid-Bulgadaev phase boundary, namely with
the critical resistance being equal to R_Q = h/4e^2. We find that transport
properties of insulating nanowires exhibit a weak Coulomb blockade behavior.
