We present a general framework to describe the simultaneous
para-to-ferromagnetic and semiconductor-to-metal transition in electron-doped
EuO. The theory correctly describes detailed experimental features of the
conductivity and of the magnetization, in particular the doping dependence of
the Curie temperature. The existence of correlation-induced local moments on
the impurity sites is essential for this description.
