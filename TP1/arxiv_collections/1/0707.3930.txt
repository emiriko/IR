We have performed quantum Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the
superfluid behavior of one- and two-dimensional interfaces separating
checkerboard solid domains. The system is described by the hard-core
Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian with nearest-neighbor interaction. In accordance with
Ref.1, we find that (i) the interface remains superfluid in a wide range of
interaction strength before it undergoes a superfluid-insulator transition;
(ii) in one dimension, the transition is of the Kosterlitz-Thouless type and is
accompanied by the roughening transition, driven by proliferation of charge 1/2
quasiparticles; (iii) in two dimensions, the transition belongs to the 3D U(1)
universality class and the interface remains smooth. Similar phenomena are
expected for domain walls in quantum antiferromagnets.
