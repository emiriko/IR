The Higgs particle is a new elementary particle predicted in the Standard
Model of the elementary particle physics. It plays a special role in the theory
of mass generation of quarks, leptons, and gauge bosons. In this article,
theoretical issues on the Higgs mechanism are first discussed, and then
experimental prospects on the Higgs particle study at the future collider
experiments, LHC and ILC, are reviewed. The Higgs coupling determination is an
essential step to establish the mass generation mechanism, which could lead to
a deeper understanding of particle physics.
