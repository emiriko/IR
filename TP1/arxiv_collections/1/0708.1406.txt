We have performed angle-dependent near-edge x-ray absorption fine structure
measurements in the Auger electron yield mode on the correlated
quasi-one-dimensional organic conductor TTF-TCNQ in order to determine the
orientation of the molecules in the topmost surface layer. We find that the
tilt angles of the molecules with respect to the one-dimensional axis are
essentially the same as in the bulk. Thus we can rule out surface relaxation as
the origin of the renormalized band widths which were inferred from the
analysis of photoemission data within the one-dimensional Hubbard model.
Thereby recent theoretical results are corroborated which invoke long-range
Coulomb repulsion as alternative explanation to understand the spectral
dispersions of TTF-TCNQ quantitatively within an extended Hubbard model.
