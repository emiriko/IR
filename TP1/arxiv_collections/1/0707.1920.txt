The effects of magnetic flux in statistical magnetisms, including Pauli
paramagnetism, Landau diamagnetism, and De Hass-van Alphen oscillation, are
discussed. It is shown that the diamagnetism could be much increased by the
fractional magnetic flux, and the amplitude of the magnetic oscillation of De
Hass-van Alphen can be amplified by the quantum effect of the flux.
