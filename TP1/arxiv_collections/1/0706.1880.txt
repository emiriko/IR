We present our predictions on multiplicities and $J/\psi$ suppression at LHC
energies. Our results take into account shadowing effects in the initial state
and final state interactions with the hot medium. We obtain 1800 charged
particles at LHC and the $J/\psi$ suppression increases by a factor 5 to 6
compared to RHIC.
