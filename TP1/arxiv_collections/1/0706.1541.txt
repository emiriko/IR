We analyze the noise induced synchronization between a collective variable
characterizing a complex system with a finite number of interacting bistable
units and time periodic driving forces. A random phase process associated to
the collective stochastic variable is defined. Its average phase frequency and
average phase diffusion are used to characterize the phenomenon. Our analysis
is based on numerical solutions of the corresponding set of Langevin equations.
