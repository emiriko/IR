We demonstrate that any SU(2) singlet wavefunction can be characterized by a
set of Valence Bond occupation numbers, testing dimer presence/vacancy on pairs
of sites. This genuine quantum property of singlet states (i) shows that SU(2)
singlets share some of the intuitive features of hardcore quantum dimers, (ii)
gives rigorous basis for interesting albeit apparently ill-defined quantities
introduced recently in the context of Quantum Magnetism or Quantum Information
to measure respectively spin correlations and bipartite entanglement and, (iii)
suggests a scheme to define consistently a wide family of quantities analogous
to high order spin correlation. This result is demonstrated in the framework of
a general functional mapping between the Hilbert space generated by an
arbitrary number of spins and a set of algebraic functions found to be an
efficient analytical tool for the description of quantum spins or qubits
systems.
