Evidence-based medicine is critically dependent on three sources of
information: a medical knowledge base, the patients medical record and
knowledge of available resources, including where appropriate, clinical
protocols. Patient data is often scattered in a variety of databases and may,
in a distributed model, be held across several disparate repositories.
Consequently addressing the needs of an evidence-based medicine community
presents issues of biomedical data integration, clinical interpretation and
knowledge management. This paper outlines how the Health-e-Child project has
approached the challenge of requirements specification for (bio-) medical data
integration, from the level of cellular data, through disease to that of
patient and population. The approach is illuminated through the requirements
elicitation and analysis of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), one of three
diseases being studied in the EC-funded Health-e-Child project.
