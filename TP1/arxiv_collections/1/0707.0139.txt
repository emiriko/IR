In order to adequately describe molecular rotation far from equilibrium, we
have generalized the J-diffusion model by allowing the rotational relaxation
rate to be angular momentum dependent. The calculated nonequilibrium rotational
correlation functions (CFs) are shown to decay much slower than their
equilibrium counterparts, and orientational CFs of hot molecules exhibit
coherent behavior, which persists for several rotational periods. As distinct
from the results of standard theories, rotational and orientational CFs are
found to dependent strongly on the nonequilibrium preparation of the molecular
ensemble. We predict the Arrhenius energy dependence of rotational relaxation
times and violation of the Hubbard relations for orientational relaxation
times. The standard and generalized J-diffusion models are shown to be almost
indistinguishable under equilibrium conditions. Far from equilibrium, their
predictions may differ dramatically.
