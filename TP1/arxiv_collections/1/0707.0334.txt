Using resonant interaction of three Rydberg atoms with a single-mode
microwave cavity, we consider a realization of three-qubit Grover search
algorithm in the presence of weak cavity decay, based on a previous idea for
three-qubit quantum gate [Phys. Rev. A 73, 064304 (2006)]. We simulate the
searching process under the influence of the cavity decay and show that our
scheme could be achieved efficiently to find the marked state with high
fidelity. The required operations are very close to the reach with current
cavity QED techniques.
