All thermodynamic quantities of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole can
be obtained from the dilaton and its potential of two dimensional (2D) dilaton
gravity. The dual relations of four thermodynamic laws are also established.
Furthermore, the near-horizon thermodynamics of the extremal RN black hole is
completely described by the Jackiw-Teitelboim theory which is obtained by
perturbing around the AdS$_2$-horizon.
