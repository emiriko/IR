Interaction is the mode of being of material things amid other material
things and the driving force of change and wholeness. Through mutual influence,
changes of interacting things become interdependent and their properties
interrelated, which leads to formation of ensembles - material wholes of
correlated things, where the mode of being of a particular component depends on
the modes of being of all other components and vice versa. Every ensemble
attains its wholeness and becomes a physical body through togetherness of
interrelated components coexisting as a collective being with mutually
restrained internal motion. Properties of ensembles on all structural levels of
matter composition emerge through the collective being of components.
