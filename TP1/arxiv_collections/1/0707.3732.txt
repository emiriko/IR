Ananda Mohan suggested that the first New Chinese Remainder Theorem
introduced by Wang can be derived from the constructive proof of the well-known
Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) and claimed that Wang's approach is the same as
the one proposed earlier by Huang. Ananda Mohan's proof is however erroneous
and we show here that Wang's New CRT I is a rewriting of an algorithm
previously sketched by Hitz and Kaltofen.
