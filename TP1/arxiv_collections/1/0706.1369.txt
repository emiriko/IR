The demand for high-speed digital communication such as data, video, and the
broadband Internet increases, the required throughput of the modules in
communications systems will also increase. In this paper we present an
instruction system, which works on the basis of a wavelength division multiplex
(WDM) system in the visible spectrum. It is specialised for the academic
training at universities to demonstrate the principles of the WDM techniques.
It works platform independent in combination with active modules in the
training description, short inline videos and interactive diagrams. The system
consists of LEDs in different wavelengths using analog and digital signals.
