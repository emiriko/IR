We have discovered a new family of three-dimensional crystal sphere packings
that are strictly jammed (i.e., mechanically stable) and yet possess an
anomalously low density. This family constitutes an uncountably infinite number
of crystal packings that are subpackings of the densest crystal packings and
are characterized by a high concentration of self-avoiding "tunnels" (chains of
vacancies) that permeate the structures. The fundamental geometric
characteristics of these tunneled crystals command interest in their own right
and are described here in some detail. These include the lattice vectors (that
specify the packing configurations), coordination structure, Voronoi cells, and
density fluctuations. The tunneled crystals are not only candidate structures
for achieving the jamming threshold (lowest-density rigid packing), but may
have substantially broader significance for condensed matter physics and
materials science.
