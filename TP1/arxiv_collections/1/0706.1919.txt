We propose a simple dynamic exchange-correlation kernel of the uniform
electron gas. We model the reduction of the electron-electron interaction due
to short-range exchange-correlation effects by introducing a
frequency-dependent error-function effective interaction. By imposing the
fulfillment of the compresibility and the third-frequency-moment sum rules, as
well as the correct asymptotic behavior at large wave vectors, we find an
accurate and simple dynamic exchange-correlation kernel that accurately
reproduces the wave-vector analysis and the imaginary-frequency analysis of the
correlation energy of the uniform electron gas.
