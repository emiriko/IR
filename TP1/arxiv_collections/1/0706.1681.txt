Electric polarization loops are measured at room temperature on highly pure
BiFeO3 single crystals synthesized by a flux growth method. Because the
crystals have a high electrical resistivity, the resulting low leakage currents
allow us to measure a large spontaneous polarization reaching 100
microC.cm^{-2}, a value never reported in the bulk. During electric cycling,
the slow degradation of the material leads to an evolution of the hysteresis
curves eventually preventing full saturation of the crystals.
