One of the main goals of the COMPASS experiment at CERN is the determination
of the gluon polarisation in the nucleon, Delta G/G. It is determined from spin
asymmetries in the scattering of 160 GeV/c polarised muons on a polarised LiD
target. The gluon polarisation is accessed by the selection of photon-gluon
fusion (PGF) events. A very clean selection of PGF events can be obtained with
charmed mesons in the final state. Their detection is based on the
reconstruction of D* and D0 mesons in the COMPASS spectrometer. The analysis
method for the first measurement of Delta G/G from the open charm channel is
described and the result from COMPASS for the 2002-2004 data taking period is
presented.
