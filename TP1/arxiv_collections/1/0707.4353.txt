With the empirical bond polarizability model, the nonresonant Raman spectra
of the chiral and achiral single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) under uniaxial
and torsional strains have been systematically studied by \textit{ab initio}
method. It is found that both the frequencies and the intensities of the
low-frequency Raman active modes almost do not change in the deformed
nanotubes, while their high-frequency part shifts obviously. Especially, the
high-frequency part shifts linearly with the uniaxial tensile strain, and two
kinds of different shift slopes are found for any kind of SWCNTs. More
interestingly, new Raman peaks are found in the nonresonant Raman spectra under
torsional strain, which are explained by a) the symmetry breaking and b) the
effect of bond rotation and the anisotropy of the polarizability induced by
bond stretching.
