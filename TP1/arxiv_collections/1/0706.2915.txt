Using molecular dynamics simulations and integral equations we investigate
the structure, the thermodynamics and the dynamics of a system of particles
interacting through a continuous core- softened ramp-like interparticle
potential. We found density, dynamic and structural anomalies similar to that
found in water. Analysis of the radial distribution function for several
temperatures at fixed densities show a pattern that may be related to the
origin of density anomaly.
