It was recently predicted [Phys. Rev. B 75, 193301 (2007)] that spin blockade
may develop at nonmagnetic semiconductor/perfect ferromagnet junctions when the
electron flow is directed from the semiconductor into the ferromagnet. Here we
consider current-voltage characteristics of such junctions. By taking into
account the contact resistance, we demonstrate a current stabilization effect:
by increasing the applied voltage the current density through the junction
saturates at a specific value. The transient behavior of the current density is
also investigated.
