Electromagnetic dipole-strength distributions up to the particle separation
energies are studied for the stable even-even nuclides $^{92,94,96,98,100}$Mo
in photon scattering experiments at the superconducting electron accelerator
ELBE of the Forschungszentrum Dresden-Rossendorf. The influence of inelastic
transitions to low-lying excited states has been corrected by a simulation of
$\gamma$ cascades using a statistical model. After corrections for branching
ratios of ground-state transitions, the photon-scattering cross-sections
smoothly connect to data obtained from $(\gamma,n)$-reactions. With the newly
determined electromagnetic dipole response of nuclei well below the particle
separation energies the parametrisation of the isovector giant-dipole resonance
is done with improved precision.
