Multi-photon absorption is a well-known phenomenon. With atom lasers a
similar process could take place for massive particles, the ionization of an
atom or molecule by the successive interaction with various particles. This
process would lead to multi-particle detection events for incident
multi-particle beams. We show that two-particle detections would introduce a
correction (proportional to the fourth power of the wavefunction modulus) to
the usual one-particle detection probability (only proportional to the second
power).
