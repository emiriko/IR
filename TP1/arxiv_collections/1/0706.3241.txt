We study phenomenological features in an extended gauge mediation SUSY
breaking model which has non-universal gaugino masses and CP phases. We show
that large CP phases in soft SUSY breaking parameters can be consistent with
the constraints coming from the electric dipole moment (EDM) of an electron, a
neutron, and also a mercury atom. Masses of the superpartners are not
necessarily required to be larger than 1 TeV but allowed to be O(100) GeV. We
also investigate the mass spectrum of Higgs scalars and their couplings to
gauge bosons in that case. Compatibility of this model with the present
experimental data on the Higgs sector is discussed.
