The friction coefficient of a particle can depend on its position as it does
when the particle is near a wall. We formulate the dynamics of particles with
such state-dependent friction coefficients in terms of a general Langevin
equation with multiplicative noise, whose evaluation requires the introduction
of specific rules. Two common conventions, the Ito and the Stratonovich,
provide alternative rules for evaluation of the noise, but other conventions
are possible. We show the requirement that a particle's distribution function
approach the Boltzmann distribution at long times dictates that a drift term
must be added to the Langevin equation. This drift term is proportional to the
derivative of the diffusion coefficient times a factor that depends on the
convention used to define the multiplicative noise. We explore the consequences
of this result in a number examples with spatially varying diffusion
coefficients. We also derive path integral representations for arbitrary
interpretation of the noise, and use it in a perturbative study of correlations
in a simple system.
