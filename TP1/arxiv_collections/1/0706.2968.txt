Transport in undoped graphene is related to percolating current patterns in
the networks of {\em N-} and {\em P}-type regions reflecting the strong bipolar
charge density fluctuations. Transmissions of the {\em P-N} junctions, though
small, are vital in establishing the macroscopic conductivity. We propose a
random resistor network model to analyze scaling dependencies of the
conductance on the doping and disorder, the quantum magnetoresistance and the
corresponding dephasing rate.
