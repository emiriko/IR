A high-statistics measurement of bremsstrahlung emitted in the alpha decay of
210Po has been performed, which allows to follow the photon spectra up to
energies of ~ 500 keV. The measured differential emission probability is in
good agreement with our theoretical results obtained within the quasi classical
approximation as well as with the exact quantum mechanical calculation. It is
shown that due to the small effective electric dipole charge of the radiating
system a significant interference between the electric dipole and quadrupole
contributions occurs, which is altering substantially the angular correlation
between the alpha particle and the emitted photon.
