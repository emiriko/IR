This paper, which commented on Newman and Leicht's "Mixture models and
exploratory analysis in networks" (2007, PNAS 104, 9564-9569), has been
withdrawn. The reason for this removal is that we misinterpreted the conceptual
framework that the authors of the original paper use. Specifically, it is
assumed in our paper that the variable theta_ri denotes the *a priori*
probability that there exists an edge from group r to vertex i. The correct
interpretation is that theta_ri denotes the probability that a given edge from
group r connects to vertex i.
  We are very grateful to Mark Newman and Elizabeth Leicht not only for
pointing out our misinterpretation, but also for doing it so politely and
gracefully.
