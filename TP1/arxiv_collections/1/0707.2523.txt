The photoproduction of quarkonium in coherent hadron-hadron (pp/pA/AA$)
interactions for LHC energies is an important tool to investigate the QCD
dynamics at high energies. In this paper we estimate the integrated cross
section and rapidity distribution for J/Psi and Upsilon production using the
Color Glass Condensate (CGC) formalism. We predict large rates, implying that
the experimental identification could be feasible at the LHC.
