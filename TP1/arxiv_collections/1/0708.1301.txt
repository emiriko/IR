One loop mediated charged Higgs bosons decays $H^\pm\to W^\pm V$, $V= Z,
\gamma$ are studied in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with
and without CP violating phases. We evaluate the MSSM contributions to these
processes taking into account $B\to X_s\gamma$ constraint as well as
experimental constraints on the MSSM parameters. In the MSSM, we found that in
the intermediate range of $\tan\beta \la 10$ and for large
  A_t and large $\mu$, where the lightest top squark becomes very light and
hence non-decoupled, the branching ratio of $H^\pm \to W^{\pm} Z$ can be of the
order 10^{-3} while the branching ratio of $H^\pm \to W^{\pm} \gamma$ is of the
order 10^{-5}. We found also that the CP violating phases of soft SUSY
parameters can modify the branching ratio by about one order of magnitude. We
also show that MSSM with CP violating phases lead to CP-violating asymmetry in
the decays $H^+ \to W^+V$ and $H^- \to W^-V$. Such CP asymmetry can be rather
large and can reach 80% in some region of parameter space.
