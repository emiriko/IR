We describe a natural inhomogeneous generalization of high frequency plane
gravitational waves. The waves are high frequency waves of the Kundt type whose
null propagation direction in space-time has vanishing expansion, twist and
shear but is not covariantly constant. The introduction of a cosmological
constant is discussed in some detail and a comparison is made with high
frequency gravity waves having wave fronts homeomorphic to 2-spheres.
