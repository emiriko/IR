We report results for the ground state energies and wave functions obtained
by projecting spatially unrestricted Hartree Fock states to eigenstates of the
total spin and the angular momentum for harmonic quantum dots with $N\leq 12$
interacting electrons including a magnetic field states with the correct
spatial and spin symmetries have lower energies than those obtained by the
unrestricted method. The chemical potential as a function of a perpendicular
magnetic field is obtained. Signature of an intrinsic spin blockade effect is
found.
