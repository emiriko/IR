We analyze quantum two prover one round interactive proof systems, in which
noninteracting provers can share unlimited entanglement. The maximum acceptance
probability is characterized as a superoperator norm. We get some partial
results about the superoperator norm, and in particular we analyze the "rank
one" case.
