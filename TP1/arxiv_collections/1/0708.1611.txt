We construct a DGP inspired braneworld scenario where a scalar field
non-minimally coupled to the induced Ricci curvature is present on the brane.
First we investigate the status of gravitational potential with non-minimal
coupling and observational constraints on this non-minimal model. Then we
further deepen the idea of embedding of FRW cosmology in this non-minimal
setup. Cosmological implications of this scenario are examined with details and
the quintessence and late-time expansion of the universe within this framework
are examined. Some observational constraints imposed on this non-minimal
scenario are studied and relation of this model with dark radiation formalism
is determined with details.
