This contribution analyses the classical laws of motion by means of an
approach relating time and entropy. We argue that adopting the notion of change
of states as opposed to the usual derivation of Newton's laws in terms of
fields a broader picture is obtained, suggesting that diverse branches of
physics- classical, quantum, relativistic and statistical mechanics - turn out
to be related by a common foundation.
