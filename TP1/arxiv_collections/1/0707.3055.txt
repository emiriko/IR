We present four-loop results for the gauge beta-function and the fermion mass
anomalous dimension for a gauge theory with a general gauge group and a
multiplet of fermions transforming according to an arbitrary representation,
calculated using the dimensional reduction scheme. In the special case of a
supersymmetric theory we confirm previous calculations of both the gauge
beta-function and the gaugino mass beta-function.
