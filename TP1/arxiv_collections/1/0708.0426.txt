We perform extensive Monte Carlo simulations of a lattice model and the Go
potential to investigate the existence of folding pathways at the level of
contact cluster formation for two native structures with markedly different
geometries. Our analysis of folding pathways revealed a common underlying
folding mechanism, based on nucleation phenomena, for both protein models.
However, folding to the more complex geometry (i.e. that with more non-local
contacts) is driven by a folding nucleus whose geometric traits more closely
resemble those of the native fold. For this geometry folding is clearly a more
cooperative process.
