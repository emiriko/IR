Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy we examined the local density of states
of thin c-axis La2-xSrxCuO4 films, over wide doping and temperature ranges. We
found that the pseudogap exists only at doping levels lower than optimal. For x
= 0.12, close to the 'anomalous' x = 1/8 doping level, a zero bias conductance
peak was the dominant spectral feature, instead of the excepted V- shaped
(c-axis tunneling) gap structure. We have established that this surprising
effect cannot be explained by tunneling into (110) facets. Possible origins for
this unique behavior are discussed.
