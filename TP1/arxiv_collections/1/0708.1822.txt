Gold nanospheres, single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT), and diamonoids were
phyically incorporated into the negative photoresist SU-8. the mixtures were
spin cast onto silicon or aluminium coated silicon wafers. ASTM standard D638
tensile specimens were lithographically patterned in the materials and then
released from the substrate using Microchem'Omnicoat or an anodic metal
dissolution process. the residual stresses, elastic moduli, and viscosity of
the SU-8. Resistivity measurements of SU-8/SWNT nanocomposites were also
investigates. We found the effective modulus and viscosity of the SU-8 test
specimens decreases with the addition of diamantane and SWNTs. Additionally,
the SU-8/SWNT nanocomposites showed changes in resistivity with increased
strain, suggesting a gauge factor for the 1 wt% SU-8/SWNT nanocomposite of
approximately 2-4.
