In the eighties Goldman discovered a Lie algebra structure on the vector
space generated by the free homotopy classes of oriented curves on an oriented
surface. The Lie bracket [a,b] is defined as the signed sum over the
intersection points of a and b of the loop product of at the intersection
points.
  If one of the classes has a simple representative we give a combinatorial
group theory description of the terms of the Lie bracket and prove that this
bracket has as many terms, counted with multiplicity, as the minimal number of
intersection points of a and b. In other words the bracket with a simple
element has no cancellation and determines minimal intersection numbers. We
show that analogous results hold for the Lie bracket (also discovered by
Goldman) of unoriented curves. We give three applications: a factorization of
Thurston's map defining the boundary of Teichmuller space, various
decompositions of the underlying vector space of conjugacy classes into ad
invariant subspaces and a connection between bijections of the set of conjugacy
classes of curves on a surface preserving the Goldman bracket and the mapping
class group.
