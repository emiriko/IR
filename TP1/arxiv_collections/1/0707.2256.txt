In this paper we will show that using the cosmological constant as a new
thermodynamical state variable, the differential and integral mass formulas of
the first law of thermodynamics for asymptotic flat spacetimes can be extended
to (2+1) dimensional charged BTZ black holes and charged de Sitter space.
