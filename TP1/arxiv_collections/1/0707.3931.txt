Magnesium diboride has been thermally treated in the presence of Rb, Cs, and
Ba. Magnetic susceptibility shows onsets of superconductivity in the resulting
samples at 52K (Rb), 58K (Cs) and 45K (Ba). Room-temperature 11B NMR indicates
to cubic symmetry of the electric field gradient at boron site for the samples
reacted with Rb and Cs, in contrast to the axial symmetry in the initial MgB2
and in the sample treated with Ba.
