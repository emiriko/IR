In the present paper we describe the properties induced by disorder on an
ultracold gas of Bosonic atoms loaded into a two-dimensional optical lattice
with global confinement ensured by a parabolic potential. Our analysis is
centered on the spatial distribution of the various phases, focusing
particularly on the superfluid properties of the system as a function of
external parameters and disorder amplitude. In particular, it is shown how
disorder can suppress superfluidity, while partially preserving the system
coherence.
