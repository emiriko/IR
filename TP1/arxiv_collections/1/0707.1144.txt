We consider the question of which right-angled Artin groups contain closed
hyperbolic surface subgroups. It is known that a right-angled Artin group
$A(K)$ has such a subgroup if its defining graph $K$ contains an $n$-hole (i.e.
an induced cycle of length $n$) with $n\geq 5$. We construct another eight
"forbidden" graphs and show that every graph $K$ on $\le 8$ vertices either
contains one of our examples, or contains a hole of length $\ge 5$, or has the
property that $A(K)$ does not contain hyperbolic closed surface subgroups. We
also provide several sufficient conditions for a \RAAG to contain no hyperbolic
surface subgroups.
  We prove that for one of these "forbidden" subgraphs $P_2(6)$, the right
angled Artin group $A(P_2(6))$ is a subgroup of a (right angled Artin) diagram
group. Thus we show that a diagram group can contain a non-free hyperbolic
subgroup answering a question of Guba and Sapir. We also show that fundamental
groups of non-orientable surfaces can be subgroups of diagram groups. Thus the
first integral homology of a subgroup of a diagram group can have torsion (all
homology groups of all diagram groups are free Abelian by a result of Guba and
Sapir).
