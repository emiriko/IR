Because of properties of QED, the bremsstrahlung corrections to decays of
particles or resonances can be calculated, with a good precision, separately
from other effects. Thanks to the widespread use of event records such
calculations can be embodied into a separate module of Monte Carlo simulation
chains, as used in High Energy Experiments of today. The PHOTOS Monte Carlo
program is used for this purpose since nearly 20 years now. In the following
talk let us review the main ideas and constraints which shaped the program
version of today and enabled it widespread use. We will concentrate specially
on conflicting requirements originating from the properties of QED matrix
elements on one side and degrading (evolving) with time standards of event
record(s). These issues, quite common in other modular software applications,
become more and more difficult to handle as precision requirements become
higher.
