We have investigated the effects of unparticles in decays $B \to l \nu$. It
is found that the direct CP violation in the decays, which is zero in SM, can
show up due to the CP conserving phase intrinsic in unparticle physics. For
$l=\tau$, the direct CP asymmetry can reach 30% for the scalar unparticle
contribution, and 100% for the longitudinal vector unparticle contribution
under the constraints of ${\rm Br}(B\to\tau\nu)$ and $\nu e$ elastic
scattering. If both unparticle-lepton coupling universality and
unparticle-quark coupling universality are assumed the constraint from
$Br(\pi\to \mu\nu)$ leads that the direct CP violation in $B\to l\nu$ can only
reach at most 8% and 1% for scalar and vector unparticle contributions
respectively if $d_{\cal U} < 2$. If the direct CP violation is observed in the
future it would give strong evidence for the existence of unparticle stuff.
