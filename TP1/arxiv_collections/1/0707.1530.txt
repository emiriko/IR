We predict that neutral graphene bilayers are pseudospin magnets in which the
charge density-contribution from each valley and spin spontaneously shifts to
one of the two layers. The band structure of this system is characterized by a
momentum-space vortex which is responsible for unusual competition between band
and kinetic energies leading to symmetry breaking in the vortex core. We
discuss the possibility of realizing a pseudospin version of ferromagnetic
metal spintronics in graphene bilayers based on hysteresis associated with this
broken symmetry.
