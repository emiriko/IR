When an electric field is applied to an electrolyte-saturated polymer gel
embedded with charged colloidal particles, the force that must be exerted by
the hydrogel on each particle reflects a delicate balance of electrical,
hydrodynamic and elastic stresses. This paper examines the displacement of a
single charged spherical inclusion embedded in an uncharged hydrogel. We
present numerically exact solutions of coupled electrokinetic transport and
elastic-deformation equations, where the gel is treated as an incompressible,
elastic Brinkman medium. This model problem demonstrates how the displacement
depends on the particle size and charge, the electrolyte ionic strength, and
Young's modulus of the polymer skeleton. The numerics are verified, in part,
with an analytical (boundary-layer) theory valid when the Debye length is much
smaller than the particle radius. Further, we identify a close connection
between the displacement when a colloid is immobilized in a gel and its
velocity when dispersed in a Newtonian electrolyte. Finally, we describe an
experiment where nanometer-scale displacements might be accurately measured
using back-focal-plane interferometry. The purpose of such an experiment is to
probe physicochemical and rheological characteristics of hydrogel composites,
possibly during gelation.
