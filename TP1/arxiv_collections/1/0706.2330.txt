We report four $\Sigma$'s and three $\Lambda$'s, in the 1500 - 1800 MeV
region, as two meson - one baryon S-wave $(1/2)^+$ resonances. We solve Faddeev
equations in the coupled channel approach. The invariant mass of one of the
meson-baryon pairs and that of the three particles have been varied and peaks
in the squared three body $T$-matrix have been found very close to the existing
$S$ = -1, $J^P= 1/2^+$ low lying baryon resonances. The input two-body
$t$-matrices for meson-meson and meson-baryon interaction have been calculated
by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation with the potentials obtained in the
chiral unitary approach.
