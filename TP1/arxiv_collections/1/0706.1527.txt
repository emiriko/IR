We predict that the interface of materials with defocusing thermal
nonlinearities support stable fundamental and higher-order surface waves when
the opposite edges of the medium are maintained at different temperatures. Such
surface waves exist due to the interplay between repulsion from the interface
and the defocusing thermal nonlinearity that deflect light beams from the bulk
of the medium toward its edges.
