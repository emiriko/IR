We show that a fairly arbitrary Frechet space topology on the space of
holomorphic functions on a domain controls the topology of uniform convergence
on compact sets.
  In fact it turns out that the result we present can be proved more simply
using the closed graph theorem. However, we believe that the techniques
presented here may be used to prove a more interesting result. Details to
appear later.
