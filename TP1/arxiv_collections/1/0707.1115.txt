MiniBooNE (Mini Booster Neutrino Experiment) searches for the
$\nu_\mu\to\nu_e$ oscillations with $\Delta m^2 \sim 1 \eV^2/c^4$ indicated by
the LSND experiment. The LSND evidence, when taken with the solar and
atmospheric neutrino oscillations, suggests new physics beyond the Standard
Model. However, this evidence has not been confirmed by other experiments.
MiniBooNE has completed its first $\nu_\mu\to\nu_e$ oscillation search using a
sample of $\sim 1$ GeV neutrino events obtained with $5.58\times 10^{20}$
protons delivered to the Booster Neutrino Beamline. The analysis finds no
significant excess of $\nu_e$ events in the analysis region of 475-3000 MeV.
