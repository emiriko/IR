Electroweak one-loop calculations for production of top-quark pairs at
colliders are completed by providing the missing QED type contributions from
real and virtual photons, where also effects from interference between QED and
QCD contributions have to be taken into account. Moreover, photon-induced $t
\bar{t}$ production is included as another partonic channel.
