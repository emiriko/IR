This work covers methodology of solving QCD evolution equation of the parton
distribution using Markovian Monte Carlo (MMC) algorithms in a class of models
ranging from DGLAP to CCFM. One of the purposes of the above MMCs is to test
the other more sophisticated Monte Carlo programs, the so-called Constrained
Monte Carlo (CMC) programs, which will be used as a building block in the
parton shower MC. This is why the mapping of the evolution variables (eikonal
variable and evolution time) into four-momenta is also defined and tested. The
evolution time is identified with the rapidity variable of the emitted parton.
The presented MMCs are tested independently, with ~0.1% precision, against the
non-MC program APCheb especially devised for this purpose.
