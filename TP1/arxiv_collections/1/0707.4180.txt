Optical pump-probe measurements of spin-dynamics at temperatures down to 1.5K
are described for a series of (001)-oriented GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well samples
containing high mobility two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs). For well
widths ranging from 5 nm to 20 nm and 2DEG sheet densities from 1.75x1011cm-2
to 3.5x1011cm-2 the evolution of a small injected spin population is found to
be a damped oscillation rather than exponential relaxation, consistent with the
quasi-collision-free regime of D'yakonov-Perel spin dynamics. A Monte Carlo
simulation method is used to extract the spin-orbit-induced electron spin
precession frequency |W(kF)| and electron momentum scattering time tp* at the
Fermi wavevector. The spin decay time passes through a minimum at a temperature
corresponding to the transition from collision-free to collision-dominated
regimes and tp* is found to be close to the ensemble momentum scattering time
tp obtained from Hall measurements of electron mobility. The values of |W(kF)|
give the Dresselhaus (BIA) coefficient of spin-orbit interaction as a function
of electron confinement energy in the quantum show, qualitatively, the
behaviour expected from k.p theory.
