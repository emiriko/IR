We analyze the semiclassical evolution of Gaussian wavepackets in chaotic
systems. We prove that after some short time a Gaussian wavepacket becomes a
primitive WKB state. From then on, the state can be propagated using the
standard TDWKB scheme. Complex trajectories are not necessary to account for
the long-time propagation. The Wigner function of the evolving state develops
the structure of a classical filament plus quantum oscillations, with phase and
amplitude being determined by geometric properties of a classical manifold.
