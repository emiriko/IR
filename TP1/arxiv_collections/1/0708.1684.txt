Within the s-d model description, we derive the current-driven spin torque in
a ferromagnet, taking explicitly into account a spin-relaxing Caldeira-Leggett
bath coupling to the s-electrons. We derive Bloch-Redfield equations of motion
for the s-electron spin dynamics, and formulate a systematic gradient expansion
to obtain non-adiabatic (higher-order) corrections to the well-known adiabatic
(first-order) spin torque. We provide simple analytical expressions for the
second-order spin torque. The theory is applied to current-driven domain wall
motion. Second-order contributions imply a deformation of a transverse
tail-to-tail domain wall. The wall center still moves with a constant velocity
that now depends on the spin-polarized current in a non-trivial manner.
