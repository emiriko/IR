We compute the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to the
thrust distribution in electron-positron annihilation. The corrections turn out
to be sizable, enhancing the previously known next-to-leading order prediction
by about 15%. Inclusion of the NNLO corrections significantly reduces the
theoretical renormalisation scale uncertainty on the prediction of the thrust
distribution.
