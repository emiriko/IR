In our previous article [4] an approach to derive Papapetrou equations for
constrained electromagnetic field was demonstrated by use of field variational
principles. The aim of current work is to present more universal technique of
deduction of the equations which could be applied to another types of
non-scalar fields. It is based on Noether theorem formulated in terms of
Cartan' formalism of orthonormal frames. Under infinitesimal coordinate
transformation the one leads to equation which includes volume force of
spin-gravitational interaction. Papapetrou equation for vector of propagation
of the wave is derived on base of the equation. Such manner of deduction allows
to formulate more accurately the constraints and clarify equations for the
potential and for spin.
