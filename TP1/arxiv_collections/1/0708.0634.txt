Drinfel'd used associators to construct families of universal representations
of braid groups. We consider semi-associators (i.e., we drop the pentagonal
axiom and impose a normalization in degree one). We show that the process may
be reversed, to obtain semi-associators from universal representations of
3-braids. We view braid groups as subgroups of braid-permutation groups. We
construct a family of universal representations of braid-permutation groups,
without using associators. All representations in the family are faithful,
defined over $\bbQ$ by simple explicit formulae. We show that they give
universal Vassiliev-type invariants for braid-permutation groups.
