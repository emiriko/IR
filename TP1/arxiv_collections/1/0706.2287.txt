In a recent paper [A. Ahanj et al., quant-ph/0603053], we gave a classical
protocol to simulate quantum correlations corresponding to the spin $s$ singlet
state for the infinite sequence of spins satisfying $2s+1 = 2^{n}$. In the
present paper, we have generalized this result by giving a classical protocol
to exactly simulate quantum correlations implied by the spin-$s$ singlet state
corresponding to all integer as well as half-integer spin values $s$. The class
of measurements we consider here are only those corresponding to spin
observables, as has been done in the above-mentioned paper. The required amount
of communication is found to be $\lceil {\rm log}_{2} (s + 1) \rceil$ in the
worst case scenario, where $\lceil x \rceil$ is the least integer greater than
or equal to $x$.
