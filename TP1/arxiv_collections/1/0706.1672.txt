We investigate the effects of a time-correlated noise on an extended chaotic
system. The chosen model is the Lorenz'96, a kind of "toy" model used for
climate studies. Through the analysis of the system's time evolution and its
time and space correlations, we have obtained numerical evidence for two
stochastic resonance-like behavior. Such behavior is seen when both, the usual
and a generalized signal-to-noise ratio function are depicted as a function of
the external noise intensity or the system size. The underlying mechanism seems
to be associated to a "noise-induced chaos reduction". The possible relevance
of these and other findings for an "optimal" climate prediction are discussed.
