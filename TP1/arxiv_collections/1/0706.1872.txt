The quantum measurement axiom dictates that physical observables and in
particular the Hamiltonian must be diagonalizable and have a real spectrum. For
a time-independent Hamiltonian (with a discrete spectrum) these conditions
ensure the existence of a positive-definite inner product that renders the
Hamiltonian self-adjoint. Unlike for a time-independent Hamiltonian, this does
not imply the unitarity of the Schroedinger time-evolution for a general
time-dependent Hamiltonian. We give an additional necessary and sufficient
condition for the unitarity of time-evolution. In particular, we obtain the
general form of a two-level Hamiltonian that fulfils this condition. We show
that this condition is geometrical in nature and that it implies the reality of
the adiabatic geometric phases. We also address the problem of the uniqueness
of the metric operator.
