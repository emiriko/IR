We compute the one loop anomalous dimension of the gauge invariant dimension
two operator min_U (A^U_mu)^2, where U is an element of the gauge group, by
exploiting Zwanziger's expansion of the operator in terms of gauge invariant
non-local n leg operators. The computation is performed in an arbitrary linear
covariant gauge and the cancellation of the gauge parameter in the final
anomalous dimension is demonstrated explicitly. The result is equivalent to the
one loop anomalous dimension of the local dimension two operator (A^a_mu)^2 in
the Landau gauge.
