The time reversal Aharonov-Casher (AC) interference effect in the mesoscopic
ring structures, based on the experiment in Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{97},
196803 (2006), is studied theoretically. The transmission curves are calculated
from the scattering matrix formalism, and the time reversal AC interference
frequency is singled out from the Fourier spectra in numerical simulations.
This frequency is in good agreement with analytical result. It is also shown
that in the absent of magnetic field, the Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak type (time
reversal) AC interference retains under the influence of strong disorder, while
the Aharonov-Bohm type AC interference is suppressed.
