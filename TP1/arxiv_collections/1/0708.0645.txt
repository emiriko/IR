We investigate the physical interpretation of the Riemann zeta function as a
FZZT brane partition function associated with a matrix/gravity correspondence.
The Hilbert-Polya operator in this interpretation is the master matrix of the
large N matrix model. Using a related function $\Xi(z)$ we develop an analogy
between this function and the Airy function Ai(z) of the Gaussian matrix model.
The analogy gives an intuitive physical reason why the zeros lie on a critical
line. Using a Fourier transform of the $\Xi(z)$ function we identify a
Kontsevich integrand. Generalizing this integrand to $n \times n$ matrices we
develop a Kontsevich matrix model which describes n FZZT branes. The Kontsevich
model associated with the $\Xi(z)$ function is given by a superposition of
Liouville type matrix models that have been used to describe matrix model
instantons.
