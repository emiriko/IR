Theory of self induced resonances in asymmetric two-junction interferometer
device is presented. In real devices it is impossible to have an ideal
interferometer free of imperfections. Thus, we extended previous theoretical
approaches introducing a model which contains several asymmetries: Josephson
current $\epsilon$, capacitances $\chi$ and dissipation $\rho$ presented in an
equivalent circuit. Moreover, non conventional symmetry of the order parameter
in high temperature superconducting quantum interference devices forced us to
include phase asymmetries. Therefore, the model has been extended to the case
of $\pi$-shift interferometers, where a phase shift is present in one of the
junctions.
