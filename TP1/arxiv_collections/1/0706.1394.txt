We present recent measurements of the CKM angles alpha and gamma using data
collected by the BaBar detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy e+ e- collider
at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. In addition to constraints on alpha
from the decays B0 -> pi+ pi-, B0 -> rho+ pi- and B0 -> rho+ rho-, we also
report the first measurement of time-dependent CP asymmetries in the decay B0
-> a1+(1260) pi-. We present measurements of gamma in B+ -> D(*)0 K+ decays
using a Dalitz analysis in the modes D^0 -> Ks pi+ pi- and D^0 -> pi+ pi- pi0.
