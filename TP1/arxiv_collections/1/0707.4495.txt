A system of coupled chaotic bistable maps on a lattice with randomly
distributed impurities is investigated as a model for studying the phenomenon
of phase growth in nonuniform media. The statistical properties of the system
are characterized by means of the average size of spatial domains of equivalent
spin variables that define the phases. It is found that the rate at which phase
domains grow becomes smaller when impurities are present and that the average
size of the resulting domains in the inhomogeneous state of the system
decreases when the density of impurities is increased. The phase diagram
showing regions where homogeneous, heterogeneous, and chessboard patterns occur
on the space of parameters of the system is obtained. A critical boundary that
separates the regime of slow growth of domains from the regime of fast growth
in the heterogeneous region of the phase diagram is calculated. The transition
between these two growth regimes is explained in terms of the stability
properties of the local phase configurations. Our results show that the
inclusion of spatial inhomogeneities can be used as a control mechanism for the
size and growth velocity of phase domains forming in spatiotemporal systems.
