We investigate the influence of polymer-pore interactions on the
translocation dynamics using Langevin dynamics simulations. An attractive
interaction can greatly improve translocation probability. At the same time, it
also increases translocation time slowly for weak attraction while exponential
dependence is observed for strong attraction. For fixed driving force and chain
length the histogram of translocation time has a transition from Gaussian
distribution to long-tailed distribution with increasing attraction. Under a
weak driving force and a strong attractive force, both the translocation time
and the residence time in the pore show a non-monotonic behavior as a function
of the chain length. Our simulations results are in good agreement with recent
experimental data.
