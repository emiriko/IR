We study soliton pulse compression in materials with cascaded quadratic
nonlinearities, and show that the group-velocity mismatch creates two different
temporally nonlocal regimes. They correspond to what is known as the stationary
and nonstationary regimes. The theory accurately predicts the transition to the
stationary regime, where highly efficient pulse compression is possible.
