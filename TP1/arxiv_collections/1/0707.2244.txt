We propose a technique for achieving large improvements in carrier mobilities
in 2- and 1-dimensional semiconductor nanostructures by modifying their
dielectric environments. We show that by coating the nanostructures with
high-$\kappa$ dielectrics, scattering from Coulombic impurities can be strongly
damped. Though screening is also weakened, the damping of Coulombic scattering
is much larger, and the resulting improvement in mobilities of carriers can be
as much as an order of magnitude for thin 2D semiconductor membranes, and more
for semiconductor nanowires.
