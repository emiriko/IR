We discuss the application of a recently introduced numerical linked-cluster
(NLC) algorithm to strongly correlated itinerant models. In particular, we
present a study of thermodynamic observables: chemical potential, entropy,
specific heat, and uniform susceptibility for the t-J model on the square
lattice, with J/t=0.5 and 0.3. Our NLC results are compared with those obtained
from high-temperature expansions (HTE) and the finite-temperature Lanczos
method (FTLM). We show that there is a sizeable window in temperature where NLC
results converge without extrapolations whereas HTE diverges. Upon
extrapolations, the overall agreement between NLC, HTE, and FTLM is excellent
in some cases down to 0.25t. At intermediate temperatures NLC results are
better controlled than other methods, making it easier to judge the convergence
and numerical accuracy of the method.
