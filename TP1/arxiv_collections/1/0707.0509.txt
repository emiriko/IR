We investigate the functional form of the order-parameter (two-point)
correlation function in quantum critical phenomena. Contrary to the common
lore, when there is no particle-hole symmetry we find that the equal-time
correlation function at criticality does not display a diverging correlation
length. We illustrate our conclusions by Monte Carlo calculations of the
quantum rotor model in $d=2$ space dimensions
