Palatini variation of Jordan frame lagrangians gives an equation relating the
dilaton to the object of non-metricity and hence the existence of the dilaton
implies that the spacetime connection is more general than that given soley by
the Christoffel symbol of general relativity. Transferring from Jordan to
Einstein frame, which connection, lagrangian, field equations and stress
conservation equations occur are discussed: it is found that the Jordan frame
has more information, this can be expressed in several ways, the simplest is
that the extra information corresponds to the function multiplying the Ricci
scalar in the action. The Einstein frame has the advantages that stress
conservation implies no currents and that the field equations are easier to
work with. This is illustrated by application to Robertson-Walker spacetime.
