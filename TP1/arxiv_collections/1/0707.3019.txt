The binding constant of copper(II) ions to C-PC were determined at different
ionic strengths from binding isotherms by equilibrium dialysis and flame atomic
absorption spectroscopy. Fluorescence and absorbtion spectroscopy provides
insight of metal-C-phycocyanin interactions. Fluorescence measurements
demonstrate C-PC quenching of heavy metal ions emission intensities.
Stern-Volmer quenching constants were obtained from the linear quenching plots.
Blue shifts in the fluorescence spectra were observed during metal binding to
C-PC. It was shown, that between bound metal ions in C-PC there exists positive
cooperativity.
