By a proper choice of the excitation energy per nucleon we analyze the mass
distributions of the nuclear fragmentation at various excitation energies.
Starting from low energies (between 0.1 and 1 MeV/nucleon) up to higher
energies about 12 MeV/n, we classified the mass yield characteristics for heavy
nuclei (A>200) on the basis of Statistical Multifragmentation Model. The
evaluation of fragment distribution with the excitation energy show that the
present results exhibit the same trend as the experimental ones.
