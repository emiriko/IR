A quantum equation-of-state model is presented and applied to the calculation
of high-pressure shock Hugoniot curves beyond the asymptotic fourfold density,
close to the maximum compression where quantum effects play a role. An
analytical estimate for the maximum attainable compression is proposed. It
gives a good agreement with the equation-of-state model.
