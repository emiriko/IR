Incorporation of the finite size of baryons into the equation of state (EOS)
of a hot and dense hadron gas (HG) in a thermodynamically consistent manner has
been a much studied problem. We first review its current status. Various models
have been proposed in order to account for the repulsive force generated by the
hard-core geometrical size of the baryons resulting in an excluded volume
effect in the EOS. We examine the criterion of the thermodynamical consistency
of these models and summarize their shortcomings. In order to remove the
shortcomings, we propose a new model which incorporates the excluded volume
effect in a thermodynamically consistent manner. We find that the new model
works even for the cases of extremely large temperatures and densities where
most of other approaches fail. Furthermore, the new expressions for
thermodynamical variables resemble in form with those obtained from
thermodynamically inconsistent models and thus a useful correction factor has
been suggested here which converts inconsistent expressions into
thermodynamically consistent ones. Finally we compare the predictions of new
model with those obtained from various old models.
