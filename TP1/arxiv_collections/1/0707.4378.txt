The physics of Anderson transitions between localized and metallic phases in
disordered systems is reviewed. The term ``Anderson transition'' is understood
in a broad sense, including both metal-insulator transitions and
quantum-Hall-type transitions between phases with localized states. The
emphasis is put on recent developments, which include: multifractality of
critical wave functions, criticality in the power-law random banded matrix
model, symmetry classification of disordered electronic systems, mechanisms of
criticality in quasi-one-dimensional and two-dimensional systems and survey of
corresponding critical theories, network models, and random Dirac Hamiltonians.
Analytical approaches are complemented by advanced numerical simulations.
