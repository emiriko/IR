We study a quantum phase transition between a phase which is topologically
ordered and one which is not. We focus on a spin model, an extension of the
toric code, for which we obtain the exact ground state for all values of the
coupling constant that takes the system across the phase transition. We compute
the entanglement and the topological entropy of the system as a function of
this coupling constant, and show that the topological entropy remains constant
all the way up to the critical point, and jumps to zero beyond it. Despite the
jump in the topological entropy, the transition is second order as detected via
any local observable.
