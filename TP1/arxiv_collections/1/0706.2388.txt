We present measurements of the double longitudinal spin asymmetries for
inclusive pi0 and pi+(-) production in polarized p+p collisions at sqrt(s) =
200 GeV at mid-rapidity with the STAR detector from the 2005 RHIC run. These
measurements are used to access Delta G/G, the gluon polarization in the
proton. The observed unpolarized inclusive cross sections show good agreement
with NLO pQCD calculations. The double longitudinal spin asymmetries are
compared to NLO pQCD calculations based on different assumptions for the gluon
polarization in the nucleon to provide constraints on Delta G/G. At the present
level of statistics the measured asymmetries disfavor a large positive gluon
polarization, but cannot yet distinguish between other scenarios.
