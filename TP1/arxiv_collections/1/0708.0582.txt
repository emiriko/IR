We investigate kinetically constrained models of glassy transitions, and
determine which model characteristics are crucial in allowing a rigorous proof
that such models have discontinuous transitions with faster than power law
diverging length and time scales. The models we investigate have constraints
similar to that of the knights model, introduced by Toninelli, Biroli, and
Fisher (TBF), but differing neighbor relations. We find that such knights-like
models, otherwise known as models of jamming percolation, need a ``No Parallel
Crossing'' rule for the TBF proof of a glassy transition to be valid.
Furthermore, most knight-like models fail a ``No Perpendicular Crossing''
requirement, and thus need modification to be made rigorous. We also show how
the ``No Parallel Crossing'' requirement can be used to evaluate the provable
glassiness of other correlated percolation models, by looking at models with
more stable directions than the knights model. Finally, we show that the TBF
proof does not generalize in any straightforward fashion for three-dimensional
versions of the knights-like models.
