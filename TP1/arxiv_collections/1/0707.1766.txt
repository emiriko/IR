We develop a harmonic analysis on objects of some category $C_2$ of
infinite-dimensional filtered vector spaces over a finite field. It includes
two-dimensional local fields and adelic spaces of algebraic surfaces defined
over a finite field. The main result is the theory of the Fourier transform on
these objects and two-dimensional Poisson formulas.
