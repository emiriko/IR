We derive general kinetic and hydrodynamic models of chemotactic aggregation
that describe certain features of the morphogenesis of biological colonies
(like bacteria, amoebae, endothelial cells or social insects). Starting from a
stochastic model defined in terms of N coupled Langevin equations, we derive a
nonlinear mean field Fokker-Planck equation governing the evolution of the
distribution function of the system in phase space. By taking the successive
moments of this kinetic equation and using a local thermodynamic equilibrium
condition, we derive a set of hydrodynamic equations involving a damping term.
In the limit of small frictions, we obtain a hyperbolic model describing the
formation of network patterns (filaments) and in the limit of strong frictions
we obtain a parabolic model which is a generalization of the standard
Keller-Segel model describing the formation of clusters (clumps). Our approach
connects and generalizes several models introduced in the chemotactic
literature. We discuss the analogy between bacterial colonies and
self-gravitating systems and between the chemotactic collapse and the
gravitational collapse (Jeans instability). We also show that the basic
equations of chemotaxis are similar to nonlinear mean field Fokker-Planck
equations so that a notion of effective generalized thermodynamics can be
developed.
