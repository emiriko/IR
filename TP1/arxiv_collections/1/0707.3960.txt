The author's new p-V-T Equation of State is tested against the available
experiments of epsilon iron. The root-mean-square-deviations (RMSD) of the
molar volume, pressure, and temperature are 0.021 cm3, 2.0 GPa and 144.9 K
respectively. Separating the experiments into 200 K ranges the new EoS was
compared to the most widely used finite strain, interatomic potential, and
empirical isothermal EoSs such as the Burch-Murnaghan, the Vinet, and the
Roy-Roy respectively. Correlation coefficients, RMSDs of the residuals and
Akaike Information Criteria were used for evaluating the fittings. Based on
these fitting parameters the new p-V-T EoS is equal or better than the
conventional isothermal EoSs. The newly defined parameters were used to
calculate the density of the inner core. The calculated densities are
significantly lower than the current consensus indicating that it might be too
early excluding the possibility of a pure iron-nickel core with no light
elements.
