We propose a novel mechanism for the production of the Higgs boson in
inclusive hadronic collisions, which utilizes the presence of heavy quarks in
the proton wave function. In these inclusive reactions the Higgs boson acquires
the momenta of both the heavy quark and antiquark and thus carries 80% or more
of the projectile's momentum. We predict that the cross section ${d \sigma/d
x_F}(p \bar p \to H X)$ for the inclusive production of the Standard Model
Higgs coming from intrinsic bottom Fock states is of order 150 fb at LHC
energies, peaking in the region of $x_F \sim 0.9$. Our estimates indicate that
the corresponding cross section coming from gluon-gluon fusion at $x_F = 0.9$
is relatively negligible and therefore the peak from intrinsic bottom should be
clearly visible for experiments with forward detection capabilities. The
predicted cross section for the production of the Standard Model Higgs coming
from intrinsic heavy quark Fock states in the proton is sufficiently large that
detection at the Tevatron and the LHC may be possible.
