We report Small Angle Neutron Scattering measurements of the flux lines
lattice (FLL) in $Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+ \delta}$. As previously reported, the
scattered intensity decreases strongly when the magnetic field is increased,
but it remains measurable far above the second peak. The direct observation of
Bragg peaks proves that the characteristics of a lattice are still present. No
structural features related to a symmetry breaking, such as a liquid like or an
amorphous state, can be observed. However, the associated scattered intensity
is very low and is difficult to explain. We discuss the coexistence between two
FLL states as a possible interpretation.
