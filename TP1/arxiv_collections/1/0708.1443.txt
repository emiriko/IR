The inclusive production cross sections of the charmed mesons D^0, D^+, D_s^+
and D^{*+} have been measured in interactions of 920 GeV protons on C, Ti, and
W targets with the HERA-B detector at the HERA storage ring. Differential cross
sections as a function of transverse momentum and Feynman's x variable are
given for the central rapidity region and for transverse momenta up to
$\pT=3.5$ GeV/$c$. The atomic mass number dependence and the leading to
non-leading particle production asymmetries are presented as well.
