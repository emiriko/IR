The non-singlet structure functions have been obtained by solving
Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations in
leading order (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO) at the small-x limit. Here a
Taylor series expansion has been used and then the method of characteristics
has been applied to solve the evolution equations. Results are comopared with
the Fermilab experiment E665 data and New Muon Collaboration (NMC) data.
