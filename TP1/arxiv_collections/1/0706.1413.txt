In evolutionary game theory an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) is a
refinement of the Nash equilibrium concept that is sometimes also recognized as
evolutionary stability. It is a game-theoretic model, well known to
mathematical biologists, that was found quite useful in the understanding of
evolutionary dynamics of a population. This chapter presents an analysis of
evolutionary stability in the emerging field of quantum games.
