We have performed for the first time micro-Raman studies of lysozyme crystals
for the temperatures lower than the room one (in the range 282-300K). Anomalous
temperature dependence of the positions of Raman scattering bands has been
detected and discussed, which corresponds to the crystalline lysozyme structure
in the vicinity of T=285K.
