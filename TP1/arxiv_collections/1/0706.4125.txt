Numerical simulations of the bosonic sector of the $SU(2)\times U(1)$
electroweak Standard Model in 3+1 dimensions have demonstrated the existence of
an oscillon -- an extremely long-lived, localized, oscillatory solution to the
equations of motion -- when the Higgs mass is equal to twice the $W^\pm$ boson
mass. It contains total energy roughly 30 TeV localized in a region of radius
0.05 fm. A detailed description of these numerical results is presented.
