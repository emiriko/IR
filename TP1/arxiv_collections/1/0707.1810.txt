We measure the mass of the eta meson using psi(2S) --> eta J/psi events
acquired with the CLEO-c detector operating at the CESR e+e- collider. Using
the four decay modes eta --> gamma gamma, 3pi0, pi+pi-pi0, and pi+pi-gamma, we
find M(eta)=547.785 +- 0.017 +- 0.057 MeV, in which the first uncertainty is
statistical and the second systematic. This result has an uncertainty
comparable to the two most precise previous measurements and is consistent with
that of NA48, but is inconsistent at the level of 6.5sigma with the much
smaller mass obtained by GEM.
