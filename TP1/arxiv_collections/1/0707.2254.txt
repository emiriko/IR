This paper studies the thermal properties of three-terminal mesoscopic
dielectric systems in the nonlinear response regime at low temperature. For a
symmetric three-terminal system, when the temperature is finitely different
between the left and right thermal reservoirs, the temperature of the central
thermal reservoir is always higher than the averaging temperature of the
others. This nonlinear thermal phenomenon is also observed for asymmetric
three-terminal systems. At the end, a model of thermal rectification is
presented.
