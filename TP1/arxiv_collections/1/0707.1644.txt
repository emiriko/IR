This paper introduces U-relations, a succinct and purely relational
representation system for uncertain databases. U-relations support
attribute-level uncertainty using vertical partitioning. If we consider
positive relational algebra extended by an operation for computing possible
answers, a query on the logical level can be translated into, and evaluated as,
a single relational algebra query on the U-relation representation. The
translation scheme essentially preserves the size of the query in terms of
number of operations and, in particular, number of joins. Standard techniques
employed in off-the-shelf relational database management systems are effective
for optimizing and processing queries on U-relations. In our experiments we
show that query evaluation on U-relations scales to large amounts of data with
high degrees of uncertainty.
