We present results on the performance of the first prototype of the CASTOR
quartz-tungsten sampling calorimeter, to be installed in the very forward
region of the CMS experiment at the LHC. This study includes GEANT Monte Carlo
simulations of the Cherenkov light transmission efficiency of different types
of air-core light guides, as well as analysis of the calorimeter linearity and
resolution as a function of energy and impact-point, obtained with 20-200 GeV
electron beams from CERN/SPS tests in 2003. Several configurations of the
calorimeter have been tested and compared, including different combinations of
(i) structures for the active material of the calorimeter (quartz plates and
fibres), (ii) various light-guide reflecting materials (glass and foil
reflectors) and (iii) photodetector devices (photomultipliers and avalanche
photodiodes).
