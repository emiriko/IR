We consider the classical and quantum dynamics of excitations in a system of
two capacitively coupled Josephson junctions. In the classical case the
equations of motion admit discrete breather solutions, which are time periodic
and localized predominantly on one of the junctions. In the quantum case
breather states are found in the central part of the energy spectrum of the
confined nonescaping states of the system. We perform a systematic analysis of
their tunneling frequency, site correlations, fluctuations of the number of
quanta, and entanglement. Quantum breather states show strong site correlation
of quanta and are characterized by a strong excitation of quanta on one
junction which perform slow coherent tunneling motion from one junction to the
other. They suppress fluctuations of the total number of excited quanta.
Quantum breather states are the least entangled states among the group of
eigenstates in the same range of the energy spectrum. We describe how quantum
breather excitations could be experimentally observed by employing the already
developed techniques for quantum information processing using Josephson
junctions.
