Many researchers have investigated first hitting times as models for survival
data. First hitting times arise naturally in many types of stochastic
processes, ranging from Wiener processes to Markov chains. In a survival
context, the state of the underlying process represents the strength of an item
or the health of an individual. The item fails or the individual experiences a
clinical endpoint when the process reaches an adverse threshold state for the
first time. The time scale can be calendar time or some other operational
measure of degradation or disease progression. In many applications, the
process is latent (i.e., unobservable). Threshold regression refers to
first-hitting-time models with regression structures that accommodate covariate
data. The parameters of the process, threshold state and time scale may depend
on the covariates. This paper reviews aspects of this topic and discusses
fruitful avenues for future research.
