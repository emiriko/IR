The combined action of gravity and quantum mechanics gives rise to a minimum
time uncertainty in the lowest order approximation of a perturbative scheme, in
which quantum effects are regarded as corrections to the classical spacetime
geometry. From the nonperturbative point of view, both gravity and quantum
mechanics are treated on equal footing in a description that already contains
all possible backreaction effects as those above in a nonlinear manner. In this
paper, the existence or not of such minimum time uncertainty is analyzed in the
context of Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter black holes using the isolated horizon
formalism. We show that from a perturbative point of view, a nonzero time
uncertainty is generically present owing to the energy scale introduced by the
cosmological constant, while in a quantization scheme that includes
nonperturbatively the effects of that scale, an arbitrarily high time
resolution can be reached.
