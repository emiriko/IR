In the field of tutoring systems, investigations have shown that there are
many tutoring systems specific to a specific domain that, because of their
static architecture, cannot be adapted to other domains. As consequence, often
neither methods nor knowledge can be reused. In addition, the knowledge
engineer must have programming skills in order to enhance and evaluate the
system. One particular challenge is to tackle these problems with the
development of a generic tutoring system. AnITA, as a stand-alone application,
has been developed and implemented particularly for this purpose. However, in
the testing phase, we discovered that this architecture did not fully match the
user's intuitive understanding of the use of a learning tool. Therefore, AnITA
has been redesigned to exclusively work as a client/server application and
renamed to AnITA2. This paper discusses the evolvements made on the AnITA
tutoring system, the goal of which is to use generic principles for system
re-use in any domain. Two experiments were conducted, and the results are
presented in this paper.
