Gedik et al have very recently demonstrated using a pump/probe femto-second
laser technique that the c-axis lattice parameter of LaCuO4+d temporarily
becomes expanded by as much as 2.5% following pulsed laser optical excitation
at 1.55 eV. Access to an out-of-equilibrium metastable excited state is
observed to develop on a time scale of 30 ps. Subsequently the latter state
decays displaying a still longer half-life of just over 300 ps. Observation of
the temperature independence of this laser induced interstate transfer and of
the linear dependence of the production of the metastable population upon the
energy delivered per unit area by the initiating light pulse (beyond a key
threshold fluence) have been interpreted by Gedik et al within the framework of
standard p-to-d, O-to-Cu, charge transfer excitations. By contrast these same
data are reinterpreted here in terms of pumped local pairs, within a negative-U
scenario of cuprate HTSC behaviour long advocated by the current author. The
d8-to-d10 laser-induced augmentation in the negative-U state population
(10CuIII2-) brings marked c-axis expansion by virtue of (i) the local
electrostatic charge imbalance, (ii) the increased antibonding nature of the
electron double-loading d10(p6) configuration created at pair-receptive CuIII
coordination units, and (iii) the layered nature of the cuprate crystal
structure. The new observations are related through to Rohlers striking,
standard crystallographic observations, to the stripe domain formation, and to
previous pump/probe experiments.
