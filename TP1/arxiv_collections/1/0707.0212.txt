The B-factories results provide an impressive confirmation of the Standard
Model (SM) description of flavor and CP violation. Nevertheless, as more data
were accumulated, deviations in the 2.5-3.5 sigma range have emerged pointing
to the exciting possibility of new CP-odd phase(s) and flavor violating
parameters in B-decays. Primarily this seems to be the case in the time
dependent CP asymmetries in penguin dominated modes (e.g. B -> phi (eta') Ks).
  We discuss these and other deviations from the SM and, as an illustration of
possible new physics scenarios, we examine the role of the Top Two Higgs
Doublet Model. This is a simple extension of the SM obtained by adding second
Higgs doublet in which the Yukawa interactions of the two Higgs doublets are
assigned in order to naturally account for the large top-quark mass.
  Of course, many other extensions of the Standard Model could also account for
these experimental deviations. Clearly if one takes these deviations seriously
then some new particles in the 300 GeV to few TeV with associated new CP-odd
phase(s) are needed.
