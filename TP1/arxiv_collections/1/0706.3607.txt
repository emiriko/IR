We investigate the transport behavior of finite modular quantum systems. Such
systems have recently been analyzed by different methods. These approaches
indicate diffusive behavior even and especially for finite systems. Inspired by
these results we analyze analytically and numerically if and in which sense the
dynamics of those systems are in agreement with an appropriate Boltzmann
equation. We find that the transport behavior of a certain type of finite
modular quantum systems may indeed be described in terms of a Boltzmann
equation. However, the applicability of the Boltzmann equation appears to be
rather limited to a very specific type of model.
