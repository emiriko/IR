Single dye molecules at cryogenic temperatures display many spectroscopic
phenomena known from free atoms and are thus promising candidates for
fundamental quantum optical studies. However, the existing techniques for the
detection of single molecules have either sacrificed the information on the
coherence of the excited state or have been inefficient. Here we show that
these problems can be addressed by focusing the excitation light near to the
absorption cross section of a molecule. Our detection scheme allows us to
explore resonance fluorescence over 9 orders of magnitude of excitation
intensity and to separate its coherent and incoherent parts. In the strong
excitation regime, we demonstrate the first observation of the Mollow triplet
from a single solid-state emitter. Under weak excitation we report the
detection of a single molecule with an incident power as faint as 150 attoWatt,
paving the way for studying nonlinear effects with only a few photons.
