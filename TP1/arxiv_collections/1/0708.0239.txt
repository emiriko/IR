Highly degenerate spectra associated with universal extra dimensions (UED)
provide an interesting phenomenology not only from the point of view of
cosmology and astrophysics, but also for colliders. We study these exotic
signals for the simplest case, called minimal UED, where it is natural to find
slow charged particles, displaced vertices, tracks with non-vanishing impact
parameters, track kinks, and even vanishing charged tracks.
