An interesting approach to achieve quantum gate operations in a solid state
device is to implement an optically driven quantum gate using two vertically
coupled self-assembled quantum dots, a quantum dot molecule (QDM). We present a
realistic model for exciton dynamics in InGaAs/GaAs QDMs under intense laser
excitation and applied electric fields. The dynamics is obtained by solutions
of the Lindblad master equation. A map of the dressed ground state as function
of laser energy and applied electric field exhibits rich structure that
includes excitonic anticrossings that permit the identification of the relevant
couplings. The optical signatures of the dipole-dipole Forster energy transfer
mechanism show as splittings of several (spatially) indirect excitonic lines.
Moreover, we construct a model for exciton qubit rotations by adiabatic
electric field cyclic sweeps into a Forster-tunneling regime which induces
level anticrossings. The proposed qubit exhibits Rabi oscillations among two
well defined exciton pairs as function of the residence time at the
anticrossing.
