We investigate the neutrino induced coherent pion production reaction at low
and intermediate energies. The model includes pion, nucleon and Delta(1232)
resonance as the relevant hadronic degrees of freedom. Nuclear medium effects
on the production mechanisms and pion distortion are taken into account. We
obtain that the dominance of the Delta excitation holds due to large
cancellations among the background contributions. We consider two sets of
vector and axial-vector N-Delta transition form-factors, evidencing the strong
sensitivity of the results to the axial coupling C5A(0). The differences
between neutrino and antineutrino cross sections, emerging from interference
terms, are also discussed.
