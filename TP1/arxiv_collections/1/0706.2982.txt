Recent developments in higher order calculations within the framework of
Dimensional Reduction, the preferred regularization scheme for supersymmetric
theories, are reported on. Special emphasis is put on the treatment of
evanescent couplings, the equivalence to Dimensional Regularization, and the
evaluation of $\alpha_s(M_GUT)$ from $\alpha_s(M_Z)$.
