In this paper, the Feynman path integral formulation of the
continuous-continuous filtering problem, a fundamental problem of applied
science, is investigated for the case when the noise in the signal and
measurement model is additive. It is shown that it leads to an independent and
self-contained analysis and solution of the problem. A consequence of this
analysis is Feynman path integral formula for the conditional probability
density that manifests the underlying physics of the problem. A corollary of
the path integral formula is the Yau algorithm that has been shown to be
superior to all other known algorithms. The Feynman path integral formulation
is shown to lead to practical and implementable algorithms. In particular, the
solution of the Yau PDE is reduced to one of function computation and
integration.
