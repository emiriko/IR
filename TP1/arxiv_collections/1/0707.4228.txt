The attosecond high harmonic pulses obtained from a long Ar-filled gas cell
were characterized by two techniques - the reconstruction of attosecond beating
by interference of two-photon transition (RABITT) and frequency-resolved
optical gating (FROG) methods. The pulse durations obtained by RABITT and FROG
methods agreed within 10 %.
