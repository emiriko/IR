In this contribution I review rigorous formulations of a variety of
limitations of measurability in quantum mechanics. To this end I begin with a
brief presentation of the conceptual tools of modern measurement theory. I will
make precise the notion that quantum measurements necessarily alter the system
under investigation and elucidate its connection with the complementarity and
uncertainty principles.
