A simple method called symbolic representation for piecewise linear functions
on the real line is introduced and used to compute the numbers of periodic
points of all periods for some such functions. Since, for every positive
integer m, the number of periodic points of minimal period m must be divisible
by m, we obtain infinitely many congruence identities.
