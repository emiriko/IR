Single photons detected by the DELPHI experiment at LEP2 in the years
1997-2000 are used to investigate the existence of a single extra dimension in
a modifed ADD scenario with slightly warped large extra dimensions. The data
collected at centre-of-mass energies between 180 and 209 GeV for an integrated
luminosity of ~650 pb^-1 agree with the predictions of the Standard Model and
allow a limit to be set on graviton emission in one large extra dimension. The
limit obtained on the fundamental mass scale MD is 1.69 TeV at 95% CL, with an
expected limit of 1.71 TeV.
