Lateral effects are analyzed in the antibunching of a beam of free
non-interacting fermions. The emission of particles from a source is
dynamically described in a 3D full quantum field-theoretical framework. The
size of the source and the detectors, as well as the temperature of the source
are taken into account and the behavior of the visibility is scrutinized as a
function of these parameters.
