We consider the wetting transition in the framework of an effective interface
model of gradient type, in dimension 2 and higher. We prove pathwise estimates
showing that the interface is localized in the whole thermodynamically-defined
partial wetting regime considered in earlier works. Moreover, we study how the
interface delocalizes as the wetting transition is approached. Our main tool is
reflection positivity in the form of the chessboard estimate.
