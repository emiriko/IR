The modeling of technology succession and new technology adoption includes a
wide array of techniques from complexity theory. In our previous work, we
applied the results of the Windrum-Birchenhall model to technology policy and
technology development strategies. However, as we began to explore the
Windrum-Birchenhall simulation we discovered significant limitations in their
model and felt that a new model was needed which could accommodate simultaneous
macro and micro-level events in order effectively simulate market volatilities.
The following paper discusses the architecture of the new model of
technological succession developed at the Southern New Hampshire University
International Business Modeling Laboratory and explains results from early
simulation runs. We continue to develop this model and expect to have
additional applications and simulation results as our research progresses.
