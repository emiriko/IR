We consider a chain of nonlinear oscillators with long-range interaction of
the type 1/l^{1+alpha}, where l is a distance between oscillators and 0< alpha
<2. In the continues limit the system's dynamics is described by the
Ginzburg-Landau equation with complex coefficients. Such a system has a new
parameter alpha that is responsible for the complexity of the medium and that
strongly influences possible regimes of the dynamics. We study different
spatial-temporal patterns of the dynamics depending on alpha and show
transitions from synchronization of the motion to broad-spectrum oscillations
and to chaos.
