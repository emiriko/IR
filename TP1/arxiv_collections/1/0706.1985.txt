Integrating areas of current research into undergraduate physics labs can be
a difficult task. The location of the magnetopause is one problem that can be
examined with no prior exposure to space physics. The magnetopause location can
be viewed as a pressure balance between the dynamic pressure of the solar wind
and the magnetic pressure of the magnetosphere. In this lab sophomore and
junior students examine the magnetopause location using simulation results from
BATS-R-US global MHD code run at NASA's Community Coordinated Modeling Center.
Students also analyze data from several spacecraft to find magnetopause
crossings. The students get reasonable agreement between their results and
model predictions from this lab as well as exposure to the tools and techniques
of space physics.
