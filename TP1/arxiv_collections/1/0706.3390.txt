Vertical shaking of a mixture of small and large beads can lead to
segregation where the large beads either accumulate at the top of the sample,
the so called Brazil Nut effect (BNE), or at the bottom, the Reverse Brazil Nut
effect (RBNE). Here we demonstrate experimentally a sharp transition from the
RBNE to the BNE when the particle coefficient of friction increases due to
aging of the particles. This result can be explained by the two competing
mechanisms of buoyancy and sidewall-driven convection, where the latter is
assumed to grow in strength with increasing friction.
