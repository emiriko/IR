We report a preliminary measurement of the slope parameter $\alpha$ for the
$\eta\to 3\piz$ decay carried out with KLOE at DA$\Phi$NE; where $\alpha$ is
the parameter describing the energy dependence of the square of the matrix
element for this decay. By fitting the event density in the Dalitz plot with a
collected statistic of 420 pb$^{-1}$ we determine $\alpha = -0.027 \pm 0.004
(stat) ^{+0.004}_{-0.006} (syst)$. This result is consistent with current
chiral perturbation theory calculations within the unitary approach.
