A procedure is described for defining a generalized solution for stochastic
differential equations using the Cameron-Martin version of the Wiener Chaos
expansion. Existence and uniqueness of this Wiener Chaos solution is
established for parabolic stochastic PDEs such that both the drift and the
diffusion operators are of the second order.
