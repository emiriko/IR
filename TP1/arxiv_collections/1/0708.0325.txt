Recently important classes of solitonic string solutions were obtained -
giant magnons and single spikes. In previous study we showed the existence of
giant magnon-like membrane solutions and studied their properties. In this
paper we investigate classical rotating membranes representing analog of a
specific class of string spiky solutions. Using the reduction to the
Neumann-Rosochatius integrable system we find analog of the string single spike
solutions. In contrast to the magnon-like solutions, this case is characterized
with finite difference of energy and ``winding number'' and finite spins as
well.
