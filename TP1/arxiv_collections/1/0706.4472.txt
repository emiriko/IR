The present paper points out to a novel scenario for formation of chaotic
attractors in a class of models of excitable cell membranes near an
Andronov-Hopf bifurcation (AHB). The mechanism underlying chaotic dynamics
admits a simple and visual description in terms of the families of
one-dimensional first-return maps, which are constructed using the combination
of asymptotic and numerical techniques. The bifurcation structure of the
continuous system (specifically, the proximity to a degenerate AHB) endows the
Poincare map with distinct qualitative features such as unimodality and the
presence of the boundary layer, where the map is strongly expanding. This
structure of the map in turn explains the bifurcation scenarios in the
continuous system including chaotic mixed-mode oscillations near the border
between the regions of sub- and supercritical AHB. The proposed mechanism
yields the statistical properties of the mixed-mode oscillations in this
regime. The statistics predicted by the analysis of the Poincare map and those
observed in the numerical experiments of the continuous system show a very good
agreement.
