We study the arrival time distribution of overdamped particles driven by a
constant force in a piecewise linear random potential which generates the
dichotomous random force. Our approach is based on the path integral
representation of the probability density of the arrival time. We explicitly
calculate the path integral for a special case of dichotomous disorder and use
the corresponding characteristic function to derive prominent properties of the
arrival time probability density. Specifically, we establish the scaling
properties of the central moments, analyze the behavior of the probability
density for short, long, and intermediate distances. In order to quantify the
deviation of the arrival time distribution from a Gaussian shape, we evaluate
the skewness and the kurtosis.
