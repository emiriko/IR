We report negative capacitance at low frequencies in organic semiconductor
based diodes and show that it appears only under bipolar injection conditions.
We account quantitatively for this phenomenon by the recombination current due
to electron-hole annihilation. Simple addition of the recombination current to
the well established model of space charge limited current in the presence of
traps, yields excellent fits to the experimentally measured admittance data.
The dependence of the extracted characteristic recombination time on the bias
voltage is indicative of a recombination process which is mediated by localized
traps.
