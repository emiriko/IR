Squeezing of light's quantum noise requires temporal rearranging of photons.
This again corresponds to creation of quantum correlations between individual
photons. Squeezed light is a non-classical manifestation of light with great
potential in high-precision quantum measurements, for example in the detection
of gravitational waves. Equally promising applications have been proposed in
quantum communication. However, after 20 years of intensive research doubts
arose whether strong squeezing can ever be realized as required for eminent
applications. Here we show experimentally that strong squeezing of light's
quantum noise is possible. We reached a benchmark squeezing factor of 10 in
power (10dB). Thorough analysis reveals that even higher squeezing factors will
be feasible in our setup.
