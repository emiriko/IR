Based on a recent proposal [Phys. Rev. A 71, 062337 (2005)], we have
experimentally realized two photon polarization qutrits by using non-maximally
entangled states and linear optical transformations. By this technique high
fidelity mutually unbiased qutrits are generated at a high brilliance level.
