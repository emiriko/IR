We present a detailed comparison of two self-consistent equation-of-state
models which differ from their electronic contribution: the atom in a spherical
cell and the atom in a jellium of charges. It is shown that both models are
well suited for the calculation of Hugoniot shock adiabats in the high pressure
range (1 Mbar-10 Gbar), and that the atom-in-a-jellium model provides a better
treatment of pressure ionization. Comparisons with experimental data are also
presented. Shell effects on shock adiabats are reviewed in the light of these
models. They lead to additional features not only in the variations of pressure
versus density, but also in the variations of shock velocity versus particle
velocity. Moreover, such effects are found to be responsible for enhancement of
the electronic specific heat.
