Bose-Einstein correlations of charged and neutral kaons have been measured in
e+-p deep inelastic scattering with an integrated luminosity of 121 pb-1 using
the ZEUS detector at HERA. The two-particle correlation function was studied as
a function of the four-momentum difference of the kaon pairs,
Q_12=sqrt{-(p_1-p_2)^2}, assuming a Gaussian shape for the particle source. The
values of the radius of the production volume, r, and of the correlation
strength, lambda, were obtained for both neutral and charged kaons. The radii
for charged and neutral kaons are similar and are consistent with those
obtained at LEP.
