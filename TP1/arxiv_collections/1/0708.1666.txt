The angle-dependent interlayer magnetoresistance of overdoped
Tl$_2$Ba$_2$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ has been measured in high magnetic fields up to 45
Tesla. A conventional Boltzmann transport analysis with no basal-plane
anisotropy in the cyclotron frequency $\omega_c$ or transport lifetime $\tau$
is shown to be inadequate for explaining the data. We describe in detail how
the analysis can be modified to incorporate in-plane anisotropy in these two
key quantities and extract the degree of anisotropy for each by assuming a
simple four-fold symmetry. While anisotropy in $\omega_c$ and other Fermi
surface parameters may improve the fit, we demonstrate that the most important
anisotropy is that in the transport lifetime, thus confirming its role in the
physics of overdoped superconducting cuprates.
