We propose a model that introduces a supersymmetric unparticle operator in
the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model. We analyze the lowest dimension
operator involving an unparticle. This operator behaves as a Standard Model
gauge singlet and it introduces a new parameter into the Higgs potential which
can provide an alternative way to relax the upper limit on the lightest Higgs
boson mass. This operator also introduces several unparticle interactions which
can induce a neutral Higgsino to decay into a spinor unparticle. It also
induces violation of scale invariance around the electroweak scale. It is
necessary for the scale of this violation to be larger than the lightest
supersymmetric particle mass to maintain the latter as the usual weakly
interacting massive particle dark matter candidate. An alternative is to have
unparticle state as dark matter candidate. We also comment on some collider
implications.
