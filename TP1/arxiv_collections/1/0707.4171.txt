We argue that the unscreened Coulomb interaction in graphene provides a
positive, universal, and logarithmic correction to scaling of zero-temperature
conductivity with frequency. The combined effect of the disorder due to
wrinkling of the graphene sheet and the long range electron-electron
interactions is a finite positive contribution to the dc conductivity. This
contribution is disorder strength dependent and thus non-universal. The
low-energy behavior of such a system is governed by the line of fixed points at
which both the interaction and disorder are finite, and the density of states
is exactly linear. An estimate of the typical random vector potential
representing ripples in graphene brings the theoretical value of the minimal
conductivity into the vicinity of 4e^2/h.
