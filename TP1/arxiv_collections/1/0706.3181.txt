We employ the broken-link model to create a barrier with slits in a
two-dimensional lattice. The diffraction and interference patterns of the
probability distribution of quantum walkers passing through the slits are
analyzed. Simulations were performed using the main types of coins, and display
diffraction and interference patterns that depend on the choice of coins.
