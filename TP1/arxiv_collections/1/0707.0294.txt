We present a calculation of 1/m^2_b corrections to the lifetime differences
of B_s mesons \Delta \Gamma_s in the heavy-quark expansion. We find that they
are small to significantly affect \Delta \Gamma_s and present the result for
lifetime difference including non-perturbative 1/m_b and 1/m_b^2 corrections.
We also analyze the generic \Delta B = 1 New Physics contributions to \Delta
\Gamma_s and provide several examples.
