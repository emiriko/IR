A major goal of developing high-precision control of many-body quantum
systems is to realise their potential as quantum computers. Probably the most
significant obstacle in this direction is the problem of "decoherence": the
extreme fragility of quantum systems to environmental noise and other control
limitations. The theory of fault-tolerant quantum error correction has shown
that quantum computation is possible even in the presence of decoherence
provided that the noise affecting the quantum system satisfies certain
well-defined theoretical conditions. However, existing methods for noise
characterisation have become intractable already for the systems that are
controlled in today's labs. In this paper we introduce a technique based on
symmetrisation that enables direct experimental characterisation of key
properties of the decoherence affecting a multi-body quantum system. Our method
reduces the number of experiments required by existing methods from exponential
to polynomial in the number of subsystems. We demonstrate the application of
this technique to the optimisation of control over nuclear spins in the solid
state.
