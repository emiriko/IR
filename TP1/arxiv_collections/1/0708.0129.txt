Low temperature specific heat has been investigated in a novel ternary
superconductor La_{3}Pd_{4}Ge_{4} with an U_{3}Ni_{4}Si_{4}-type structure
consisting of the alternating BaAl_{4} (ThCr_{2}Si_{2})- and AlB$_{2}$-type
layers. A comparative study with the related ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type superconductor
LaPd_{2}Ge_{2}, one of the layers in La_{3}Pd_{4}Ge_{4}, is also presented.
  From the normal state specific heat, the Sommerfeld coefficient $\gamma_{n} =
27.0$ mJ/mol K^2 and the Debye temperature $\Theta_{\rm D}$ = 256 K are derived
for the La_{3}Pd_{4}Ge_{4}, while those for the LaPd_{2}Ge_{2} are $\gamma_{n}
=8.26$ mJ/mol K^2 and $\Theta_{\rm D}$ = 291 K. The La_{3}Pd_{4}Ge_{4} has
moderately high electronic density of state at the Fermi level. Electronic
contribution on the specific heat, $C_{\rm el}$, in each compound is well
described by the BCS behavior, suggesting that both of the La_{3}Pd_{4}Ge_{4}
and the LaPd_{2}Ge_{2} have fully opened isotropic gap in the superconducting
state.
