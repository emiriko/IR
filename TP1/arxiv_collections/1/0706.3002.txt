Exactly solvable rererence potentials of several smoothly joined Morse-type
components were constructed for the lowest two excimer states of Ar2 molecule.
The parameters of the potentials have been ascertained by fitting to the
experimental data, and they are reliable in a wide range of nuclear
separations. A large number of quantum mechanical Franck-Condon factors for
bound-free and bound-bound transitions have been calculated and compared with
the observed spectroscopic features. The fitting procedure also involved dipole
transition moments, which have been adjusted to the known radiative lifetimes
of the vibrational levels. The resulting potential energy curves accurately
reproduce the first and the second emission continua of Ar2* as well as the
oscillatory spectrum related to their inner turning point region. The numbering
and the positions of the vibrational levels reported by Herman et al. [P. R.
Herman, P. E. LaRocque, and B. P. Stoicheff, J. Chem. Phys. 89, 4535 (1988)]
have been confirmed.
