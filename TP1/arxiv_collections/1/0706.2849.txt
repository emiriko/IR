A comprehensive study of the electronic states at the 4s+5s asymptote in KRb
is presented. Abundant spectroscopic data on the \astate state were collected
by Fourier-transform spectroscopy which allow to determine an accurate
experimental potential energy curve up to 14.8 \AA . The existing data set (C.
Amiot et al. J. Chem. Phys. 112, 7068 (2000)) on the ground state \Xstate was
extended by several additional levels lying close to the atomic asymptote. In a
coupled channels fitting routine complete molecular potentials for both
electronic states were fitted. Along with the line frequencies of the molecular
transitions, recently published positions of Feshbach resonances in $^{40}$K
and $^{87}$Rb mixtures (F. Ferlaino et al. Phys. Rev. A 74, 039903 (2006)) were
included in the fit. This makes the derived potential curves capable for an
accurate description of observed cold collision features so far. Predictions of
scattering lengths and Feshbach resonances in other isotopic combinations are
reported.
