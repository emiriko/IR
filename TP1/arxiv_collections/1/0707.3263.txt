We outline design and lines of development of autonomous tools for the
computing Grid management, monitoring and optimization. The management is
proposed to be based on the notion of utility. Grid optimization is considered
to be application-oriented. A generic Grid simulator is proposed as an
optimization tool for Grid structure and functionality.
