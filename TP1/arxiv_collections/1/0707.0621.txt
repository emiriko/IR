All-reflective interferometry based on nano-structured diffraction gratings
offers new possibilities for gravitational wave detection. We investigate an
all-reflective Fabry-Perot interferometer concept in 2nd order Littrow mount.
The input-output relations for such a resonator are derived treating the
grating coupler by means of a scattering matrix formalism. A low loss
dielectric reflection grating has been designed and manufactured to test the
properties of such a grating cavity.
