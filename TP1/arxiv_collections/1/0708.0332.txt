The observation of dark-resonances in the two-electron atom barium and their
influence on optical cooling is reported. In heavy alkali earth atoms, i.e.
barium or radium, optical cooling can be achieved using n^1S_0-n^1P_1
transitions and optical repumping from the low lying n^1D_2 and n^3D_{1,2}
states to which the atoms decay with a high branching ratio. The cooling and
repumping transition have a common upper state. This leads to dark resonances
and hence make optical cooling less inefficient. The experimental observations
can be accurately modelled by the optical Bloch equations. Comparison with
experimental results allows us to extract relevant parameters for effective
laser cooling of barium.
