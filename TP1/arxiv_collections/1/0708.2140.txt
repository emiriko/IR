We show which is the nanostructure required in granular Co20(ZrO2)80 thin
films to produce an ac response such as the one that is universally observed in
a very wide variety of dielectric materials. A bimodal size distribution of Co
particles yields randomly competing conductance channels which allow both
thermally assisted tunneling through small particles and capacitive conductance
among larger particles that are further apart. A model consisting on a simple
cubic random resistance-capacitor network describes quantitatively the
experimental results as functions of temperature and frequency, and enables the
determination of the microscopic parameters controlling the ac response of the
samples.
