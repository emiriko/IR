We study a model of freely cooling inelastic granular gas in one dimension,
with a restitution coefficient which approaches the elastic limit below a
relative velocity scale v. While at early times (t << 1/v) the gas behaves as a
completely inelastic sticky gas conforming to predictions of earlier studies,
at late times (t >> 1/v) it exhibits a new fluctuation dominated phase ordering
state. We find distinct scaling behavior for the (i) density distribution
function, (ii) occupied and empty gap distribution functions, (iii) the density
structure function and (iv) the velocity structure function, as compared to the
completely inelastic sticky gas. The spatial structure functions (iii) and (iv)
violate the Porod law. Within a mean-field approximation, the exponents
describing the structure functions are related to those describing the spatial
gap distribution functions.
