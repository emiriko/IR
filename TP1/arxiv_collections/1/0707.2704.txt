It is shown that a momentum-boost technique applied to the extended Kohn-Sham
scheme enables the computational determination of the Mott insulating
transition. Self-consistent solutions are given for correlated electron systems
by the first-principles calculation defined by the multi-reference density
functional theory, in which the effective short-range interaction can be
determined by the fluctuation reference method. An extension of the Harriman
construction is made for the twisted boundary condition in order to define the
momentum-boost technique in the first-principles manner. For an effectively
half-filled-band system, the momentum-boost method tells that the period of a
metallic ground state by the LDA calculation is shortened to the least period
of the insulating phase, indicating occurrence of the Mott insulating
transition.
