In the Intriligator-Seiberg-Shih model, we parametrize spontaneous breaking
of $U(1)_R$ symmetry with two gauge singlets with R-charges 1 and --1. These
singlets can play the role of the messengers. The messenger scale is
dynamically generated, and hence there is no hierarchy problem between the
supersymmetry breaking scale and the messenger scale. In the gauge mediation
scenario, supersymmetry breaking scale turns out to be around
$\mathcal{O}(10^6)\textrm{GeV}$.
