I present a method for lossy transform coding of digital audio that uses the
Weyl symbol calculus for constructing the encoding and decoding transformation.
The method establishes a direct connection between a time-frequency
representation of the signal dependent threshold of masked noise and the
encode/decode pair. The formalism also offers a time-frequency measure of
perceptual entropy.
