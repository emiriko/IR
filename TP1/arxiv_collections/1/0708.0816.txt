We perform a comparison of the radiative and collisional parton energy losses
in an expanding quark-gluon plasma. The radiative energy loss is calculated
within the light-cone path integral approach. The collisional energy loss is
calculated using the Bjorken method with an accurate treatment of the binary
collision kinematics. Our numerical results demonstrate that for RHIC and LHC
conditions the collisional energy loss is relatively small in comparison to the
radiative one. We find an enhancement of the heavy quark radiative energy loss
as compared to that of the light quarks at high energies.
