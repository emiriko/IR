Structural study of orbital-ordered manganite thin films has been conducted
using synchrotron radiation, and a ground state electronic phase diagram is
made. The lattice parameters of four manganite thin films, Nd0.5Sr0.5MnO3
(NSMO) or Pr0.5Sr0.5MnO3 (PSMO) on (011) surfaces of SrTiO3 (STO) or
[(LaAlO3){0.3}(SrAl0.5Ta0.5O3){0.7}] (LSAT), were measured as a function of
temperature. The result shows, as expected based on previous knowledge of bulk
materials, that the films' resistivity is closely related to their structures.
Observed superlattice reflections indicate that NSMO thin films have an
antiferro-orbital-ordered phase as their low-temperature phase while PSMO film
on LSAT has a ferro-orbital-ordered phase, and that on STO has no
orbital-ordered phase. A metallic ground state was observed only in films
having a narrow region of A-site ion radius, while larger ions favor
ferro-orbital-ordered structure and smaller ions stabilize
antiferro-orbital-ordered structure. The key to the orbital-ordering transition
in (011) film is found to be the in-plane displacement along [0-1 1] direction.
