We propose a method to perform precision measurements of the interaction
parameters in systems of N ultra-cold spin 1/2 atoms. The spectroscopy is
realized by first creating a coherent spin superposition of the two relevant
internal states of each atom and then letting the atoms evolve under a
squeezing Hamiltonian. The non-linear nature of the Hamiltonian decreases the
fundamental limit imposed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to N^(-2), a
factor of N smaller than the fundamental limit achievable with non-interacting
atoms. We study the effect of decoherence and show that even with decoherence,
entangled states can outperform the signal to noise limit of non-entangled
states. We present two possible experimental implementations of the method
using Bose-Einstein spinor condensates and fermionic atoms loaded in optical
lattices and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.
