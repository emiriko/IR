We present a theoretical analysis of magnetic toroidal moments in periodic
systems, in the limit in which the toroidal moments are caused by a time and
space reversal symmetry breaking arrangement of localized magnetic dipole
moments. We summarize the basic definitions for finite systems and address the
question of how to generalize these definitions to the bulk periodic case. We
define the toroidization as the toroidal moment per unit cell volume, and we
show that periodic boundary conditions lead to a multivaluedness of the
toroidization, which suggests that only differences in toroidization are
meaningful observable quantities. Our analysis bears strong analogy to the
modern theory of electric polarization in bulk periodic systems, but we also
point out some important differences between the two cases. We then discuss the
instructive example of a one-dimensional chain of magnetic moments, and we show
how to properly calculate changes of the toroidization for this system.
Finally, we evaluate and discuss the toroidization (in the local dipole limit)
of four important example materials: BaNiF_4, LiCoPO_4, GaFeO_3, and BiFeO_3.
