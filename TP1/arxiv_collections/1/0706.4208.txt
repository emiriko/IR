Scanning tunneling spectroscopy of thin epitaxial
$SrRuO_{3}/(110)YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-\delta}$ ferromagnet/superconductor bilayers,
reveal a clear penetration of the Andreev bound states into the ferromagnetic
layer. The penetration is manifested in the density of states of the
ferromagnet as a split zero bias conductance peak with an imbalance between
peak heights. Our data indicate that the splitting occurs at the superconductor
side as a consequence of induced magnetization, confirming recent theoretical
predictions. The imbalance is attributed to the spin polarization in the
ferromagnet.
