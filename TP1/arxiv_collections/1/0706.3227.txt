I examine the role of final state interactions in cold nuclear matter in
modifying hadron production on nuclear targets with leptonic or hadronic beams.
I demonstrate the extent to which available experimental data in
electron-nucleus collisions can give direct information on final state effects
in hadron-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions. For hadron-nucleus
collisions, a theoretical estimate based on a parton energy loss model tested
in lepton-nucleus collisions shows a large effect on mid-rapidity hadrons at
fixed target experiments. At RHIC energy, the effect is large for negative
rapidity hadrons, but mild at midrapidity. This final state cold hadron
quenching needs to be taken into account in jet tomographic analysis of the
medium created in nucleus-nucleus collisions.
