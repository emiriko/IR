The negative mode of the Schwarzschild black hole is central to Euclidean
quantum gravity around hot flat space and for the Gregory-Laflamme black string
instability. We analyze the eigenvalue as a function of space-time dimension by
constructing two perturbative expansions: one for large d and the other for
small d-3, and determining as many coefficients as we are able to compute
analytically. Joining the two expansions we obtain an interpolating rational
function accurate to better than 2% through the whole range of dimensions
including d=4.
