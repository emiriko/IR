As I compress on the canvas of a few pages here major results of my research
on the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB) spreading over the past 15
years, an exciting picture emerges on this unique host molecule which surpasses
in its complexity even that of the most capable viral proteins known to date.
Accordingly, RB has the potential to bind not only growth-promoting proteins
such as insulin, but also to attach itself to calcium and oxygen, as well as to
be secreted into the extracellular environment. Moreover, RB may exert
proteolytic, antimicrobial and anti-aging activities. These condensed
structure-based insights on RB are the substance of a scientific revolution I
have initiated a long time ago, yet likely to gain even further speed in the
years to come, thus expanding both our understanding of life at the molecular
level and the possibilities for pharmacological modulation of fundamental
biological phenomena, particularly in oncology and gerontology.
