The contributions of neutrons to hadronic signals from the DREAM calorimeter
are measured by analyzing the time structure of these signals. The neutrons,
which mainly originate from the evaporation stage of nuclear breakup in the
hadronic shower development process, contribute through elastic scattering off
protons in the plastic scintillating fibers which provide the $dE/dx$
information in this calorimeter. This contribution is characterized by an
exponential tail in the pulse shape, with a time constant of $\sim 25$ ns. The
relative contribution of neutrons to the signals increases with the distance
from the shower axis. As expected, the neutrons do not contribute to the DREAM
\v{C}erenkov signals.
