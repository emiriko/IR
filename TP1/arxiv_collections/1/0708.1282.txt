We show how the SUSY flavour and CP problems can be solved using gauged SU(3)
family symmetry previously introduced to describe quark and lepton masses and
mixings, in particular neutrino tri-bimaximal mixing via constrained sequential
dominance. The Yukawa and soft trilinear and scalar mass squared matrices and
kinetic terms are expanded in powers of the flavons used to spontaneously break
the SU(3) family symmetry, and the canonically normalized versions of these
matrices are constructed. The soft mass matrices are then expressed in the
Super-CKM basis, and the leading order mass insertion parameters are
calculated, and are shown to satisfy the experimental constraints from flavour
changing neutral current processes. Assuming that CP is spontaneously broken by
the flavons, the next-to-leading order effects responsible for CP violation are
then estimated, and the predictions for electric dipole moments are shown to be
an order of magnitude more suppressed than those predicted from the constrained
minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM), and may be further suppressed if
the high energy trilinear soft parameter is assumed to be relatively small. We
also predict that, unlike in the CMSSM, epsilon_K'/epsilon_K may be dominated
by the SUSY operator O_8. We also discuss the additional constraints from
unification, which can lead to further predictions for flavour changing in our
scheme.
