Some aspects of the motion of a tachyon is discussed. It is shown that the
inertial frame Sigma-Prime around which the tachyon switches the direction of
its motion, does not observe any movement of the tachyon at all. Inertial
frames on either side of Sigma-Prime observe the tachyon to be moving at very
large speeds but in opposite direction. Sigma-Prime itself observes only a
sudden appearance and immediate disappearance of a long rod like object. Thus
unbounded speeds in either direction give the same result in the limit. This
suggests that negative numbers as a physical quantity are not meaningful.
Subtraction can be used integral to a formula but the final result has to be
interpreted with a positive answer. This means the abstract quantity -infinity
indicating an unbounded negative number is not meaningful. The situation is
also compared with Tan (Pi/2)+ and Tan(Pi/2)-. The conclusion is that in the
limit, travel at unbounded speed is direction independent and gives the
connotation of many identities to the same particle.
