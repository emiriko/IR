In this paper we present the equations of the evolution of the universe in
$D$ spatial dimensions, as a generalization of the work of Lima \citep{lima}.
We discuss the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmological equations in $D$ spatial
dimensions for a simple fluid with equation of state $p=\omega_{D}\rho$. It is
possible to reduce the multidimensional equations to the equation of a point
particle system subject to a linear force. This force can be expressed as an
oscillator equation, anti-oscillator or a free particle equation, depending on
the $k$ parameter of the spatial curvature. An interesting result is the
independence on the dimension $D$ in a de Sitter evolution. We also stress the
generality of this procedure with a cosmological $\Lambda$ term. A more
interesting result is that the reduction of the dimensionality leads naturally
to an accelerated expansion of the scale factor in the plane case.
