We analyze the role played by entanglement in the dynamical evolution of
Grover's search algorithm in the space of qubits. We show that the algorithm
can be equivalently described as an iterative change of the entanglement
between the qubits, which governs the evolution of the initial state towards
the target state, and where the entanglement can be quantified in terms a
single entanglement monotone. We also provide a necessary and sufficient
condition for the quadratic speedup, which illustrates how the change in the
bipartite entanglement of the state after each iteration determines the
corresponding increase in the probability of finding the target state. This
allows us to reestablish from the entanglement perspective that Grover's search
algorithm is the only optimal pure state search algorithm.
