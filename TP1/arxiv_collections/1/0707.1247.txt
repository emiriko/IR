The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is expected to provide proton-proton
collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV, yielding millions of of top
quark events. The top-physics potential of the two general purpose experiments,
ATLAS and CMS, is discussed according to state-of-the-art simulation of both
physics and detectors. An overview is given of the most important results with
emphasis on the expected improvements in our understanding of physics connected
to the top quark.
