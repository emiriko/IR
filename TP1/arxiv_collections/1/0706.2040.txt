Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) have become a popular tool for
computational analysis of biological data in a variety of domains. But, what
exactly are they and how do they work? How can we use PGMs to discover patterns
that are biologically relevant? And to what extent can PGMs help us formulate
new hypotheses that are testable at the bench? This note sketches out some
answers and illustrates the main ideas behind the statistical approach to
biological pattern discovery.
