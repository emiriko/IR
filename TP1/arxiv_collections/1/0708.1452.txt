Multiple-valued Logic (MVL) circuits are one of the most attractive
applications of the Monostable-to-Multistable transition Logic (MML), and they
are on the basis of advanced circuits for communications. The operation of such
quantizer has two steps : sampling and holding. Once the quantizer samples the
signal, it must maintain the sampled value even if the input changes. However,
holding property is not inherent to MML circuit topologies. This paper analyses
the case of an MML ternary inverter used as a quantizer, and determines the
relations that circuit representative parameters must verify to avoid this
malfunction.
