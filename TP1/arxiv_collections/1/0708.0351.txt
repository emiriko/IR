Hard high-energy pion-nucleus bremsstrahlung, $\pi^- +A\to\pi^- +\gamma +A$,
is studied in the Coulomb region, i.e. the small-angle region where the nuclear
scattering is dominated by the Coulomb interaction. Special attention is
focussed on the possibility of measuring the pion polarizability in such
reactions. We study the sensitivity to the structure of the underlying the
pion-Compton amplitude through a model with $\sigma$, $\rho$, and a_1
exchanges. It is found that the effective energy in the virtual pion-Compton
scattering is often so large that the threshold approximation does not apply.
