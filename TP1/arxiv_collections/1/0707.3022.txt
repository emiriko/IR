Using a combined quantum mechanical/classical method, we study the collisions
of small Na clusters on large Ar clusters as a model for cluster deposit. We
work out basic mechanisms by systematic variation of collision energy, system
sizes, and orientations. The soft Ar material is found to serve as an extremely
efficient shock absorber. The collisional energy is quickly transfered at first
impact and the Na clusters are always captured by the Ar surface. The
distribution of the collision energy into the Ar system proceeds very fast with
velocity of sound. The relaxation of shapes goes at a slower pace using times
of several ps. It produces a substantial rearrangement of the Ar system while
the Na cluster remains rather robust.
