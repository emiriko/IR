Heavy multi-quark potential in the SU(N) color group using hard-wall AdS/QCD
at both zero and finite temperature is studied. A Cornell-like potential is
obtained for baryons and other exotic configurations and compared with those in
the quenched lattice calculation in N=3 case. At the end we also discuss
possible improvements in the UV region of potential.
