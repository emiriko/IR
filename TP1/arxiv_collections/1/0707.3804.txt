The reduction of dynamical systems has a rich history, with many important
applications related to stability, control and verification. Reduction of
nonlinear systems is typically performed in an exact manner - as is the case
with mechanical systems with symmetry--which, unfortunately, limits the type of
systems to which it can be applied. The goal of this paper is to consider a
more general form of reduction, termed approximate reduction, in order to
extend the class of systems that can be reduced. Using notions related to
incremental stability, we give conditions on when a dynamical system can be
projected to a lower dimensional space while providing hard bounds on the
induced errors, i.e., when it is behaviorally similar to a dynamical system on
a lower dimensional space. These concepts are illustrated on a series of
examples.
