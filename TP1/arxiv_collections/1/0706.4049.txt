It is shown that only one vacuum state can be prepared with a finite amount
of energy and it appears, in particular, as a limit of physical states under
large timelike translations in any theory which satisfies a phase space
condition proposed in this work. This new criterion, related to the concept of
additivity of energy over isolated subsystems, is verified in massive free
field theory. The analysis entails very detailed results about the momentum
transfer of local operators in this model.
