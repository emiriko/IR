We use the T-matrix approximation to analyze the effect of a localized
impurity on the local density of states in mono- and bilayer graphene. For
monolayer graphene the Friedel oscillations generated by intranodal scattering
obey an inverse-square law, while the internodal ones obey an inverse law. In
the Fourier transform this translates into a filled circle of high intensity in
the center of the Brillouin zone, and empty circular contours around its
corners. For bilayer graphene both types of oscillations obey an inverse law.
