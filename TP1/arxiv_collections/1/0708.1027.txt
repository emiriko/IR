A recent angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) study by Douglas
et al. \cite {dessau-comment} on oxygen isotope exchanged
Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O$_{8+\delta}$ superconductors reported an absence of isotope
effect at optimal doping, questioning the previous work by us \cite
{gweon-nature}. Here, we report a new result that sheds light on this puzzling
discrepancy as well as the nature of the electron lattice interaction in the
cuprates: the anomalous isotope effect at optimal doping \cite {gweon-nature},
re-confirmed here, vanishes on a mere 2 % overdoping of holes. This result
implies a rapid change of the nature of the electron-lattice interaction near
optimal doping. We also find that the data by Douglas et al. \cite
{dessau-comment} are actually characteristic of significantly over-doped
samples, not of optimally doped samples as they claimed.
