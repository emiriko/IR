In this work we study a class of stochastic processes $\{X_t\}_{t\in\N}$,
where $X_t = (\phi \circ T_s^t)(X_0)$ is obtained from the iterations of the
transformation T_s, invariant for an ergodic probability \mu_s on [0,1] and a
continuous by part function $\phi:[0,1] \to \R$. We consider here $T_s:[0,1]\to
[0,1]$ the Manneville-Pomeau transformation. The autocorrelation function of
the resulting process decays hyperbolically (or polynomially) and we obtain
efficient methods to estimate the parameter s from a finite time series. As a
consequence we also estimate the rate of convergence of the autocorrelation
decay of these processes. We compare different estimation methods based on the
periodogram function, on the smoothed periodogram function, on the variance of
the partial sum and on the wavelet theory.
