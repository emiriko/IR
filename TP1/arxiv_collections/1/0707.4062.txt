The interplay between chaotic tunneling and dynamical localization in mixed
phase space is investigated. Semiclassical analysis using complex classical
orbits reveals that tunneling through torus regions and transport in chaotic
regions are not independent processes, rather they are strongly correlated and
described by complex orbits with both properties. This predicts a phenomenon
analogous to the quantum suppression of classical diffusion: chaotic tunneling
is suppressed as a result of dynamical localization in chaotic regions. This
hypothesis is confirmed by numerical experiments where the effect of
destructive interference is attenuated.
