This paper presents a molecular mechanics study for new nanorobotic
structures using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations coupled to virtual reality
(VR) techniques. The operator can design and characterize through molecular
dynamics simulation the behavior of bionanorobotic components and structures
through 3-D visualization. The main novelty of the proposed simulations is
based on the mechanical characterization of passive/active robotic devices
based on double stranded DNA molecules. Their use as new DNA-based nanojoint
and nanotweezer are simulated and results discussed.
