We have performed high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering studies on
three samples of hydrogenated tetrahydrofuran-water clathrates, containing
either H2 at different para/ortho concentrtion, or HD. By a refined analysis of
the data, we are able to assign the spectral bands to rotational and
center-of-mass translational transitions of either para- or ortho-H2. The H2
molecule rotates almost freely, while performing a translational motion
(rattling) in the nanometric-size cage, resulting a paradigmatic example of
quantum dynamics in a non-harmonic potential well. Both the H2 rotational
transition and the fundamental of the rattling transition split into triplets,
having different separation. The splitting is a consequence of a substantial
anisotropy of the environment with respect to the orientation of the molecule
in the cage, in the first case, or with respect to the center-of-mass position
inside the cage, in the second case. The values of the transition frequencies
and band intensities have been quantitatively related to the details of the
interaction potential between H2 and the water molecules, with a very good
agreement.
