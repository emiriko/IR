We investigate the effects to all orders in the Planck length, from a
generalized uncertainty principle, on the thermodynamic parameters of radiating
Schwarzschild black holes in a scenario with large extra dimesions. We show
that black holes in this framework are hotter, decay faster and are less
classical objects. Particularly, we show that the final stage of the radiation
process is a black hole remnant with zero entropy, zero heat capacity and non
zero finite temperature. We finally compare our results with the ones obtained
in the standard Hawking picture and with the generalized uncertainty principle
to leading order in the Planck length.
