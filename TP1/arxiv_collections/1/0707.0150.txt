The low-energy spin fluctuations in the electron-doped
Pr$_{1-x}$LaCe$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ have been investigated over a wide concentration
range of 0.07$\leqslant$ $x$ $\leqslant$0.18 that spans from the
antiferromagnetic and non-superconducting phase to the superconducting and
paramagnetic phase. For all concentrations considered, the low energy
excitations exhibit commensurate peaks centered at the ($\pi$, $\pi$) position.
Our data show that the characteristics of the excitations, such as the
relaxation rate and the overall spectral weight, change rapidly when the system
enters the superconducting phase. The spin stiffness also decreases with
increasing $x$ in the superconducting phase and is extrapolated to zero at $x$
= 0.21 when the superconductivity disappears. These indicate a close relation
between the spin fluctuations and the superconductivity in the electron-doped
system.
