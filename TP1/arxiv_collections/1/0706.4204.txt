The evolution of the low-energy electromagnetic dipole response with the
neutron excess is investigated along the Sn isotopic chain within an approach
incorporating Hartree-Fock-Bogoljubov (HFB) and multi-phonon
Quasiparticle-Phonon-Model (QPM) theory. General aspects of the relationship of
nuclear skins and dipole sum rules are discussed. Neutron and proton transition
densities serve to identify the Pygmy Dipole Resonance (PDR) as a generic mode
of excitation. The PDR is distinct from the GDR by its own characteristic
pattern given by a mixture of isoscalar and isovector components. Results for
the $^{100}$Sn-$^{132}$Sn isotopes and the several N=82 isotones are presented.
In the heavy Sn-isotopes the PDR excitations are closely related to the
thickness of the neutron skin. Approaching $^{100}$Sn a gradual change from a
neutron to a proton skin is found and the character of the PDR is changed
correspondingly. A delicate balance between Coulomb and strong interaction
effects is found. The fragmentation of the PDR strength in $^{124}$Sn is
investigated by multi-phonon calculations. Recent measurements of the dipole
response in $^{130,132}$Sn are well reproduced.
