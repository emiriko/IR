We consider Einstein's attitude with regard to religion both from
sociological and epistemological points of view. An attempt to put it into a
wider socio-historical perspective has been made, with the emphasis on his
ethnic and religious background. The great scientist was neither anatheist nor
a believer in the orthodox sense and the closest labels one might apply would
be pantheism/cosmism (ontological view) and agnosticism (epistemological view).
His ideas on the divine could be considered as a continuation of a line that
can be traced back to Philo of Alexandria, who himself followed the Greek
Stoics and Neoplatonists and especially Baruch Spinoza. Einstein's scientific
(or rational) and religious (or intuitive) thinking was deeply rooted in the
Hellenic culture.
