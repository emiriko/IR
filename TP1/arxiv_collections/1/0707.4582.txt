We study the effects of localization on the Hall transport in a granular
system at large tunneling conductance $g_{T}\gg 1$ corresponding to the
metallic regime. We show that the first-order in 1/g_T weak localization
correction to Hall resistivity of a two- or three-dimensional granular array
vanishes identically, $\de \rho_{xy}^{WL}=0$. This result is in agreement with
the one for ordinary disordered metals. Being due to an exact cancellation, our
result holds for arbitrary relevant values of temperature T and magnetic field
H, both in the ``homogeneous'' regime of very low T and H corresponding to
ordinary disordered metals and in the ``structure-dependent'' regime of higher
values of T or H.
