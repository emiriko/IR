Heterotic orbifold models are promising candidates for models with MSSM like
spectra. But orbifolds only correspond to a special place in moduli space, the
bigger picture is described by the moduli space of Calabi-Yau spaces. In this
talk we will make explicit connections between both points of view. To this end
we study blowups of orbifold singularities using both explicit constructions
and toric geometry techniques. We show that matching of all orbifold models in
blowups are possible.
