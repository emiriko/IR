We quantize odd dimensional anti-de Sitter spaces by applying the method of
deforming contact manifolds proposed by Rajeev. The construction in the present
paper consists of the identification of the odd dimensional anti-de Sitter
space as a hypersurface of contact type and the subsequent use of
'symplectization' principle. We also show that this construction generalizes to
any odd dimensional hypersurface which can be represented as a nonzero level
set of a homogenous function.
