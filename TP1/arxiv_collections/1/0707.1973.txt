The radiative and non-radiative decay rates of InAs quantum dots are measured
by controlling the local density of optical states near an interface. From
time-resolved measurements we extract the oscillator strength and the quantum
efficiency and their dependence on emission energy. From our results and a
theoretical model we determine the striking dependence of the overlap of the
electron and hole wavefunctions on the quantum dot size. We conclude that the
optical quality is best for large quantum dots, which is important in order to
optimally tailor quantum dot emitters for, e.g., quantum electrodynamics
experiments.
