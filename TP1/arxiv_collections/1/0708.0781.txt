We present a new type of modified Galerkin method. It is a construction with
several (inductively defined) levels, that provides approximate solutions of
increasing accuracy with every new level. These solutions are constructed as
approximations of the so called induced trajectories (notion on which the
definition of a class of approximate inertial manifolds used in the nonlinear
and postprocessed Galerkin methods is based).
