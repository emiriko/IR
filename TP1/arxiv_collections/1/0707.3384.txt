We propose an exact form of the fusion matrix of the Neveu-Schwarz blocks
that appear in a correlation function of four super-primary fields.
Orthogonality relation satisfied by this matrix is equivalent to the bootstrap
equation for the four-point super-primary correlator in the N=1 supersymmetric
Liouville theory.
