Quantum error correction (QEC) is an essential concept for any quantum
information processing device. Typically, QEC is designed with minimal
assumptions about the noise process; this generic assumption exacts a high cost
in efficiency and performance. In physical systems, errors are not likely to be
arbitrary; rather we will have reasonable models for the structure of quantum
decoherence. We may choose quantum error correcting codes and recovery
operations that specifically target the most likely errors.
  We present a convex optimization method to determine the optimal (in terms of
average entanglement fidelity) recovery operation for a given channel,
encoding, and information source. This is solvable via a semidefinite program
(SDP). We present computational algorithms to generate near-optimal recovery
operations structured to begin with a projective syndrome measurement. These
structured operations are more computationally scalable than the SDP required
for computing the optimal; we can thus numerically analyze longer codes. Using
Lagrange duality, we bound the performance of the structured recovery
operations and show that they are nearly optimal in many relevant cases.
  We present two classes of channel-adapted quantum error correcting codes
specifically designed for the amplitude damping channel. These have
significantly higher rates with shorter block lengths than corresponding
generic quantum error correcting codes. Both classes are stabilizer codes, and
have good fidelity performance with stabilizer recovery operations. The
encoding, syndrome measurement, and syndrome recovery operations can all be
implemented with Clifford group operations.
