We confront the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model with a variety of experimental
constraints as well as theoretical consistency conditions. The most
constraining data are the \bar B\to X_s\gamma decay rate (at low values of
M_{H^\pm}), and \Delta\rho (at both low and high M_{H^\pm}). We also take into
account the B\bar B oscillation rate and R_b, or the width \Gamma(Z\to b\bar b)
(both of which restrict the model at low values of \tan\beta), and the
B^-\to\tau\nu_\tau decay rate, which restricts the model at high \tan\beta and
low M_{H^\pm}. Furthermore, the LEP2 non-discovery of a light, neutral Higgs
boson is considered, as well as the muon anomalous magnetic moment. Since
perturbative unitarity excludes high values of \tan\beta, the model turns out
to be very constrained. We outline the remaining allowed regions in the
\tan\beta-M_{H^\pm} plane for different values of the masses of the two
lightest neutral Higgs bosons, and describe some of their properties.
