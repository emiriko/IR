In order to determine the chemical freeze-out parameters of the
hadron-emitting source in relativistic heavy ion collisions some studies in
literature perform fits by using as data input a subsample of ratios calculated
out of experimentally measured hadron yields instead of yields themselves. We
show that this is a statistically incorrect method fit, implying a bias in the
extracted parameters.
