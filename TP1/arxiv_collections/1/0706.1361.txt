We investigate the ten dimensional origin of six dimensional F_4 variant
supergravity with supersymmetric de Sitter background. We address first the
issue of spontaneous compactification, showing that it consists of a warped
compactification on a four sphere of a variant massive type IIA supergravity.
Moreover we illustrate how the known D4-D8 brane solution, whose near horizon
geometry yields AdS_6 x S^4, is accordingly modified to a system including
Euclidean branes. Finally, we discuss the relation between this latter solution
and the D4-D8 brane system, showing how it represents a generalisation of the
DW/Cosmology correspondence.
