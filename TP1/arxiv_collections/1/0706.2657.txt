Building on work by Florens and Georges, we formulate and study a
self-consistent slave rotor mean field theory for strongly correlated systems.
This approach views the electron, in the strong correlation regime, as a
composite of a neutral spinon and a charged rotor field. We solve the coupled
spinon-rotor model self-consistently using a cluster mean field theory for the
rotors and various ansatzes for the spinon ground state. We illustrate this
approach with a number of examples relevant to ongoing experiments in strongly
correlated electronic systems such as: (i) the phase diagram of the isotropic
triangular lattice organic Mott insulators, (ii) quasiparticle excitations and
tunneling asymmetry in the weakly doped cuprate superconductors, and (iii) the
cyclotron mass of carriers in commensurate spin-density wave and U(1) staggered
flux (or d-density wave) normal states of the underdoped cuprates. We compare
the estimated cyclotron mass with results from recent quantum oscillation
experiments on ortho-II YBCO by N. Doiron-Leyraud et al (Nature 447, 565
[2007]) which appear to find hole pockets in the magnetic field induced normal
state. We comment on the relation of this normal ground state to Fermi arcs
seen in photoemission experiments above Tc. This slave rotor mean field theory
can be generalized to study inhomogeneous states and strongly interacting
models relevant to ultracold atoms in optical lattices.
