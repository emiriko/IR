Spectrometry is a general physical-analysis approach for investigating
light-matter interactions. However, the complex designs of existing
spectrometers render them resistant to simplification and miniaturization, both
of which are vital for applications in micro- and nanotechnology and which are
now undergoing intensive research. Stationary-wave integrated Fourier-transform
spectrometry (SWIFTS)-an approach based on direct intensity detection of a
standing wave resulting from either reflection (as in the principle of colour
photography by Gabriel Lippmann) or counterpropagative interference
phenomenon-is expected to be able to overcome this drawback. Here, we present a
SWIFTS-based spectrometer relying on an original optical near-field detection
method in which optical nanoprobes are used to sample directly the evanescent
standing wave in the waveguide. Combined with integrated optics, we report a
way of reducing the volume of the spectrometer to a few hundreds of cubic
wavelengths. This is the first attempt, using SWIFTS, to produce a very small
integrated one-dimensional spectrometer suitable for applications where
microspectrometers are essential.
