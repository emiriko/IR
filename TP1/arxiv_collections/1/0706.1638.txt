We study a diffusive superconductor--ferromagnet--superconductor (SFS)
junction with in-plane ferromagnetic domains. Close to the superconducting
transition temperature, we describe the proximity effect in the junction with
the linearized Usadel equations. We find that properties of such a junction
depend on the size of the domains relative to the magnetic coherence length. In
the case of large domains, the junction exhibits transitions to the $\pi$
state, similarly to a single-domain SFS junction. In the case of small domains,
the magnetization effectively averages out, and the junction is always in the
zero state, similarly to a superconductor--normal metal--superconductor (SNS)
junction. In both those regimes, the influence of domain walls may be
approximately described as an effective spin-flip scattering. We also study the
inhomogeneous distribution of the local current density in the junction. Close
to the 0--$\pi$ transitions, the directions of the critical current may be
opposite in the vicinity of the domain wall and in the middle of the domains.
