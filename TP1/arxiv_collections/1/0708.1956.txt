A quantum superposition of two coherent states of light with small amplitude
can be obtained by subtracting a photon from a squeezed vacuum state. In
experiments this preparation can be made conditioned on the detection of a
photon in the field from a squeezed light source. We propose and analyze an
extended measurement strategy which allows generation of high fidelity coherent
state superpositions with larger amplitude.
