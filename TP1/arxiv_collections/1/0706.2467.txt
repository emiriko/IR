The transitions between neighbouring plateaux in the quantum Hall system are
observed to follow anti-holomophic scaling with superuniversal scaling
exponents, showing that the system contains an emergent sub-modular discrete
symmetry and a holomorphic structure at low energies. We identify a class of
effective scaling models consistent with this data, which is parametrized by
the complex structure of a torus with a special spin structure, in which only
the number of fermions (c) remains undetermined. For c = 2 this gives the
superuniversal anti-holomorphic scaling potential previously inferred from
data, with scaling exponent nu = 2.6, in reasonable agreement with available
scaling data.
