The models of the Internet reported in the literature are mainly aimed at
reproducing the scale-free structure, the high clustering coefficient and the
small world effects found in the real Internet, while other important
properties (e.g. related to centrality and hierarchical measurements) are not
considered. For a better characterization and modeling of such network, a
larger number of topological properties must be considered. In this work, we
present a sound multivariate statistical approach, including feature spaces and
multivariate statistical analysis (especially canonical projections), in order
to characterize several Internet models while considering a larger set of
relevant measurements. We apply such a methodology to determine, among nine
complex networks models, which are those most compatible with the real Internet
data (on the autonomous systems level) considering a set of 21 network
measurements. We conclude that none of the considered models can reproduce the
Internet topology with high accuracy.
