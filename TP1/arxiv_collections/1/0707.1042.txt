Some of the secret sharing schemes having unique quantum features like
parallelism and entanglement are supposed to be relatively secure. Different
schemes proposed by various researchers over the years have features which
could be specific to the nature and need of a situation. Following Hsu's
proposed scheme we propose a secret sharing scheme using Grover's search
algorithm for a four qubit system with several marked states. Further, the
scheme has been generalised to an n-qubit syatem.
