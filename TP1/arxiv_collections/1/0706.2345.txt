We consider the phenomenological consequences of a hidden Higgs sector
extending the Standard Model (SM), in which the matter content are uncharged
under the SM gauge groups. We consider a simple case where the hidden sector is
gauged under a U(1) with one Higgs singlet. The only couplings between SM and
the hidden sector are through mixings between the neutral gauge bosons of the
two respective sectors, and between the Higgs bosons. We find signals testable
at the LHC that can reveal the existence and shed light on the nature of such a
hidden sector.
