We study the branching ratios of the allowed and forbidden radiative
transitions among the first few (9) fine structure levels of O VI using
relativistic coupled cluster theory. We find irregular patterns for a number of
transitions with in $n$-complexes with $n\le4$. We have used the exisiting
values of the allowed electric dipole ($E1$) transition as a benchmark of our
theory. Good agreement with the existing values establish accuracies of not
only the theoretical method but the basis function as well. In general the
electric quadrupole ($E2$) transition probabilities are greater in magnitude
than magnetic dipole ($M1$) transition probabilities, whereas for medium atomic
transition frequencies they are of the same order of magnitude. On the other
hand if the transitions involved are between two fine structure components of
the same term, then the $M1$ transition probability is more probable than that
of $E2$. We have analyzed these trends with physical arguments and order of
magnitude estimations. The results presented here in tabular and graphical
forms are compared with the available theoretical and observed data. Graphical
analysis helps to understand the trends of electric and magnetic transitions
for the decay channels presented here. Our calculated values of the lifetimes
of the excited states are in very good agreement with the available results.
