The local minima (inherent structures) of a system and their associated
transition links give rise to a network. Here we consider the topological and
distance properties of such a network in the context of spin glasses. We use
steepest descent dynamics, determining for each disorder sample the transition
links appearing within a given barrier height. We find that differences between
linked inherent structures are typically associated with local clusters of
spins; we interpret this within a framework based on droplets in which the
characteristic ``length scale'' grows with the barrier height. We also consider
the network connectivity and the degrees of its nodes. Interestingly, for spin
glasses based on random graphs, the degree distribution of the network of
inherent structures exhibits a non-trivial scale-free tail.
