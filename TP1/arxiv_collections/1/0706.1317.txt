This paper proposes a novel learning method for a mixture of recurrent neural
network (RNN) experts model, which can acquire the ability to generate desired
sequences by dynamically switching between experts. Our method is based on
maximum likelihood estimation, using a gradient descent algorithm. This
approach is similar to that used in conventional methods; however, we modify
the likelihood function by adding a mechanism to alter the variance for each
expert. The proposed method is demonstrated to successfully learn Markov chain
switching among a set of 9 Lissajous curves, for which the conventional method
fails. The learning performance, analyzed in terms of the generalization
capability, of the proposed method is also shown to be superior to that of the
conventional method. With the addition of a gating network, the proposed method
is successfully applied to the learning of sensory-motor flows for a small
humanoid robot as a realistic problem of time series prediction and generation.
