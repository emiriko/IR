On the basis of a semi-phenomenological model, it is argued that the high
energy anomaly observed in recent photoemission experiments on cuprates is
caused by interaction with an overdamped bosonic mode in the mid-infrared
region of the spectrum. Analysis of optical conductivity allows to connect this
excitation to the incoherent charge response reported for the majority of high
Tc materials and some other perovskites. We show that its large damping is an
essential feature responsible for the "waterfall" dispersion and linewidth of
the spectral weight.
