We study factorization schemes for parton shower models in hadron-hadron
collisions. As an example, we calculate lepton pair production mediated by a
virtual photon in quark--anti-quark annihilation, and we compare factorized
cross sections obtained in the conventional $\bar{\rm MS}$ scheme with those
obtained in a factorization scheme in which a kinematical constraint due to
parton radiation is taken into account. We discuss some properties of
factorized cross sections.
