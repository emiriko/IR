We study the dynamics of denaturation bubbles in double-stranded DNA on the
basis of the Poland-Scheraga model. We show that long time distributions for
the survival of DNA bubbles and the size autocorrelation function can be
derived from an asymptotic weak noise approach. In particular, below the
melting temperature the bubble closure corresponds to a noisy finite time
singularity. We demonstrate that the associated Fokker-Planck equation is
equivalent to a quantum Coulomb problem. Below the melting temperature the
bubble lifetime is associated with the continuum of scattering states of the
repulsive Coulomb potential; at the melting temperature the Coulomb potential
vanishes and the underlying first exit dynamics exhibits a long time power law
tail; above the melting temperature, corresponding to an attractive Coulomb
potential, the long time dynamics is controlled by the lowest bound state.
Correlations and finite size effects are discussed.
