It is known that if one could clone an arbitrary quantum state one could send
signal faster than the speed of light. However it remains interesting to see
that if one can perfectly self replicate an arbitrary quantum state, does it
violate the no signalling principle? Here we see that perfect self replication
would also lead to superluminal signalling.
