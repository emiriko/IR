We address the mu problem of gauge mediation by considering a singlet chiral
superfield coupled to the Higgs and messenger fields. We compute the soft terms
generated below the messenger scale and study the phenomenological consequences
of the model. The experimental bound on the Higgs mass provides a severe
constraint that identifies three special regions of parameters where the mass
spectrum and the collider signatures can be distinct from ordinary gauge
mediation.
