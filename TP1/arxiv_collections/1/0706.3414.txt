We use optical tweezers to directly measure the intermolecular forces acting
on a single polymer imposed by surrounding entangled polymers (115 kbp DNA, 1
mg/ml). A tube-like confining field was measured in accord with the key
assumption of reptation models. A time-dependent harmonic potential opposed
transverse displacement, in accord with recent simulation findings. A tube
radius of 0.8 microns was determined, close to the predicted value (0.5
microns). Three relaxation modes (~0.4, 5 and 30 s) were measured following
transverse displacement, consistent with predicted relaxation mechanisms.
