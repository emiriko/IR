The "atomic saw method" uses the passage of dislocations in two-dimensional
(2D) quantum-well superlattices to create periodic slipping layers and
one-dimensional (1D) quantum wire superlattices. The effects of this space
structuring of the samples on the allowed energies are analysed in the case of
GaAs d-doped superlattices. If they are sufficiently large, the various
minigaps appearing in the 1D band structure could be responsible for the
presence of negative differential resistance (NDR) with high critical current
in these systems. The purpose is to determine the evolution of the minigaps in
terms of the sample parameters and to obtain the means to determine both the 2D
and 1D structural characteristics where NDR could appear.
