We report measurements of charmonia produced in two-photon collisions and
decaying to four-meson final states, where the meson is either a charged pion
or a charged kaon. The analysis is based on a 395fb^{-1} data sample
accumulated with the Belle detector at the KEKB electron-positron collider. We
observe signals for the three C-even charmonia eta_c(1S), chi_{c0}(1P) and
chi_{c2}(1P) in the pi^+pi^-pi^+pi^-, K^+K^-pi^+pi^- and K^+K^-K^+K^- decay
modes. No clear signals for eta_c(2S) production are found in these decay
modes. We have also studied resonant structures in charmonium decays to
two-body intermediate meson resonances. We report the products of the
two-photon decay width and the branching fractions, Gamma_{gamma gamma}B, for
each of the charmonium decay modes.
