The existence of an exactly scale invariant sector possessing a non-trivial
infrared fixed point at a higher energy scale and its possible communication
with the Standard Model particles through a heavy messenger sector has been
shown to lead to curious unparticle effects. We demonstrate that top physics at
the Tevatron can already constrain such theories. We also consider possible
improvements at the LHC and delineate some striking signatures.
