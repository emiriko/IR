The calculational precision of $\ee\to\tautau$ and $\ee\to\mumu$ production
cross-sections in electron-positron annihilations at \roots = 10.58 \gev are
studied for the \kk Monte Carlo simulation program. We determine
$\sigma(\ee\to\tautau) = (0.919 \pm 0.003) \nb$ and $\sigma(\ee\to\mumu) =
(1.147 \pm 0.005) \nb$, where the error represents the precision of the
calculation.
