We derive the power of direct radiation into free space induced by Josephson
oscillations in intrinsic Josephson junctions of highly anisotropic layered
superconductors. We consider the super-radiation regime for a crystal cut in
the form of a thin slice parallel to the c-axis. We find that the radiation
correction to the current-voltage characteristic in this regime depends only on
crystal shape. We show that at large enough number of junctions oscillations
are synchronized providing high radiation power and efficiency in the THz
frequency range. We discuss crystal parameters and bias current optimal for
radiation power and crystal cooling.
