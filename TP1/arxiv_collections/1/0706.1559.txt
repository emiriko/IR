We propose a two-dimensional time-reversal invariant system of essentially
non-interacting electrons on a square lattice that exhibits configurations with
fractional charges e/2. These are vortex-like topological defects in the
dimerization order parameter describing spatial modulation in the electron
hopping amplitudes. Charge fractionalization is established by a simple
counting argument, analytical calculation within the effective low-energy
theory, and by an exact numerical diagonalization of the lattice Hamiltonian.
We comment on the exchange statistics of fractional charges and possible
realizations of the system.
