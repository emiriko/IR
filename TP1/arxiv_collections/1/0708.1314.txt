The enhanced light transmission through an array of subwavelength holes
surrounded by Bragg mirrors is studied, showing that the mirrors act to confine
the surface plasmons associated with the Extraordinary Optical Transmission
effect, forming a surface resonant cavity. The overall effect is increased
light transmission intensity by more than a factor of three beyond the already
enhanced transmission, independent of whether the Bragg mirrors are on the
input or the output side of the incident light. The geometry of the Bragg
mirror structures controls the enhancement, and can even reduce the
transmission in half. By varying these geometric parameters, we were able to
periodically modulate the transmission of light for specific wavelengths,
consistent with the propagation and interference of surface plasmon waves in a
resonant cavity. FDTD simulations and a wave propagation model verify this
effect.
