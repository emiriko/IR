Currently, educational platforms propose many tools of communication,
production, labour division or collective work management in order to support
collective activities. But it is not guaranteed that actors (instructional
designers, tutors or learner) are really using them. Our work, describe
characteristics of instrumented learning situations (ICLS) in the higher
education. Our intention is to determine: if ICLS are really existing; which
form they take (in terms of scenario, tools, type of activity...) ; if
recommendations resulting from research tasks are taken into account by
instructional designers and if the instructional designer prescribed activities
are really follow by learners or tutors? To answer these questions, we have
made a survey about ICLS actors uses.
