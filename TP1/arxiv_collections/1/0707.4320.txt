A tropical version of Nevanlinna theory is described in which the role of
meromorphic functions is played by continuous piecewise linear functions of a
real variable whose one-sided derivatives are integers at every point. These
functions are naturally defined on the max-plus (or tropical) semi-ring.
Analogues of the Nevanlinna characteristic, proximity and counting functions
are defined and versions of Nevanlinna's first main theorem, the lemma on the
logarithmic derivative and Clunie's lemma are proved.
  As well as providing another example of a tropical or dequantized analogue of
an important area of complex analysis, this theory has applications to
so-called ultra-discrete equations. Preliminary results are presented
suggesting that the existence of finite-order max-plus meromorphic solutions
can be considered to be an ultra-discrete analogue of the Painlev'e property.
