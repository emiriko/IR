I show how to protect adiabatic quantum computation (AQC) against decoherence
and certain control errors, using a hybrid methodology involving dynamical
decoupling, subsystem and stabilizer codes, and energy gaps. Corresponding
error bounds are derived. As an example I show how to perform
decoherence-protected AQC against local noise using at most two-body
interactions.
