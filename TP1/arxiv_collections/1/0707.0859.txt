Using arguments based on sum rules, we derive a general result for the
average shifts of rf lines in Fermi gases in terms of interatomic interaction
strengths and two-particle correlation functions. We show that near an
interaction resonance shifts vary inversely with the atomic scattering length,
rather than linearly as in dilute gases, thus accounting for the experimental
observation that clock shifts remain finite at Feshbach resonances.
