Different techniques of Glow Discharge AES are described in this paper. The
most important parameters at such investigations are: the power of VHF-field,
pressure of the inert gas and concentration of the easily ionizable additive,
e.g. NaCl. The influences of these parameters were studied It is proposed a
high sensitive flash desorption method, which enables investigation of the
water desorption rate from humidified samples of biological origin, namely DNA
and chromatin. The ways of minimizing of detection limit are considered as the
most important characteristics of an analytical device. The concentration of
any measured element is detectable if it correlates to the signal equal to
tripled standard deviation of the results of background measurement. Electron
temperature of the Helium has been evaluated by absorption rate at two lines of
helium \lambda=353.828nm; \lambda'=344.759nm that was equal to T_c ~ 15000 K.
