A statistical mechanical framework to analyze linear vector channel models in
digital wireless communication is proposed for a large system. The framework is
a generalization of that proposed for code-division multiple-access systems in
Europhys. Lett. 76 (2006) 1193 and enables the analysis of the system in which
the elements of the channel transfer matrix are statistically correlated with
each other. The significance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by
assessing the performance of an existing model of multi-input multi-output
communication systems.
