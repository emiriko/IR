We report the results of inelastic neutron scattering experiments on
NpCoGa$_{5}$, an isostructural analogue of the PuCoGa$_{5}$ superconductor. Two
energy scales characterize the magnetic response in the antiferromagnetic
phase. One is related to a non-dispersive excitation between two crystal field
levels. The other at lower energies corresponds to dispersive fluctuations
emanating from the magnetic zone center. The fluctuations persist in the
paramagnetic phase also, although weaker in intensity. This supports the
possibility that magnetic fluctuations are present in PuCoGa$_{5}$, where
unconventional d-wave superconductivity is achieved in the absence of magnetic
order.
