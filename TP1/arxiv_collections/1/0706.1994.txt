In this note, we will discuss how to compactly express and prove the
Jarzynski identity for an open quantum system with dissipative dynamics. We
will avoid explicitly measuring the work directly, which is tantamount to
continuously monitoring the system, and instead measure the heat flow from the
environment. We represent the measurement of heat flow with Hermitian map
superoperators that act on the system density matrix. Hermitian maps provide a
convenient and compact representation of sequential measurement and correlation
functions.
