The rules governing cell division and differentiation are central to
understanding the mechanisms of development, aging and cancer. By utilising
inducible genetic labelling, recent studies have shown that the clonal
population in transgenic mouse epidermis can be tracked in vivo. Drawing on
these results, we explain how clonal fate data may be used to infer the rules
of cell division and differentiation underlying the maintenance of adult murine
tail-skin. We show that the rates of cell division and differentiation may be
evaluated by considering the long-time and short-time clone fate data, and that
the data is consistent with cells dividing independently rather than
synchronously. Motivated by these findings, we consider a mechanism for cancer
onset based closely on the model for normal adult skin. By analysing the
expected changes to clonal fate in cancer emerging from a simple two-stage
mutation, we propose that clonal fate data may provide a novel method for
studying the earliest stages of the disease.
