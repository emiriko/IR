Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common adult motor neuron
disease, causing motor neuron degeneration, muscle atrophy, paralysis, and
death. Despite this degenerative process, a stable hypermetabolic state has
been observed in a large subset of patients. Mice expressing a mutant form of
Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (mSOD1 mice) constitute an animal model of ALS that,
like patients, exhibits unexpectedly increased energy expenditure.
Counterbalancing for this increase with a high-fat diet extends lifespan and
prevents motor neuron loss. Here, we investigated whether lipid metabolism is
defective in this animal model. Hepatic lipid metabolism was roughly normal,
whereas gastrointestinal absorption of lipids as well as peripheral clearance
of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins were markedly increased, leading to decreased
postprandial lipidemia. This defect was corrected by the high-fat regimen that
typically induces neuroprotection in these animals. Together, our findings show
that energy metabolism in mSOD1 mice shifts toward an increase in the
peripheral use of lipids. This metabolic shift probably accounts for the
protective effect of dietary lipids in this model.
