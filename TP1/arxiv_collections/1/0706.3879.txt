We suggest a new method for quantum optical control with nanoscale
resolution. Our method allows for coherent far-field manipulation of individual
quantum systems with spatial selectivity that is not limited by the wavelength
of radiation and can, in principle, approach a few nanometers. The selectivity
is enabled by the nonlinear atomic response, under the conditions of
Electromagnetically Induced Transparency, to a control beam with intensity
vanishing at a certain location. Practical performance of this technique and
its potential applications to quantum information science with cold atoms,
ions, and solid-state qubits are discussed.
