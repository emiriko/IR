We report a thorough characterization of the glassy dynamics of benzophenone
by broadband dielectric spectroscopy. We detect a well pronounced beta
relaxation peak developing into an excess wing with increasing temperature. A
previous analysis of results from Optical-Kerr-effect measurements on this
material within the mode coupling theory revealed a high-frequency Cole-Cole
peak. We address the question if this phenomenon also may explain the
Johari-Goldstein beta relaxation, a so far unexplained spectral feature
inherent to glass-forming matter, mainly observed in dielectric spectra. Our
results demonstrate that according to the present status of theory, both
spectral features seem not to be directly related.
