Based only on the parallel transport condition, we present a general method
to compute Abelian or non-Abelian geometric phases acquired by the basis states
of pure or mixed density operators, which also holds for nonadiabatic and
noncyclic evolution. Two interesting features of the non-Abelian geometric
phase obtained by our method stand out: i) it is a generalization of Wilczek
and Zee's non-Abelian holonomy, in that it describes nonadiabatic evolution
where the basis states are parallelly transported between distinct degenerate
subspaces, and ii) the non-Abelian character of our geometric phase relies on
the transitional evolution of the basis states, even in the nondegenerate case.
We apply our formalism to a two-level system evolving nonadiabatically under
spontaneous decay to emphasize the non-Abelian nature of the geometric phase
induced by the reservoir. We also show, through the generalized invariant
theory, that our general approach encompasses previous results in the
literature.
