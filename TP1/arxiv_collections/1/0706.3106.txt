We report on a method to tune the orientation of in-plane magnetic domains
and domain walls in thin ferromagnetic strips by manipulating the magnetic
anisotropy. Uniaxial in-plane anisotropy is induced in a controlled way by
oblique evaporation of magnetic thin strips. A direct correlation between the
magnetization direction and the domain wall orientation is found experimentally
and confirmed by micromagnetic simulations. The domain walls in the strips are
always oriented along the oblique evaporation-induced easy axis, in spite of
the shape anisotropy. The controlled manipulation of domain wall orientations
could open new possibilities for novel devices based on domain-wall
propagation.
