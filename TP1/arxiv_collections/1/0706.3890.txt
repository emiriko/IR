We study the Hawking thermal spectrum in dragging coordinate system and the
tunneling radiation characteristics of hot NUT-Kerr-Newman-Kasuya spacetime.
The tunneling rates at the event and cosmological horizon are found to be
related to the change of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. The radiation spectrum is
not pure thermal and thus there is a correction to the Hawking thermal
spectrum.
