We analyze the exclusive charmonium $J/\psi+\eta_c$ pair production in
$e^+e^-$ annihilation using the nonfactorized perturbative QCD and the
light-front quark model(LFQM) that goes beyond the peaking approximation. We
effectively include all orders of higher twist terms in the leading order of
QCD coupling constant and compare our nonfactorized analysis with the usual
factorized analysis in the calculation of the cross section. We also calculate
the quark distribution amplitudes, the Gegenbauer moments, and the decay
constants for $J/\psi$ and $\eta_c$ mesons using our LFQM. Our nonfactorized
result enhances the NRQCD result by a factor of $3\sim4$ at $\sqrt{s}=10.6$
GeV.
