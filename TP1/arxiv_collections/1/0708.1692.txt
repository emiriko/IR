Confined electron spins are preferred candidates for embodying quantum
information in the solid state. A popular idea is the use of optical excitation
to achieve the ``best of both worlds'', i.e. marrying the long spin decoherence
times with rapid gating. Here we study an all-optical adiabatic approach to
generating single qubit phase gates. We find that such a gate can be extremely
robust against the combined effect of all principal sources of decoherence,
with an achievable fidelity of 0.999 even at finite temperature. Crucially this
performance can be obtained with only a small time cost: the adiabatic gate
duration is within about an order of magnitude of a simple dynamic
implementation. An experimental verification of these predictions is
immediately feasible with only modest resources.
