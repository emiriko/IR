Based on a microscopic many-particle theory we study the amplification of
polaritons in a multiple-quantum-well resonant photonic crystal. For the
Bragg-spaced multiple quantum wells under investigation we predict that in a
typical pump-probe setup four-wave mixing processes can lead to an unstable
energy transfer from the pump into the probe and the background-free four-wave
mixing directions. We find that under certain excitation conditions this
phase-conjugate oscillation induced instability can lead to a large
amplification of the weak probe pulse.
