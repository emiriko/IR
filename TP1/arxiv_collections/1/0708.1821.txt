The focus in this paper is an analysis of existing state of the arts directed
toward the development of the next generation of vibration damping systems. The
research work concentrates on an investigation related to
nanoparticles/fibres/tubes-reinforced materials and coatings dynamic
characterization and modeling of the fundamental phenomena that control
relationships between structure and damping/mechanical properties of the
materials. We simulated composite materials using finite element and mesh free
methods, using a hollow shell representation of the individual nanotube/fiber.
Results of the research work will provide a platform for the development of
nanoparticle-reinforced damping materials that are light-weight, vibration and
shock resistant. The outcome of the research work is expected to have
wide-ranging technical benefits with direct relevance to industry in areas of
transportation (aerospace, automotive, rail), electronics and civil
infrastructure development.
