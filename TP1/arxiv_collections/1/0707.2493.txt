We study the triple differential distribution of B-> Xu l nu, consistently
including all perturbative and non-perturbative effects through O(alphas^2
beta_0) and O(1/mb^3). The Fermi motion is parameterized in terms of a single
light-cone function for each structure function and for any value of q^2,
accounting for all subleading effects. We discuss the problems and
uncertainties related to the high-q^2 tail and to Weak Annihilation effects. We
work in the kinetic scheme, a framework characterized by a Wilsonian treatment
with a hard cutoff mu ~ 1GeV. Our method is illustrated with the extraction of
|V_ub| from some of the latest experimental data, providing a detailed estimate
of the theoretical uncertainty.
