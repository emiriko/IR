The dominant MSSM effects in the rare K decays, K+ --> pi+ nu nu bar, KL -->
pi0 nu nu bar, KL --> pi0 e+ e- and KL --> pi0 mu+ mu-, are discussed both
within and without the minimal flavor violation hypothesis, at moderate and
large tangent beta. In each case, the sensitivities to MSSM soft-breaking terms
are compared, laying emphasis on possible correlations among observables. In
most scenarios, rare K decays offer unique windows into the Delta S=1 sector of
the soft-breaking terms. Therefore, together with B-physics and collider
observables, these modes will be essential for reconstructing the still elusive
SUSY-breaking mechanism.
