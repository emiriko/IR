We present a new statistical method to optimally link local weather extremes
to large-scale atmospheric circulation structures. The method is illustrated
using July-August daily mean temperature at 2m height (T2m) time-series over
the Netherlands and 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500) time-series over the
Euroatlantic region of the ECMWF reanalysis dataset (ERA40). The method
identifies patterns in the Z500 time-series that optimally describe, in a
precise mathematical sense, the relationship with local warm extremes in the
Netherlands. Two patterns are identified; the most important one corresponds to
a blocking high pressure system leading to subsidence and calm, dry and sunny
conditions over the Netherlands. The second one corresponds to a rare, easterly
flow regime bringing warm, dry air into the region. The patterns are robust;
they are also identified in shorter subsamples of the total dataset. The method
is generally applicable and might prove useful in evaluating the performance of
climate models in simulating local weather extremes.
