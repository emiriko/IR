Consider the single server queue with an infinite buffer and a FIFO
discipline, either of type M/M/1 or Geom/Geom/1. Denote by A the arrival
process and by s the services. Assume the stability condition to be satisfied.
Denote by D the departure process in equilibrium and by r the time spent by the
customers at the very back of the queue. We prove that (D,r) has the same law
as (A,s) which is an extension of the classical Burke Theorem. In fact, r can
be viewed as the departures from a dual storage model. This duality between the
two models also appears when studying the transient behavior of a tandem by
means of the RSK algorithm: the first and last row of the resulting
semi-standard Young tableau are respectively the last instant of departure in
the queue and the total number of departures in the store.
