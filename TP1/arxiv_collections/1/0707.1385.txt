Beam asymmetry and differential cross section for the reaction gamma+p->eta+p
were measured from production threshold to 1500 MeV photon laboratory energy.
The two dominant neutral decay modes of the eta meson, eta->2g and eta->3pi0,
were analyzed. The full set of measurements is in good agreement with
previously published results. Our data were compared with three models. They
all fit satisfactorily the results but their respective resonance contributions
are quite different. The possible photoexcitation of a narrow state N(1670) was
investigated and no evidence was found.
