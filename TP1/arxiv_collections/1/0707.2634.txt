The temperature dependence of static dielectric susceptibility of a system
with strongly coupled fluctuating dipoles is calculated within a self
consistent mean fluctuation field approximation. Results are qualitatively in
good agreement with, a quantum paraelectric, SrTiO$_3$ in the low temperature
regime. We identify this system as a {\it gaped quantum paraelectric} and
suggest a possible experimental realization of a {\it quantum critical
paraelectric} through the application of hydrostatic pressure or doping by
impurity.
