We derive forward inclusive dijet production in the scattering of a dilute
hadron off an arbitrary dense target, whose partons with small fraction of
momentum x are described by a Color Glass Condensate. Both multiple scattering
and non-linear QCD evolution at small-x are included. This is of relevance for
measurements of two-particle correlations in the proton direction of
proton-nucleus collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. The azimuthal angle
distribution is peaked back to back and broadens as the momenta of the measured
particles gets closer to the saturation scale.
