The undoing of quantum measurements is discussed in the broader context of
irreversibility in physics. We give explicit examples of how a wavefunction can
be uncollapsed in two solid-state experimental set-ups. Wavefunction uncollapse
shows the quantum observer paradox in a new and significantly clearer way.
