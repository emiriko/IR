We investigate the effects of two dimensional confinement on the lasing
properties of a classical random laser system operating in the incoherent
feedback (diffusive) regime. A suspension of 250nm rutile (TiO2) particles in a
Rhodamine 6G solution was inserted into the hollow core of a photonic crystal
fiber (PCF) generating the first random fiber laser and a novel
quasi-one-dimensional RL geometry. Comparison with similar systems in bulk
format shows that the random fiber laser presents an efficiency that is at
least two orders of magnitude higher.
