We examine canonical quantization of relativistic field theories on the
forward hyperboloid, a Lorentz-invariant surface of the form $x_\mu x^\mu =
\tau^2$. This choice of quantization surface implies that all components of the
4-momentum operator are affected by interactions (if present), whereas rotation
and boost generators remain interaction free -- a feature characteristic of
Dirac's `` point-form\rq\rq of relativistic dynamics. Unlike previous attempts
to quantize fields on space-time hyperboloids, we keep the usual plane-wave
expansion of the field operators and consider evolution of the system generated
by the 4-momentum operator. We verify that the Fock-space representations of
the Poincar\'e generators for free scalar and spin-1/2 fields look the same as
for equal-time quantization. Scattering is formulated for interacting fields in
a covariant interaction picture and it is shown that the familiar perturbative
expansion of the S-operator is recovered by our approach. An appendix analyzes
special distributions, integrals over the forward hyperboloid, that are used
repeatedly in the paper.
