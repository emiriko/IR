The system-size dependence of particle production in heavy-ion collisions at
the top SPS energy is analyzed in terms of the statistical model. A systematic
comparison is made of two suppression mechanisms that quantify strange particle
yields in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions: the canonical model with
strangeness correlation radius determined from the data and the model
formulated in the canonical ensemble using chemical off-equilibrium strangeness
suppression factor. The system-size dependence of the correlation radius and
the thermal parameters are obtained for p-p, C-C, Si-Si and Pb-Pb collisions at
sqrt(s_NN) = 17.3 AGeV. It is shown that on the basis of a consistent set of
data there is no clear difference between the two suppression patterns. In the
present study the strangeness correlation radius was found to exhibit a rather
weak dependence on the system size.
