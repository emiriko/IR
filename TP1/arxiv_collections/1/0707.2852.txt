We discuss the processes underlying the excitation of fishbone-like internal
kink instabilities driven by supra-thermal electrons generated experimentally
by different means: Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ECRH) and by Lower
Hybrid (LH) power injection. The peculiarity and interest of exciting these
electron fishbones by ECRH only or by LH only is also analyzed. Not only the
mode stability is explained, but also the transition between steady state
nonlinear oscillations to bursting (almost regular) pulsations, as observed in
FTU, is interpreted in terms of the LH power input. These results are directly
relevant to the investigation of trapped alpha particle interactions with
low-frequency MHD modes in burning plasmas: in fact, alpha particles in reactor
relevant conditions are characterized by small dimensionless orbits, similarly
to electrons; the trapped particle bounce averaged dynamics, meanwhile, depends
on energy and not mass.
