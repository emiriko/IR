Passive scalar turbulence forced steadily is characterized by the velocity
correlation scale, $L$, injection scale, $l$, and diffusive scale, $r_d$. The
scales are well separated if the diffusivity is small, $r_d\ll l,L$, and one
normally says that effects of diffusion are confined to smaller scales, $r\ll
r_d$. However, if the velocity is single scale one finds that a weak dependence
of the scalar correlations on the molecular diffusivity persists to even larger
scales, e.g. $l\gg r\gg r_d$ \cite{95BCKL}. We consider the case of $L\gg l$
and report a counter-intuitive result -- the emergence of a new range of large
scales, $L\gg r\gg l^2/r_d$, where the diffusivity shows a strong effect on
scalar correlations.
