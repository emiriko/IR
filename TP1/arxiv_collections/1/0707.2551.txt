Biochemistry and mechanics are closely coupled in cell adhesion. At sites of
cell-matrix adhesion, mechanical force triggers signaling through the
Rho-pathway, which leads to structural reinforcement and increased
contractility in the actin cytoskeleton. The resulting force acts back to the
sites of adhesion, resulting in a positive feedback loop for mature adhesion.
Here we model this biochemical-mechanical feedback loop for the special case
when the actin cytoskeleton is organized in stress fibers, which are
contractile bundles of actin filaments. Activation of myosin II molecular
motors through the Rho-pathway is described by a system of reaction-diffusion
equations, which are coupled into a viscoelastic model for a contractile actin
bundle. We find strong spatial gradients in the activation of contractility and
in the corresponding deformation pattern of the stress fiber, in good agreement
with experimental findings.
