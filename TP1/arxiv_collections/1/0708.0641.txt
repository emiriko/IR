We examine the relation between amplitudes measured in exclusive
lepto-production and the quark content of the nucleon. We show that in the
limit of high energy and small t, the natural interpretation of amplitudes
measured in these hard exclusive processes is in terms of the quark content of
the meson cloud and not the target itself. In this regime, Regge amplitudes
will make a significant contribution to these exclusive amplitudes. This leads
to violation of QCD scaling.
