Based on a microscopic many-particle theory we investigate the influence of
excitonic correlations on the vectorial polarization state characteristics of
the parametric amplification of polaritons in semiconductor microcavities. We
study a microcavity with perfect in-plane isotropy. A linear stability analysis
of the cavity polariton dynamics shows that in the co-linear (TE-TE or TM-TM)
pump-probe polarization state configuration, excitonic correlations diminish
the parametric scattering process whereas it is enhanced by excitonic
correlations in the cross-linear (TE-TM or TM-TE) configuration. Without any
free parameters, our microscopic theory gives a quantitative understanding how
many-particle effects can lead to a rotation or change of the outgoing
(amplified) probe signal's vectorial polarization state relative to the
incoming one's.
