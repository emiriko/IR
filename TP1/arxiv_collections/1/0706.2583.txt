We investigate the dynamical evolution of a Na$_8$ cluster embedded in Ar
matrices of various sizes from N=30 to 1048. The system is excited by an
intense short laser pulse leading to high ionization stages. We analyze the
subsequent highly non-linear motion of cluster and Ar environment in terms of
trajectories, shapes, and energy flow. The most prominent effects are:
temporary stabilization of high charge states for several ps, sudden stopping
of the Coulomb explosion of the embedded Na$_8$ clusters associated with an
extremely fast energy transfer to the Ar matrix, fast distribution of energy
throughout the Ar layers by a sound wave. Other ionic-atomic transfer and
relaxation processes proceed at slower scale of few ps. The electron cloud is
almost thermally decoupled from ions and thermalizes far beyond the ps scale.
