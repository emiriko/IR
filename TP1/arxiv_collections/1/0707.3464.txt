This paper studies the mutation-selection balance in three simplified
replication models. The first model considers a population of organisms
replicating via the production of asexual spores. The second model considers a
sexually replicating population that produces identical gametes. The third
model considers a sexually replicating population that produces distinct sperm
and egg gametes. All models assume diploid organisms whose genomes consist of
two chromosomes, each of which is taken to be functional if equal to some
master sequence, and defective otherwise. In the asexual population, the
asexual diploid spores develop directly into adult organisms. In the sexual
populations, the haploid gametes enter a haploid pool, where they may fuse with
other haploids. The resulting immature diploid organisms then proceed to
develop into mature organisms. Based on an analysis of all three models, we
find that, as organism size increases, a sexually replicating population can
only outcompete an asexually replicating population if the adult organisms
produce distinct sperm and egg gametes. A sexual replication strategy that is
based on the production of large numbers of sperm cells to fertilize a small
number of eggs is found to be necessary in order to maintain a sufficiently low
cost for sex for the strategy to be selected for over a purely asexual
strategy. We discuss the usefulness of this model in understanding the
evolution and maintenance of sexual replication as the preferred replication
strategy in complex, multicellular organisms.
