The spatial charge arrangement of a typical quasi-two-dimensional organic
conductor alpha-(BEDT-TTF)2I3 is revealed by single crystal structure analysis
using synchrotron radiation. The results show that the horizontal stripe type
structure, which was suggested by mean field theory, is established. We also
find the charge disproportion above the metal-insulator transition temperature
and a significant change in transfer integrals caused by the phase transition.
Our result elucidates the insulating phase of this material as a 2k_F charge
density localization.
