In this paper we present a far-reaching generalization of E. Vessiot's
analysis of the Darboux integrable partial differential equations in one
dependent and two independent variables. Our approach provides new insights
into this classical method, uncovers the fundamental geometric invariants of
Darboux integrable systems, and provides for systematic, algorithmic
integration of such systems. This work is formulated within the general
framework of Pfaffian exterior differential systems and, as such, has
applications well beyond those currently found in the literature. In
particular, our integration method is applicable to systems of hyperbolic PDE
such as the Toda lattice equations, 2 dimensional wave maps and systems of
overdetermined PDE.
