We perform drainage experiments of a linear alkane fluid (n-hexadecane) down
to molecular thicknesses, and focus on the role played by the confinement rate.
We show that molecular layering is strongly influenced by the velocity at which
the confining walls are approached: under high enough shear rates, the confined
medium behaves as a structureless liquid of enhanced viscosity for film
thickness below $\sim$10 nm. Our results also lead us to conclude that a
rapidly confined film can be quenched in a metastable disordered state, which
might be related with recent intriguing results on the shear properties of
confined films produced at different rates [Zhu and Granick, Phys. Rev. Lett.
