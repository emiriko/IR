Some components of the graviton two-point function have been recently
computed in the context of loop quantum gravity, using the spinfoam
Barrett-Crane vertex. We complete the calculation of the remaining components.
We find that, under our assumptions, the Barrett-Crane vertex does not yield
the correct long distance limit. We argue that the problem is general and can
be traced to the intertwiner-independence of the Barrett-Crane vertex, and
therefore to the well-known mismatch between the Barrett-Crane formalism and
the standard canonical spin networks. In a companion paper we illustrate the
asymptotic behavior of a vertex amplitude that can correct this difficulty.
