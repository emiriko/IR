We update our former analysis of the Nuclear Modification Factors (NMF) for
different hadron species at RHIC and LHC. This update is motivated by the new
experimental data from STAR which presents differences with the preliminary
data used to fix some of the parameters in our model. The main change is the
use of AKK fragmentation functions for the hard part of the spectrum and minor
adjustments of the coalescence (soft) contribution. We confirm that observation
of the NMF for the f_0 meson can shed light on its quark composition.
