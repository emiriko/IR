We present an Adaptively Biased Molecular Dynamics (ABMD) method for the
computation of the free energy surface of a reaction coordinate using
non-equilibrium dynamics. The ABMD method belongs to the general category of
umbrella sampling methods with an evolving biasing potential, and is inspired
by the metadynamics method. The ABMD method has several useful features,
including a small number of control parameters, and an $O(t)$ numerical cost
with molecular dynamics time $t$. The ABMD method naturally allows for
extensions based on multiple walkers and replica exchange, where different
replicas can have different temperatures and/or collective variables. This is
beneficial not only in terms of the speed and accuracy of a calculation, but
also in terms of the amount of useful information that may be obtained from a
given simulation. The workings of the ABMD method are illustrated via a study
of the folding of the Ace-GGPGGG-Nme peptide in a gaseous and solvated
environment.
