A weak quantum mechanical coupling is constructed permitting superluminal
communication within a preferred region of a gravitating AdS_5 spacetime. This
is achieved by adding a spatially non-local perturbation of a special kind to
the Hamiltonian of a four-dimensional conformal field theory with a
weakly-coupled AdS dual, such as maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. In
particular, two issues are given careful treatment: (1) the UV-completeness of
our deformed CFT, guaranteeing the existence of a ``deformed string theory''
AdS dual, and (2) the demonstration that superluminal effects can take place in
AdS, both on its boundary as well as in the bulk. Exotic Lorentz-violating
properties such as these may have implications for tests of General Relativity,
addressing the cosmological constant problem, or probing "behind'' horizons.
Our construction may give insight into the interpretation of wormhole solutions
in Euclidean AdS gravity.
