We first report a novel phenomenon that manifests itself in a colossal
difference in soft x-ray reflectivity from ferromagnetic transition-metal films
between the left- and right-handed circular polarization (LCP and RCP) modes at
a resonance near normal Brewster's angle. Theoretical and numerical studies of
sft x-ray resonant magnetic scattering using the circular-polarization-mode
basis reveal that this effect arises from a totally destructive interference of
photons scattered individually from chargem orbital, and spin degrees of
freedom in magnetized thin films that selectively occurs only for one helicity
of the opposite circular modes when the required criteria are fulfilled. Across
the normal Brewster's angle. the polarization state of scattered soft x-ray is
continuously variable from the RCP to the LCP mode (or vice versa) through the
linear s polarization mode by changing the incidence angle of linear
p-polarized x rays at the resonance.
