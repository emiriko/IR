Photoassociation of a pair of cooled atoms by excitation with a short chirped
laser pulse creates a dynamical hole in the initial continuum wavefunction.
This hole is manifested by a void in the pair wavefunction and a momentum kick.
Photoassociation into loosely bound levels of the external well in Cs_2
0$_g^-$(6S + 6P$_{3/2}$ is considered as a case study. After the pulse, the
free evolution of the ground triplet state wavepacket is analyzed. Due to a
negative momentum kick, motion to small distances is manifested and a
compression effect is pointed out, markedly increasing the density of atom
pairs at short distance. A consequence of the hole is the redistribution of the
vibrational population in the ground triplet state, with population of the last
bound level and creation of pairs of hot atoms. The physical interpretation
makes use of the time dependence of the probability current and population on
each channel to understand the role of the parameters of the photoassociation
pulse. By varying such parameters, optimization of the compression effect in
the ground state wavepacket is demonstrated. Due to an increase of the short
range density probability by more than two orders of magnitude, we predict
important photoassociation rates into deeply bound levels of the excited state
by a second pulse, red-detuned relative to the first one and conveniently
delayed.
