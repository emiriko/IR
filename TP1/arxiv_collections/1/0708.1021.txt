We present a unifying approach to quantum error correcting code design that
encompasses additive (stabilizer) codes, as well as all known examples of
nonadditive codes with good parameters. We use this framework to generate new
codes with superior parameters to any previously known. In particular, we find
((10,18,3)) and ((10,20,3)) codes. We also show how to construct encoding
circuits for all codes within our framework.
