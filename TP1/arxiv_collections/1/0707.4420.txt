Previous work has shown that static multi-black hole solutions of
higher-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory do not possess smooth horizons. We
show that the lack of smoothness is worse than previously demonstrated. We
consider solutions describing multiple black holes on a common axis. In five
dimensions, the metric is generically twice, but not three times, continuously
differentiable at the horizon. The Maxwell field is generically continuous, but
not differentiable, at the horizon. In more than five dimensions, the metric is
once, but not twice, continuously differentiable, and there is a
parallely-propagated curvature singularity at the horizon. The Maxwell field
strength is again continuous, but not differentiable, at the horizon.
