We consider single production of the heavy top quark T predicted by the
three-site Higgsless model in future high energy collider experiments, such as
the high energy linear e^{+}e^{-} collider (ILC), the linear-ring type $ep$
collider (THERA), and the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Our numerical
results show that the possible signals of the heavy top quark T might be
observed via the process $e^{+}e^{-}\to t\bar{T}\to t\bar{t}Z$ in future ILC
experiments and via the subprocess $qb\to q'T$ at the LHC.
