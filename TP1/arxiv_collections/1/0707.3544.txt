Deformation of aerogel strongly modifies the orientation of the order
parameter of superfluid 3He confined in aerogel. We used a radial squeezing of
aerogel to keep the orbital angular momentum of the 3He Cooper pairs in the
plane perpendicular to the magnetic field. We did not find strong evidence for
a "polar" phase, with a nodal line along the equator of the Fermi surface,
predicted to occur at large radial squeezing. Instead we observed 3He-A with a
clear experimental evidence of the destruction of the long-range order by
random anisotropy -- the Larkin-Imry-Ma effect. In 3He-B we observed and
identified new modes of NMR, which are impossible to obtain in bulk 3He-B. One
of these modes is characterized by a repulsive interaction between magnons,
which is suitable for the magnon Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC).
