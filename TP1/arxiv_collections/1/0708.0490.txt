After a review of the chrono-geometrical structure of special relativity,
where the definition of the instantaneous 3-space is based on the
observer-dependent convention for the synchronization of distant clocks, it is
shown that in a class of models of general relativity the instantaneous 3-space
and the associated clock synchronization convention are dynamically determined
by Einstein's equations. This theoretical framework is necessary to understand
the relativistic effects around the Earth, to be tested with the ACES mission
of ESA, and the implications for metrology induced by the accuracy of the new
generation of atomic clocks.
