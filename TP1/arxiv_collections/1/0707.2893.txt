We discuss coherent exciton-polariton states in long molecular chains that
are formed due to the interaction of molecular excitations with both vacuum
photons and surface excitations of the neighboring reflecting substrate. The
resonance coupling with surface plasmons (or surface polaritons) of the
substrate can substantially contribute to the retarded intermolecular
interactions leading to an efficient channel of the decay of one-dimensional
excitons with small momenta via emission of surface excitations. The interface
also modifies the radiative decay of excitons into vacuum photons. In an
idealized system, excitons with higher momenta would not emit photons nor
surface waves. For a dissipative substrate, additional exciton quenching takes
place owing to Joule losses as the electric field of the exciton polarization
penetrates the substrate. We discuss how these effects depend on the
polarization of molecular excitations, their frequency and on the distance of
the chain from the substrate.
