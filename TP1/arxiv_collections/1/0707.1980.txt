We report on an experimental study of quantum transport of atoms in variable
periodic optical potentials. The band structure of both ratchet-type asymmetric
and symmetric lattice potentials is explored. The variable atom potential is
realized by superimposing a conventional standing wave potential of \lambda/2
spatial periodicity with a fourth-order multiphoton potential of \lambda /4
periodicity. We find that the Landau-Zener tunneling rate between the first and
the second excited Bloch band depends critically on the relative phase between
the two spatial lattice harmonics.
