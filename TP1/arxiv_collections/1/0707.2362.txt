We present the results of a search for associated production of the chargino
and neutralino supersymmetric particles using up to 1.1 fb-1 of integrated
luminosity collected by the CDF II experiment at the Tevatron ppbar collider at
a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV. The search is conducted by analyzing
events with a large transverse momentum imbalance and either three charged
leptons or two charged leptons of the same electric charge. The numbers of
observed events are found to be consistent with standard model expectations.
Upper limits on the production cross section are derived in different
theoretical models. In one of these models a lower limit on the mass of the
chargino is set at 129 GeV/c^2 at the 95% confidence level.
