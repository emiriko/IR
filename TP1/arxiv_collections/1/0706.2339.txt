The Tevatron experiments CDF and DO are close to making definitive statements
about the technicolor discovery mode rho_T -> W pi_T for M(rho_T) <~ 230 GeV
and M(pi_T) <~ 125 GeV. We propose new incisive tests for this mode and
searches for others that may be feasible at the Tevatron and certainly are at
the LHC. The other searches include two long discussed, namely, omega_T ->
gamma pi_T and l+l-, and a new one -- for the I^G J^{PC} = 1^- 1^{++} partner,
a_T, of the rho_T. Adopting the argument that the technicolor contribution to S
is reduced if M(a_T) is near M(rho_T), we enumerate important a_T decays and
estimate production rates at the colliders.
