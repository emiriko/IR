We report on experimental studies on the collective behavior of a strongly
interacting Fermi gas with tunable interactions and variable temperature. A
scissors mode excitation in an elliptical trap is used to characterize the
dynamics of the quantum gas in terms of hydrodynamic or near-collisionless
behavior. We obtain a crossover phase diagram for collisional properties,
showing a large region where a non-superfluid strongly interacting gas shows
hydrodynamic behavior. In a narrow interaction regime on the BCS side of the
crossover, we find a novel temperature-dependent damping peak, suggesting a
relation to the superfluid phase transition.
