We present molecular dynamics simulations on the structural relaxation of a
simple bead-spring model for polymer blends. The introduction of a different
monomer size induces a large time scale separation for the dynamics of the two
components. Simulation results for a large set of observables probing density
correlations, Rouse modes, and orientations of bond and chain end-to-end
vectors, are analyzed within the framework of the Mode Coupling Theory (MCT).
An unusually large value of the exponent parameter is obtained. This feature
suggests the possibility of an underlying higher-order MCT scenario for dynamic
arrest.
