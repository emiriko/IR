Cooperation and competition between the antiferromagnetic, d-wave
superconducting and Mott-insulating states are explored for the two-dimensional
Hubbard model including nearest and next-nearest-neighbor hoppings at zero
temperature. Using the variational cluster approach with clusters of different
shapes and sizes up to 10 sites, it is found that the doping-driven transition
from a phase with microscopic coexistence of antiferromagnetism and
superconductivity to a purely superconducting phase is discontinuous for strong
interaction and accompanied by phase separation. At half-filling the system is
in an antiferromagnetic Mott-insulating state with vanishing charge
compressibility. Upon decreasing the interaction strength U below a certain
critical value of roughly U=4 (in units of the nearest-neighbor hopping),
however, the filling-dependent magnetic transition changes its character and
becomes continuous. Phase separation or, more carefully, the tendency towards
the formation of inhomogeneous states disappears. This critical value is in
contrast to previous studies, where a much larger value was obtained. Moreover,
we find that the system at half-filling undergoes the Mott transition from an
insulator to a state with a finite charge compressibility at essentially the
same value. The weakly correlated state at half-filling exhibits
superconductivity microscopically admixed to the antiferromagnetic order. This
scenario suggests a close relation between phase separation and the
Mott-insulator physics.
