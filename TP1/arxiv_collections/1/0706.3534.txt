We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of the 2D Potts model on the
square lattice after a quench below the discontinuous transition point. By
means of numerical simulations of systems with q =12,24 and 48 we observe the
onset of a stationary regime below the temperature-driven transition, in a
temperature interval decreasing with the system size and increasing with q.
These results obtained dynamically agree with those obtained from the
analytical continuation of the free energy (Meunier and Morel, 2000), from
which metastability in the 2D Potts model results to be a finite size effect.
