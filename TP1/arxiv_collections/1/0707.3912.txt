Searches for excited electrons and neutrinos have been performed using the
complete HERA I and II data samples collected by the H1 detector at
$\sqrt{s}=320$ GeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of up to 435
pb$^{-1}$. In absence of a signal, the limits on the ratio of the coupling to
the compositeness scale derived extend the excluded region to higher masses
than has been possible in previous searches.
