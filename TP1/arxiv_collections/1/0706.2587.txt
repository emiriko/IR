It is reported on an analysis of electroproduction of light vector mesons at
small Bjorken-x within the handbag approach. The partonic subprocesses, meson
electroproduction off quarks or gluons, are calculated within the modified
perturbative approach in which quark transverse momenta are retained. The soft
hadronic matrix elements, generalized parton distributions, are constructed
from the CTEQ6 parton distribution functions by means of double distributions.
The cross sections for longitudinal polarized virtual photons evaluated from
this approach, are in very good agreement with experiment in a wide range of
kinematics. Talk presented at the DIS2007 conference, Munich (2007)
