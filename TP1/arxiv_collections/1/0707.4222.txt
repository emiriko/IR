A mutual action of the random anisotropy brought in the superfluid 3He by
aerogel and of the global anisotropy caused by its deformation is considered.
Strong global anisotropy tends to suppress fluctuations of orientation of the
order parameter and stabilizes ABM order parameter. In a limit of vanishing
anisotropy these fluctuations are getting critical. It is argued that still in
a region of small fluctuations the average order parameter can acquire "robust"
component. This component maintains a long-range order even in a limit of
vanishing global anisotropy.
