Let (X,Y) be a bivariate elliptical random vector with associated random
radius in the Gumbel max-domain of attraction. In this paper we obtain a second
order asymptotic expansion of the joint survival probability P(X > x, Y> y) for
x,y large. Further, based on the asymptotic bounds we discuss some aspects of
the statistical modelling of joint survival probabilities and the survival
conditional excess probability.
