We investigate the spin state of LaCoO3 using state-of-the-art photoemission
spectroscopy and ab initio band structure calculations. The GGA+U calculations
provide a good description of the ground state for the experimentally estimated
value of electron correlation strength, U. In addition to the correlation
effect, spin-orbit interaction is observed to play a significant role in the
case of intermediate spin and high spin configurations. The comparison of the
calculated Co 3d and O 2p partial density of states with the experimental
valence band spectra indicates that at room temperature, Co has dominant
intermediate spin state configuration and that the high spin configuration may
not be significant at this temperature. The lineshape of the La 5p and O 2s
core level spectra could be reproduced well within these ab initio
calculations.
