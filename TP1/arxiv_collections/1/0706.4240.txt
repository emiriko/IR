We consider the electronic current through a one-dimensional conductor in the
ballistic transport regime and show that the quantum oscillations of a weakly
pinned single scattering target results in a temperature- and bias-voltage
independent excess current at large bias voltages. This is a genuine effect on
transport that derives from an exponential reduction of electronic
backscattering in the elastic channel due to quantum delocalization of the
scatterer and from suppression of low-energy electron backscattering in the
inelastic channels caused by the Pauli exclusion principle. We show that both
the mass of the target and the frequency of its quantum vibrations can be
measured by studying the differential conductance and the excess current. We
apply our analysis to the particular case of a weakly pinned C60 molecule
encapsulated by a single-wall carbon nanotube and find that the discussed
phenomena are experimentally observable.
