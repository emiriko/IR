In KEKB, synchrotron radiation interferometers (SRMs) are used for measuring
the transverse beam sizes. There is also a tool for enlarging the vertical beam
size intentionally by making an asymmetric bump, called an ``iSize'' bump, at
one of the strongest non-interleaved sextupole magnets in each KEKB ring. The
calibrations of the SRMs were checked by comparing the measured vertical beam
sizes with those calculated using the computer code ``SAD''. The obtained
correction factors are 1.000$\pm$0.045 for HER and 0.971$\pm$0.060 for LER,
which are consistent with the calibration factors of SRMs\cite{SRMcalib} within
errors. Using the obtained calibration factor, x-y coupling of each ring was
calculated .
