In their textbook, Suzuki and Varga [Y. Suzuki and K. Varga, {\em Stochastic
Variational Approach to Quantum-Mechanical Few-Body Problems} (Springer,
Berlin, 1998)] present the stochastic variational method in a very exhaustive
way. In this framework, the so-called correlated gaussian bases are often
employed. General formulae for the matrix elements of various operators can be
found in the textbook. However the Fourier transform of correlated gaussians
and their application to the management of a relativistic kinetic energy
operator are missing and cannot be found in the literature. In this paper we
present these interesting formulae. We give also a derivation for new
formulations concerning central potentials; the corresponding formulae are more
efficient numerically than those presented in the textbook.
