We investigate the transmission of focused beams through single subwavelength
holes in a silver film. We use radially and azimuthally polarized light,
respectively, to excite higher order waveguide modes as well as to match the
radial symmetry of the aperture geometry. Remarkably, the transmission
properties can be described by a classical waveguide model even for thicknesses
of the silver film as thin as a quarter of a wavelength.
