We propose a proof of convergence of an adaptive method used in molecular
dynamics to compute free energy profiles. Mathematically, it amounts to
studying the long-time behavior of a stochastic process which satisfies a
non-linear stochastic differential equation, where the drift depends on
conditional expectations of some functionals of the process. We use entropy
techniques to prove exponential convergence to the stationary state.
