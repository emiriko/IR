LiTi2O4 is a unique material in that it is the only known oxide spinel
superconductor. Although bulk studies have demonstrated that superconductivity
can be generally described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schreiffer theory, the
microscopic mechanisms of superconductivity are not yet resolved fully. The
sensitivity of the superconducting properties to various defects of the spinel
crystal structure provides insight into such mechanisms. Epitaxial films of
LiTi2O4 on single crystalline substrates of MgAl2O4, MgO, and SrTiO3 provide
model systems to systematically explore the effects of lattice strain and
microstructural disorder. Lattice strain that affects bandwidth gives rise to
limited variations in the superconducting and normal state properties.
Microstructural disorder such as antiphase boundaries that give rise to Ti
network disorder can reduce the critical temperature, but Ti network disorder
combined with Mg interdiffusion can affect the superconducting state much more
dramatically. Thickness dependent transport studies indicate a
superconductor-insulator transition as a function of film thickness regardless
of lattice strain and microstructure. In addition, surface sensitive X-ray
absorption spectroscopy has identified Ti to retain site symmetry and average
valence of the bulk material regardless of film thickness.
