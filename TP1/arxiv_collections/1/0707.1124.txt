Results of room temperature measurements of tensoresistive effect of thin
single crystal microwires of Pb1-xTlxTe (x=0.0000 - 0.0025, d = 5 - 20
micrometers) obtained from the melted compound of corresponding composition by
the filling of quartz capillary with the following crystallization of material
are presented. For the samples corresponding to chemical composition with
concentration of thallium x ~0,0025 an essential increase of tensoresistive
effect (resistance changes for elastic elongations per unit length of a
crystal) in comparison with nondoped samples is observed. Various mechanisms
which can lead to observable anomalies, including resonance scattering are
discussed. Obtained experimental results allow us to suppose that the observed
peculiarities can be interpreted on the basis of model of an impurity band of
Tl in PbTe.
