The magnitude of gravity at subatomic distances was investigated in the
nuclear size range by examining the vibrational kinetic energy of baryons and
quarks, treated as waveparticles and strings, in the 4He and 2H nuclei. Due to
the relativistic increase in mass and concomitant wave particle confinement at
high vibrational energies, it is found that gravitational moduli forces are
significant and comparable in size with the strong interaction forces exerted
between color quarks. This leads to analytical expressions for the
gravitational constant and for the binding energies of the 4He and 2H nuclei in
close agreement with experiment.
