In the present paper we explicitly construct deformation quantizations of
certain Poisson structures on E^*, where E -> M is a Lie algebroid. Although
the considered Poisson structures in general are far from being regular or even
symplectic, our construction gets along without Kontsevich's formality theorem
but is based on a generalized Fedosov construction. As the whole construction
merely uses geometric structures of E we also succeed in determining the
dependence of the resulting star products on these data in finding appropriate
equivalence transformations between them. Finally, the concreteness of the
construction allows to obtain explicit formulas even for a wide class of
derivations and self-equivalences of the products. Moreover, we can show that
some of our products are in direct relation to the universal enveloping algebra
associated to the Lie algebroid. Finally, we show that for a certain class of
star products on E^* the integration with respect to a density with vanishing
modular vector field defines a trace functional.
