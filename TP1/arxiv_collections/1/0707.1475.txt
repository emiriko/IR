The Bel and Bel-Robinson tensors were introduced nearly fifty years ago in an
attempt to generalize to gravitation the energy-momentum tensor of
electromagnetism. This generalization was successful from the mathematical
point of view because these tensors share mathematical properties which are
remarkably similar to those of the energy-momentum tensor of electromagnetism.
However, the physical role of these tensors in General Relativity has remained
obscure and no interpretation has achieved wide acceptance. In principle, they
cannot represent {\em energy} and the term {\em superenergy} has been coined
for the hypothetical physical magnitude lying behind them. In this work we try
to shed light on the true physical meaning of {\em superenergy} by following
the same procedure which enables us to give an interpretation of the
electromagnetic energy. This procedure consists in performing an orthogonal
splitting of the Bel and Bel-Robinson tensors and analysing the different parts
resulting from the splitting. In the electromagnetic case such splitting gives
rise to the electromagnetic {\em energy density}, the Poynting vector and the
electromagnetic stress tensor, each of them having a precise physical
interpretation which is deduced from the {\em dynamical laws} of
electromagnetism (Poynting theorem). The full orthogonal splitting of the Bel
and Bel-Robinson tensors is more complex but, as expected, similarities with
electromagnetism are present. Also the covariant divergence of the Bel tensor
is analogous to the covariant divergence of the electromagnetic energy-momentum
tensor and the orthogonal splitting of the former is found. The ensuing {\em
equations} are to the superenergy what the Poynting theorem is to
electromagnetism. See paper for full abstract.
