We show that scalar unparticles coupled to the Standard Model Higgs at the
renormalizable level can have a dramatic impact in the breaking of the
electroweak symmetry already at tree level. In particular one can get the
proper electroweak scale without the need of a Higgs mass term in the
Lagrangian. By studying the mixed unparticle-Higgs propagator and spectral
function we also show how unparticles can shift the Higgs mass away from its
Standard Model value, \lambda v^2, and influence other Higgs boson properties.
Conversely, we study in some detail how electroweak symmetry breaking affects
the unparticle sector by breaking its conformal symmetry and generating a mass
gap. We also show that, for Higgs masses above that gap, unparticles can
increase quite significantly the Higgs width.
