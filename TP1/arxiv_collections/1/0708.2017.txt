We calculate the excitation energies of small neutral sodium clusters in the
framework of time-dependent density-functional theory. In the presented
calculations, we extract these energies from the power spectra of the dipole
and quadrupole signals that result from a real-time and real-space propagation.
For comparison with measured photoelectron spectra, we use the ionic
configurations of the corresponding single-charged anions. Our calculations
clearly improve on earlier results for photoelectron spectra obtained from
static Kohn-Sham eigenvalues.
