In this paper we show that for a non-ideal Bose gas there exists an upper
limit on the transition temperature above which Bose-Einstein condensation
cannot occur regardless of the pressure applied. Such upper limits for some
realistic Bose gases are estimated. This result implies that there may also
exist an upper limit on the transition temperature of superconductors.
