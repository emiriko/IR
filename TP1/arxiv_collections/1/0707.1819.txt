Four-qubit cluster states of two photons entangled in polarization and linear
momentum have been used to realize a complete set of single qubit rotations and
the C-NOT gate for equatorial qubits with high values of fidelity. By the
computational equivalence of the two degrees of freedom our result demonstrate
the suitability of two photon cluster states for rapid and efficient one-way
quantum computing.
