We discuss Stark deflectometry of micro-modulated molecular beams for the
enrichment of biomolecular isomers as well as single-wall carbon nanotubes and
we demonstrate the working principle of this idea with fullerenes. The sorting
is based on the species-dependent polarizability-to-mass ratio $\alpha/m$. The
device is compatible with a high molecular throughput, and the spatial
micro-modulation of the beam permits to obtain a fine spatial resolution and a
high sorting sensitivity.
