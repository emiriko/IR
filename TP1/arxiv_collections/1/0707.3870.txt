Analysis of the spontaneously induced correlation on atom-radiation
entanglement in an ensemble of two-level atoms initially prepared in the upper
level and placed in a cavity containing a squeezed radiation employing the
method of evaluating the coherent-state propagator is presented. It is found
that the cavity radiation exhibits squeezing which is directly attributed to
the squeezed radiation in the cavity. The intensity of the cavity radiation
increases with the squeeze parameter and interaction time. It is also shown
that substantial degree of entanglement between the atomic states and radiation
mode exits at a particular time that depends on the coupling constant and
squeeze parameter. We come to understand that though the squeezed radiation is
directly accountable for the cavity squeezing, it significantly destroys the
atom-radiation entanglement.
