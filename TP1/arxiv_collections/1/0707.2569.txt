We present a fast and accurate method to calculate the electrostatic energy
and forces of interacting particles with the boundary conditions appropriate to
surfaces, i.e periodic in the two directions parallel to the surface and free
in the perpendicular direction. In the spirit of the Ewald method the problem
is divided into a short range and long range part. The charge density
responsible for the long range part is represented by plane waves in the
periodic directions and by finite elements in the non-periodic direction. Our
method has computational complexity of O(N_g log(N_g)) with a very small
prefactor, where N_g is the number of grid points.
