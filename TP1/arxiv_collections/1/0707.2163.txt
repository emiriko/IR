A quantum-dynamical analysis of phonon-driven exciton dissociation at polymer
heterojunctions is presented, using a hierarchical electron-phonon model
parameterized for three electronic states and 24 vibrational modes. Two
interfering decay pathways are identified: a direct charge separation, and an
indirect pathway via an intermediate bridge state. Both pathways depend
critically on the dynamical interplay of high-frequency C=C stretch modes and
low-frequency ring-torsional modes. The ultrafast, highly non-equilibrium
dynamics is consistent with time-resolved spectroscopic observations.
