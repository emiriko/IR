Let g denote a Lie algebra, and let T(g) denote the tensor product of g with
a ring of truncated polynomials. The Lie algebra T(g) is called a truncated
current Lie algebra. The highest-weight representation theory of T(g) is
developed, and a reducibility criterion for the Verma modules is described.
