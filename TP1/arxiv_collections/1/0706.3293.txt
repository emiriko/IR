Numerically exact investigations of interacting spin systems provide a major
tool for an understanding of their magnetic properties. For medium size systems
the approximate Lanczos diagonalization is the most common method. In this
article we suggest two improvements: efficient basis coding in subspaces and
simple restructuring for openMP parallelization.
