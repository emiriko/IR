The Pfaffian model has been proposed for the fractional quantum Hall effect
(FQHE) at nu=5/2. We examine it for the quasihole excitations by comparison
with exact diagonalization results. Specifically, we consider the structure of
the low-energy spectrum, accuracy of the microscopic wave functions,
particle-hole symmetry, splitting of the degeneracies, and off-diagonal long
range order. We also review how the 5/2 FQHE can be understood without
appealing to the Pfaffian model. Implications for nonabelian braiding
statistics will be mentioned.
