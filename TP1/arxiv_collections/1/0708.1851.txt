We report influence of encapsulated C60 molecules on electron transport in
carbon-nanotube peapod quantum dots. We find atomic-like behaviors with doubly
degenerate electronic levels, which exist only around ground states, by single
electron spectroscopy measured at low back-gate voltages (Vbg). Correlation
with presence of nearly free electrons (NFEs) unique to the peapods is
discussed. Moreover, we find anomalously high values of power a observed in
power laws in conductance versus energy relationships, which are strongly
associated with the doubly degenerate levels. It is revealed that the powers
originate from Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid via the occupied doubly degenerate
levels. Our observations clarify that the encapsulated C60 molecules form
doubly degenerate levels only at ground state in peapod quantum dots and do not
eliminate a ballistic charge transport.
