We perform a dedicated study of the four-fermion production process e- e+ ->
mu- nubar_mu u dbar X near the W pair-production threshold in view of the
importance of this process for a precise measurement of the W boson mass.
Accurate theoretical predictions for this process require a systematic
treatment of finite-width effects. We use unstable-particle effective field
theory (EFT) to perform an expansion in the coupling constants, GammaW/MW, and
the non-relativistic velocity v of the W boson up to next-to-leading order in
GammaW/MW ~ alpha_ew ~ v^2. We find that the dominant theoretical uncertainty
in MW is currently due to an incomplete treatment of initial-state radiation.
The remaining uncertainty of the NLO EFT calculation translates into delta MW ~
10-15 MeV, and to about 5 MeV with additional input from the NLO four-fermion
calculation in the full theory.
