We have performed a single crystal neutron scattering experiment on
Ce0.7La0.3B6 to investigate the order parameter of phase IV microscopically.
Below the phase transition temperature 1.5 K of phase IV, weak but distinct
superlattice reflections at the scattering vector (h/2,h/2,l/2) (h, l = odd
number) have been observed by neutron scattering for the first time. The
intensity of the superlattice reflections is stronger for high scattering
vectors, which is quite different from the usual magnetic form factor of
magnetic dipoles. This result directly evidences that the order parameter of
phase IV has a complex magnetization density, consistent with the recent
experimental and theoretical prediction in which the order parameter is the
magnetic octupoles Tbeta with Gamma5 symmetry of point group Oh. Neutron
scattering experiments using short wavelength neutrons, as done in this study,
could become a general method to study the high-rank multipoles in f electron
systems.
