Modifications of jet-like azimuthal correlations have revealed novel
properties of the medium created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
Experimental results on jet-like 2- and 3-particle correlations, specificly
"punch-through" at high transverse momentum, broadening at low and modest
transverse momentum, and particularly the possible experimental evidence for
conical flow, are reviewed. Future prospects of jet-like correlations and their
physics potential are discussed.
