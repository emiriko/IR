Spatially-resolved techniques of laser scanning microscopy (LSM) have been
used to image simultaneously the spatial variations of (i) rf current flow,
J$_RF$(x,y), of (ii) areas of resistive dissipation and (iii) the sources of
microwave nonlinearity (NL) in an operating superconducting resonator. The RF
power dependent spatial evolution of these linear and NL microwave properties
in the meander strip YBCO/LAO superconducting resonator have been LSM probed at
different temperatures below Tc. The influence of both topologies of the
twin-domain YBCO structure and of J$_RF$(x,y) peaks at the edges of
superconducting strip line on its NL properties was analyzed in detail with a
micron-scale spatial resolution. Result shows the resistive origin of the
dominant sources of microwave NLs
