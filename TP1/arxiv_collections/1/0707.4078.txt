The KLOE Experiment at the $\phi$ factory DA$\Phi$NE, has measured the cross
section $\sigma(e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-\gamma)$ using two different selection
schemes: requiring the photon emission at small polar angle and detecting the
photon at large polar angle in the calorimeter. Using a theoretical radiator
function we extract the pion form factor and obtain the $\pi\pi$ contribution
to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Results presented here come from
the analysis of 240 pb^{-1} collected in 2002, with improved systematic
uncertainty with respect to the published KLOE analysis. We also include an
update of the previous analysis.
