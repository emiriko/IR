Signatures of black hole events at CERN's Large Hadron Collider are
discussed. Event simulations are carried out with the Fortran Monte Carlo
generator CATFISH. Inelasticity effects, exact field emissivities, color and
charge conservation, corrections to semiclassical black hole evaporation,
gravitational energy loss at formation and possibility of a black hole remnant
are included in the analysis.
