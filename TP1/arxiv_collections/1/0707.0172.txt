Efficient methods for the description of the non-Markovian dynamics of open
systems play an important role in many proposed applications of quantum
mechanics. Here we review some of the most important tools that are based on
the projection operator techniques of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. The
standard product-state projection is generalized to a new class of correlated
projection superoperators that allow the treatment of strong memory effects,
and lead to a non-Markovian generalization of the Lindblad equation.
