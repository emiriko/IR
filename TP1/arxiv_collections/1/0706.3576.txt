The influence of Coulomb distortion on the polarization transfer in elastic
proton and antiproton electron scattering at low energies is calculated in a
distorted wave Born approximation. For antiproton electron scattering Coulomb
effects reduce substantially the spin transfer cross section compared to the
plane wave Born approximation whereas for proton electron scattering they lead
to a dramatic increase for kinetic proton lab energies below about 20 keV.
