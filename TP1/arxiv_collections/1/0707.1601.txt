The decay psi(2S) --> eta J/psi is used to measure, for the first time, all
prominent eta-meson branching fractions with the same experiment in the same
dataset, thereby providing a consistent treatment of systematics across
branching fractions. We present results for eta decays to gamma gamma,
pi+pi-pi0, 3 pi0, pi+ pi- gamma, and e+ e- gamma, accounting for 99.9% of all
eta decays. The precisions for several of the branching fractions and their
ratios are improved. Two channels, pi+ pi- gamma and e+ e- gamma, show results
that differ at the level of three standard deviations from those previously
determined.
