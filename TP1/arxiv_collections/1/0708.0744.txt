We consider quantum Schubert cells in the quantum grassmannian and give a
cell decomposition of the prime spectrum via the Schubert cells. As a
consequence, we show that all primes are completely prime in the generic case
where the deformation parameter q is not a root of unity. There is a torus H
that acts naturally on the quantum grassmannian and the cell decomposition of
the set of H-primes leads to a parameterisation of the H-spectrum via certain
diagrams on partitions associated to the Schubert cells. Interestingly, the
same parameterisation occurs for the non-negative cells in recent studies
concerning the totally non-negative grassmannian. Finally, we use the cell
decomposition to establish that the quantum grassmannian satisfies normal
separation and catenarity.
