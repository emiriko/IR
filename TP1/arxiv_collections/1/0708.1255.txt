In this paper we study the relaxation singularities of human motor system at
aging. Our purpose is to examine the structure of force output variability as a
function of human aging in the time and frequency domains. For analysis of
experimental data we have developed here the statistical theory of relaxation
of force output fluctuation with taking into account the effects of two
relaxation channels. The first of them contains the contribution of short-range
correlation whereas other relaxation component reflects the effect of
long-range correlation. The analysis of experimental data shows, that the
general behavior of relaxation processes at human aging is determined by a
complicated combination and nonlinear interactions two above stated relaxation
processes as a whole.
