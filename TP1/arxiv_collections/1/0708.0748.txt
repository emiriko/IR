In this paper we have criticized the so-called Landau damping theory. We have
analyzed solutions of the standard dispersion equations for longitudinal
(electric) and transversal (electromagnetic and electron) waves in
half-infinite slab of the uniform collisionless plasmas with non-Maxwellian and
Maxwellian-like electron energy distribution functions. One considered the most
typical cases of both the delta-function type distribution function (the plasma
stream with monochromatic electrons) and distribution functions, different from
Maxwellian ones as with a surplus as well as with a shortage in the Maxwellian
distribution function tail. It is shown that there are present for the
considered cases both collisionless damping and also non-damping electron waves
even in the case of non-Maxwellian distribution function.
