In this paper we show how to find nearly optimal embeddings of large trees in
several natural classes of graphs. The size of the tree T can be as large as a
constant fraction of the size of the graph G, and the maximum degree of T can
be close to the minimum degree of G. For example, we prove that any graph of
minimum degree d without 4-cycles contains every tree of size \epsilon d^2 and
maximum degree at most (1-2\epsilon)d - 2. As there exist d-regular graphs
without 4-cycles of size O(d^2), this result is optimal up to constant factors.
We prove similar nearly tight results for graphs of given girth, graphs with no
complete bipartite subgraph K_{s,t}, random and certain pseudorandom graphs.
These results are obtained using a simple and very natural randomized embedding
algorithm, which can be viewed as a "self-avoiding tree-indexed random walk".
