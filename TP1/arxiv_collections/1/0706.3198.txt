We examine a nearly extreme macroscopic Reissner-Nordstrom black hole in the
context of semi-classical gravity. The absorption rate associated with the
quantum tunneling process of scalar particles whereby this black hole can
acquire enough angular momentum to violate the weak cosmic censorship
conjecture is shown to be nonzero.
