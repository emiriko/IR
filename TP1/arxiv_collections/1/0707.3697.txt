We determine the chromoelectric response of quark-gluon plasma (QGP)
systematically within the framework of classical transport equations. The
transport equations are set up in the phase space which includes the SU(3)
group space corresponding to color (which is a dynamical degree of freedom), in
addition to the position - momentum variables. The distribution functions are
defined by projecting the density operators for the quarks and the gluons to
their respective coherent states (defined over the extended phase space). The
full import of the Yang-Mills(YM) dynamics is shown to manifest through the
emergence of an intrinsic nonlinear, nonlocal response, whose behavior we
determine in the long wavelength limit. It also manifests as a tensor response
which is a characteristic of gluons. The response functions are shown to have a
natural interpretation in terms of the renormalizations of the Abelian and the
non-Abelian coupling constants. A detailed analysis of the screening of heavy
quark potential and of the exact role played by the Debye mass screening in the
case of the Cornell potential, is performed. We also discuss the non-Abelian
contribution to Landau damping in QGP.
