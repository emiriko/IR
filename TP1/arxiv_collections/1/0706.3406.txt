Interacting electrons in quantum dots with large Thouless number $g$ in the
three classical random matrix symmetry classes are well-understood. When a
specific type of spin-orbit coupling known to be dominant in two dimensional
semiconductor quantum dots is introduced, we show that a new interacting
quantum critical crossover energy scale emerges and low-energy quasiparticles
generically have a decay width proportional to their energy. The low-energy
physics of this system is an example of a universal interacting crossover
regime.
