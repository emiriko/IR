I apply a two-step renormalization group method to the study of the
competition between antiferromagnetism (AFM) and superconductivity in an
anisotropic 2D Hubbard model. I show that this simple model captures the
essentials of the ground-state phases of the quasi 1D organic conductors. As
found experimentally, the ground-state phase diagram is mostly AFM. The AFM is
localized in the strong-coupling limit where the electrons are confined in the
chains. It is an SDW in the weak-coupling limit where interchain hopping is
present. There is a tiny region in the weak-coupling regime where transverse
two-particle hopping is dominant over magnetism.
