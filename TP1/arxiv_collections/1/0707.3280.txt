Strangelets coming from the interstellar medium (ISM) are an interesting
target to experiments searching for evidence of this hypothetic state of
hadronic matter. We entertain the possibility of a {\it trapped} strangelet
population, quite analogous to ordinary nuclei and electron belts. For a
population of strangelets to be trapped by the geomagnetic field, these
incoming particles would have to fulfill certain conditions, namely having
magnetic rigidities above the geomagnetic cutoff and below a certain threshold
for adiabatic motion to hold. We show in this work that, for fully ionized
strangelets, there is a narrow window for stable trapping. An estimate of the
stationary population is presented and the dominant loss mechanisms discussed.
It is shown that the population would be substantially enhanced with respect to
the ISM flux (up to two orders of magnitude) due to quasi-stable trapping.
