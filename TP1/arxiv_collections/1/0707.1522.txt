We argue, in contrast to recent studies, that the antiferromagnetic
superexchange coupling between nearest neighbour spins does not fully destroy
the ferromagnetism in dilute magnets with long-ranged ferromagnetic couplings.
Above a critical coupling, we find a \textit{canted} ferromagnetic phase with
unsaturated moment. We have calculated the transition temperature using a
simplified local Random Phase Approximation procedure which accounts for the
canting. For the dilute magnetic semiconductors, such as GaMnAs, using
\textit{ab-initio} couplings allows us to predict the existence of a canted
phase and provide an explanation to the apparent contradictions observed in
experimental measurements. Finally, we have compared with previous studies that
used RKKY couplings and reported non-ferromagnetic state when the superexchange
is too strong. Even in this case the ferromagnetism should remain essentially
stable in the form of a canted phase.
