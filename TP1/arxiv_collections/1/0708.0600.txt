A pair of complementary algorithms are presented. One of the pair is a fast
method for connecting graphs with an edge. The other is a fast method for
removing edges from a graph. Both algorithms employ the same tree based graph
representation and so, in concert, can arbitrarily modify any graph. Since the
clusters of a percolation model may be described as simple connected graphs, an
efficient Monte Carlo scheme can be constructed that uses the algorithms to
sweep the occupation probability back and forth between two turning points.
This approach concentrates computational sampling time within a region of
interest. A high precision value of pc = 0.59274603(9) was thus obtained, by
Mersenne twister, for the two dimensional square site percolation threshold.
