We describe a Cs atomic magnetometer operating in the spin-exchange
relaxation-free (SERF) regime. With a vapor cell temperature of
$103^\circ\rm{C}$ we achieve intrinsic magnetic resonance widths $\Delta B=17
{\rm \mu G}$ corresponding to an electron spin-relaxation rate of $300 {\rm
s^{-1}}$ when the spin-exchange rate is $\Gamma_{SE}=14000 {\rm s^{-1}}$. We
also observe an interesting narrowing effect due to diffusion. Signal-to-noise
measurements yield a sensitivity of about $400\thinspace{\rm pG/\sqrt{Hz}}$.
Based on photon shot noise, we project a sensitivity of $40 {\rm
pG/\sqrt{Hz}}$. A theoretical optimization of the magnetometer indicates
sensitivities on the order of $2 {\rm pG/\sqrt{Hz}}$ should be achievable in a
$1 {\rm cm^3}$ volume. Because Cs has a higher saturated vapor pressure than
other alkali metals, SERF magnetometers using Cs atoms are particularly
attractive in applications requiring lower temperatures.
