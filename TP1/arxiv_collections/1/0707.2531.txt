Recently a model, which is equivalent to the scalar form of Gursey model, is
shown to be a nontrivial field theoretical model when it is gauged with a SU(N)
field. In this paper we study another model that is equivalent to the vector
form of the Gursey model. We get a trivial theory when it is coupled with a
scalar field. This result changes drastically when it is coupled with an
additional SU(N) field. We find a nontrivial field theoretical model under
certain conditions.
