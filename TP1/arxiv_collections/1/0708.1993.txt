We present a mathematical model of glucose-lactose diauxic growth in
Escherichia coli including both the postive and negative regulation mechanisms
of the lactose operon as well as the inducer exclusion. To validate this model,
we first calculated the time evolution of beta-galactosidase for only the
lactose nutrient and compared the numerical results with experimental data.
Second, we compared the calculated cell biomass of the glucose-lactose diauxic
growth with the experimental optical density of the diauxic growth for a
particular E. coli MG 1655. For both cases, the numerical calculations from
this model are in good agreement with these two experiments' data. The diauxic
growth pattern of a wild type E. coli was also investigated.
