This thesis contains three main parts, which are largely independent. In the
first part we deal with the boundary bootstrap in supersymmetric factorized
scattering theory. We give a description of supersymmetry in the case when the
space is a half-line and present rules for the determination of the
representations in which higher level boundary bound states transform, and for
the determination of the supersymmetric one-particle reflection matrix factors
for the higher level boundary bound states. These rules apply under the
condition that the bulk particles transform in the kink or in the boson-fermion
representation. Examples for the application of these rules to specific models
are also given. In the second part we investigate the problem whether the TCSA
spectrum can be approximated by the spectrum of the original Hamiltonian
operator in which the coefficients of the terms are suitably changed. The
investigation is done in the case of the critical Ising model on a strip with
an external magnetic field on one of the boundaries. Another truncation method
that preserves the solvability of the model is also considered. The results of
perturbative and numerical calculations show that the above approximation is
possible and that the qualitative behaviour of the truncated spectrum as a
function of the coupling constant depends on the truncation method. In the
third part we investigate the phase structure of the two- and three-frequency
sine-Gordon models using the TCSA. In the case of the three-frequency model the
tricritical point, several points of the critical line and a few points of the
line of first order transition are found.
