The breaking of SO(10) to SU(3)_C x U(1)_EM can be accomplished by just four
Higgs fields: the symmetric rank-two tensor, S(54); a pair of spinors, C(16)
and Cbar(16bar); and a vector, T(10). This setup is also able to generate
realistic fermion masses. The heavy color triplets in the vector and spinor
fields mediate proton decay via dimension-five operators. The experimental
bounds on proton decay constrain the structure and size of the Yukawa
operators.
