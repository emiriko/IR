The systematic treatment of heavy quark mass effects in DIS in current CTEQ
global analysis is summarized. Applications of this treatment to the comparison
between theory and experimental data on DIS charm production are described. The
possibility of intrinsic charm in the nucleon is studied. The issue of
determining the charm mass in global analysis is discussed.
