We consider a combined nanomechanical-supercondcuting device that allows the
Cooper pair tunneling to interfere with the mechanical motion of the middle
superconducting island. Coupling of mechanical oscillations of a
superconducting island between two superconducting leads to the electronic
tunneling generate a supercurrent which is modulated by the oscillatory motion
of the island. This coupling produces alternating finite and vanishing
supercurrent as function of the superconducting phases. Current peaks are
sensitive to the superconducting phase shifts relative to each other. The
proposed device may be used to study the nanoelectromechanical coupling in case
of superconducting electronics.
