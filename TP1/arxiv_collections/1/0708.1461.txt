A number of metal-based nanopowders such kinds as Fe, Co, Fe/Co alloy, Fe/C,
Fe/organic shell were successfully produced by aerosol synthesis method. The
mechanism of nanoparticles formation and the influence of experimental
parameters on shape, size distribution, structure, chemical and phase
composition of oxide-, carbon-, or organic- coated nanoparticles were
evaluated. The sizes of particles can be varied from 6-100 nm with narrow size
distribution. The several application fields of synthesized nanoparticles have
been studied.
