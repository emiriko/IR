We report on coherent resonant emission of the fundamental exciton state in a
single semiconductor GaAs quantum dot. Resonant regime with picoseconde laser
excitation is realized by embedding the quantum dots in a waveguiding
structure. As the pulse intensity is increased, Rabi oscillation is observed up
to three periods. The Rabi regime is achieved owing to an enhanced light-matter
coupling in the waveguide. This is due to a \emph{slow light effect}
($c/v_{g}\simeq 3000$), occuring when an intense resonant pulse propagates in a
medium. The resonant control of the quantum dot fundamental transition opens
new possibilities in quantum state manipulation and quantum optics experiments
in condensed matter physics.
