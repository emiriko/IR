The Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) critical temperature in a relativistic
ideal Bose gas of identical bosons, with and without the antibosons expected to
be pair-produced abundantly at sufficiently hot temperatures, is exactly
calculated for all boson number-densities, all boson point rest masses, and all
temperatures. The Helmholtz free energy at the critical BEC temperature is
found to be lower, thus implying that the omission of antibosons always leads
to the computation of a metastable state.
