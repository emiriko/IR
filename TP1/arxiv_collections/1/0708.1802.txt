We present a Brownian inchworm model of a self-propelled elastic dimer in the
absence of an external potential. Nonequilibrium noise together with a
stretch-dependent damping form the propulsion mechanism. Our model connects
three key nonequilibrium features -- position-velocity correlations, a nonzero
mean internal force, and a drift velocity. Our analytical results, including
striking current reversals, compare very well with numerical simulations. The
model unifies the propulsion mechanisms of DNA helicases, polar rods on a
vibrated surface, crawling keratocytes and Myosin VI. We suggest experimental
realizations and tests of the model.
