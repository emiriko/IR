Using methods previously developed by Kelbg and others for creating effective
potentials for electron-ion plasmas, we investigate quarkonium potentials above
deconfinement. Using results for the internal energy of a static
quark-antiquark pair, a set of effective potentials are constructed that take
into account quantum effects and symmetry conditions. Bound state effects are
explicitly included in order to account for the strongly coupled nature of
plasmas. It is hoped that these effective potentials will be useful in
simulations of heavy quarks or plasma quasiparticles when the dynamics is
treated classically.
