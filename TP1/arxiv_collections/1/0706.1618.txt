Tensor models can be interpreted as theory of dynamical fuzzy spaces. In this
paper, I study numerically the fluctuation spectra around a Gaussian classical
solution of a tensor model, which represents a fuzzy flat space in arbitrary
dimensions. It is found that the momentum distribution of the low-lying
low-momentum spectra is in agreement with that of the metric tensor modulo the
general coordinate transformation in the general relativity at least in the
dimensions studied numerically, i.e. one to four dimensions. This result
suggests that the effective field theory around the solution is described in a
similar manner as the general relativity.
