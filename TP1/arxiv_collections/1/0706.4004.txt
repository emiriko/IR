In recent years, there has been a strong interest in measuring the available
bandwidth of network paths. Several methods and techniques have been proposed
and various measurement tools have been developed and evaluated. However, there
have been few comparative studies with regards to the actual performance of
these tools. This paper presents a study of available bandwidth measurement
techniques and undertakes a comparative analysis in terms of accuracy,
intrusiveness and response time of active probing tools. Finally, measurement
errors and the uncertainty of the tools are analysed and overall conclusions
made.
