A brief discussion is given on the nonlocal effect in multigapped
superconductivity. It is pointed out that the effective magnetic penetration
depth at lower external fields may be reduced by the nonlocal effect associated
with the presence of small energy gap. A crude estimation of the effect in
double gap system is provided and compared with the data obtained by muSR in
MgB2.
