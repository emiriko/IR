In the standard geometric approach to a measure of entanglement of a pure
state, $\sin^2\theta$ is used, where $\theta$ is the angle between the state to
the closest separable state of products of normalized qubit states. We consider
here a generalization of this notion to separable states consisting of products
of unnormalized states of different dimension. In so doing, the entanglement
measure $\sin^2\theta$ is found to have an interpretation as the distance
between the state to the closest separable state. We also find the components
of the closest separable state and its norm have an interpretation in terms of,
respectively, the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the reduced density matrices
arising in the Schmidt decomposition of the state vector.
