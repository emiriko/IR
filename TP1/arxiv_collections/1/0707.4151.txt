The potential of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment to measure
Drell-Yan muon pairs is discussed. Muon pairs can be measured in CMS with high
precision up to very high invariant masses. The systematic errors are
considered. The potential to carry out precise measurements of the
forward-backward asymmetry is discussed.
