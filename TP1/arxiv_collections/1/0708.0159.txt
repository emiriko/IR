Within the framework of the dinuclear system model, the production of
superheavy element Z=117 in possible projectile-target combinations is analyzed
systematically. The calculated results show that the production cross sections
are strongly dependent on the reaction systems. Optimal combinations,
corresponding excitation energies and evaporation channels are proposed in this
letter, such as the isotopes ^{248,249}Bk in ^{48}Ca induced reactions in 3n
evaporation channels and the reactions ^{45}Sc+^{246,248}Cm in 3n and 4n
channels, and the system ^{51}V+^{244}Pu in 3n channel.
