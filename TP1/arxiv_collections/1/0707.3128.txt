The Canonical Transformation theory of Yanai and Chan [J. Chem. Phys. 124,
194106 (2006)] provides a rigorously size-extensive description of dynamical
correlation in multireference problems. Here we describe a new formulation of
the theory based on the extended normal ordering procedure of Mukherjee and
Kutzelnigg [J. Chem. Phys. 107, 432 (1997)].
  On studies of the water, nitrogen, and iron-oxide potential energy curves,
the Linearised Canonical Transformation Singles and Doubles theory is
competitive in accuracy with some of the best multireference methods, such as
the Multireference Averaged Coupled Pair Functional, while computational
timings (in the case of the iron-oxide molecule) are two-three orders of
magnitude faster and comparable to those of Complete Active Space Second-Order
Perturbation Theory. The results presented here are greatly improved both in
accuracy and in cost over our earlier study as the result of a new numerical
algorithm for solving the amplitude equations.
