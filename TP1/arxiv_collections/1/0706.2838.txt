We investigate by molecular dynamics simulations a continuous isotropic
core-softened potential with attractive well in three dimensions, introduced by
Franzese [cond-mat/0703681, to appear on Journal of Molecular Liquids], that
displays liquid-liquid coexistence with a critical point and water-like density
anomaly. Here we find diffusion and structural anomalies. These anomalies occur
with the same hierarchy that characterizes water. Yet our analysis shows
differences with respect to the water case. Therefore, many of the anomalous
features of water could be present in isotropic systems with soft-core
attractive potentials, such as colloids or liquid metals, consistent with
recent experiments showing polyamorphism in metallic glasses.
