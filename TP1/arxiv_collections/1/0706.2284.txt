The Dupree-Weinstock renormalization is used to prove that a reactive closure
exists for drift wave turbulence in magnetized plasmas. The result is used to
explain recent results in gyrokinetic simulations and is also related to the
Mattor-Parker closure. The level of closure is found in terms of applied
external sources.
