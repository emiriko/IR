We provide a novel approach for characterization of quantum Hamiltonian
systems via utilizing a single measurement device. Specifically, we demonstrate
how external quantum correlations can be used for Hamiltonian identification
tasks. We explicitly introduce experimental procedures for direct estimation of
single- and two-qubit Hamiltonian parameters, and also for simultaneous
estimation of transverse and longitudinal relaxation rates, using a single
Bell-state analyzer. An advantage of our method over the earlier approaches is
that it has a built-in feature which makes it suitable for partial
characterization of Hamiltonian parameters.
