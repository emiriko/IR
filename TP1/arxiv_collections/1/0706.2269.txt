Topological excitations are prominent candidates for explaining
nonperturbative effects in QCD like confinement. In these lectures, I cover
both formal treatments and applications of topological objects. The typical
phenomena like BPS bounds, topology, the semiclassical approximation and chiral
fermions are introduced by virtue of kinks. Then I proceed in higher dimensions
with magnetic monopoles and instantons and special emphasis on calorons.
Analytical aspects are discussed and an overview over models based on these
objects as well as lattice results is given.
