This article uses data from two experimental studies of two-person Prisoner's
Dilemma games [1, 2] and compares the data with the theoretic predictions
calculated with the use of a quantum game theoretical method. The experimental
findings of the cooperation percentage Cp indicate a strong connectivity with
the properties of a novel function (N), which depends on the payoff parameters
of the game and the entanglement parameter . A classification scheme depending
on four quantum cooperation indicators is developed to describe cooperation in
real two-person games. The quantum indicators lead to results, that are at
least as good as the cooperation predictions derived from classical game
theory.
