We explore the total cross section of ground state polar molecules in an
electric field at various energies, focusing on RbCs and RbK. An external
electric field polarizes the molecules and induces strong dipolar interactions
leading to non-zero partial waves contributing to the scattering even as the
collision energy goes to zero. This results in the need to compute scattering
problems with many different values of total M to converge the total cross
section. An accurate and efficient approximate total cross section is
introduced and used to study the low field temperature dependence. To
understand the scattering of the polar molecules we compare a semi-classical
cross section with quantum unitarity limit. This comparison leads to the
ability to characterize the scattering based on the value of the electric field
and the collision energy.
