We study a dynamics of ultracold Fermi-gases near the unitary limit in the
framework of Effective Field Theory. It is shown that, while one can obtain a
reasonable description of the universal proportionality constant both in the
narrow and the broad Feshbach resonance limits, the reguirement of the
reparametrisation invariance leads to appearance of the three body forces
needed to cancel the otherwise arising off-shell uncertainties. The size of the
unsertainties is estimated.
