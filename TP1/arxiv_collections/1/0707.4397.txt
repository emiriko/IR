We have carried out bound-state and low-energy quantum scattering
calculations on He + NH (triplet Sigma) in magnetic fields, with the NH
molecule in its n=1 rotationally excited states. We have explored the pattern
of levels as a function of magnetic field and identified the nearly good
quantum numbers in different regimes. We have used the bound-state calculations
to locate low-energy Feshbach resonances. When the magnetic field is used to
tune across such a resonance, the real and imaginary part of the scattering
length show asymmetric oscillations and peaks with amplitude between 1 and 3
Angstroms. The scattering length does not pass through a pole at resonance. The
resonant behavior is characterized by a complex resonant scattering length
a_res. The corresponding inelastic cross sections show troughs as well as peaks
near resonance. This may be important for efforts to achieve evaporative and
sympathetic cooling for molecules, because it offers the hope that inelastic
trap losses can be reduced by tuning close to a Feshbach resonance.
