In these lecture notes we describe recent progress in our understanding of
attractor mechanism and entropy of extremal black holes based on the entropy
function formalism. We also describe precise computation of the microscopic
degeneracy of a class of quarter BPS dyons in N=4 supersymmetric string
theories, and compare the statistical entropy of these dyons, expanded in
inverse powers of electric and magnetic charges, with a similar expansion of
the corresponding black hole entropy. This comparison is extended to include
the contribution to the entropy from multi-centered black holes as well.
