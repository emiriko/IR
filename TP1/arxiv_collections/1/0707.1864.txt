An analysis is presented of frequency versus wave-vector dispersion in
elliptically birefringent one-dimensional layered periodic structures. The
presence of local normal mode polarization state variations from one layer to
the next is found to lead to mode coupling and to affect the wave-vector
dispersion and the character of the Bloch states of the system.
