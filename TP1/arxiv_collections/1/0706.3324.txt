We investigate the effect of general time transformations on the phase
synchronization (PS) phenomenon and the mutual information rate (MIR) between
pairs of nodes in dynamical networks. We demonstrate two important results
concerning the invariance of both PS and the MIR. Under time transformations PS
can neither be introduced nor destroyed and the MIR cannot be raised from zero.
On the other hand, for proper time transformations the timing between the
cycles of the coupled oscillators can be largely improved. Finally, we discuss
the relevance of our findings for communication in dynamical networks.
