X-ray diffraction was demonstrated from shock-compressed polycrystalline
metal on nanosecond time scales. Laser ablation was used to induce shock waves
in polycrystalline foils of Be, 25 to 125 microns thick. A second laser pulse
was used to generate a plasma x-ray source by irradiation of a Ti foil. The
x-ray source was collimated to produce a beam of controllable diameter, and the
beam was directed at the Be sample. X-rays were diffracted from the sample, and
detected using films and x-ray streak cameras. The diffraction angle was
observed to change with shock pressure. The diffraction angles were consistent
with the uniaxial (elastic) and isotropic (plastic) compressions expected for
the loading conditions used. Polycrystalline diffraction will be used to
measure the response of the crystal lattice to high shock pressures and through
phase changes.
