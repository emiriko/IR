Spin currents may be generated by applying bias voltages V to the
nanostructures even in the absence of spin-active ferromagnetic interfaces.
Most theoretical proposals concentrate on a concrete spin-orbit interaction and
on the disorder-averaged effect. It remains underappreciated that any
spin-orbit interaction produces random spin currents with a typical amplitude
e^2 V/\hbar not affected by disorder. This work addresses such mesoscopic
fluctuations of spin currents for generic model of a nanostructure where
several quantum connectors meet in a single node. The analysis is performed in
the framework of recently developed quantum circuit theory of G_Q corrections
and reveals four distinct mechanisms of spin current fluctuations. The results
are elaborated for simple models of tunnel and ballistic connectors.
