Experimental results obtained at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)
have been interpreted in terms of a strongly interacting quark gluon plasma.
The strongly interacting plasma is characterized by ``perfect fluidity'', i.e.
a ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density that saturates a proposed lower
bound. In this contribution we explore the possibility that a similar
phenomenon takes place in a strongly coupled non-relativistic Fermi liquid in
which the scattering length between the Fermions is infinitely large.
