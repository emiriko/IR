We explore the eikonal approximation to graviton exchange in AdS_5 space, as
relevant to scattering in gauge theories. We restrict ourselves to the regime
where conformal invariance of the dual gauge theory holds, and to large 't
Hooft coupling where the computation involves pure gravity. We give a heuristic
argument, a direct loop computation, and a shock wave derivation. The scalar
propagator in AdS_3 plays a key role, indicating that even at strong coupling,
two-dimensional conformal invariance controls high-energy four-dimensional
gauge-theory scattering.
