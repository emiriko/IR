In this article, we generalize Wenzel law, which assigns an effective contact
angle for a droplet on a rough substrate, when the wetting layer has an ordered
phase, like a nematic. We estimate the conditions for which the wetting
behavior of an ordered fluid can be qualitatively different from the one
usually found in a simple fluid. To particularize our general considerations,
we will use the Landau-de Gennes mean field approach to investigate
theoretically and numerically the complete wetting transition between a nematic
liquid crystal and a saw-shaped structured substrate.
