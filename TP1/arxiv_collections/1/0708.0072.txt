Using the quasiclassical theory, we analyze the vortex structure of
strong-paramagnetic superconductors.There, induced paramagnetic moments are
accumulated exclusively around the vortex core. We quantitatively evaluate the
significant paramagnetic effect in the H-dependence of various quantities, such
as low temperature specific heat, Knight shift, magnetization and the flux line
lattice (FLL) form factor. The anomalous H-dependence of the FLL form factor
observed by the small angle neutron scattering in CeCoIn_5 is attributable to
the large paramagnetic contribution.
