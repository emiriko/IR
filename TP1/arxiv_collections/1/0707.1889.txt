Topological quantum computation has recently emerged as one of the most
exciting approaches to constructing a fault-tolerant quantum computer. The
proposal relies on the existence of topological states of matter whose
quasiparticle excitations are neither bosons nor fermions, but are particles
known as {\it Non-Abelian anyons}, meaning that they obey {\it non-Abelian
braiding statistics}. Quantum information is stored in states with multiple
quasiparticles, which have a topological degeneracy. The unitary gate
operations which are necessary for quantum computation are carried out by
braiding quasiparticles, and then measuring the multi-quasiparticle states. The
fault-tolerance of a topological quantum computer arises from the non-local
encoding of the states of the quasiparticles, which makes them immune to errors
caused by local perturbations. To date, the only such topological states
thought to have been found in nature are fractional quantum Hall states, most
prominently the \nu=5/2 state, although several other prospective candidates
have been proposed in systems as disparate as ultra-cold atoms in optical
lattices and thin film superconductors. In this review article, we describe
current research in this field, focusing on the general theoretical concepts of
non-Abelian statistics as it relates to topological quantum computation, on
understanding non-Abelian quantum Hall states, on proposed experiments to
detect non-Abelian anyons, and on proposed architectures for a topological
quantum computer. We address both the mathematical underpinnings of topological
quantum computation and the physics of the subject using the \nu=5/2 fractional
quantum Hall state as the archetype of a non-Abelian topological state enabling
fault-tolerant quantum computation.
