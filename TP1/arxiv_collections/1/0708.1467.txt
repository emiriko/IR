This paper the utilizes atomistic-continuum mechanics (ACM) to investigate
the mechanical properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). By
establishing a linkage between structural mechanics and molecular mechanics,
not only the Young's moduli could be obtained but also the modal analysis could
be achieved. In addition, according to atomistic-continuum mechanics and finite
element method, an effective atomistic-continuum model is constructed to
investigate the above two mechanical properties of SWCNTs with affordable
computational time by personal computers. The validity of the results is
demonstrated by comparing them with existing results.
