We study the phase behavior of a nematic liquid crystal confined between a
flat substrate with strong anchoring and a patterned substrate whose structure
and local anchoring strength we vary. By first evaluating an effective surface
free energy function characterizing the patterned substrate we derive an
expression for the effective free energy of the confined nematic liquid
crystal. Then we determine phase diagrams involving a homogeneous state in
which the nematic director is almost uniform and a hybrid aligned nematic state
in which the orientation of the director varies through the cell. Direct
minimization of the free energy functional were performed in order to test the
predictions of the effective free energy method. We find remarkably good
agreement between the phase boundaries calculated from the two approaches. In
addition the effective energy method allows one to determine the energy
barriers between two states in a bistable nematic device.
