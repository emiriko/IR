The transverse momentum and pseudorapidity dependences of partonic
{`\it{Mach-like}'} shock wave have been studied by using a multi-phase
transport model (AMPT) with both partonic and hadronic interactions. The
splitting parameter $D$, i.e. half distance between two splitting peaks on away
side in di-hadron azimuthal angular ($\Delta\phi$) correlations, slightly
increases with the transverse momentum of associated hadrons ($p^{assoc}_T$),
which is consistent with preliminary experimental trend, owing to different
interaction-lengths/numbers between wave partons and medium in strong parton
cascade. On the other hand, the splitting parameter $D$ as a function of
pseudorapidity of associated hadrons ($\eta^{assoc}$), keeps flat in
mid-pseudorapidity region and rapidly drops in high-pseudorapidity region,
which is as a result of different violent degrees of jet-medium interactions in
the medium that has different energy densities in the longitudinal direction.
It is proposed that the research on the properties of {`\it{Mach-like}'}
correlation can shed light on the knowledge of both partonic and hadronic
interactions at RHIC.
