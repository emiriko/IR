We describe new QCD fits to diffractive cross sections measured at HERA and
we use the parton densities derived from these fits to predict the shape of the
dijet mass fraction in double Pomeron exchange at the Tevatron. We discuss the
existence of exclusive events in this dijet channel and some prospects are
given for the LHC.
