We consider corrections to vanishing U_{e3} and maximal atmospheric neutrino
mixing originating from the relation U = U_ell^dagger U_nu, where U is the PMNS
mixing matrix and U_ell (U_nu) is associated with the diagonalization of the
charged lepton (neutrino) mass matrix. We assume that in the limit of U_ell or
U_nu being the unit matrix, one has U_{e3} = 0 and theta_{23} = pi/4, while the
solar neutrino mixing angle is a free parameter. Well-known special cases of
the indicated scenario are the bimaximal and tri-bimaximal mixing schemes. If
U_{e3} \neq 0 and theta_{23} \neq pi/4 due to corrections from the charged
leptons, |U_{e3}| can be sizable (close to the existing upper limit) and we
find that the value of the solar neutrino mixing angle is linked to the
magnitude of CP violation in neutrino oscillations. In the alternative case of
the neutrino sector correcting U_{e3} = 0 and theta_{23} = pi/4, we obtain a
generically smaller |U_{e3}| than in the first case. Now the magnitude of CP
violation in neutrino oscillations is connected to the value of the atmospheric
neutrino mixing angle theta_{23}. We find that both cases are in agreement with
present observations. We also introduce parametrization independent "sum-rules"
for the oscillation parameters.
