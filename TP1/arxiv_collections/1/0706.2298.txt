The spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD is known to be linked to a
non-zero density of eigenvalues of the massless Dirac operator near the origin.
Numerical studies of two-flavour QCD now suggest that the low quark modes are
locally coherent to a certain extent. As a consequence, the modes can be
simultaneously deflated, using local projectors, with a total computational
effort proportional to the lattice volume (rather than its square). Deflation
has potentially many uses in lattice QCD. The technique is here worked out for
the case of quark propagator calculations, where large speed-up factors and a
flat scaling behaviour with respect to the quark mass are achieved.
