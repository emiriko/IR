We propose a method for finding gaps in the spectrum of a differential
operator. When applied to the one-dimensional Hamiltonian of the quartic
oscillator, a simple algebraic algorithm is proposed that, step by step,
separates with a remarkable precision all the energies even for a double-well
configuration in a tunnelling regime. Our strategy may be refined and
generalised to a large class of 1d-problems.
