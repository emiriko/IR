This paper presents the results of searches for the flavor-changing neutral
current, lepton-number-violating and lepton-flavor-violating processes in the
charm mesons decays. Recent results from charged $D$ mesons decays to final
states with dielectrons from CLEO-c are reported. The prospects of the searches
for the rare charm decays at BES-III are also discussed.
