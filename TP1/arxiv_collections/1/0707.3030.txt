This work aims at optimizing injection networks, which consist in adding a
set of long-range links (called bypass links) in mobile multi-hop ad hoc
networks so as to improve connectivity and overcome network partitioning. To
this end, we rely on small-world network properties, that comprise a high
clustering coefficient and a low characteristic path length. We investigate the
use of two genetic algorithms (generational and steady-state) to optimize three
instances of this topology control problem and present results that show
initial evidence of their capacity to solve it.
