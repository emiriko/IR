We perform a global fits to charmless $B \to PP$ decays which independently
constrain the $(\bar\rho,\bar\eta)$ vertex of the unitarity triangle. The
fitted amplitudes and phase are used to predict the branching ratios and CP
asymmetries of all decay modes, including those of the $B_s$ system. Different
schemes of SU(3) breaking in decay amplitude sizes are analyzed. The
possibility of having a new physics contribution to $K \pi$ decays is also
discussed.
