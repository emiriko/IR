Numerical results for the polaron dispersion are presented for an arbitrary
number of space dimensions. Upper and lower bounds are calculated for the
dispersion curves. They are rather close to each other in the cases of small
electron-phonon couplings usual for real polar materials. To describe the
dispersion in other materials, we suggest a simple fitting formula which can be
applied at intermediate values of the Fr\"ohlich electron-phonon coupling
constant. Its validity is approved by the comparison with direct calculations
and previously obtained results. This makes our results not only reliable and
highly accurate but also easy reproducible.
