We consider the low energy spectrum of spin-1/2 two-dimensional triangular
lattice models subject to a ferromagnetic Heisenberg interaction and a three
spin chiral interaction of variable strength. Initially, we consider quasi-one
dimensional ladder systems of various geometries. Analytical results are
derived that yield the behavior of the ground states, their energies and the
transition points. The entanglement properties of the ground state of these
models are examined and we find that the entanglement depends on the lattice
geometry due to frustration effects. To this end, the chirality of a given
quantum state is used as a witness of tripartite entanglement. Finally, the two
dimensional model is investigated numerically by means of exact diagonalization
and indications are presented that the low energy sector is a chiral spin
liquid.
