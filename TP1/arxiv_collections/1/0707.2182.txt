This paper focuses on the design of multiplier-less decimation filters
suitable for oversampled digital signals. The aim is twofold. On one hand, it
proposes an optimization framework for the design of constituent decimation
filters in a general multistage decimation architecture. The basic building
blocks embedded in the proposed filters belong, for a simple reason, to the
class of cyclotomic polynomials (CPs): the first 104 CPs have a z-transfer
function whose coefficients are simply {-1,0,+1}. On the other hand, the paper
provides a bunch of useful techniques, most of which stemming from some key
properties of CPs, for designing the proposed filters in a variety of
architectures. Both recursive and non-recursive architectures are discussed by
focusing on a specific decimation filter obtained as a result of the
optimization algorithm.
  Design guidelines are provided with the aim to simplify the design of the
constituent decimation filters in the multistage chain.
