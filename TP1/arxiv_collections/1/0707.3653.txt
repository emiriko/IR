We couple a recently-established N=1 globally supersymmetric self-dual
Yang-Mills multiplet in three dimensions to supergravity. This becomes possible
due to our previous result on globally supersymmetric formulation based on a
compensator multiplet. We further couple the self-dual vector to a
supersymmetric sigma-model on the coset SO(8,n) / SO(8) X SO(n) via minimal
couplings for an arbitrary gauged subgroup H_0 \subset SO(8) X SO(n). A
corresponding superspace formulation is also presented.
