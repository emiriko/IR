We investigate a lattice model of polymers where the nearest-neighbour
monomer-monomer interaction strengths differ according to whether the local
configurations have so-called ``hydrogen-like'' formations or not. If the
interaction strengths are all the same then the classical $\theta$-point
collapse transition occurs on lowering the temperature, and the polymer enters
the isotropic liquid-drop phase known as the collapsed globule. On the other
hand, strongly favouring the hydrogen-like interactions give rise to an
anisotropic folded (solid-like) phase on lowering the temperature. We use Monte
Carlo simulations up to a length of 256 to map out the phase diagram in the
plane of parameters and determine the order of the associated phase
transitions. We discuss the connections to semi-flexible polymers and other
polymer models. Importantly, we demonstrate that for a range of energy
parameters two phase transitions occur on lowering the temperature, the second
being a transition from the globule state to the crystal state. We argue from
our data that this globule-to-crystal transition is continuous in two
dimensions in accord with field-theory arguments concerning Hamiltonian walks,
but is first order in three dimensions.
