We make use of the nonlinear Riemann Hilbert problem of the dispersionless
Kadomtsev Petviashvili equation, i) to construct the longtime behaviour of the
solutions of its Cauchy problem; ii) to characterize a class of implicit
solutions; iii) to elucidate the spectral mechanism causing the gradient
catastrophe of localized solutions, at finite time as well as in the longtime
regime, and the corresponding universal behaviours near breaking.
