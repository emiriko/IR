We give the explicit wave functions of the $qqqq\bar{q}$ components of the
C=+1, J=1/2 charmed baryons, $\Sigma_{c}$, $\Lambda_{c}$ and $\Xi_{c}^{a}$, and
calculate the magnetic moments by adding the 5q components contributions, and
we also compute the magnetic moments of the $\Sigma_{b}$ and $\Sigma_{b}^{*}$
baryons. The influence of the additional light and strange $q\bar{q}$ pairs is
investigated. It's obvious that the constituent quark masses of the charm and
beauty quarks are much heavier than that of the light and strange quarks,
consequently, the hidden flavor contributions to the baryons magnetic moments
may be significant. What is interesting is that the inclusion of the
$qqqq\bar{q}$ components contributions leads to different $\Lambda^{+}_{c}$,
$\Xi^{a+}_{c}$ and $\Xi^{a0}_{c}$ magnetic moments, all of which are predicted
to be the same value $0.38\mu_{N}$ on the basis of the classical qqq quark
model. And it's shown that the differences of these magnetic moments are
independent of the constituent mass of the charm quark.
