We derive the most general Seiberg-Witten maps for noncommutative gauge
theories in second order of the noncommutative parameter theta. Our results
reveal the existence of more ambiguities than previously known. In particular,
we demonstrate that some of these ambiguities enter observables like scattering
cross sections and enlarge the parameter space of the noncommutative standard
model beyond O(theta).
