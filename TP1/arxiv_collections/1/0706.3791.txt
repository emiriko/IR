Protecting secure random key from eavesdropping in quantum key distribution
protocols has been well developed. In this letter, we further study how to
detect and eliminate eavesdropping on the random base string in such protocols.
The correlation between the base string and the key enables Alice and Bob to
use specific privacy amplification to distill and reuse the previously shared
base string with unconditional security and high efficiency. The analysis of
the unconditional secure reusable base string brings about new concept and
protocol design technique.
