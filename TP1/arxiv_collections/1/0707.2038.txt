We show that one can cool a micro-mechanical oscillator to its quantum ground
state using radiation pressure in an appropriately detuned cavity
(self-cooling). From a simple theory based on Heisenberg-Langevin equations we
find that optimal self-cooling occurs in the good cavity regime, when the
cavity bandwidth is smaller than the mechanical frequency, but still larger
than the effective mechanical damping. In this case the intracavity field and
the vibrational mechanical mode coherently exchange their fluctuations. We also
present dynamical calculations which show how to access the mirror final
temperature from the fluctuations of the field reflected by the cavity.
