The physics of randomness and regularities for languages (mother tongues) and
their lifetimes and family trees and for the second languages are studied in
terms of two opposite processes; random multiplicative noise [1], and
fragmentation [2], where the original model is given in the matrix format. We
start with a random initial world, and come out with the regularities, which
mimic various empirical data [3] for the present languages.
