We study a tunnel junction consisting of two thin-film s-wave superconductors
separated by a thin, insulating barrier in the presence of misaligned in-plane
exchange fields. We find an interesting interplay between the superconducting
phase difference and the relative orientation of the exchange fields,
manifested in the Josephson current across the junction. Specifically, this may
be written $I_\text{J}^\text{C} = (I_0+I_m ~ \cos\phi) \sin\Delta\theta$, where
I_0 and I_m are constants, and $\phi$ is the relative orientation of the
exchange fields while $\Delta\theta$ is the superconducting phase difference.
Similar results have recently been obtained in other S/I/S junctions coexisting
with helimagnetic or ferromagnetic order. We calculate the superconducting
order parameter self-consistently, and investigate quantitatively the effect
which the misaligned exchange fields constitute on the Josephson current, to
see if I_m may have an appreciable effect on the Josephson current. It is found
that I_0 and I_m become comparable in magnitude at sufficiently low
temperatures and fields close to the critical value, in agreement with previous
work. From our analytical results, it then follows that the Josephson current
in the present system may be controlled in a well-defined manner by a rotation
of the exchange fields on both sides of the junction. We discuss a possible
experimental realization of this proposition.
