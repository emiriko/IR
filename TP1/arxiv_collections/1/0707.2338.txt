We show that starting with the fact that special relativity theory is
concerned with a distortion of the observed length of a moving rod, without
mentioning if it is a "contraction" or "dilation", we can derive the Lorentz
transformations for the spacetime coordinates of the same event. This
derivation is based on expressing the length of the moving rod as a sum of
components with all the lengths involved in this summation being measured by
the observers of the same inertial reference frame.
