Recently the general form of a translation-covariant quantum Boltzmann
equation has been derived which describes the dynamics of a tracer particle in
a quantum gas. We develop a stochastic wave function algorithm that enables
full three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations of this equation. The simulation
method is used to study the approach to equilibrium for various scattering
cross sections and to determine dynamical deviations from Gaussian statistics
through an investigation of higher-order cumulants. Moreover, we examine the
loss of coherence of superpositions of momentum eigenstates and determine the
corresponding decoherence time scales to quantify the transition from quantum
to classical behavior of the state of the test particle.
