This is an opening talk for the workshop and is intended to be provocative.
We take a stab at the following questions: How well do we really know the sides
of the unitarity triangle? What else could we do to improve? (I propose several
new measurements). What precision should we ultimately aim at in the
determination of CKM elements? What have we learned so far about flavor
physics? Where do we go from here?
