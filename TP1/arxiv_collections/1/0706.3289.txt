We study theoretically the quantum dynamics of an electron in the
singlyionized double-donor structure in the semiconductor host under the
influence of laser pulses whose frequencies are close to structure resonant
frequencies. This system can be used as a charge qubit where the logical states
are defined by the lowest two energy states of the remaining valence electron
localized around one or another donor. The quantum operations are performed via
resonant or Raman-like transitions between the localized (qubit) states and the
excited states delocalized over the structure, combined with phase shifts
between qubit states generated by voltage pulses. The possibility of
realization of arbitrary single-qubit rotations is demonstrated.
