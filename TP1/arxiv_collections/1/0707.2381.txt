Current steps in the current-voltage characteristics of wide superconducting
Sn films exposed to a microwave irradiation were observed in the resistive
state with phase slip lines. The behaviour of the magnitude of the steps on the
applied irradiation power was found to be similar to that for the current steps
in narrow superconducting channels with phase slip centers and, to some extent,
for the Shapiro steps in Josephson junctions. This provides evidence for the
Josephson properties of the phase slip lines in wide superconducting films and
supports the assumption about similarity between the processes of phase slip in
wide and narrow films.
