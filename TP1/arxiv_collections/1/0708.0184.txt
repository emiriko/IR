We consider quantum walks on the cycle in the non-stationary case where the
`coin' operation is allowed to change at each time step. We characterize, in
algebraic terms, the set of possible state transfers and prove that, as opposed
to the stationary case, it is possible to asymnptotically reach a uniform
distribution among the nodes of the associated graph.
