We use newly discovered N = (2, 2) vector multiplets to clarify T-dualities
for generalized Kahler geometries. Following the usual procedure, we gauge
isometries of nonlinear sigma-models and introduce Lagrange multipliers that
constrain the field-strengths of the gauge fields to vanish. Integrating out
the Lagrange multipliers leads to the original action, whereas integrating out
the vector multiplets gives the dual action. The description is given both in N
= (2, 2) and N = (1, 1) superspace.
