The aim of this paper is to construct a natural Riemann-Lagrange differential
geometry on 1-jet spaces, in the sense of nonlinear connections, generalized
Cartan connections, d-torsions, d-curvatures, jet electromagnetic fields and
jet Yang-Mills energies, starting from some given non-linear evolution DEs
systems modelling economic phenomena, like the Kaldor model of the bussines
cycle or the Tobin-Benhabib-Miyao model regarding the role of money on economic
growth.
