We employ conditional Tsallis q entropies to study the separability of
symmetric one parameter W and GHZ multiqubit mixed states. The strongest
limitation on separability is realized in the limit q-->infinity, and is found
to be much superior to the condition obtained using the von Neumann conditional
entropy (q=1 case). Except for the example of two qubit and three qubit
symmetric states of GHZ family, the $q$-conditional entropy method leads to
sufficient - but not necessary - conditions on separability.
