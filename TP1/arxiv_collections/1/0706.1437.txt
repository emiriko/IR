We analyze the time resolved spike statistics of a solitary and two mutually
interacting chaotic semiconductor lasers whose chaos is characterized by
apparently random, short intensity spikes. Repulsion between two successive
spikes is observed, resulting in a refractory period which is largest at laser
threshold. For time intervals between spikes greater than the refractory
period, the distribution of the intervals follows a Poisson distribution. The
spiking pattern is highly periodic over time windows corresponding to the
optical length of the external cavity, with a slow change of the spiking
pattern as time increases. When zero-lag synchronization between the two lasers
is established, the statistics of the nearly perfectly matched spikes are not
altered. The similarity of these features to those found in complex interacting
neural networks, suggests the use of laser systems as simpler physical models
for neural networks.
