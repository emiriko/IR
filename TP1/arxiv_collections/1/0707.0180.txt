Based on measurements of soft x-ray magnetic diffraction under in-situ
applied electric field, wereport on significantly manipulation and exciting of
commensurate magnetic order in multiferroic ErMn2O5. The induced magnetic
scattering intensity arises at the commensurate magnetic Bragg position whereas
the initial magnetic signal almost persists. We demonstrate the possibility to
imprint a magnetic response function in ErMn2O5 by applying electric field.
