Dynamic response of two-dimensional electron systems with spin-orbit
interaction is studied theoretically on the basis of quantum kinetic equation,
taking into account elastic scattering of electrons. The spin polarization and
spin current induced by the applied electric field are calculated for the whole
class of electron systems described by p-linear spin-orbit Hamiltonians. The
absence of nonequilibrium intrinsic static spin currents is confirmed for these
systems with arbitrary (nonparabolic) electron energy spectrum. Relations
between the spin polarization, spin current, and electric current are
established. The general results are applied to the quantum wells grown in
[001] and [110] crystallographic directions, with both Rashba and Dresselhaus
types of spin-orbit coupling. It is shown that the existence of the fixed
(momentum-independent) precession axes in [001]-grown wells with equal Rashba
and Dresselhaus spin velocities or in symmetric [110]-grown wells leads to
vanishing spin polarizability at arbitrary frequency of the applied electric
field. This property is explained by the absence of Dyakonov-Perel-Kachorovskii
spin relaxation for the spins polarized along these precession axes. As a
result, a considerable frequency dispersion of spin polarization at very low
frequency in the vicinity of the fixed precession axes is predicted. Possible
effects of extrinsic spin-orbit coupling on the obtained results are discussed.
