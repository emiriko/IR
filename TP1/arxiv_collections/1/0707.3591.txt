Properties of the Roper resonance, the first scalar excitation of the
nucleon, are determined. Pole positions and residues of the $P_{11}$ partial
wave are studied in a combined analysis of pion- and photo-induced reactions.
We find the Roper pole at $\{(1371\pm7)-i(92\pm10)\}$ MeV and an elasticity of
$0.61\pm 0.03$. The largest decay coupling is found for the $N\sigma$
($\sigma=(\pi\pi)$-$S$-wave). The analysis is based on new data on $\gamma p\to
p\pi^0\pi^0$ for photons in the energy range from the two-pion threshold to 820
MeV from TAPS at Mainz and from 0.4 to 1.3 GeV from Crystal Barrel at Bonn and
includes further data from other experiments. The partial wave analysis
excludes the possibility that the Roper resonance is split into two states with
different partial decay widths.
