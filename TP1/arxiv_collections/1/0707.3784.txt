We derive a low-energy effective model of metallic zigzag carbon nanotubes at
half filling. We show that there are three important features characterizing
the low-energy properties of these systems: the long-range Coulomb interaction,
umklapp scattering and an explicit dimerization generated by interactions. The
ratio of the dimerization induced gap and the Mott gap induced by the umklapp
interactions is dependent on the radius of the nanotube and can drive the
system through a quantum phase transition with SU(2)_1 quantum symmetry. We
consider the physical properties of the phases on either side of this
transition which should be relevant for realistic nanotubes.
