By performing high-resolution two-color photoassociation spectroscopy, we
have successfully determined the binding energies of several of the last bound
states of the homonuclear dimers of six different isotopes of ytterbium. These
spectroscopic data are in excellent agreement with theoretical calculations
based on a simple model potential, which very precisely predicts the s-wave
scattering lengths of all 28 pairs of the seven stable isotopes. The s-wave
scattering lengths for collision of two atoms of the same isotopic species are
13.33(18) nm for ^{168}Yb, 3.38(11) nm for ^{170}Yb, -0.15(19) nm for ^{171}Yb,
-31.7(3.4) nm for ^{172}Yb, 10.55(11) nm for ^{173}Yb, 5.55(8) nm for ^{174}Yb,
and -1.28(23) nm for ^{176}Yb. The coefficient of the lead term of the
long-range van der Waals potential of the Yb_2 molecule is C_6=1932(30) atomic
units $(E_h a_0^6 \approx 9.573\times 10^{-26}$ J nm^6).
