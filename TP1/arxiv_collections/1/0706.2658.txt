We have investigated shot noise in multiterminal, diffusive multiwalled
carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) at 4.2 K over the frequency f = 600 - 850 MHz.
Quantitative comparison of our data to semiclassical theory, based on
non-equilibrium distribution functions, indicates that a major part of the
noise is caused by a non-equilibrium state imposed by the contacts. Our data
exhibits non-local shot noise across weakly transmitting contacts while a
low-impedance contact eliminates such noise almost fully. We obtain F_{tube}<
0.03 for the intrinsic Fano factor of our MWNTs.
