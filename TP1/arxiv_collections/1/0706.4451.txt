In this paper we explore a possibility that all transport turbulent models
are contained in a coarse-grained kinetic equation. Building on a recent work
by H.Chen et al (2004), we account for fluctuations of a single -point
probability density in turbulence, by introducing a``two-level'' (${\bf
c,v}$)-phase-space, separating microscopic (${\bf c'\equiv c_{micro}= c-v}$)
and hydrodynamic (${\bf v'=v-V}$) modes. Unlike traditional kinetic theories,
with hydrodynamic approximations derived in terms of small deviations from
thermodynamic equilibrium, the theory developed in this work, is based on a
far- from -equilibrium isotropic and homogeneous turbulence as an unperturbed
state. The expansion in dimensionless rate of strain leads to a new class of
turbulent models, including the well-known ${\cal K}-{\cal E}$, Reynolds stress
and all possible nonlinear models. The role of interaction of the fluxes in
physical space with the energy flux across the scales, not present in standard
modeling, is demonstrated on example of turbulent channel flow. To close the
system, neither equation for turbulent kinetic energy nor information on
pressure-velocity correlations, contained in the derived coarse-grained kinetic
equation, are needed.
