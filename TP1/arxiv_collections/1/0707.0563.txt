Transition-metal oxides exhibiting a bistable resistance state are attractive
for non-volatile memory applications. The relevance of oxygen vacancies (VO)
for the resistance-change memory was investigated with x-ray fluorescence,
infrared microscopy, and x-ray absorption spectroscopy using Cr-doped SrTiO3 as
example. We propose that the microscopic origin of resistance switching in this
class of materials is due to an oxygen-vacancy drift occurring in close
proximity to one of the electrodes.
