Based on the color-spin interaction in diquarks, we argue that charmed
multiquark hadrons are likely to exist. Because of the appreciable number of
charm quarks produced in central nucleus-nucleus collisions at
ultrarelativistic energies, production of charmed multiquark hadrons is
expected to be enhanced in these collisions. Using both the quark coalescence
model and the statistical hadronization model, we estimate the yield of charmed
tetraquark meson $T_{cc}$ and pentaquark baryon $\Theta_{cs}$ in heavy ion
collisions at RHIC and LHC. We further discuss the decay modes of these charmed
exotic hadrons in order to facilitate their detections in experiments.
