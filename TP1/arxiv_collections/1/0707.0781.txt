The vacuum-driven nonperturbative factors $L_i$ for quark and gluon Green's
functions are shown to define the nonperturbative dynamics of QGP in the
leading approximation. EoS obtained recently in the framework of this approach
is compared in detail with known lattice data for $\mu=0$ including $P/T^4$,
$\epsilon/T^4$, $\frac{\epsilon-3P}{T^4}$. The basic role in the dynamics at
$T\la 3T_c$ is played by the factors $L_i$ which are approximately equal to the
modulus of Polyakov line for quark $L_{fund}$ and gluon $L_{adj}$. The
properties of $L_i$ are derived from field correlators and compared to lattice
data, in particular the Casimir scaling property $L_{adj}
=(L_{fund})^{\frac{C_2(adj)}{C_2(fund)}}$ follows in the Gaussian approximation
valid for small vacuum correlation lengths. Resulting curves for $P/T^4$,
$\epsilon/T^4$, $\frac{\epsilon-3P}{T^4}$ are in a reasonable agreement with
lattice data, the remaining difference points out to an effective attraction
among QGP constituents.
