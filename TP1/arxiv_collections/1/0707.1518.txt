In the axionic solution of the strong CP problem, fermions which transform
under quantum chromodynamics (QCD) are required. In supersymmetry, by equating
U(1)_{PQ} with U(1)_R, the natural candidates are the gluinos, as pointed out
some years ago. A new specific implementation of this idea is proposed, linking
the gluino axion scale to that of the canonical seesaw mechanism for neutrinos.
Gaugino masses are generated dynamically and the A term is predicted to be very
small.
