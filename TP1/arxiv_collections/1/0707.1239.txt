Recently we have shown that exclusive QCD photon-induced reactions at low
Mandelstam-t are best described by Regge exchanges in the entire scaling
region, and not only for low values of Bjorken-x. In this paper we explore this
crucial Regge behavior in Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering from the point of
view of collinear factorization, with the proton tensor written in terms of
Generalized Parton Distributions, and we reproduce this feature. Thus it
appears that in the Bjorken limit, a large class of hard, low-t exclusive
processes are more sensitive to the meson cloud of the proton than to its
fundamental quark structure. These process will then be described most
efficiently by process-dependent Regge Exclusive Amplitudes rather than by
universal Generalized Parton Distributions. We introduce such Regge Exclusive
Amplitudes for Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering.
