In this letter we study the process of gluon fusion into a pair of Higgs
bosons in a model with one universal extra dimension. We find that the
contributions from the extra top quark Kaluza-Klein excitations lead to a Higgs
pair production cross section at the LHC that can be significantly altered
compared to the Standard Model value for small values of the compactification
scale.
