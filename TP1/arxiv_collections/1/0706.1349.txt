An improved quark mass density- dependent model with the non-linear scalar
sigma field and the $\omega$-meson field is presented. We show that the present
model can describe saturation properties, the equation of state, the
compressibility and the effective nuclear mass of nuclear matter under mean
field approximation successfully. The comparison of the present model and the
quark-meson coupling model is addressed.
