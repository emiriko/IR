There are several different experimental indications, such as the strangeness
contribution to the magnetic moment of the proton, sigma_{\pi N} term, strange
spin polarization, ratio of strange and non strange quark flavor distributions
which suggest that the nucleon contains a hidden strangeness component which is
contradictory to the naive constituent quark model. Chiral constituent quark
model with configuration mixing (\chiCQM_{{\rm config}}) is known to provide a
satisfactory explanation of the ``proton spin problem'' and related issues. In
the present work, we have extended the model to carry out the calculations for
the parameters pertaining to the strange quark content of the nucleon, for
example, the strange spin polarization \Delta s, strange components of the weak
axial vector form factors \Delta \Sigma and \Delta_8 as well as F and D,
strangeness magnetic moment of the proton \mu_p^s, the strange quark content in
the nucleon f_s coming from the \sigma_{\pi N} term, the ratios between strange
and non-strange quarks \frac{2 s}{u+d} and \frac{2 s}{\bar u+ \bar d},
contribution of strangeness to angular momentum sum rule etc.. Our result
demonstrates the broad consistency with the experimental observations as well
as other theoretical considerations.
