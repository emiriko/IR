We study entanglement in two coupled quartic oscillators. It is shown that
the entanglement, as measured by the von Neumann entropy, increases with the
classical chaos parameter for generic chaotic eigenstates. We consider certain
isolated periodic orbits whose bifurcation sequence affects a class of quantum
eigenstates, called the channel localized states. For these states, the
entanglement is a local minima in the vicinity of a pitchfork bifurcation but
is a local maxima near a anti-pitchfork bifurcation. We place these results in
the context of the close connections that may exist between entanglement
measures and conventional measures of localization that have been much studied
in quantum chaos and elsewhere. We also point to an interesting near-degeneracy
that arises in the spectrum of reduced density matrices of certain states as an
interplay of localization and symmetry.
