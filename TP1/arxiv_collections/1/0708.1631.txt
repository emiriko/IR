We compute the shear viscosity at leading order in hot Quantum
Electrodynamics. Starting from the Kubo relation for shear viscosity, we use
diagrammatic methods to write down the appropriate integral equations for
bosonic and fermionic effective vertices. We also show how Ward identities can
be used to put constraints on these integral equations. One of our main results
is an equation relating the kernels of the integral equations with functional
derivatives of the full self-energy; it is similar to what is obtained with
two-particle-irreducible effective action methods. However, since we use Ward
identities as our starting point, gauge invariance is preserved. Using these
constraints obtained from Ward identities and also power counting arguments, we
select the necessary diagrams that must be resummed at leading order. This
includes all non-collinear (corresponding to 2 to 2 scatterings) and collinear
(corresponding to 1+N to 2+N collinear scatterings) rungs responsible for the
Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect. We also show the equivalence between our
integral equations obtained from quantum field theory and the linearized
Boltzmann equations of Arnold, Moore and Yaffe obtained using effective kinetic
theory.
