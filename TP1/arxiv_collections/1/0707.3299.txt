The effect of random shooting of particles is considered on the basis of
solution of the Schrodinger equation and in terms of the Wigner function.
Two-particles description shows, in particular, that initial correlation leads
to high velocities of particles. This could be a potential mechanism for
obtaining energy. Evolution of the n-particle probability distribution is
descibed analytically.
