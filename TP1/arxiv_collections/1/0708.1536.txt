Scientific realism in classical (i.e. pre-quantum) physics has remained
compatible with the naive realism of everyday thinking on the whole; whereas it
has proven impossible to find any consistent way to visualize the world
underlying quantum theory in terms of our pictures in the everyday world. The
general conclusion is that in quantum theory naive realism, although necessary
at the level of observations, fails at the microscopic level. In this paper I
offer a counter view that what fails in quantum theory is naive realism at the
level of observations itself.
