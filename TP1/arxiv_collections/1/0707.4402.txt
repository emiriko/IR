We report on a calculation of the effects of supersymmetry on the
cross-section for top-antitop production at LHC. A numerical study is carried
out for the ten benchmarks of the Snowmass accord. It is found that the higher
order effects involving supersymmetric particles in internal loops can be as
high as 6%, both for the cross-section and the (parity even) helicity
asymmetry, for one particular benchmark. For other benchmarks smaller but
nonetheless observable corrections are found.
