A second-order Taylor series expansion of the free energy functional provides
analytical expressions for the magnetic field dependence of the free energy and
of the magnetization of ferrofluids, here modelled by dipolar Yukawa
interaction potentials. The corresponding hard core dipolar Yukawa reference
fluid is studied within the framework of the mean spherical approximation. Our
findings for the magnetic and phase equilibrium properties are in quantitative
agreement with previously published and new Monte Carlo simulation data.
