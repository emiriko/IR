We report high resolution transmission electron microscopy and ab initio
calculation results for the defect formation in Pt nanocontacts (NCs). Our
results show that there is a size limit to the existence of twins (extended
structural defects). Defects are always present but blocked away from the tip
axes. The twins may act as scattering plane, influencing contact electron
transmission for Pt NC at room temperature and Ag/Au NC at low temperature.
