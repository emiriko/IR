Recently we showed that a simple model of network rewiring could be solved
exactly for any time and any parameter value. We also showed that this model
can be recast in terms of several well known models of statistical physics such
as Urn model and the Voter model. We also noted that it has been applied to a
wide range of problems. Here we consider various generalisations of this model
and include some new exact results.
