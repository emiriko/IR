Recently some papers in the literature have shown the presence and importance
of the so-called {}"magnetic" components of gravitational waves (GWs), which
have to be taken into account in the context of the total response functions of
interferometers for GWs propagating from arbitrary directions. In this paper
the response functions for the magnetic components are re-analysed in the full
frequency dependence answering to the question of the title.
