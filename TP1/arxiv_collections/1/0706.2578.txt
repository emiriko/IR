We study the $e^{\pm}\mu^{\mp} + E^{miss}_T$ and $l^+l^- + E^{miss}_T$
signatures $(l = e, \mu)$ for different values of $\tan\beta$ in the mSUGRA
model. With $\tan\beta$ rising, we observe a characteristic change in the shape
of dilepton mass spectra in $l^+l^- + E^{miss}_T $ versus $e^{\pm}\mu^{\mp}$
final states reflecting the decrease of $\tilde{\chi}^0_2 \to l^+l^-
\tilde{\chi^0_1}$ branching ratio. We also study the non mSUGRA modifications
of the CMS test point LM1 with arbitrary relations among gaugino and higgsino
masses. For such modifications of the mSUGRA test point LM1 the number of
lepton events depends rather strongly on the relations among gaugino and
higgsino masses and in some modifications of the test point LM1 the signatures
with leptons and $E_{T}^{miss}$ do not lead to the SUSY discovery and the
single SUSY discovery signature remains the signature with $n \geq 2 jets +
E^{miss}_T + no leptons$.
