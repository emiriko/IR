We study a class of nonlinear kinetic Fokker-Planck type equations modeling
quantum particles which obey the Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics,
respectively. We establish the existence of classical solutions in the
perturbative regime and prove exponential convergence towards the equilibrium.
