Cross sections for the $\gamma p \to K^+ \Lambda$ have been measured at
backward angles using linearly polarized photons in the range 1.50 to 2.37 GeV.
In addition, the beam asymmetry for this reaction has been measured for the
first time at backward angles. The $\Lambda$ was detected at forward angles in
the LEPS spectrometer via its decay to $p\pi^-$ and the K^+ was inferred using
the technique of missing mass. These measurements, corresponding to kaons at
far backward angles in the center-of-mass frame, complement similar CLAS data
at other angles. Comparison with theoretical models shows that the reactions in
these kinematics provide further opportunities to investigate the reaction
mechanisms of hadron dynamics.
