In this article, we study the Coulomb corrections to the Delbrueck scattering
amplitude. We consider the limit when the energy of the photon is much less
than the electron mass. The calculations are carried out in the coordinate
representation using the exact relativistic Green function of an electron in a
Coulomb field. The resulting relative corrections are of the order of a few
percent for scattering on for a large charge of the nucleus. We compare the
corrections with the corresponding ones calculated through the dispersion
integral of the pair production cross section and also with the magnetic loop
contribution to the g-factor of a bound electron. The last one is in a good
agreement with our results but the corrections calculated through the
dispersion relation are not.
