We introduce an approach to inferring the causal architecture of stochastic
dynamical systems that extends rate distortion theory to use causal
shielding---a natural principle of learning. We study two distinct cases of
causal inference: optimal causal filtering and optimal causal estimation.
  Filtering corresponds to the ideal case in which the probability distribution
of measurement sequences is known, giving a principled method to approximate a
system's causal structure at a desired level of representation. We show that,
in the limit in which a model complexity constraint is relaxed, filtering finds
the exact causal architecture of a stochastic dynamical system, known as the
causal-state partition. From this, one can estimate the amount of historical
information the process stores. More generally, causal filtering finds a graded
model-complexity hierarchy of approximations to the causal architecture. Abrupt
changes in the hierarchy, as a function of approximation, capture distinct
scales of structural organization.
  For nonideal cases with finite data, we show how the correct number of
underlying causal states can be found by optimal causal estimation. A
previously derived model complexity control term allows us to correct for the
effect of statistical fluctuations in probability estimates and thereby avoid
over-fitting.
