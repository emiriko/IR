We examine the generic phase behavior of high-Tc cuprate superconductors in
terms a universal van Hove singularity in the strongly overdoped region. Using
a rigid ARPES-derived dispersion we solve the BCS gap equation and show that
the pairing interaction or pairing energy cutoff must be a rapidly declining
function of doping. This result is prejudicial to a phonon-based pairing
interaction and more consistent with a magnetic or magnetically enhanced
interaction.
