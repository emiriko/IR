An exact expression for the distribution of the area swept out by a drifted
Brownian motion till its first-passage time is derived. A study of the
asymptotic behaviour confirms earlier conjectures and clarifies their range of
validity. The analysis also leads to a simple closed-form solution for the
moments of the Airy distribution.
