We report experimental measurements of the transmission spectrum of an
optical cavity coupled with cold Rb atoms. We observe the multi-atom vacuum
Rabi splitting of a composite cavity and atom system. When a coupling field is
applied to the atoms and induces the resonant two-photon Raman transition with
the cavity field in a Lamda-type three-level system, we observe a cavity
transmission spectrum with two vacuum Rabi sidebands and a central peak
representing the intracavity dark state. The central peak linewidth is
significantly narrowed by the dark-state resonance and its position is
insensitive to the frequency change of the empty cavity.
