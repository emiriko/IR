A Yukawa-Higgs model with Ginsparg-Wilson (GW) fermions, proposed recently by
Bhattacharya, Martin and Poppitz as a possible lattice formulation of chiral
gauge theories, is studied. A simple argument shows that the gauge boson always
acquires mass by the St\"uckelberg (or, in a broad sense, Higgs) mechanism,
regardless of strength of interactions. The gauge symmetry is spontaneously
broken. When the gauge coupling constant is small, the physical spectrum of the
model consists of massless fermions, massive fermions and \emph{massive} vector
bosons.
