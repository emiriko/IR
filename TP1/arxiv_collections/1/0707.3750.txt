The fold recognition methods are promissing tools for capturing the structure
of a protein by its amino acid residues sequence but their use is still
restricted by the needs of huge computational resources and suitable efficient
algorithms as well. In the recent version of FROST (Fold Recognition Oriented
Search Tool) package the most efficient algorithm for solving the Protein
Threading Problem (PTP) is implemented due to the strong collaboration between
the SYMBIOSE group in IRISA and MIG in Jouy-en-Josas. In this paper, we present
the diverse components of FROST, emphasizing on the recent advances in
formulating and solving new versions of the PTP and on the way of solving on a
computer cluster a million of instances in a easonable time.
