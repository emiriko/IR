Certain proposed extended Bose-Hubbard models may exhibit topologically
ordered ground states with excitations obeying non-Abelian braid statistics. A
sufficient tuning of Hubbard parameters could yield excitation braiding rules
allowing implementation of a universal set of topologically protected quantum
gates. We discuss potential difficulties in realizing a model with a proposed
non-Abelian topologically ordered ground state using optical lattices
containing bosonic dipoles. Our direct implementation scheme does not realize
the necessary anisotropic hopping, anisotropic interactions, and low
temperatures.
