Combining analytical and numerical methods, we study within the framework of
the homogeneous non-linear Boltzmann equation, a broad class of models relevant
for the dynamics of dissipative fluids, including granular gases. We use the
new method presented in a previous paper [J. Stat. Phys. 124, 549 (2006)] and
extend our results to a different heating mechanism, namely a deterministic
non-linear friction force. We derive analytically the high energy tail of the
velocity distribution and compare the theoretical predictions with high
precision numerical simulations. Stretched exponential forms are obtained when
the non-equilibrium steady state is stable. We derive sub-leading corrections
and emphasize their relevance. In marginal stability cases, power-law behaviors
arise, with exponents obtained as the roots of transcendental equations. We
also consider some simple BGK (Bhatnagar, Gross, Krook) models, driven by
similar heating devices, to test the robustness of our predictions.
