We report on the first experimental demonstration of purification of
nonclassical continuous variable states. The protocol uses two copies of
phase-diffused states overlapped on a beam splitter and provides Gaussified,
less mixed states with the degree of squeezing improved. The protocol uses only
linear optical devices such as beam splitters and homodyne detection, thereby
proving these optical elements can be used for successful purification of this
type of state decoherence which occurs in optical transmission channels.
