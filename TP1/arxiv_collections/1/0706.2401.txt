We propose a unified explanation for the origin of dark matter and baryon
number asymmetry on the basis of a non-supersymmetric model for neutrino
masses. Neutrino masses are generated in two distinct ways, that is, a
tree-level seesaw mechanism with a single right-handed neutrino, and one-loop
radiative effects by a new additional doublet scalar. A spontaneously broken
U(1)$^\prime$ brings a $Z_2$ symmetry which restricts couplings of this new
scalar and controls the neutrino masses. It also guarantees the stability of a
CDM candidate. We examine two possible candidate for the CDM. We also show that
the decay of a heavy right-handed neutrino related to the seesaw mechanism can
generate baryon number asymmetry through leptogenesis.
