We study the suppression of electron localization due to the screening of
disorder in a Hubbard-Anderson model. We focus on the change of the electron
localization length at the Fermi level within a static picture, where
interactions are absorbed into the redefinition of the random on-site energies.
Two different approximations are presented, either one yielding a nonmonotonic
dependence of the localization length on the interaction strength, with a
pronounced maximum at an intermediate interaction strength. In spite of its
simplicity, our approach is in good agreement with recent numerical results.
