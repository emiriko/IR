In this paper we illustrate the dynamics of the instanton representation in
the description of vacuum GR in minisuperspace for undensitized variables. We
uncover a new class of general solutions in both the degenerate and the
nondegenerate sectors of the theory. Additionally, the individual sectors are
preserved under Hamiltonian evolution. Finally, we present an algorithm for
constructing general solutions by expansion about the isotropic sector.
