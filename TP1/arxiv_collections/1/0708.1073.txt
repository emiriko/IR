We present an application of error theory using Dirichlet Forms in linear
partial differential equations (LPDE). We study the transmission of an
uncertainty on the terminal condition to the solution of the LPDE thanks to the
decomposition of the solution on a wavelets basis. We analyze the basic
properties and a particular class of LPDE where the wavelets bases show their
powerful, the combination of error theory and wavelets basis justifies some
hypotheses, helpful to simplify the computation.
