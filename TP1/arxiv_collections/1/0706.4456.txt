We present predictions for the nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow
of D and B mesons, as well as of their decay electrons, in semicentral Pb-Pb
collisions at the LHC. Heavy quarks are propagated in a Quark-Gluon Plasma
using a relativistic Langevin simulation with drag and diffusion coefficients
from elastic interactions with light anti-/quarks and gluons, including
non-perturbative resonance scattering. Hadronization at T_c is performed within
a combined coalescence-fragmentation scheme.
