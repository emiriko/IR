We parallelize density-matrix renormalization group to directly extend it to
2-dimensional ($n$-leg) quantum lattice models. The parallelization is made
mainly on the exact diagonalization for the superblock Hamiltonian since the
part requires an enormous memory space as the leg number $n$ increases. The
superblock Hamiltonian is divided into three parts, and the correspondent
superblock vector is transformed into a matrix, whose elements are uniformly
distributed into processors. The parallel efficiency shows a high rate as the
number of the states kept $m$ increases, and the eigenvalue converges within
only a few sweeps in contrast to the multichain algorithm.
