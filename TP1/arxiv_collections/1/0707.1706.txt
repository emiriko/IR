Jets in hadron collisions are very complicated with a long learning curve
replete with errors. In relativistic heavy ion (RHI) collisions, it is likely
that jets will be much more complicated with an even longer and more difficult
learning curve. Hard scattering is more easily observed via single particle and
few particle correlation measurements. The main advantage of jets is higher
rate at large $p_T$, plus the possibility of detailed studies of soft
fragmentation if the soft fragments can be separated from the background. A
critical review of the possibility of using jets as a probe of hard-scattering
in RHI collisions is presented along with other probes and measurements which
the author considers much more likely to reveal the interesting physics in
Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. Finally, a list of unanswered questions raised by
results at RHIC is presented.
