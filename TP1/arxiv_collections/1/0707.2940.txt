Unlike standard quantum mechanics, dynamical reduction models assign no
particular a priori status to `measurement processes', `apparata', and
`observables', nor self-adjoint operators and positive operator valued measures
enter the postulates defining these models. In this paper, we show why and how
the Hilbert-space operator formalism, which standard quantum mechanics
postulates, can be derived from the fundamental evolution equation of dynamical
reduction models. Far from having any special ontological meaning, we show that
within the dynamical reduction context the operator formalism is just a compact
and convenient way to express the statistical properties of the outcomes of
experiments.
