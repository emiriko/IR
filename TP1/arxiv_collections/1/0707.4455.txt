Form invariance transformations can be used for constructing phantom
cosmologies starting with conventional cosmological models. In this work we
reconsider the scalar field case and extend the discussion to fermionic fields,
where the "phantomization" process exhibits a new class of possible accelerated
regimes. As an application we analyze the cosmological constant group for a
fermionic seed fluid.
