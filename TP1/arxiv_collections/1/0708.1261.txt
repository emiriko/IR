We investigate the dynamics of super-inflation in two versions of Loop
Quantum Cosmology, one in which the Friedmann equation is modified by the
presence of inverse volume corrections, and one in which quadratic corrections
are important. Computing the tilt of the power spectrum of the perturbed scalar
field in terms of fast-roll parameters, we conclude that the first case leads
to a power spectrum that is scale invariant for steep power law negative
potentials and for the second case, scale invariance is obtained for positive
potentials that asymptote to a constant value for large values of the scalar
field. It is found that in both cases, the horizon problem is solved with only
a few e-folds of super-inflationary evolution.
