The Ashtekar-Barbero constraints for General Relativity with fermions are
derived from the Einstein-Cartan canonical theory rescaling the state
functional of the gravity-spinor coupled system by the exponential of the
Nieh-Yan functional. A one parameter quantization ambiguity naturally appears
and can be associated with the Immirzi parameter.
