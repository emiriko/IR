An antiferromagnetic (AF) spin fluctuation induced pairing model is proposed
for the electron-doped cuprate superconductors. It suggests that, similar to
the hole-doped side, the superconducting gap function is monotonic
d_{x^2-y^2}-wave and explains why the observed gap function has a nonmonotonic
d_{x^2-y^2}-wave behavior when an AF order is taken into account. Dynamical
spin susceptibility is calculated and shown to be in good agreement with the
experiment. This gives a strong support to the proposed model.
