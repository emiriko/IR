The process of secondary baryon production in pi(+-)p collisions at high
energies in the central and forward fragmentation regions is considered in the
framework of the Quark-Gluon String Model. The contribution of the
string-junction mechanism to the baryon production is analysed. The results of
numerical calculations are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data
on the Lambda/bar(Lambda) and p/bar(p)$ asymmetries.
