We investigate the quantum field theory of a Lorentz non-invariant model with
a massive nonlinear dispersion relation in Minkowski space. The model involves
some non-causal signals in the form of wave packets propagating with
super-luminal group velocities. To avoid the problems with causality we
characterize the causal sector of the theory by a cutoff condition excluding
all super-luminal group velocities. It is argued that in the causal theory
satisfying the energy positivity condition an Unruh's detector moving with a
constant velocity with respect to the preferred frame does not detect any
particle. But in a causal theory violating energy positivity, detection of a
field quanta occurs. We comment on the origin of this particle creation.
