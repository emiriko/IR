Geodesic rays of class C^{1,1} are constructed for any test configuration of
a positive line bundle L on X using resolution of singularities. The
construction reduces to finding a subsolution of the corresponding Monge-Ampere
equation. Geometrically, this is accomplished by the use a positive line bundle
on the resolution which is trivial outside of the exceptional divisor.
