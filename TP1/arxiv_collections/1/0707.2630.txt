OpenFMO framework, an open-source software (OSS) platform for Fragment
Molecular Orbital (FMO) method, is extended to multi-physics simulations (MPS).
After reviewing the several FMO implementations on distributed computer
environments, the subsequent development planning corresponding to MPS is
presented. It is discussed which should be selected as a scientific software,
lightweight and reconfigurable form or large and self-contained form.
