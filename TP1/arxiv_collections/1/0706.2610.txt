The band structure and optical dielectric function $\epsilon$ of
single-walled zigzag
[(3,0),(4,0),(5,0),(6,0),(8,0),(9,0),(12,0),(16,0),(20,0),(24,0)], armchair
[(3,3),(4,4),(5,5),(8,8),(12,12),(15,15)], and chiral
[(4,2),(6,2),(8,4),(10,4)] SiC-NTs as well as the single honeycomb SiC sheet
have been calculated within DFT with the LDA. It is found that all the SiC
nanotubes are semiconductors, except the ultrasmall (3,0) and (4,0) zigzag
tubes which are metallic. Furthermore, the band gap of the zigzag SiC-NTs which
is direct, may be reduced from that of the SiC sheet to zero by reducing the
diameter ($D$), though the band gap for all the SiC nanotubes with a diameter
larger than ~20 \AA$ $ is almost independent of diameter. For the electric
field parallel to the tube axis ($E\parallel \hat{z}$), the $\epsilon''$ for
all the SiC-NTs with a moderate diameter (say, $D$ $>$ 8 \AA$ $) in the
low-energy region (0~6 eV) consists of a single distinct peak at ~3 eV.
However, for the small diameter SiC nanotubes such as the (4,2),(4,4) SiC-NTs,
the $\epsilon''$ spectrum does deviate markedly from this general behavior. In
the high-energy region (from 6 eV upwards), the $\epsilon''$ for all the
SiC-NTs exhibit a broad peak centered at ~7 eV. For the electric field
perpendicular to the tube axis ($E\perp \hat{z}$), the $\epsilon''$ spectrum of
all the SiC-NTs except the (4,4), (3,0) and (4,0) nanotubes, in the low energy
region also consists of a pronounced peak at around 3 eV whilst in the
high-energy region is roughly made up of a broad hump starting from 6 eV. The
magnitude of the peaks is in general about half of the magnitude of the
corresponding ones for $E\parallel \hat{z}$.
