Manufacturing is using Virtual Reality tools to enhance the product life
cycle. Their definitions are still in flux and it is necessary to define their
connections. Thus, firstly, we will introduce more closely some definitions
where we will find that, if the Virtual manufacturing concepts originate from
machining operations and evolve in this manufacturing area, there exist a lot
of applications in different fields such as casting, forging, sheet
metalworking and robotics (mechanisms). From the recent projects in Europe or
in USA, we notice that the human perception or the simulation of mannequin is
more and more needed in both fields. In this context, we have isolated some
applications as ergonomic studies, assembly and maintenance simulation, design
or training where the virtual reality tools can be applied. Thus, we find out a
family of applications where the virtual reality tools give the engineers the
main role in the optimization process. We will illustrate our paper by several
examples where virtual reality interfaces are used and combined with
optimization tools as multi-agent systems.
