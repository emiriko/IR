We describe the collisional interaction between two different atoms that are
trapped in a harmonic potential. The atoms are exposed to a magnetic field,
which is modulated in the vicinity of an s-wave Feshbach resonance, and we
study the formation of molecular bound states and excited states of the trapped
system with non-trivial angular correlations.
