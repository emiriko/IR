By means of neutron scattering we have determined new branches of magnetic
excitations in orbitally active CoO (TN=290 K) up to 15 THz and for
temperatures from 6 K to 450 K. Data were taken in the (111) direction in six
single-crystal zones. From the dependence on temperature and Q we have
identified several branches of magnetic excitation. We describe a model for the
coupled orbital and spin states of Co2+ subject to a crystal field and
tetragonal distortion.
