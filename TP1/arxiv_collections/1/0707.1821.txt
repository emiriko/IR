We study network growth from a fixed set of initially isolated nodes placed
at random on the surface of a sphere. The growth mechanism we use adds edges to
the network depending on strictly local gain and cost criteria. Only nodes that
are not too far apart on the sphere may be considered for being joined by an
edge. Given two such nodes, the joining occurs only if the gain of doing it
surpasses the cost. Our model is based on a multiplicative parameter lambda
that regulates, in a function of node degrees, the maximum geodesic distance
that is allowed between nodes for them to be considered for joining. For n
nodes distributed uniformly on the sphere, and for lambda*sqrt(n) within limits
that depend on cost-related parameters, we have found that our growth mechanism
gives rise to power-law distributions of node degree that are invariant for
constant lambda*sqrt(n). We also study connectivity- and distance-related
properties of the networks.
