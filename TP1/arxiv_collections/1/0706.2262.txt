In this paper we {\em discuss} diverse aspects of mutual relationship between
adjoints and formal adjoints of unbounded operators bearing a matrix structure.
We emphasize on the behaviour of row and column operators as they turn out to
be the germs of an arbitrary matrix operator, providing most of the information
about the latter {as it is the troublemaker}.
