Molecular dynamics simulations are used to study the local dynamics of
counterion-charged polymer association at charge densities above and below the
counterion condensation threshold. Surprisingly, the counterions form
weakly-interacting clusters which exhibit short range orientational order, and
which decay slowly due to migration of ions across the diffuse double layer.
The cluster dynamics are insensitive to an applied electric field, and
qualitatively agree with the available experimental data. The results are
consistent with predictions of the classical theory only over much longer time
scales.
