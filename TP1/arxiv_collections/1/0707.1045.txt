The low-coverage adsorption of a molecular electron donor,
tetrathiafulvalene, on Au(111) is characterized by the spontaneous formation of
superlattice of monomers, whose spacing exceeds the equilibrium distance of
non-covalent interactions and depends on coverage. The origin of this peculiar
growth mode is due to a long-range repulsive interaction between molecules. The
analysis of molecular-pair distributions obtained by scanning tunneling
microscopy measurements permits us to determine that the nature of TTF
intermolecular interactions on Au (111) is electrostatic. A repulsion between
molecules is caused by the accumulation of charge due to electron donation into
the metal surface, as pictured through density functional theory calculations.
