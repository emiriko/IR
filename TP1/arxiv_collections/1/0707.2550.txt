This article addresses the question whether the magnetic flux of stationary
vortices or of half flux quanta generated by frustrated superconducting rings
is noisy. It is found that the flux noise generated intrinsically by a
superconductor is, in good approximation, not enhanced by stationary vortices.
Half flux quanta generated by $\pi$-rings are characterized by considerably
larger noise.
