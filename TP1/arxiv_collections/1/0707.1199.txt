We analyze the new equation of motion for the damped oscillator. It differs
from the standard one by a damping term which is nonlocal in time and hence it
gives rise to a system with memory. Both classical and quantum analysis is
performed. The characteristic feature of this nonlocal system is that it breaks
local composition low for the classical Hamiltonian dynamics and the
corresponding quantum propagator.
