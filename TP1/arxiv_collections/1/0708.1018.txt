We report a systematic study of normal state Nernst effect in the
electron-doped cuprates Pr$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_{4-\delta}$ over a wide range of
doping (0.05$\leq x \leq$0.21) and temperature. At low temperatures, we
observed a notable vortex Nernst signal above T$_c$ in the underdoped films,
but no such normal state vortex Nernst signal is found in the overdoped region.
The superconducting fluctuations in the underdoped region are most likely
incoherent phase fluctuations as found in hole-doped cuprates. At high
temperatures, a large normal state Nernst signal is found at dopings from
slightly underdoped to highly overdoped. Combined with normal state
thermoelectric power, Hall effect and magnetoresistance measurements, the large
Nernst effect is compatible with two-band model. For the highly overdoped
films, the large Nernst effect is anomalous and not explainable with a simple
hole-like Fermi surface seen in photoemission experiments.
