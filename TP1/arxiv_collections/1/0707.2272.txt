This paper introduces "OPTOTEACH", a new teaching system for photonics lab
work, designed by Harz University and successfully released on the German
market by HarzOptics. OPTOTEACH is the first POF-WDM teaching system,
specifically designed to cover a multitude of lab experiments in the field of
optical communication technology.
  It is illustrated, how this lab system is supplemented by a newly developed
optical teaching software - "OPTOSOFT" - and how the combination of system and
software creates a unique augmented learning environment. The paper details,
how the didactic concept for the software was conceptualised and introduces the
latest beta version. OPTOSOFT is specifically designed not only as an
attachment to OPTOTEACH, it also allows students to rehearse various aspects of
theoretical optics and experience a fully interactive and feature-rich
self-learning environment.
  The paper further details the first experiences educators at Harz University
have made working with the lab system as well as the teaching software. So far,
the augmented learning concept was received mostly positive, although there is
some potential for further optimisation concerning integration and pacing of
various interactive modules.
