We show that a continuous quantum non-demolition measurement of the energy of
a nanomechanical resonator can be achieved by monitoring the resonator with a
quantum point contact via a Cooper-pair box. This technique can further be used
to prepare highly non-classical states of two resonators, such as canonical
phase-reference states, and so-called "noon" states.
