We determine the local entropy of the free energy of the quantized open
bosonic string in Minkowski spacetime with the most general boundary
conditions. We formulate a finite temperature theory of the thermal closed
string excitations in anti-de Sitter spacetime within the TFD approach. We
write down the thermal states and obtain the entropy and the free energy in the
first order expansion of the semiclassical quantization in the center of mass
reference frame.
