We study the consequences of timelike and spaccelike conformal Ricci and
conformal matter collineations for anisotropic fluid in the context of General
Relativity. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for a spacetime
with anisotropic fluid to admit conformal Ricci and conformal matter
collineations parallel to u^a and x^a. These conditions for timelike and
spacelike conformal Ricci and conformal matter collineations for anisotropic
fluid reduce to the conditions of perfect fluid when the heat flux and the
traceless anisotropic stress tensor vanish. Further, for $\alpha=0$ (the
conformal factor), we recover the earlier results of Ricci collineations and
matter collineations in each case of timelike and spacelike conformal Ricci
collineations and conformal matter collineations for the perfect fluid. Thus
our results give the generalization of the results already available in the
literature. It is worth noticing that the conditions of conformal matter
collineations can be derived from the conditions of conformal Ricci
collineations or vice versa under certain constraints.
