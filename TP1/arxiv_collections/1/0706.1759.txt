The Petviashvili's iteration method has been known as a rapidly converging
numerical algorithm for obtaining fundamental solitary wave solutions of
stationary scalar nonlinear wave equations with power-law nonlinearity: \
$-Mu+u^p=0$, where $M$ is a positive definite self-adjoint operator and $p={\rm
const}$. In this paper, we propose a systematic generalization of this method
to both scalar and vector Hamiltonian equations with arbitrary form of
nonlinearity and potential functions. For scalar equations, our generalized
method requires only slightly more computational effort than the original
Petviashvili method.
