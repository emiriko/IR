We study a one-dimensional Heisenberg chain with competing ferromagnetic
nearest-neighbor and antiferromagnetic next-nearest neighbor interactions in
magnetic field. Starting from the fully polarized high-field state, we
calculate the dispersions of the lowest-lying $n$-magnon excitations and the
saturation field (n=2,3,4). We show that the lowest-lying excitations are
always bound multi-magnon states with a total momentum of $\pi$ except for a
small parameter range. We argue that bose condensation of the bound $n$ magnons
leads to novel Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids with multi-polar correlations;
nematic and triatic ordered liquids correspond to n=2 and n=3.
