We investigate continuous variable quantum teleportation using non-Gaussian
states of the radiation field as entangled resources. We compare the
performance of different classes of degaussified resources, including two-mode
photon-added and two-mode photon-subtracted squeezed states. We then introduce
a class of two-mode squeezed Bell-like states with one-parameter dependence for
optimization. These states interpolate between and include as subcases
different classes of degaussified resources. We show that optimized squeezed
Bell-like resources yield a remarkable improvement in the fidelity of
teleportation both for coherent and nonclassical input states. The
investigation reveals that the optimal non-Gaussian resources for continuous
variable teleportation are those that most closely realize the simultaneous
maximization of the content of entanglement, the degree of affinity with the
two-mode squeezed vacuum and the, suitably measured, amount of non-Gaussianity.
