In this paper we study how to attack through different techniques a perfect
fluid Bianchi I model with variable G, and $\Lambda.$ These tactics are: Lie
groups method (LM), imposing a particular symmetry, self-similarity (SS),
matter collineations (MC). and kinematical self-similarity (KSS). We compare
both tactics since they are quite similar (symmetry principles). We arrive to
the conclusion that the LM is too restrictive and brings us to get only the
flat FRW solution with G=const. and $\Lambda=0$. The SS, MC and KSS approaches
bring us to obtain the following solution: G is a decreasing time function and
$\Lambda\thickapprox t^{-2}$, with $\Lambda<0$, while the exponents of the
scale factor must satisfy the conditions $\sum_{i=1}% ^{3}\alpha_{i}=1$ and
$\sum_{i=1}^{3}\alpha_{i}^{2}<1,$ $\forall\omega \in(-1,1)$, relaxing in this
way the Kasner conditions.
