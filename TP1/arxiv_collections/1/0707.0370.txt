We investigate in micro-photoluminescence experiments the dynamical nuclear
polarization in individual InGaAs quantum dots. Experiments carried out in an
applied magnetic field of 2T show that the nuclear polarization achieved
through the optical pumping of electron spins is increasing with the sample
temperature between 2K and 55K, reaching a maximum of about 50%. Analysing the
dependence of the Overhauser shift on the spin polarization of the optically
injected electron as a function of temperature enables us to identify the main
reasons for this increase.
