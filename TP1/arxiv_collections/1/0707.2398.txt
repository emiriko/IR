We study mesoscopic superpositions of two component Bose-Einstein
condensates. Atomic condensates, with long coherence times, are good systems in
which to study such quantum phenomenon. We show that the mesoscopic
superposition states can be rapidly generated in which the atoms dispersively
interact with the photon field in a cavity. We also discuss the production of
compass states which are generalized Schr\"{o}dinger cat states. The physical
realization of mesoscopic states is important in studying decoherence and
precision measurement.
