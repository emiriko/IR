By applying holomorphic motions, we prove that a parabolic germ is
quasiconformally rigid, that is, any two topologically conjugate parabolic
germs are quasiconformally conjugate and the conjugacy can be chosen to be more
and more near conformal as long as we consider these germs defined on smaller
and smaller neighborhoods. Before proving this theorem, we use the idea of
holomorphic motions to give a conceptual proof of the Fatou linearization
theorem. As a by-product, we also prove that any finite number of analytic
germs at different points in the Riemann sphere can be extended to a
quasiconformal homeomorphism which can be more and more near conformal as as
long as we consider these germs defined on smaller and smaller neighborhoods of
these points.
