We present a deterministic exploration mechanism for sponsored search
auctions, which enables the auctioneer to learn the relevance scores of
advertisers, and allows advertisers to estimate the true value of clicks
generated at the auction site. This exploratory mechanism deviates only
minimally from the mechanism being currently used by Google and Yahoo! in the
sense that it retains the same pricing rule, similar ranking scheme, as well
as, similar mathematical structure of payoffs. In particular, the estimations
of the relevance scores and true-values are achieved by providing a chance to
lower ranked advertisers to obtain better slots. This allows the search engine
to potentially test a new pool of advertisers, and correspondingly, enables new
advertisers to estimate the value of clicks/leads generated via the auction.
Both these quantities are unknown a priori, and their knowledge is necessary
for the auction to operate efficiently. We show that such an exploration policy
can be incorporated without any significant loss in revenue for the auctioneer.
We compare the revenue of the new mechanism to that of the standard mechanism
at their corresponding symmetric Nash equilibria and compute the cost of
uncertainty, which is defined as the relative loss in expected revenue per
impression. We also bound the loss in efficiency, as well as, in user
experience due to exploration, under the same solution concept (i.e. SNE). Thus
the proposed exploration mechanism learns the relevance scores while
incorporating the incentive constraints from the advertisers who are selfish
and are trying to maximize their own profits, and therefore, the exploration is
essentially achieved via mechanism design. We also discuss variations of the
new mechanism such as truthful implementations.
