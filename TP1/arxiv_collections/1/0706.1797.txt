A generalized Fermi-Bose mapping method is used to determine the exact ground
states of several models of mixtures of strongly interacting ultracold gases in
tight waveguides, which are generalizations of the Tonks-Girardeau (TG) gas (1D
Bose gas with point hard cores) and fermionic Tonks-Girardeau (FTG) gas (1D
spin-aligned Fermi gas with infinitely strong zero-range attractions). We
detail the case of a Bose-Fermi mixture with TG boson-boson (BB) and
boson-fermion (BF) interactions. Exact results are given for density profiles
in a harmonic trap, single-particle density matrices, momentum distributions,
and density-density correlations. Since the ground state is highly degenerate,
we analyze the splitting of the ground manifold for large but finite BB and BF
repulsions.
