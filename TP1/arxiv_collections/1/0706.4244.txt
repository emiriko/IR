We offer a detailed review of the physics behind the PVLAS experiment. We
also address some laboratory and astrophysical cross-checks for the recent
claim concerning a signal consistent with an Axion-Like Particle. Our aim is
that the leading role played by Emilio (Mimmo) Zavattini in this field of
research will become apparent.
