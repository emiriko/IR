We present a theory describing trapping of the normally dispersive radiation
by the Raman solitons in optical fibers. Frequency of the radiation component
is continuously blue shifting, while the soliton is red shifting. Underlying
physics of the trapping effect is in the existence of the inertial gravity-like
force acting on light in the accelerating frame of reference. We present
analytical calculations of the rate of the opposing frequency shifts of the
soliton and trapped radiation and find it to be greater than the rate of the
red shift of the bare Raman soliton. Our findings are essential for
understanding of the continuous shift of the high frequency edge of the
supercontinuum spectra generated in photonic crystal fibers towards higher
frequencies.
