We report measurements of the exclusive cross section for $e^+e^- \to D \bar
D $, where $D=D^0$ or $D^+$, in the center-of-mass energy range from the $D
\bar D $ threshold to $5\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ with initial-state radiation. The
analysis is based on a data sample collected with the Belle detector with an
integrated luminosity of 673 $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$.
