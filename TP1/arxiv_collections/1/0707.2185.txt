In this article, we propose a method for calculation of the inverse and
direct dynamic models of the Orthoglide, a parallel robot with threedegrees of
freedom in translation. These models are calculated starting from the elements
of the dynamic model of the kinematic chain structure and equations of
Newton-Euler applied to the platform. These models are obtained in explicit
form having an interesting physical interpretation.
