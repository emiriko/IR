Heavy Quarkonium states modifications in relativistic heavy ion collisions
have been of great interest since the proposal by Matsui and Satz of J/psi
suppression as a signature of Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) formation. Recent
studies suggest that the excited states chi_c, psi(2S) and Upsilon(3S) melt
sequentially[1,2] and the amount of observed suppression depends on the state
and medium conditions. Therefore, this suppression pattern may be used as a
probe of the medium temperature. In this work we present preliminary results on
the charmonium and bottomnium measurements performed by the STAR experiment at
RHIC for p+p and Cu+Cu collisions at sqrt(s_{NN})=200GeV
