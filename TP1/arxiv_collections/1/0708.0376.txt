We report the observation of charmless hadronic decays of charged B mesons to
the final state K+K-pi+. Using a data sample of 347.5 fb^-1 collected at the
Y(4S) resonance with the BABAR detector, we observe 429+/-43 signal events with
a significance of 9.6 sigma. We measure the inclusive branching fraction BF(B+
--> K+K-pi+) = [5.0+/-0.5(stat)+/-0.5(syst)]x10^-6. Inspection of the Dalitz
plot of signal candidates shows a broad structure peaking near 1.5 GeV/c^2 in
the K+K- invariant mass distribution. We find the direct CP asymmetry to be
consistent with zero.
