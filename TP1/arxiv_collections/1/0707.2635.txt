A thermodynamically consistent excluded volume model is proposed to account
for the particle multiplicities obtained from lowest SIS energies to the
highest RHIC energies. The chemical freeze-out volumes lying in a slice of one
unit of rapidity for pions and kaons are separately inferred from this analysis
and the results are compared with the corresponding thermal freeze-out volumes
obtained from the Hanbury-Brown Twiss (HBT) pion interferometry. Furthermore,
we extract the variations of freeze-out number densities for pions and nucleons
with the center-of-mass energy in our model and compare them with the HBT data.
