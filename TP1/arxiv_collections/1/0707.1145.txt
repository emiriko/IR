The coupling constants $g_L$ and $g_X$ of some versions of the
$SU(3)_L\otimes U(1)_X$ extension of the standard model are related through to
relationship $g^2_X/g^2_L= \sin^2\theta_W/(1 - 4\sin^2\theta_W)$. This fact
suggest that the $SU(3)_L\otimes U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry in this class of models
can be broken dynamically to the standard model at TeV scale without requiring
the introduction of fundamental scalars. This possibility was investigated by
Das and Jain who considered only the first version of this class of models. In
this brief report we discuss an energy criterion to verify the most probable
version of the $SU(3)_L\otimes U(1)_X$ model that is realized in nature.
