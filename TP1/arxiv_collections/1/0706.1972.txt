Photoluminescence spectra measured on a type-II GaSb/GaAs quantum dot
ensemble at high excitation power indicate a Mott transition from the low
density state comprising of spatially-indirect excitons to a high density
electron-plasma state. Under the influence of a very high magnetic field, the
electron-plasma that is formed at high excitation powers is `frozen-out' into a
state of optically inactive magneto-excitons.
