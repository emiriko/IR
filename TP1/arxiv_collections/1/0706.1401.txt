Longitudinal data tracking repeated measurements on individuals are highly
valued for research because they offer controls for unmeasured individual
heterogeneity that might otherwise bias results. Random effects or mixed models
approaches, which treat individual heterogeneity as part of the model error
term and use generalized least squares to estimate model parameters, are often
criticized because correlation between unobserved individual effects and other
model variables can lead to biased and inconsistent parameter estimates.
Starting with an examination of the relationship between random effects and
fixed effects estimators in the standard unobserved effects model, this article
demonstrates through analysis and simulation that the mixed model approach has
a ``bias compression'' property under a general model for individual
heterogeneity that can mitigate bias due to uncontrolled differences among
individuals. The general model is motivated by the complexities of longitudinal
student achievement measures, but the results have broad applicability to
longitudinal modeling.
