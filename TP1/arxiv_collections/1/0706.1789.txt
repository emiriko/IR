The LHC provides new opportunities to improve our understanding of the b
quark using high statistics data samples and the 14 TeV center-of-mass energy.
The prospects to measure the cross section for inclusive b production in events
containing jets and at least one muon are presented. Studies of detector
systematic effects and theoretical uncertainties are included. QCD aspects of
the beauty production are discussed.
