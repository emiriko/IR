We study the properties of $g^{1}$, the first excited state of the gluon in
representative variants of the Randall Sundrum model with the Standard Model
fields in the bulk. We find that measurements of the coupling to light quarks
(from the inclusive cross-section for $pp\to g^{1} \to t\bar t$), the coupling
to bottom quarks (from the rate of $pp\to g^{1} b$), as well as the overall
width, can provide powerful discriminants between the models. In models with
large brane kinetic terms, the $g^1$ resonance can even potentially be
discovered decaying into dijets against the large QCD background. We also
derive bounds based on existing Tevatron searches for resonant $t \bar{t}$
production and find that they require $M_{g^{1}} \gtrsim 950$ GeV. In addition
we explore the pattern of interference between the $g^1$ signal and the
non-resonant SM background, defining an asymmetry parameter for the invariant
mass distribution. The interference probes the relative signs of the couplings
of the $g^{1}$ to light quark pairs and to $t\bar t$, and thus provides an
indication that the top is localized on the other side of the extra dimension
from the light quarks, as is typical in the RS framework.
