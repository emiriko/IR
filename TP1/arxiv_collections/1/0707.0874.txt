We consider the Segal-Bargmann transform for a noncompact symmetric space of
the complex type. We establish isometry and surjectivity theorems for the
transform, in a form as parallel as possible to the results in the compact
case. The isometry theorem involves integration over a tube of radius R in the
complexification, followed by analytic continuation with respect to R. A
cancellation of singularities allows the relevant integral to have a
nonsingular extension to large R, even though the function being integrated has
singularities.
