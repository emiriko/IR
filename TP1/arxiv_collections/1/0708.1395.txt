We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of multiple copy purification and
distillation protocols for phase diffused squeezed states of light. The
standard iterative distillation protocol is generalized to a collective
purification of an arbitrary number of N copies. We also derive a
semi-analytical expression for the asymptotic limit of the iterative
distillation and purification protocol and discuss its properties.
