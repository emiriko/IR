Claims have been made that f0(1370) does not exist. The five primary sets of
data requiring its existence are refitted. Major dispersive effects due to the
opening of the 4pi threshold are included for the first time; the sigma -> 4pi
amplitude plays a strong role. Crystal Barrel data on pbar-p -> 3pizero at rest
require f0(1370) signals of at least 32 and 33 standard deviations in 1S0 and
3P1 annihilation respectively. Furthermore, they agree within 5 MeV for mass
and width. Data on pbar-p -> eta-eta-pizero agree and require at least a 19
standard deviation contribution. This alone is sufficient to demonstrate the
existence of f0(1370). BES II data for J/Psi -> phi-pi-pi contain a visible
f0(1370) signal > 8 standard devations. In all cases, a resonant phase
variation is required. The possibility of a second pole in the sigma amplitude
due to the opening of the 4pi channel is excluded. Cern-Munich data for pi-pi
elastic scattering are fitted well with the inclusion of some mixing between
sigma, f0(1370) and f0(1500). The pi-pi widths for f2(1565), rho3(1690),
rho3(1990) and f4(2040) are determined.
