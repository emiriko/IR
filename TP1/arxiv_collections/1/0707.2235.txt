We propose a simple model of self-propelled particles to show that coherent
structures, such as jets and swirls, can arise from a plausible microscopic
mechanisms: (i) the elongated shape of the self-propelled particles with (ii)
the hardcore interactions among them. We demonstrate via computer simulation
that these coherent structures, which emerge at sufficiently high densities of
particles, have characteristics that are similar to those observed in recent
experiments in bacteria baths.
