Grassmannian local hidden variables are shown to generate all possible
quantum correlations in a bipartite quantum system. Grassmann representation of
fermions, common in field theory, opens a related perspective. Although
Grassmann hidden variables can not challange Bell's locality theorem, they can
become an interesting mathematical tool to investigate entanglement.
