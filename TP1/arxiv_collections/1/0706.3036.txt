A fully self-consistent calculation of the bosonic dynamics of the Hubbard
model is developed within the Composite Operator Method. From one side we
consider a basic set of fermionic composite operators (Hubbard fields) and
calculate the retarded propagators. On the other side we consider a basic set
of bosonic composite operators (charge, spin and pair) and calculate the causal
propagators. The equations for the Green's functions (GF) (retarded and
causal), studied in the polar approximation, are coupled and depend on a set of
parameters not determined by the dynamics. First, the pair sector is
self-consistently solved together with the fermionic one and the zero-frequency
constants (ZFC) are calculated not assuming the ergodic value, but fixing the
representation of the GF in such a way to maintain the constrains required by
the algebra of the composite fields. Then, the scheme to compute the charge and
spin sectors, ZFCs included, is given in terms of the fermionic and pair
correlators.
