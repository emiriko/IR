Entanglement in a class of bipartite generalized coherent states is
discussed. It is shown that a positive parameter can be associated with the
bipartite generalized coherent states so that the states with equal value for
the parameter are of equal entanglement. It is shown that the maximum possible
entanglement of 1 bit is attained if the positive parameter equals $\sqrt{2}$.
The result that the entanglement is one bit when the relative phase between the
composing states is $\pi$ in bipartite coherent states is shown to be true for
the class of bipartite generalized coherent states considered.
