The high energy programme of the HERA collider ended in March 2007. During
the whole HERA programme, a combined total integrated luminosity of 1 fb$^{-1}$
was collected by the H1 and ZEUS experiments. In this context, an overview of
the most recent results of both experiments concerning searches for new physics
is presented. The topics covered are searches for contact interactions,
leptoquarks and excited leptons, as well as studies of the isolated lepton and
multi-lepton topologies, and a general signature based search.
