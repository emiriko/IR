Dunajski generalization of the second heavenly equation is studied. A
dressing scheme applicable to Dunajski equation is developed, an example of
constructing solutions in terms of implicit functions is considered. Dunajski
equation hierarchy is described, its Lax-Sato form is presented. Dunajsky
equation hierarchy is characterized by conservation of three-dimensional volume
form, in which a spectral variable is taken into account.
