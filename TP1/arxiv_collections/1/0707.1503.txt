As in many other areas of science, systems biology makes extensive use of
statistical association and significance estimates in contingency tables, a
type of categorical data analysis known in this field as enrichment (also
over-representation or enhancement) analysis. In spite of efforts to create
probabilistic annotations, especially in the Gene Ontology context, or to deal
with uncertainty in high throughput-based datasets, current enrichment methods
largely ignore this probabilistic information since they are mainly based on
variants of the Fisher Exact Test. We developed an open-source R package to
deal with probabilistic categorical data analysis, ProbCD, that does not
require a static contingency table. The contingency table for the enrichment
problem is built using the expectation of a Bernoulli Scheme stochastic process
given the categorization probabilities. An on-line interface was created to
allow usage by non-programmers and is available at:
http://xerad.systemsbiology.net/ProbCD/ . We present an analysis framework and
software tools to address the issue of uncertainty in categorical data
analysis. In particular, concerning the enrichment analysis, ProbCD can
accommodate: (i) the stochastic nature of the high-throughput experimental
techniques and (ii) probabilistic gene annotation.
