This paper presents a proposal for a flexible agent mobility architecture
based on IEEE-FIPA standards and intended to be one of them. This proposal is a
first step towards interoperable mobility mechanisms, which are needed for
future agent migration between different kinds of platforms. Our proposal is
presented as a flexible and robust architecture that has been successfully
implemented in the JADE and AgentScape platforms. It is based on an open set of
protocols, allowing new protocols and future improvements to be accommodated in
the architecture. With this proposal we demonstrate that a standard
architecture for agent mobility capable of supporting several agent platforms
can be defined and implemented.
