Galilei invariant equations for massive fields with various spins are found
and classified. They have been obtained directly, i.e., by using requirement of
Galilei invariance and the facts on representations of the Galilei group
deduced in our previous paper de Montigny M, Niederle J and Nikitin A G, J.
Phys. A {\bf 39}, 1-21, 2006 . It is shown that the collection of
non-equivalent Galilei-invariant wave equations for vector and scalar fields is
very broad and describes many physically consistent systems.
