The problem of spontaneous emission is studied by a direct computer
simulation of the dynamics of a combined system: atom + radiation field. The
parameters of the discrete finite model, including up to 20k field oscillators,
have been optimized by a comparison with the exact solution for the case when
the oscillators have equidistant frequencies and equal coupling constants.
Simulation of the effect of multi-pulse sequence of phase kicks and emission by
a pair of atoms shows that both the frequency and the linewidth of the emitted
spectrum could be controlled.
