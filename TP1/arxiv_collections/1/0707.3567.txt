Feynman diagrams may be evaluated by Mellin-Barnes representations of their
Feynman parameter integrals in d=4-2\eps dimensions. Recently, the Mathematica
toolkit AMBRE has been developed for the automatic derivation of such
representations with a loop-by-loop approach. We describe the package and
exemplify its use with the \eps-expansion of the massive one-loop QED vertex
function.
