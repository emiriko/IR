Through the utilization of index-matched GaAs immersion lens techniques we
demonstrate a record extinction (12%) of a far-field focused laser by a single
InAs/GaAs quantum dot. This contrast level enables us to report for the first
time resonant laser transmission spectroscopy on a single InAs/GaAs quantum dot
without the need for phase-sensitive lock-in detection.
