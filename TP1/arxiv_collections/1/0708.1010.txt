We present a search for a pentaquark decaying strongly to $\Xi^-\pi^-$ in
$\gamma N$ collisions at a center-of-mass energy up to 25 GeV/c^2. Finding no
evidence for such a state in the mass range of 1480 MeV/c^2 to 2400 MeV/c^2, we
set limits on the yield and on the cross section times branching ratio relative
to $\Xi^*(1530)^0$.
