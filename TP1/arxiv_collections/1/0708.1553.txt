The topcolor-assisted technicolor (TC2) model predicts a number of neutral
scalars like the top-pion ($\pi^0_t$) and the top-Higgs ($h^0_t$). These
scalars have flavor-changing neutral-current (FCNC) top quark couplings, among
which the top-charm transition couplings may be sizable. Such FCNC couplings
induce single top productions associated with a neutral scalar at the CERN
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) through the parton processes $cg \to t \pi_t^0$ and
$cg \to t h_t^0$. In this note we examine these productions and find their
production rates can exceed the $3\sigma$ sensitivity of the LHC in a large
part of parameter space. Since in the Standard Model and the minimal
supersymmetric model such rare productions have unobservably small production
rates at the LHC, these rare processes will serve as a good probe for the TC2
model.
