In a new measurement on neutrino oscillation $\nu_{\mu}\to\nu_e$, the
MiniBooNE Collaboration observes an excess of electron-like events at low
energy and the phenomenon may demand an explanation which obviously is beyond
the oscillation picuture. We propose that heavier neutrino $\nu_2$ decaying
into a lighter one $\nu_1$ via the transition process $\nu_{\mu}\to \nu_e+X$
where $X$ denotes any light products, could be a natural mechanism. The
theoretical model we employ here is the unparticle scenario established by
Georgi. We have studied two particular modes $\nu_\mu\to \nu_e+\Un$ and
$\nu_\mu\to \nu_e+\bar\nu_e+\nu_e$. Unfortunately, the number coming out from
the computation is too small to explain the observation. Moreover, our results
are consistent with the cosmology constraint on the neutrino lifetime and the
theoretical estimation made by other groups, therefore we can conclude that
even though neutrino decay seems plausible in this case, it indeed cannot be
the source of the peak at lower energy observed by the MiniBooNE collaboration
and there should be other mechanisms responsible for the phenomenon.
