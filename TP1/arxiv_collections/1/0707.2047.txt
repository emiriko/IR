Magnetic tweezers are used to study the mechanical response under torsion of
single nucleosome arrays reconstituted on tandem repeats of 5S positioning
sequences. Regular arrays are extremely resilient and can reversibly
accommodate a large amount of supercoiling without much change in length. This
behavior is quantitatively described by a molecular model of the chromatin 3-D
architecture. In this model, we assume the existence of a dynamic equilibrium
between three conformations of the nucleosome, which are determined by the
crossing status of the entry/exit DNAs (positive, null or negative). Torsional
strain, in displacing that equilibrium, extensively reorganizes the fiber
architecture. The model explains a number of long-standing topological
questions regarding DNA in chromatin, and may provide the ground to better
understand the dynamic binding of most chromatin-associated proteins.
