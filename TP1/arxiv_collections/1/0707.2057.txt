We consider the population genetics problem: how long does it take before
some member of the population has $m$ specified mutations? The case $m=2$ is
relevant to onset of cancer due to the inactivation of both copies of a tumor
suppressor gene. Models for larger $m$ are needed for colon cancer and other
diseases where a sequence of mutations leads to cells with uncontrolled growth.
