In this paper we consider general relativity and its combination with scalar
quantum electrodynamics (QED) as an effective quantum field theory at energies
well below the Planck scale. This enables us to compute the one-loop quantum
corrections to the Newton and Coulomb potential induced by the combination of
graviton and photon fluctuations. We derive the relevant Feynman rules and
compute the nonanalytical contributions to the one-loop scattering matrix for
charged scalars in the nonrelativistic limit. In particular, we derive the
post-Newtonian corrections of order $Gm/\text c^2 r$ from general relativity
and the genuine quantum corrections of order $G\hbar/\text c^3 r^2$.
