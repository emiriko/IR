Using the first principles calculations we have studied the vibrational modes
and Raman spectra of a (10, 10) single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) bundle
under hydrostatic pressure. Detailed analysis shows that the original radial
breathing mode (RBM) of the SWNT bundle disappears after the structural phase
transition (SPT). And significantly a RBM-like mode appears at about 509
cm^{-1}, which could be considered as a fingerprint of the SPT happened in the
SWNT bundle, and further used to determine the microscopic structure of the
bundle after the SPT.
