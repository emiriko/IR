We investigate the quark spectrum near but above the critical temperature of
the chiral transition, taking into account the precursory soft modes. It is
found that there appear novel excitation spectra of quasi-quarks and
quasi-antiquarks with a three-peak structure. By a detailed analysis on the
formation of the three-peak structure using Yukawa models, it is shown that the
new quark spectra originate from the mixing between a quark (anti-quark) and an
antiquark hole (quark hole) caused by a resonant scattering of the quasi-quark
with the soft modes which have a small but finite excitation energy with a
small width near the critical temperature.
