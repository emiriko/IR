Nanostructured Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloys ingots of diameter 3~5 mm could be
synthesised by a metastable liquid state spinodal decomposition method. The
molten Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy was purified by means of the fluxing technique and
thus a large undercooling could be achieved. For undercooling Delta T > 260 K,
the microstructure of the undercooled specimen had exhibited liquid state
spinodal decomposition in the undercooled liquid state. The microstructure
could be described as two intertwining networks with small grains dispersed in
them. For undercooling Delta T > 290 K, the overall microstructure of the
specimen changed into a granular morphology. The average grain sizes of the
small and large grains are ~ 30 nm and ~ 80 nm, respectively. These prepared
samples are soft magnets with saturation magnetization Bs ~0.744 T.
