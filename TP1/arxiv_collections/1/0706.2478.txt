We describe the twist-2 contributions to inclusive unpolarized and polarized
deep-inelastic diffractive scattering in an operator approach. The
representation refers to the observed large rapidity gap but does not require
reference to a pomeron picture. We discuss both the case of vanishing target
mass $M$ and momentum transfer $t$ as well as the effects at finite $t$ and
$M$, which lead to modifications at large $\beta$ and low values of $Q^2$.
