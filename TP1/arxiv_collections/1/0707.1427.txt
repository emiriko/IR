The 1/N expansion can be successfully used to calculate the Green functions
of the two-dimensional O(2N) Gross - Neveu model. In parallel, the methods of
analytic perturbation theory are also applied. Comparing the results of these
two calculations at leading order, we report on the surprising agreement
between them.
