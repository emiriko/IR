The quantum Hall states of graphene have a filled Dirac sea of Landau levels.
The short ranged SU(4) symmetry breaking interactions can induce a staggered
polarization of the sea of Dirac-Landau levels. We study this effect in the
extended Hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice using mean field variational
wavefunctions. We find a valley symmetry broken, anti-ferromagnetic spin
ordered phase at $\nu=\pm 1$ when the on-site interaction is dominant. Our mean
field solution is consistent with the recently reported experimental results of
