We report on magnetotransport measurements in two MBE-grown GaAs/AlGaAs
superlattices formed by wide and narrow quantum wells and thin Si-doped
barriers subject to tilted magnetic fields. It has been shown that illumination
of the strongly coupled superlattice with narrow wells leads to reduction of
its dimensionality from the 3D to 2D. The illumination-induced transition is
revealed by remarkable change of magnetoresistance curves as compared to those
measured before illumination. The experimental data along with tight-binding
model calculations indicate that the illumination not only enhances the
electron concentration but also suppresses the electron tunneling through the
barriers.
