We construct and study a class of algebras associated to generalized layered
graphs, i.e. directed graphs with a ranking function on their vertices. Each
finite directed acyclic graph admits countably many structures of a generalized
layered graph. We construct linear bases in such algebras and compute their
Hilbert series. Our interest to generalized layered graphs and algebras
associated to those graphs is motivated by their relations to factorizations of
polynomials over noncommutative rings.
