Dynamic ordering of driven vortex matter has been investigated in the peak
effect regime of both amorphous MoGe films and 2H-NbSe2 crystals by mode
locking (ML) and dc transport measurements. ML features allow us to trace how
the shear rigidity of driven vortices evolves with the average velocity.
Determining the onset of ML resonance in different magnetic fields and/or
temperatures, we find that the dynamic ordering frequency (velocity) exhibits a
striking divergence in the higher part of the peak effect regime.
Interestingly, this phenomenon is accompanied by a pronounced peak of dynamic
critical current. Mapping out field-temperature phase diagrams, we find that
divergent points follow well the thermodynamic melting curve of the ideal
vortex lattice over wide field and/or temperature ranges. These findings
provide a link between the dynamic and static melting phenomena which can be
distinguished from the disorder induced peak effect.
