We derive semiclassical approximations for wavefunctions, Green's functions
and expectation values for classically chaotic quantum systems. Our method
consists of applying singular and regular perturbations to quantum
Hamiltonians. The wavefunctions, Green's functions and expectation values of
the unperturbed Hamiltonian are expressed in terms of the spectral determinant
of the perturbed Hamiltonian. Semiclassical resummation methods for spectral
determinants are applied and yield approximations in terms of a finite number
of classical trajectories. The final formulas have a simple form. In contrast
to Poincare surface of section methods, the resummation is done in terms of the
periods of the trajectories.
