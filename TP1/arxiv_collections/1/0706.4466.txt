Feedback controlled ratchets are thermal rectifiers that use information on
the state of the system to operate. We study the effects of time delays in the
feedback for a protocol that performs an instantaneous maximization of the
center-of-mass velocity in the many particle case. For small delays the
center-of-mass velocity decreases for increasing delays (although not as fast
as in the few particle case). However, for large delays we find the surprising
result that the presence of a delay can improve the flux performance of the
ratchet. In fact, the maximum flux obtained with the optimal periodic protocol
is attained. This implies that the delayed feedback protocol considered can
perform better than its non-delayed counterpart. The improvement of the flux
observed in the presence of large delays is the result of the emergence of a
new dynamical regime where the presence of the delayed feedback stabilizes
quasiperiodic solutions that resemble the solutions obtained in a certain
closed-loop protocol with thresholds. In addition, in this new regime the
system presents multistability, i.e. several quasiperiodic solutions can be
stable for a fixed time delay.
