To better understanding the principal features of collisionless
damping/growing plasma waves we have implemented a demonstrative calculation
for the simplest cases of electron waves in two-stream plasmas with the
delta-function type electron velocity distribution function of each of the
streams with velocities v(1) and v(2). The traditional dispersion equation is
reduced to an algebraic 4th order equation, for which numerical solutions are
presented for a variant of equal stream densities. In the case of uniform
half-infinite slab one finds two dominant type solutions: non-damping forward
waves and forward complex conjugated exponentially both damping and growing
waves. Beside it in this case there is no necessity of calculation any
logarithmically divergent indefinite integrals. The possibility of wave
amplifying might be useful in practical applications.
