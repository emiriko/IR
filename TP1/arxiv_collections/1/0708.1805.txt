We consider shape, size and regularity of the hulls of the chordal
Schramm-Loewner evolution driven by a symmetric alpha-stable process. We obtain
derivative estimates, show that the complements of the hulls are Hoelder
domains, prove that the hulls have Hausdorff dimension 1, and show that the
trace is right-continuous with left limits almost surely.
