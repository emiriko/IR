The BELLE detector has already accumulated e^+ e^- collision data at the
KEKB-collider corresponding to 600 fb^-1. BaBar has accumulated data of
approximately 390 fb^-1 at PEP-II. Both are running on asymmetric energy e^+
e^- colliders at the Upsilon(4S) energy. The paper selects important results
from both experiments with the emphasis on CP violation in B meson decays and
its implications for the Unitarity Triangle.
