We have designed and built an apparatus for real-time acoustic imaging of
convective flow patterns in optically opaque fluids. This apparatus takes
advantage of recent advances in two-dimensional ultrasound transducer array
technology; it employs a modified version of a commercially available
ultrasound camera, similar to those employed in non-destructive testing of
solids. Images of convection patterns are generated by observing the lateral
variation of the temperature dependent speed of sound via refraction of
acoustic plane waves passing vertically through the fluid layer. The apparatus
has been validated by observing convection rolls in both silicone oil and
ferrofluid.
