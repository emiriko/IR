We have analyzed the symmetry properties and the ground state of an orbital
Hubbard model with two orbital flavors, describing a partly filled
spin-polarized $e_g$ band on a cubic lattice, as in ferromagnetic manganites.
We demonstrate that the off-diagonal hopping responsible for transitions
between $x^2-y^2$ and $3z^2-r^2$ orbitals, and the absence of SU(2) invariance
in orbital space, have important implications. One finds that superexchange
contributes in all orbital ordered states, the Nagaoka theorem does not apply,
and the kinetic energy is much enhanced as compared with the spin case.
Therefore, orbital ordered states are harder to stabilize in the Hartree-Fock
approximation (HFA), and the onset of a uniform ferro-orbital polarization and
antiferro-orbital instability are similar to each other, unlike in spin case.
Next we formulate a cubic (gauge) invariant slave boson approach using the
orbitals with complex coefficients. In the mean-field approximation it leads to
the renormalization of the kinetic energy, and provides a reliable estimate for
the ground state energy of the disordered state. Using this approach one finds
that the HFA fails qualitatively in the regime of large Coulomb repulsion
$U\to\infty$ -- the orbital order is unstable, and instead a strongly
correlated orbital liquid with disordered orbitals is realized at any electron
filling.
