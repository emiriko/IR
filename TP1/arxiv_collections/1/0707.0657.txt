One way to treat the infrared divergences of the electroweak
Next-to-Leading-Order (NLO) differential cross sections to parity-violating
(PV) electron-proton scattering is by adding soft-photon emission contribution.
Although more physical, the results are left with a logarithmic dependence on
the photon detector acceptance, which can only be eliminated by considering
Hard Photon Bremsstrahlung (HPB) contribution. Here we present a treatment of
HPB for PV electron-proton scattering. HPB differential cross sections for
electron-proton scattering have been computed using the experimental values of
nucleon form factors. The final results are expressed through kinematic
parameters, making it possible to apply the computed PV HPB differential cross
sections for the analysis of data of a range of current and proposed
experiments.
