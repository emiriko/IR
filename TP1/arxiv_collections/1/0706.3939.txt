I discuss the prospects for future studies of parity-violating (PV)
interactions at low energies and the insights they might provide about open
questions in the Standard Model as well as physics that lies beyond it. I cover
four types of parity-violating observables: PV electron scattering; PV hadronic
interactions; PV correlations in weak decays; and searches for the permanent
electric dipole moments of quantum systems.
