In this contribution we study the photoproduction of quarkonium in coherent
proton-proton and nucleus-nucleus interactions at the LHC. The integrated cross
sections and rapidity distributions are estimated using the Color Glass
Condensate (CGC) formalism, which takes into account the parton saturation
effects at high energies. Nuclear shadowing effects are also taken into
account.
