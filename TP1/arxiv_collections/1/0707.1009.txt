The subthreshold photoproduction of \phi mesons from heavy nuclear targets
has been suggested as a candidate to search for the \phi-N bound state, a
quantum chromodynamics molecular state. In this Brief Report, we present
detailed Monte Carlo studies to demonstrate the feasibility of this technique.
Further, we show that proton-induced subthreshold production of \phi meson from
heavy nuclear targets is also suitable for such a search.
