We numerically analyze Non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq (NOB) effects in
two-dimensional Rayleigh-Benard flow in glycerol, which shows a dramatic change
in the viscosity with temperature. The results are presented both as functions
of the Rayleigh number (Ra) up to $10^8$ (for fixed temperature difference
between the top and bottom plates) and as functions of
"non-Oberbeck-Boussinesqness'' or "NOBness'' ($\Delta$) up to 50 K (for fixed
Ra). For this large NOBness the center temperature $T_c$ is more than 5 K
larger than the arithmetic mean temperature $T_m$ between top and bottom plate
and only weakly depends on Ra. To physically account for the NOB deviations of
the Nusselt numbers from its Oberbeck-Boussinesq values, we apply the
decomposition of $Nu_{NOB}/Nu_{OB}$ into the product of two effects, namely
first the change in the sum of the top and bottom thermal BL thicknesses, and
second the shift of the center temperature $T_c$ as compared to $T_m$. While
for water the origin of the $Nu$ deviation is totally dominated by the second
effect (cf. Ahlers et al., J. Fluid Mech. 569, pp. 409 (2006)) for glycerol the
first effect is dominating, in spite of the large increase of $T_c$ as compared
to $T_m$.
