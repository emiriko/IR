We investigate the entanglement dynamics of continuous-variable quantum
channels in terms of an entangled squeezed state of two cavity fields in a
general non-Markovian environment. Using the Feynman-Vernon influence
functional theory in the coherent-state representation, we derive an exact
master equation with time-dependent coefficients reflecting the non-Markovian
influence of the environment. The influence of environments with different
spectral densities, e.g., Ohmic, sub-Ohmic, and super-Ohmic, is numerically
studied. The non-Markovian process shows its remarkable influences on the
entanglement dynamics due to the sensitive time-dependence of the dissipation
and noise functions within the typical time scale of the environment. The Ohmic
environment shows a weak dissipation-noise effect on the entanglement dynamics,
while the sub-Ohmic and super-Ohmic environments induce much more severe noise.
In particular, the memory of the system interacting with the environment
contributes a strong decoherence effect to the entanglement dynamics in the
super-Ohmic case.
