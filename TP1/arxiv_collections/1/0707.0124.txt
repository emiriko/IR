We first introduce new algebras of generalized functions containing Gevrey
ultradistributions and then develop a Gevrey microlocal analysis suitable for
these algebras. Finally, we give an application through an extension of the
well-known H\"{o}rmander's theorem on the wave front of the product of two
distributions.
