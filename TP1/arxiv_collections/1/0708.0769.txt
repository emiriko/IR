We present new sets of pion, kaon, proton and inclusive charged hadron
fragmentation functions obtained in NLO combined analyses of single-inclusive
hadron production in electron-positron annihilation, proton-proton collisions,
and deep-inelastic lepton-proton scattering with either particles identified in
the final state. At variance with all previous fits, the present analyses take
into account data where hadrons of different electrical charge are identified,
which allow to discriminate quark from anti-quark fragmentation functions.
