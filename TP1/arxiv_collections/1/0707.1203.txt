The eigenfunctions with eigenvalues 1 or -1 of the transfer operator of Mayer
are in bijective correspondence with the eigenfunctions with eigenvalue 1 of a
transfer operator connected to the nearest integer continued fraction
algorithm. This is shown by relating these eigenspaces of these operators to
cohomology groups for the modular group with coefficients in certain principal
series representations.
