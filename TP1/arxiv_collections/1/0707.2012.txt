We consider the generalized evolution of compact level sets by functions of
their normal vectors and second fundamental forms on a Riemannian manifold M.
The level sets of a function $u:M\to\mathbb{R}$ evolve in such a way whenever u
solves an equation $u_{t}+F(Du, D^{2}u)=0$, for some real function F satisfying
a geometric condition. We show existence and uniqueness of viscosity solutions
to this equation under the assumptions that M has nonnegative curvature, F is
continuous off Du=0, (degenerate) elliptic, and locally invariant by parallel
translation. We then prove that this approach is geometrically consistent,
hence it allows to define a generalized evolution of level sets by very
general, singular functions of their curvatures. For instance, these
assumptions on F are satisfied when F is given by the evolutions of level sets
by their mean curvature (even in arbitrary codimension) or by their positive
Gaussian curvature. We also prove that the generalized evolution is consistent
with the classical motion by the corresponding function of the curvature,
whenever the latter exists. When M is not of nonnegative curvature, the same
results hold if one additionally requires that F is uniformly continuous with
respect to D^2 u. Finally we give some counterexamples showing that several
well known properties of the evolutions in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are no longer true
when M has negative sectional curvature.
