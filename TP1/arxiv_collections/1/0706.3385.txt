A finite range density and momentum dependent effective interaction is used
to calculate the density and temperature dependence of the symmetry energy
coefficient Csym(rho,T) of infinite nuclear matter. This symmetry energy is
then used in the local density approximation to evaluate the excitation energy
dependence of the symmetry energy coefficient of finite nuclei in a
microcanonical formulation that accounts for thermal and expansion effects. The
results are in good harmony with the recently reported experimental data from
energetic nucleus-nucleus collisions.
