We propose a method for polarising antiprotons in a storage ring by means of
a polarised positron beam moving parallel to the antiprotons. If the relative
velocity is adjusted to $v/c \approx 0.002$ the cross section for spin-flip is
as large as about $2 \cdot 10^{13}$ barn as shown by new QED-calculations of
the triple spin-cross sections. Two possibilities for providing a positron
source with sufficient flux density are presented. A polarised positron beam
with a polarisation of 0.70 and a flux density of approximately $1.5 \cdot
10^{10}$/(mm$^2$ s) appears to be feasible by means of a radioactive $^{11}$C
dc-source. A more involved proposal is the production of polarised positrons by
pair production with circularly polarised photons. It yields a polarisation of
0.76 and requires the injection into a small storage ring. Such polariser
sources can be used at low (100 MeV) as well as at high (1 GeV) energy storage
rings providing a time of about one hour for polarisation build-up of about
$10^{10}$ antiprotons to a polarisation of about 0.18. A comparison with other
proposals show a gain in the figure-of-merit by a factor of about ten.
