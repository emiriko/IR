We analyze under which conditions the missing label problem associated to a
reduction chain $\frak{s}^{\prime}\subset \frak{s}$ of (simple) Lie algebras
can be completely solved by means of an In\"on\"u-Wigner contraction $\frak{g}$
naturally related to the embedding. This provides a new interpretation of the
missing label operators in terms of the Casimir operators of the contracted
algebra, and shows that the available labeling operators are not completely
equivalent. Further, the procedure is used to obtain upper bounds for the
number of invariants of affine Lie algebras arising as contractions of
semisimple algebras.
