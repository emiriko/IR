We discuss a method to achieve decoherence resistent entanglement generation
in two level spin systems governed by gapped and multi-degenerate Hamiltonians.
In such systems, while the large number of degrees of freedom in the ground
state levels allows to create various quantum superpositions, the energy gap
prevents decoherence. We apply the protected evolution to achieve decoherence
resistent generation of many particle GHZ states and show it can significantly
increase the sensitivity in frequency spectroscopy. We discuss how to engineer
the desired many-body protected manifold in two specific physical systems,
trapped ions and neutral atoms in optical lattices, and present simple
expressions for the fidelity of GHZ generation under non-ideal conditions.
