We carry out preliminary numerical study of Sugino's lattice formulation
\cite{Sugino:2004qd,Sugino:2004qdf} of the two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$
super Yang-Mills theory (2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ SYM) with the gauge group
$\SU(2)$. The effect of dynamical fermions is included by re-weighting a
quenched ensemble by the pfaffian factor. It appears that the complex phase of
the pfaffian due to lattice artifacts and flat directions of the classical
potential are not problematic in Monte Carlo simulation. Various one-point
supersymmetric Ward-Takahashi (WT) identities are examined for lattice spacings
up to $a=0.5/g$ with the fixed physical lattice size $L=4.0/g$, where $g$
denotes the gauge coupling constant in two dimensions. WT identities implied by
an exact fermionic symmetry of the formulation are confirmed in fair accuracy
and, for most of these identities, the quantum effect of dynamical fermions is
clearly observed. For WT identities expected only in the continuum limit, the
results seem to be consistent with the behavior expected from supersymmetry,
although we do not see clear distintion from the quenched simulation. We
measure also the expectation values of renormalized gauge-invariant bi-linear
operators of scalar fields.
