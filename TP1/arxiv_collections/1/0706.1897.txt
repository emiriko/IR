The charge ordering transition induced by the nearest-neighbor Coulomb
repulsion, V, in the 1/4-filled extended Hubbard model is investigated using
Cellular Dynamical Mean-Field Theory. We find a transition to a strongly
renormalized charge ordered Fermi liquid at VCO and a metal-to-insulator
transition at VMI>VCO. Short range antiferromagnetism occurs concomitanly with
the CO transition. Approaching the charge ordered insulator the Fermi surface
deforms and the scattering rate of electrons develops momentum dependence on
the Fermi surface.
