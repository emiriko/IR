The structure of a network can significantly influence the properties of the
dynamical processes which take place on them. While many studies have been
devoted to this influence, much less attention has been devoted to the
interplay and feedback mechanisms between dynamical processes and network
topology on adaptive networks. Adaptive rewiring of links can happen in real
life systems such as acquaintance networks where people are more likely to
maintain a social connection if their views and values are similar. In our
study, we consider different variants of a model for consensus formation. Our
investigations reveal that the adaptation of the network topology fosters
cluster formation by enhancing communication between agents of similar opinion,
though it also promotes the division of these clusters. The temporal behavior
is also strongly affected by adaptivity: while, on static networks, it is
influenced by percolation properties, on adaptive networks, both the early and
late time evolution of the system are determined by the rewiring process. The
investigation of a variant of the model reveals that the scenarios of
transitions between consensus and polarized states are more robust on adaptive
networks.
