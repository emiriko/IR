Muonic final states will provide clean signatures formany physics processes
at the LHC. The two LHC experiments ATLAS and CMS will be able to identify
muons with a high reconstruction efficiency above 96% and a high transverse
momentum resolution better than 2% for transverse momenta below 400 GeV/c and
about 10% at 1 TeV/c. The two experiments follow complentary concepts of muon
detection. ATLAS has an instrumented air-toroid mangetic system serving as a
stand-alone muon spectrometer. CMS relies on high bending power and momentum
resolution in the inner detector, and uses an iron yoke to increase its
magnetic field. The iron yoke is instrumented with chambers used for muon
identification. Therefore, muon momenta can only be reconstructed with high
precision by combining inner-detector information with the data from the muon
chambers.
