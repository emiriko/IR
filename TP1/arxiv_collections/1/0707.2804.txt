A system of generalized kinetic equations for the distribution functions of
two-dimensional Dirac fermions scattered by impurities is derived in the Born
approximation with respect to short-range impurity potential. It is proven that
the conductivity following from classical Boltzmann equation picture, where
electrons or holes have scattering amplitude reduced due chirality, is
justified except for an exponentially narrow range of chemical potential near
the conical point. When in this range, creation of infinite number of
electron-hole pairs related to quasi-relativistic nature of electrons in
graphene results in a renormalization of minimal conductivity as compared to
the Boltzmann term and logarithmic corrections in the conductivity similar to
the Kondo effect.
