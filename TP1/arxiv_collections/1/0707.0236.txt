We present activation gap measurements of the fractional quantum Hall effect
(FQHE) in the second Landau level. Signatures for 14 (5) distinct
incompressible FQHE states are seen in a high (low) mobility sample with the
enigmatic 5/2 even denominator FQHE having a large activation gap of $\sim$600
($\sim$300mK) in the high (low) mobility sample. Our measured large relative
gaps for 5/2, 7/3, and 8/3 FQHE indicate emergence of exotic FQHE correlations
in the second Ladau level, possibly quite different from the well-known lowest
Landau level Laughlin correlations. Our measured 5/2 gap is found to be in
reasonable agreement with the theoretical gap once finite width and disorder
broadening corrections are taken into account.
