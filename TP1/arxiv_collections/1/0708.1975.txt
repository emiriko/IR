By solving the kinetic spin Bloch equations, we study the time evolution of
the transient spin grating, whose spin polarization varies periodically in real
space, confined in (001) GaAs quantum wells. With this study we can investigate
the properties of both the spin transport and the spin relaxation at the same
time. The Fourier component of the spin signal decays double exponentially with
two decay rates $1/\tau_+$ and $1/\tau_-$. In high temperature regime, the
average of these two rates varies with the grating wave-vector $q$
quadratically, i.e., $(1/\tau_++1/\tau_-)/2=D_sq^2+1/\tilde{\tau}_s$, with
$D_s$ and $\tilde{\tau}_s$ representing the spin diffusion coefficient and the
average of the out-of-plane and the in-plane spin relaxation times
respectively. $\tau_{\pm}$ calculated from our theory are in good agreement
with the experimental data by Weber {\em et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 98},
076604 (2007)]. By comparing $D_s$ with and without the electron-electron
Coulomb scattering, we calculate the contribution of Coulomb drag to the spin
diffusion coefficient. With the transient spin grating result, we further
reveal the relations among different characteristic parameters such as spin
diffusion coefficient $D_s$, spin relaxation time $\tau_s$, and spin injection
length $L_s$. We show that in the presence of the Dresselhaus and/or Rashba
spin-orbit coupling, the widely used relation $L_s=\sqrt{D_s\tau_s}$ is
generally inaccurate and can even be very wrong in some special cases. We
present an accurate way to extract the steady-state transport characteristic
parameters from the transient spin grating signals.
