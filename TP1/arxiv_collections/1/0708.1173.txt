A discrete time model that is capable of replicating the basic features of
cardiac cell action potentials is suggested. The paper shows how the map-based
approaches can be used to design highly efficient computational models
(algorithms) that enable large-scale simulations and analysis of discrete
network models of cardiac activity.
