We find the transition kernels for four Markovian interacting particle
systems on the line, by proving that each of these kernels is intertwined with
a Karlin-McGregor type kernel. The resulting kernels all inherit the
determinantal structure from the Karlin-McGregor formula, and have a similar
form to Schutz's kernel for the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process.
