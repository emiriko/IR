New results on single spin asymmetries of identified charged pion and kaon
pairs produced in deep-inelastic scattering of muons on a transversely
polarized 6LiD target are presented. The data were taken in the years 2003 and
2004 with the COMPASS spectrometer at CERN with a 160 GeV muon beam from the
CERN SPS accelerator. The asymmetries can be interpreted in the context of
transversity as a convolution of the chiral-odd interference fragmentation
function $H_1^\sphericalangle$ with the transverse spin distribution of quarks
$\Delta_Tq(x)$. The measured azimuthal target spin asymmetries on the deuteron
are compatible with zero within a small statistical error of about 1%.
