Hadron production has been calculated in a pQCD improved parton model for pp,
dA and heavy ion collisions. We applied KKP and AKK fragmentation functions.
Our jet fragmentation study shows, that hadron ratios at high p_T depend on
quark contribution mostly and less on the gluonic one. This finding can be seen
in jet-energy loss calculations, also. We display the suppression pattern on
different hadron ratios in PbPb collisions at LHC energies.
