Random sequential adsorption of binary mixtures of extended objects on a
two-dimensional triangular lattice is studied numerically by means of Monte
Carlo simulations. The depositing objects are formed by self-avoiding random
walks on the lattice. We concentrate here on the influence of the symmetry
properties of the shapes on the kinetics of the deposition processes in
two-component mixtures. Approach to the jamming limit in the case of mixtures
is found to be exponential, of the form: $\theta(t) \sim
\theta_{jam}-\Delta\theta \exp (-t/\sigma),$ and the values of the parameter
$\sigma$ are determined by the order of symmetry of the less symmetric object
in the mixture. Depending on the local geometry of the objects making the
mixture, jamming coverage of a mixture can be either greater than both
single-component jamming coverages or it can be in between these values.
Results of the simulations for various fractional concentrations of the objects
in the mixture are also presented.
