We study the dynamics of a symmetric two-level system strongly coupled to a
broadened harmonic mode. Upon mapping the problem onto a spin-boson model with
peaked spectral density, we show how analytic solutions can be obtained, at
arbitrary detuning and finite temperatures, in the case of large Q-factors of
the oscillator. In general {\em two} or more oscillation frequencies of the
two-level particle are observed as a consequence of the entanglement with the
oscillator. Our approximated analytical solution well agrees with numerical
predictions obtained within the non-interacting blip approximation.
