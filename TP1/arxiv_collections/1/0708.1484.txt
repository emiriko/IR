We propose a physical implementation of the quantum NAND tree evaluation
algorithm. Our approach, based on continuous time quantum walks, uses the wave
interference of a single electron in a heirarchical set of tunnel coupled
quantum dots. We find that the query complexity of the NAND tree evaluation
does not suffer strongly from disorder and dephasing, nor is it directly
limited by temperature or restricted dimensionality for 2-d structures.
Finally, we suggest a potential application of this algorithm to the efficient
determination of high-order correlation functions of complex quantum systems.
