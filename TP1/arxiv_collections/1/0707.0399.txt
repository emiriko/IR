The energies of the low-lying isoscalar and isovector ud anti-s anti-s
configurations with spin-parity J^P=0^+, 1^+, and 2^+ are calculated in a
non-relativistic constituent quark model by use of the variational method. The
contributions of various parts of the quark-quark interacting potentials
including the s-channel interaction are investigated, and the effect of
different forms of confinement potential is examined. The model parameters are
determined by the same method as in our previous work, and they still can
satisfactorily describe the nucleon-nucleon scattering phase shifts and the
hyperon-nucleon cross sections. The parameters of the s-channel interaction are
fixed by the masses of K and K^* mesons, for which the size parameter is taken
to be two possible values. When it is chosen as the same as baryons', the
numerical results show that the masses of all the ud anti-s anti-s
configurations are higher than the corresponding meson-meson thresholds. But
when the size parameter for the K and K^* mesons is adjusted to be smaller than
that for the baryons, the ud anti-s anti-s configuration with I=0 and J^P=1^+
is found to lie lower than the K^*K^* threshold, furthermore, this state has a
very small KK^* component and the interaction matrix elements between this
state and KK^* is comparatively small, thus its coupling to the KK^* channel
will consequently be weak and it might be regarded as a possible tetraquark
candidate.
