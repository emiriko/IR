The release of a gas limited by surface desorption, or by diffusion from the
bulk of spherical pebbles is revisited. A method is proposed to identify the
release limiting process, by comparing a partial temperature ramp, up to
slightly beyond the release peak, followed by a rapid temperature drop, to a
second, full release ramp. Comparing the release curve from the second ramp to
that of the first one: i) the peak is unmoved in first order desorption
kinetics, and moves to higher temperature in the other cases, ii) as compared
to the Arrhenius analysis of the first curve, that of the second is, again,
identical in first order kinetics, in second order desorption it maintains the
slope but lowers the intercept at the reciprocal temperature origin, and it is
inapplicable in bulk diffusion kinetics.
