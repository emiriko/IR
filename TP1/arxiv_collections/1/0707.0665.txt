We discuss the character of states near the Fermi level in Mn doped GaAs, as
revealed by a survey of dc transport and optical studies over a wide range of
Mn concentrations. A thermally activated valence band contribution to dc
transport, a mid-infrared peak at energy hbar omega approx 200 meV in the ac-
conductivity, and the hot photoluminescence spectra indicate the presence of an
impurity band in low doped (<<1% Mn) insulating GaAs:Mn materials. Consistent
with the implications of this picture, both the impurity band ionization energy
inferred from the dc transport and the position of the mid-infrared peak move
to lower energies and the peak broadens with increasing Mn concentration. In
metallic materials with > 2% doping, no traces of Mn-related activated
contribution can be identified in dc-transport, suggesting that the impurity
band has merged with the valence band. No discrepancies with this perception
are found when analyzing optical measurements in the high-doped GaAs:Mn. A
higher energy (hbar omega approx 250 meV) mid-infrared feature which appears in
the metallic samples is associated with inter-valence band transitions. Its
red-shift with increased doping can be interpreted as a consequence of
increased screening which narrows the localized-state valence-band tails and
weakens higher energy transition amplitudes. Our examination of the dc and ac
transport characteristics of GaAs:Mn is accompanied by comparisons with its
shallow acceptor counterparts, confirming the disordered valence band picture
of high-doped metallic GaAs:Mn material.
