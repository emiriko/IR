In various areas of applied numerics, the problem of calculating the
logarithm of a matrix A emerges. Since series expansions of the logarithm
usually do not converge well for matrices far away from the identity, the
standard numerical method calculates successive square roots. In this article,
a new algorithm is presented that relies on the computation of successive
matrix exponentials. Convergence of the method is demonstrated for a large
class of initial matrices and favorable choices of the initial matrix are
discussed.
