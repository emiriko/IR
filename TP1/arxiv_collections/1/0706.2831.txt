Quantum vacuum energy (Casimir energy) is reviewed for a mathematical
audience as a topic in spectral theory. Then some one-dimensional systems are
solved exactly, in terms of closed classical paths and periodic orbits. The
relations among local spectral densities, energy densities, global eigenvalue
densities, and total energies are demonstrated. This material provides
background and motivation for the treatment of higher-dimensional systems
(self-adjoint second-order partial differential operators) by semiclassical
approximation and other methods.
