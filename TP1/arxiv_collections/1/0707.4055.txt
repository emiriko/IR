Precession of magnetization induced by pulsed optical excitation is observed
in a ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As by time-resolved magneto-optical
measurements. It appears as complicated oscillations of polarization plane of
linearly-polarized probe pulses, but is reproduced by gyromagnetic theory
incorporating an impulsive change in an effective magnetic field due to changes
in magnetic anisotropy. It is inferred from the shape of the impulse that the
changes in anisotropy result from non-equilibrium carrier population: cooling
of hot photo-carriers and subsequent annihilation of photo-carriers.
