Using the Cartan-Kahler theory, and results on real algebraic structures, we
prove two embedding theorems. First, the interior of a smooth, compact
3-manifold may be isometrically embedded into a G_2-manifold as an associative
submanifold. Second, the interior of a smooth, compact 4-manifold K, whose
double has a trivial bundle of self-dual 2-forms, may be isometrically embedded
into a Spin(7)-manifold as a Cayley submanifold. Along the way, we also show
that Bochner's Theorem on real analytic approximation of smooth differential
forms, can be obtained using real algebraic tools developed by Akbulut and
King.
