The decay channels $B_d^0 \to D^{*0} K^{*0}$ are investigated for extracting
weak $CKM$ phase information. These channels are described by color-suppressed
tree diagrams only and are free from penguin contributions. The branching
ratios for these channels are found to be $\sim \cal O $ $(10^{-5} - 10^{-6})$
which can be measured at the currently running $B$ factories. The method
presented here may be well-suited to determine the phase $\gamma$.
