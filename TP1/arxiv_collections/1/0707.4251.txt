The aim of this paper is to construct a Riemann-Lagrange geometry on 1-jet
spaces, in the sense of d-connections, d-torsions, d-curvatures,
electromagnetic d-field and geometric electromagnetic Yang-Mills energy,
starting from a given linear ODEs system or a given superior order ODE. The
case of a non-homogenous linear ODE of superior order is disscused.
