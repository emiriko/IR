The Lie-Poisson algebra so(N+1) and some of its contractions are used to
construct a family of superintegrable Hamiltonians on the ND spherical,
Euclidean, hyperbolic, Minkowskian and (anti-)de Sitter spaces. We firstly
present a Hamiltonian which is a superposition of an arbitrary central
potential with N arbitrary centrifugal terms. Such a system is quasi-maximally
superintegrable since this is endowed with 2N-3 functionally independent
constants of the motion (plus the Hamiltonian). Secondly, we identify two
maximally superintegrable Hamiltonians by choosing a specific central potential
and finding at the same time the remaining integral. The former is the
generalization of the Smorodinsky-Winternitz system to the above six spaces,
while the latter is a generalization of the Kepler-Coulomb potential, for which
the Laplace-Runge-Lenz N-vector is also given. All the systems and constants of
the motion are explicitly expressed in a unified form in terms of ambient and
polar coordinates as they are parametrized by two contraction parameters
(curvature and signature of the metric).
