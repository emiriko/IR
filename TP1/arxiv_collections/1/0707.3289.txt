By summarizing and extending the Lagrangian densities of the general
relativity and the Kibble's gauge theory of gravitation,a further generalized
Lagrangian density for a gravitational system is obtained and analyzed in
greater detail, which can be used for studying more extensive range of
gravitation. Many special cases can be derived from this generalized Lagrangian
density, their general characters and peculiarities will be briefly described.
