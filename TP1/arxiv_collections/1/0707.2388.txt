We model protein folding as a physical stochastic process as follows. The
unfolded protein chain is treated as a random coil described by SAW
(self-avoiding walk). Folding is induced by hydrophobic forces and other
interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, which can be taken into account by
imposing conditions on SAW. The resulting model is termed CSAW (conditioned
self-avoiding walk. Conceptually, the mathematical basis is a generalized
Langevin equation. In practice, the model is implemented on a computer by
combining SAW and Monte Carlo. To illustrate the flexibility and capabilities
of the model, we consider a number of examples, including folding pathways,
elastic properties, helix formation, and collective modes.
