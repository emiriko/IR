We summarize the relations among three classes of laws: infinitely divisible,
selfdecomposable and stable. First we look at them as the solutions of the
Central Limit Problem; then their role is scrutinized in relation to the Levy
and the additive processes with an emphasis on stationarity and selfsimilarity.
Finally we analyze the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes driven by Levy noises and
their selfdecomposable stationary distributions, and we end with a few
particular examples.
