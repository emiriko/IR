We use a light-cone sum rule (LCSR) analysis of the branching ratios of
radiative meson decays to contrain the value of the magnetic susceptibility of
the quark condensate $\chi(\mu)$. For the first time, we use a complete set of
three-particle distribution amplitudes that enables us to give a consistent
prediction for the branching ratios. Furthermore we will make use of a very
recent update of several non-perturbative parameters. Our final result for
$\chi(\mu= 1 {\rm GeV})= 2.85 \pm 0.5 {\rm GeV}^{-2}$ (assuming asymptotic wave
functions) agrees with the currently used value of $3.15 \pm 0.3 {\rm
GeV}^{-2}$.
