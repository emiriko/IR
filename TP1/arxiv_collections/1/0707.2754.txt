We study the effect of the relative S^5-angle of a quark and an antiquark on
their static potential and the related screening length in a strongly coupled
moving ${\cal N}=4$ SYM plasma. The large velocity scaling law for the
screening length holds for any relative S^5-angle $\theta$. However, the
velocity independent prefactor Z strongly depends on $\theta$. For comparison
with QCD we propose to average Z over all relative orientations on S^5. This
generates a suppression factor relative to the case $\theta =0$.
