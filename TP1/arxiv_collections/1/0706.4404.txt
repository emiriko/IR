Estimation of multiplicity of muons and pions production at high energy
proton-nuclei collisions is given. Both QED and QCD contributions are
considered for peripheral kinematics of muon pair and $\sigma$-meson
production, keeping in mind it's final conversion to muons. An attempt to
explain the excess of positive charged muons compared to negative one in cosmic
muon showers is given.
  We derive the dependence of cross-section of $n$ pairs as a function of $n$
at large n as $d^n(n!n^2)^{-1}$.
