Fifteen years ago, a structural analysis of the hormone insulin and the
retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB) revealed that they may physically
interact with one another. Subsequently, an RB peptide corresponding to the
proposed RB binding site for insulin was found to recognize full-length insulin
in vitro. As part of efforts aimed at developing this RB peptide into an
anti-cancer drug, this molecule was chemically coupled to a cellular
internalization signal and termed "MCR peptide". Meanwhile, several such MCR
peptide variants have been demonstrated to restrain the proliferation of
different human cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, one of the MCR
peptides coined MCR-10 was shown to be capable of interfering with the complex
formation between insulin and RB in HepG2 human hepatoma cells, as monitored by
immunofluorescence. This latter result indicating an in vivo association
between insulin and RB was confirmed by a follow-up study combining the methods
of co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Here, we provide evidence for the
existence of the insulin-RB complex in A549 human non-small cell lung cancer
cells. Specifically, we demonstrate this heterodimer by means of a magnetic
beads-based immunoprecipitation approach and equally show that this dimer can
be disrupted by MCR-4 or MCR-10 each of which is known to possess
antiproliferative properties, yet to a much lesser extent by a control peptide.
Thus, this investigation has yielded another important proof for the occurrence
of the insulin-RB dimer and, furthermore, its validity as a target for
antineoplastic MCR peptides.
