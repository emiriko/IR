We report the measurements of the t anti-t production cross section and of
the top quark mass using 1.02 fb^-1 of p anti-p data collected with the CDFII
detector at the Fermilab Tevatron. We select events with six or more jets on
which a number of kinematical requirements are imposed by means of a neural
network algorithm. At least one of these jets must be identified as initiated
by a b-quark candidate by the reconstruction of a secondary vertex. The cross
section is measured to be sigma_{tt}=8.3+-1.0(stat.)+2.0-1.5(syst.)+-0.5(lumi.)
pb, which is consistent with the standard model prediction. The top quark mass
of 174.0+-2.2(stat.)+-4.8(syst.) GeV/c^2 is derived from a likelihood fit
incorporating reconstructed mass distributions representative of signal and
background.
