We consider the self-energy and the self-force for an electrically charged
particle at rest in the wormhole space-time. We develop general approach and
apply it to two specific profiles of the wormhole throat with singular and with
smooth curvature. The self-force for these two profiles is found in manifest
form; it is an attractive force. We also find an expression for the self-force
in the case of arbitrary symmetric throat profile. Far from the throat the
self-force is always attractive.
