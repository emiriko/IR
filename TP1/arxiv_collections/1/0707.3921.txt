Inspired by the recent measurement of the B(E2;$0_{2}^{+} \to 2_{1}^+$) and
B(E0;$0_{2}^{+} \to 0_{1}^+$) values in $^{12}$Be, we give an interpretation of
available spectroscopic data on both $^{12}$Be and $^{11}$Be, using a simple
model which contains the essential feature of these two nuclei; the presence of
weakly-bound neutron(s) in deformed potentials. The agreement of the calculated
results with observed data is surprisingly good, including well-known strong E1
transitions in both nuclei.
