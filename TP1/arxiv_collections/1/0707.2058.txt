We present an advanced lateral triple quantum dot made by local anodic
oxidation. Three dots are coupled in a starlike geometry with one lead attached
to each dot thus allowing for multiple path transport measurements with two
dots per path. In addition charge detection is implemented using a quantum
point contact. Both in charge measurements as well as in transport we observe
clear signatures of states from each dot. Resonances of two dots can be
established allowing for serial transport via the corresponding path. Quadruple
points with all three dots in resonance are prepared for different electron
numbers and analyzed concerning the interplay of the simultaneously measured
transport along both paths.
