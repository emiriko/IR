We present a detailed analysis of meson-induced massive lepton (muon)
Drell--Yan production for the process $\pi^{-}N\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}X$, considering
both an unpolarized nucleon target and longitudinally polarized protons. Using
a QCD framework, we focus on the angular distribution of $\mu^+$, which is
sensitive to the shape of the pion distribution amplitude, the goal being to
test corresponding results against available experimental data. Predictions are
made, employing various pion distribution amplitudes, for the azimuthal angle
dependence of the $\mu^{+}$ distribution in the polarized case, relevant for
the planned COMPASS experiment. QCD evolution is given particular attention in
both considered cases.
