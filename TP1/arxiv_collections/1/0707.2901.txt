Field-tuned superconductor-insulator transition (FSIT) behavior in 2D
isotropic and homogeneous thin films is usually accompanied by a nonvanishing
critical resistance at low $T$. It is shown that, in a 2D film including line
defects paralle to each other but with random positions perpendicular to them,
the (apparent) critical resistance in low $T$ limit vanishes, as in the 1D
quantum superconducting (SC) transition, under a current parallel to the line
defects. This 1D-like critical resistive behavior is more clearly seen in
systems with weaker point disorder and may be useful in clarifying whether the
true origin of FSIT behavior in the parent superconductor is the glass
fluctuation or the quantum SC fluctuation. As a by-product of the present
calculation, it is also pointed out that, in 2D films with line-like defects
with a long but {\it finite} correlation length parallel to the lines, a
quantum metallic behavior intervening the insulating and SC ones appears in the
resistivity curves.
