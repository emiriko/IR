We report on the experimental combination of three advanced interferometer
techniques for gravitational wave detection, namely power-recycling, detuned
signal-recycling and squeezed field injection. For the first time we
experimentally prove the compatibility of especially the latter two. To achieve
a broadband non-classical sensitivity improvement we applied a filter cavity
for compensation of quadrature rotation. Signal to noise ratio was improved by
up to 2.8 dB beyond the coherent state's shot noise. The complete set-up was
stably locked for arbitrary times and characterized by injected single-sideband
modulation fields.
