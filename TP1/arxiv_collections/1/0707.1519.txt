Finsler and Lagrange spaces can be equivalently represented as almost Kahler
manifolds enabled with a metric compatible canonical distinguished connection
structure generalizing the Levi Civita connection. The goal of this paper is to
perform a natural Fedosov-type deformation quantization of such geometries. All
constructions are canonically derived for regular Lagrangians and/or
fundamental Finsler functions on tangent bundles.
