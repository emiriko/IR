We review the q-deformed spin network approach to topological quantum field
theory and apply these methods to produce unitary representations of the braid
groups that are dense in the unitary groups. The simplest case of these models
is the Fibonacci model, itself universal for quantum computation. We here
formulate these braid group representations in a shape suitable for computation
and algebraic work.
