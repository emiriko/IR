A two-parameter neutrino mass formula is described, giving a moderately
hierarchical spectrum m_1 < m_2 < m_3 consistent with the experimental
estimates of Delta m^2_{21} and Delta m^2_{32}. The formula follows from a
three-parameter empirical neutrino mass formula through imposing a parameter
constraint and leads to a very simple neutrino mass sum rule m_3 = 18 m_2 - 48
m_1. Some alternative parameter constraints, used tentatively to eliminate one
of three parameters, are compared.
