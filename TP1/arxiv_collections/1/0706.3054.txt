The resolution associated with the so-called perfect lens of thickness $d$ is
$-2\pi d/\ln(|\chi+2|/2)$. Here the susceptibility $\chi$ is a Hermitian
function in $H^2$ of the upper half-plane, i.e., a $H^2$ function satisfying
$\chi(-\omega)=\bar{\chi(\omega)}$. An additional requirement is that the
imaginary part of $\chi$ be nonnegative for nonnegative arguments. Given an
interval $I$ on the positive half-axis, we compute the distance in
$L^\infty(I)$ from a negative constant to this class of functions. This result
gives a surprisingly simple and explicit formula for the optimal resolution of
the perfect lens on a finite bandwidth.
