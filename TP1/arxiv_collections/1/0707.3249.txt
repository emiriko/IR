This paper is concerned with the effect of parameter fluctuations with a
characteristic waiting time in coupled R\"{o}ssler oscillators. We show that
the averaged error in synchronization that is introduced due to a fluctuating
parameter is proportional to the waiting time and the amplitude of the
fluctuations. It is also shown that coupling strength beyond a threshold value
does not have any significant effect on improving the quality of
synchronization when the fluctuations posses considerable waiting time.
