Surface modified amorphous nanoporous silica molecules with hydrophobic as
well as hydrophilic character can be effectively used as therapeutic drug for
combating chicken malaria in poultry industry. The amorphous nanosilica was
developed by top-down approach using volcanic soil derived silica as source
material. Amorphous silica has long been used as feed additive for poultry
industry and considered to be safe for human consumption by WHO and USDA. The
basic mechanism of action of these nanosilica molecules is mediated by the
physical absorption of VLDL, serum triglycerides and other serum cholesterol
components in the lipophilic nanopores of nanosilica. This reduces the supply
of the host derived cholesterol, thus limiting the growth of the malarial
parasite in vivo.
