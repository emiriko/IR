Maxwell's demon was born in 1867 and still thrives in modern physics. He
plays important roles in clarifying the connections between two theories:
thermodynamics and information. Here, we present the history of the demon and a
variety of interesting consequences of the second law of thermodynamics, mainly
in quantum mechanics, but also in the theory of gravity. We also highlight some
of the recent work that explores the role of information, illuminated by
Maxwell's demon, in the arena of quantum information theory.
