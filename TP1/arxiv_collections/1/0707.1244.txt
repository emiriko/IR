In this work, we calculate the current distribution, in the close vicinity of
the quantum point contacts (QPCs), taking into account the Coulomb interaction.
In the first step, we calculate the bare confinement potential of a generic QPC
and, in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field, obtain the positions of
the incompressible edge states (IES) taking into account electron-electron
interaction within the Thomas-Fermi theory of screening. Using a local version
of the Ohm's law, together with a relevant conductivity model, we also
calculate the current distribution. We observe that, the imposed external
current is confined locally into the incompressible strips. Our calculations
demonstrate that, the inclusion of the electron-electron interaction, strongly
changes the general picture of the transport through the QPCs.
