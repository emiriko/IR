A general Hamiltonian theory for the adiabatic motion of relativistic charged
particles confined by slowly-varying background electromagnetic fields is
presented based on a unified Lie-transform perturbation analysis in extended
phase space (which includes energy and time as independent coordinates) for all
three adiabatic invariants. First, the guiding-center equations of motion for a
relativistic particle are derived from the particle Lagrangian. Covariant
aspects of the resulting relativistic guiding-center equations of motion are
discussed and contrasted with previous works. Next, the second and third
invariants for the bounce motion and drift motion, respectively, are obtained
by successively removing the bounce phase and the drift phase from the
guiding-center Lagrangian. First-order corrections to the second and third
adiabatic invariants for a relativistic particle are derived. These results
simplify and generalize previous works to all three adiabatic motions of
relativistic magnetically-trapped particles.
