A theoretical scheme to generate multipartite entangled states in a Josephson
planar-designed architecture is reported. This scheme improves the one
published in [Phys. Rev. B 74, 104503 (2006)] since it speeds up the generation
of W entangled states in an MxN array of inductively coupled Josephson flux
qubits by reducing the number of necessary steps. In addition, the same
protocol is shown to be able to transfer the W state from one row to the other.
