Degeneracy of the genetic code is a biological way to minimize effects of the
undesirable mutation changes. Degeneration has a natural description on the
5-adic space of 64 codons $\mathcal{C}_5 (64) = \{n_0 + n_1 5 + n_2 5^2
  : n_i = 1, 2, 3, 4 \} ,$ where $n_i$ are digits related to nucleotides as
follows: C = 1, A = 2, T = U = 3, G = 4. The smallest 5-adic distance between
codons joins them into 16 quadruplets, which under 2-adic distance decay into
32 doublets. p-Adically close codons are assigned to one of 20 amino acids,
which are building blocks of proteins, or code termination of protein
synthesis. We shown that genetic code multiplets are made of the p-adic nearest
codons.
