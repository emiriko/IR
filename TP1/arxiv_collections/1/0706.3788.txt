A new measurement of the neutrino asymmetry parameter B in neutron decay, the
angular correlation between neutron spin and anti-neutrino momentum, is
presented. The result, B=0.9802(50), agrees with the Standard Model expectation
and earlier measurements, and permits improved tests on ``new physics'' in
neutron decay.
