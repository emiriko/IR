The atmospheric greenhouse effect, an idea that many authors trace back to
the traditional works of Fourier (1824), Tyndall (1861), and Arrhenius (1896),
and which is still supported in global climatology, essentially describes a
fictitious mechanism, in which a planetary atmosphere acts as a heat pump
driven by an environment that is radiatively interacting with but radiatively
equilibrated to the atmospheric system. According to the second law of
thermodynamics such a planetary machine can never exist. Nevertheless, in
almost all texts of global climatology and in a widespread secondary literature
it is taken for granted that such mechanism is real and stands on a firm
scientific foundation. In this paper the popular conjecture is analyzed and the
underlying physical principles are clarified. By showing that (a) there are no
common physical laws between the warming phenomenon in glass houses and the
fictitious atmospheric greenhouse effects, (b) there are no calculations to
determine an average surface temperature of a planet, (c) the frequently
mentioned difference of 33 degrees Celsius is a meaningless number calculated
wrongly, (d) the formulas of cavity radiation are used inappropriately, (e) the
assumption of a radiative balance is unphysical, (f) thermal conductivity and
friction must not be set to zero, the atmospheric greenhouse conjecture is
falsified.
