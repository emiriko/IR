Several nanoelectronic devices have been already proved. However, no
architecture which makes use of them provides a feasible opportunity to build
medium/large systems. Nanoarchitecture proposals only solve a small part of the
problems needed to achieve a real design. In this paper, we propose and analyze
a cell architecture that overcomes most of those at the gate level. Using the
cell structure we build 2 and 3-input NAND gates showing their error
probabilities. Finally, we outline a method to further improve the structure's
tolerance by taking advantage of interferences among nanodevices. Using this
improvement we show that it is possible to reduce the output standard deviation
by a factor larger than $\sqrt{2}$ and restitute the signal levels using
nanodevices.
