An important step in the calculation of the triply graded link homology
theory of Khovanov and Rozansky is the determination of the Hochschild homology
of Soergel bimodules for SL(n). We present a geometric model for this
Hochschild homology for any simple group G, as equivariant intersection
homology of B x B-orbit closures in G. We show that, in type A these orbit
closures are equivariantly formal for the conjugation T-action. We use this
fact to show that in the case where the corresponding orbit closure is smooth,
this Hochschild homology is an exterior algebra over a polynomial ring on
generators whose degree is explicitly determined by the geometry of the orbit
closure, and describe its Hilbert series, proving a conjecture of Jacob
Rasmussen.
