We present a simple novel scheme that converts a Gaussian beam into an
approximated radially polarized beam using coherent polarization manipulation
together with Poynting walk-off in birefringent crystals. Our scheme alleviates
the interferometric stability required by previous schemes that implemented
this coherent mode summation using Mach-Zehnder-like interferometers. A
symmetrical arrangement of two walk-off crystals with a half-wave plate, allows
coherence control even when the laser has short temporal coherence length. We
generated 14 watts of radially polarized beam from an Ytterbium fiber laser,
only limited by the available fiber laser power.
