Hybrid branching-time logics are introduced as extensions of CTL-like logics
with state variables and the downarrow-binder. Following recent work in the
linear framework, only logics with a single variable are considered. The
expressive power and the complexity of satisfiability of the resulting logics
is investigated.
  As main result, the satisfiability problem for the hybrid versions of several
branching-time logics is proved to be 2EXPTIME-complete. These branching-time
logics range from strict fragments of CTL to extensions of CTL that can talk
about the past and express fairness-properties. The complexity gap relative to
CTL is explained by a corresponding succinctness result.
  To prove the upper bound, the automata-theoretic approach to branching-time
logics is extended to hybrid logics, showing that non-emptiness of alternating
one-pebble Buchi tree automata is 2EXPTIME-complete.
