We demonstrate a wavelength-tunable, fiber-coupled source of
polarization-entangled photons with extremely high spectral brightness and
quality of entanglement. Using a 25 mm PPKTP crystal inside a polarization
Sagnac interferometer we detect a spectral brightness of 273000 pairs/(s mW
nm), a factor of 28 better than comparable previous sources while state
tomography showed the two-photon state to have a tangle of T=0.987. This
improvement was achieved by use of a long crystal, careful selection of
focusing parameters and single-mode fiber coupling. We demonstrate that, due to
the particular geometry of the setup, the signal and idler wavelengths can be
tuned over a wide range without loss of entanglement.
