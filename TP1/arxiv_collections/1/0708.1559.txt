Applying the fact that guided photons inside a waveguide can be treated as
massive particles, one can study the superluminality of evanescent modes via
showing that a massive particle can propagate over a spacelike interval, which
corresponds to quantum tunneling effects. For this purpose, we treat the
particle as a quantum reference frame, while attach an inertia observer to a
classical reference frame, and then quantize the formulae for the Lorentz
transformation between the quantum and classical reference frames, from which
we obtain the conclusion that, owing to the Heisenberg's uncertainty relation,
the particle can propagate over a spacelike interval.
