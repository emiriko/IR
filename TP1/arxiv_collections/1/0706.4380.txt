The term 'tomography' is commonly applied to the idea of studying properties
of a medium by the modifications this medium induces to a known probe
propagating through it. In the context of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion
collisions, rare high transverse momentum (p_T) processes taking place
alongside soft bulk-matter production can be viewed as a tomographic probe as
long as the energy scales are such that the modification of high p_T processes
can be dominantly ascribed to interactions with the medium during the
propagation of partons. Various high p_T observables have been suggested for
tomography, among them hard single hadron suppression, dihadron correlations
and gamma-hadron correlations. In this paper, we present a model study of a
number of different observables within the same calculational framework to
assess the sensitivity of the observables to different properties of the medium
and discuss the prospects of obtaining tomographic information.
