We study analytically and numerically the stability of the standing waves for
a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a point defect and a power type
nonlinearity. A main difficulty is to compute the number of negative
eigenvalues of the linearized operator around the standing waves, and it is
overcome by a perturbation method and continuation arguments. Among others, in
the case of a repulsive defect, we show that the standing wave solution is
stable in $\hurad$ and unstable in $\hu$ under subcritical nonlinearity.
Further we investigate the nature of instability: under critical or
supercritical nonlinear interaction, we prove the instability by blowup in the
repulsive case by showing a virial theorem and using a minimization method
involving two constraints. In the subcritical radial case, unstable bound
states cannot collapse, but rather narrow down until they reach the stable
regime (a {\em finite-width instability}). In the non-radial repulsive case,
all bound states are unstable, and the instability is manifested by a lateral
drift away from the defect, sometimes in combination with a finite-width
instability or a blowup instability.
