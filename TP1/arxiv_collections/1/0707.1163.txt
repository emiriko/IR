The parts contributed by the author in recent discussions with several
physicists and mathematicians are reviewed, as they have been occasioned by the
2006 book "The Trouble with Physics", of Lee Smolin. Some of the issues
addressed are the possible and not yet sufficiently explored relationship
between modern Mathematics and theoretical Physics, as well as the way
physicists may benefit from becoming more aware of what at present appear to be
certain less than fortunate yet essential differences between modern
Mathematics and theoretical Physics, as far as the significant freedom of
introducing new fundamental concepts, structures and theories in the former is
concerned. A number of modern mathematical concepts and structures are
suggested for consideration by physicists, when dealing with foundational
issues in present day theoretical Physics. Since here discussions with several
persons are reviewed, certain issues may be brought up more than one time. For
such repetitions the author ask for the kind understanding of the reader.
