We consider the late-time tails of spherical waves propagating on
even-dimensional Minkowski spacetime under the influence of a long range radial
potential. We show that in six and higher even dimensions there exist
exceptional potentials for which the tail has an anomalously small amplitude
and fast decay. Along the way we clarify and amend some confounding arguments
and statements in the literature of the subject.
