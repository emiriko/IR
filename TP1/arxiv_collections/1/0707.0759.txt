We discuss some properties of the Knill-Laflamme-Milburn scheme for quantum
teleportation with both maximally and nonmaximally entangled states. We derive
the error correction scheme when one performs teleportation with nonmaximally
entangled states and we find the probability for perfect teleportation. We show
that the maximally entangled state is optimal in such a case. We also show how
the error correction scheme can be implemented experimentally when one uses
polarization encoding.
