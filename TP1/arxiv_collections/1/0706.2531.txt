In this talk, we investigate the implications of R-parity violating (RPV)
operators in a model with family symmetry. Family symmetry can determine the
form of RPV operators as well as the Yukawa matrices. We consider a concrete
model with non-abelian discrete symmetry Q_6, which has only three RPV
trilinear operators with no baryon number violating terms. We find that ratios
of decay rates of the lepton flavor violating processes are fixed thanks to the
family symmetry, predicting BR(tau to 3e)/BR(tau to 3mu) ~ 4
m_{mu}^2/m_{tau}^2.
