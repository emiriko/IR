We characterize to what extent it is possible to modify the stationary states
of a quantum dynamical semigroup, that describes the irreversible evolution of
a two-level system, by means of an auxiliary two-level system. We consider
systems that can be initially entangled or uncorrelated. We find that the
indirect control of the stationary states is possible, even if there are not
initial correlations, under suitable conditions on the dynamical parameters
characterizing the evolution of the joint system.
