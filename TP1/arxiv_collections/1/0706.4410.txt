We propose a scheme for quantum state transfer(QST) between two qubits which
is based on their individual interaction with a common boson environment. The
corresponding single mode spin-boson Hamiltonian is solved by mapping it onto a
wave propagation problem in a semi-infinite ladder and the fidelity is
obtained. High fidelity occurs when the qubits are equally coupled to the boson
while the fidelity becomes smaller for nonsymmetric couplings. The complete
phase diagram for such an arbitrary QST mediated by bosons is discussed.
