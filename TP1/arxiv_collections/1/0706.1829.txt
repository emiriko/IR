Scale invariance may be a classical symmetry which is broken radiatively.
This provides a simple way to stabilize the scale of electroweak symmetry
breaking against radiative corrections. The simplest phenomenologically
successful model of this type involves the addition of one real scalar field to
the standard model. In this minimal model the electroweak Higgs can be
interpreted as the pseudo-Goldstone boson of broken scale invariance. We study
the possible origin of neutrino mass in such models, both at tree-level and
radiatively.
