We present EXAFS data at the Mn K and Tb L3 edges that provide upper limits
on the possible displacements of any atoms in TbMnO3. The displacements must be
less than 0.005-0.01A for all atoms which eliminates the possibility of
moderate distortions (0.02A) with a small c-axis component, but for which the
displacements in the ab plane average to zero. Assuming the polarization arises
from a displacement of the O2 atoms along the c-axis, the measured polarization
then leads to an O2 displacement that is at least 6X10^{-4}A, well below our
experimental limit. Thus a combination of the EXAFS and the measured electrical
polarization indicate that the atomic displacements likely lie in the range
6X10^{-4} - 5X10^{-3}A.
