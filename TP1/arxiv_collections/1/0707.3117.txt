We present a novel method for opto-mechanical cooling of sub-wavelength sized
nanomechanical resonators. Our scheme uses a high finesse Fabry-Perot cavity of
small mode volume, within which the nanoresonator is acting as a
position-dependant perturbation by scattering. In return, the back-action
induced by the cavity affects the nanoresonator dynamics and can cool its
fluctuations. We investigate such cavity cooling by scattering for a nanorod
structure and predict that ground-state cooling is within reach.
