This paper outlines the results from experiments performed to gain further
information about the structure and properties of cleaved silicon surfaces,
using vacuum cleavage luminescence detection methods. The experiments involved
detecting the luminescence produced by cleaving thin silicon plates within a
high vacuum, by a process of converting the luminescence to an amplified
electrical signal.
