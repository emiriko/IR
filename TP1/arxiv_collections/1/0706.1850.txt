We study the Casimir-Lifshitz interaction out of thermal equilibrium, with
particular attention devoted to the surface-surface and surface-atom
configurations. A systematic investigation of the contributions to the force
coming from the propagating and evanescent components of the electromagnetic
radiation is performed. The large distance behaviors of such interactions is
discussed, and both analytical and numerical results are compared with the
equilibrium ones. A detailed analysis of the crossing between the
surface-surface and the surface-rarefied body, and finally the surface-atom
force is shown, and a complete derivation and discussion of the recently
predicted non-additivity effects and new asymptotic behaviors is presented.
