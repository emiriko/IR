Two different types of Cooper pair transistors, with Al and Nb islands, have
been investigated in a tunable electromagnetic environment. The device with an
Al island demonstrates gate charge modulation with 2e-periodicity in a wide
range of environmental impedances at bath temperatures below 340 mK. Contrary
to the results of the Al sample, we were not able to detect 2e-periodicity
under any conditions on similar samples with Nb island. We attribute this to
the material properties of Nb.
