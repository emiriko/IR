We study several structure properties of finite nuclei using relativistic
mean-field Lagrangians constructed according to the Brown-Rho scaling due to
the chiral symmetry restoration at high densities. The models are consistent
with current experimental constraints for the equations of state of symmetric
matter at both normal and supra-normal densities and of asymmetric matter at
sub-saturation densities. It is shown that these models can successfully
describe the binding energies and charge radii of finite nuclei. Compared to
calculations with usual relativistic mean-field models, these models give a
reduced thickness of neutron skin in ^{208}Pb between 0.17 fm and 0.21 fm. The
reduction of the predicted neutron skin thickness is found to be due to not
only the softening of the symmetry energy but also the scaling property of
$\rho $ meson required by the partial restoration of chiral symmetry.
