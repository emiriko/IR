Recent neutron scattering experiments have revealed that the generic form of
the magnetic excitations in the high-Tc cuprates of wide range of doping has
the so-called "hourglass" shape; it features both upward and downward
excitations at the incommensurate (IC) momenta spanning from the resonance peak
at the commensurate momentum $(\pi,\pi)$. We propose the two-component
spin-fermion model as a minimal phenomenological model which has both local
spins and itinerant fermions as independent degrees of freedom. Our
calculations of the dynamic spin correlation function provide good agreement
with experiments and show: (1) the upward dispersion branch of magnetic
excitations is mostly due to the local spin excitations; (2) the downward
dispersion branch is from collective spin excitations of fermions; (3) the
resonance mode is a mixture of both degrees of freedom.
