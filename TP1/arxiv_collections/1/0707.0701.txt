In this paper, we study the application of sparse principal component
analysis (PCA) to clustering and feature selection problems. Sparse PCA seeks
sparse factors, or linear combinations of the data variables, explaining a
maximum amount of variance in the data while having only a limited number of
nonzero coefficients. PCA is often used as a simple clustering technique and
sparse factors allow us here to interpret the clusters in terms of a reduced
set of variables. We begin with a brief introduction and motivation on sparse
PCA and detail our implementation of the algorithm in d'Aspremont et al.
(2005). We then apply these results to some classic clustering and feature
selection problems arising in biology.
