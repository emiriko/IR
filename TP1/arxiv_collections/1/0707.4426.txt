We study the effect of the ferromagnetic (FM) contacts on the spin
accumulation in the lateral spin valve system for the collinear magnetization
configurations. When an additional FM electrode is introduced in the
all-metallic lateral spin-valve system, we find that the transresistance can be
fractionally suppressed or very weakly influenced depending on the position of
the additional FM electrode, and relative magnitudes of contact resistance and
the bulk resistance defined over the spin diffusion length. Nonlocal spin
signals such as nonlocal voltage drop and leakage spin currents are independent
of the magnetization orientation of the additional FM electrode. Even when the
additional contact is nonmagnetic, nonlocal spin signals can be changed by the
spin current leaking into the nonmagnetic electrode.
