In this paper we investigate several properties of the full signal-idler-pump
mode quantum state generated by a triply resonant non-degenerate Optical
Parametric Oscillator operating above threshold, with an injected wave on the
signal and idler modes in order to lock the phase diffusion process. We
determine and discuss the spectral purity of this state, which turns out not to
be always equal to 1 even though the three interacting modes have been taken
into account at the quantum level. We have seen that the purity is essentially
dependent on the weak intensity of the injected light and on an asymmetry of
the synchronization. We then derive the expression of its total three-mode
Glauber P-function, and calculate the joint signal-idler photon number
probability distribution and investigate their dependence on the injection.
