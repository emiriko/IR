The Maxwell equations with accounting for tensors properties of time have
been considered. The effects that follow from such consideration are described.
These are the appearance of vacuum polarization, anisotropy of electromagnetic
wave velocity in vacuum, anisotropy of the vacuum dielectric permittivity,
rotation of light polarization plane, as well as the existence of longitudinal
components of electromagnetic wave and the rotational (non-potential) component
of electric field caused by electric charges.
