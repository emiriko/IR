A mechanism for the enhancement for proton lifetime in
supersymmetric/supergravity (SUSY/SUGRA) grand unified theories (GUTs) and in
string theory models is discussed where Higgsino mediated proton decay arising
from color triplets (anti-triplets) with charges $Q=-1/3(1/3)$ and
$Q=-4/3(4/3)$ is suppressed by an internal cancellation due to contributions
from different sources. We exhibit the mechanism for an SU(5) model with
$45_H+\bar{45}_H$ Higgs multiplets in addition to the usual Higgs structure of
the minimal model. This model contains both $Q=-1/3(1/3)$ and $Q=-4/3(4/3)$
Higgs color triplets (anti-triplets) and simple constraints allow for a
complete suppression of Higgsino mediated proton decay. Suppression of proton
decay in an SU(5) model with Planck scale contributions is also considered. The
suppression mechanism is then exhibited for an SO(10) model with a unified
Higgs structure involving $144_H+\bar{144}_H$ representations.The SU(5)
decomposition of $144_H+\bar{144}_H$ contains $5_H+\bar 5_H$ and
$45_H+\bar{45}_H$ and the cancellation mechanism arises among these
contributions which mirrror the SU(5) case. The cancellation mechanism appears
to be more generally valid for a larger class of unification models.
Specifically the cancellation mechanism may play a role in string model
constructions to suppress proton decay from dimension five operators. The
mechanism allows for the suppression of proton decay consistent with current
data allowing for the possibility that proton decay may be visible in the next
round of nucleon stability experiment.
