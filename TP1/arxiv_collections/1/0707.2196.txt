We study the reduced single-particle density matrix (RSPDM), the momentum
distribution, natural orbitals and their occupancies, of dark "soliton" (DS)
states in a Tonks-Girardeau gas. DS states are specially tailored excited
many-body eigenstates, which have a dark solitonic notch in their
single-particle density. The momentum distribution of DS states has a
characteristic shape with two sharp spikes. We find that the two spikes arise
due to the high degree of correlation observed within the RSPDM between the
mirror points ($x$ and $-x$) with respect to the dark notch at $x=0$; the
correlations oscillate rather than decay as the points $x$ and $-x$ are being
separated.
