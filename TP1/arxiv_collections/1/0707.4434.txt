We study parameter estimation of supermassive black hole binary systems in
the final stage of inspiral using the full post-Newtonian gravitational
waveforms. We restrict our analysis to systems in circular orbit with
negligible spins, in the mass range $10^8\Ms-10^5\Ms$, and compare the results
with those arising from the commonly used restricted post-Newtonian
approximation. The conclusions of this work are particularly important with
regard to the astrophysical reach of future LISA measurements. Our analysis
clearly shows that modeling the inspiral with the full post-Newtonian waveform,
not only extends the reach to higher mass systems, but also improves in general
the parameter estimation. In particular, there are remarkable improvements in
angular resolution and distance measurement for systems with a total mass
higher than $5\times10^6\Ms$, as well as a large improvement in the mass
determination.
