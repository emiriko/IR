The results of 3 experiments in Costas arrays are presented, for which
theoretical explanation is still not available: the number of dots on the main
diagonal of exponential Welch arrays, the parity populations of Golomb arrays
generated in fields of characteristic 2, and the maximal cross-correlation
between pairs of Welch or Golomb arrays generated in fields of size equal to a
Sophie Germain prime.
