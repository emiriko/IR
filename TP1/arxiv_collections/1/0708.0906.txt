We consider a simple setup in which a small quantum dot is strongly connected
to a finite size box. This box can be either a metallic box or a finite size
quantum wire.The formation of the Kondo screening cloud in the box strongly
depends on the ratio between the Kondo temperature and the box level spacing.
By weakly connecting two metallic reservoirs to the quantum dot, a detailed
spectroscopic analysis can be performed. Since the transport channels and the
screening channels are almost decoupled, such a setup allows an easier access
to the measure of finite-size effects associated with the finite extension of
the Kondo cloud.
