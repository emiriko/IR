We determine the physical properties of \emph{p}-wave Feshbach molecules in
doubly spin-polarized $^{40}$K and find excellent agreement with recent
experiments. We show that these molecules have a large probability $Z$ to be in
the closed channel or bare molecular state responsible for the Feshbach
resonance. In the superfluid state this allows for observation of Rabi
oscillations between the molecular and atomic components of the Bose-Einstein
condensed pairs, which contains a characteristic signature of the quantum phase
transition that occurs as a function of applied magnetic field.
