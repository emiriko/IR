We consider interaction effects in quantum point contacts on the first
quantization plateau, taking into account all non momentum-conserving
processes. We compute low-temperature linear and non-linear conductance, shot
noise, and thermopower by perturbation theory, and show that they are
consistent with experimental observations on the so-called "0.7 anomaly". The
full temperature-dependent conductance is obtained from self-consistent
second-order perturbation theory and approaches ~ e^2/h at higher temperatures,
but still smaller than the Fermi temperature.
