Binding energies of three-body systems of the type \phi+2N are estimated. Due
to the strong attraction between \phi-meson and nucleon, suggested in different
approaches, bound states can appear in systems like \phi+np (singlet and
triplet) and \phi+pp. This indicates the principal possibility of the formation
of new nuclear clusters.
