Recently, Bender et al. have considered the quantum brachistochrone problem
for the non-Hermitian $\cal PT$-symmetric quantum system and have shown that
the optimal time evolution required to transform a given initial state
$|\psi_i\rangle$ into a specific final state $|\psi_f\rangle$ can be made
arbitrarily small. Additionally, it has been shown that finding the shortest
possible time requires only the solution of the two-dimensional problem for the
quantum system governed by the effective Hamiltonian acting in the subspace
spanned by $|\psi_i\rangle$ and $|\psi_f\rangle$. In this paper, we study a
similar problem for the generic non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, focusing our
attention on the geometric aspects of the problem.
