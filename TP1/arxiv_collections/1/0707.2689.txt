The long-time behavior of the velocity autocorrelation function (VACF) is
investigated by the molecular dynamics simulation of a two-dimensional system
which has both a many-body interaction and a random potential. With
strengthening the random potential by increasing the density of impurities, a
crossover behavior of the VACF is observed from a positive tail, which is
proportional to t^{-1}, to a negative tail, proportional to -t^{-2}. The latter
tail exists even when the density of particles is the same order as the density
of impurities. The behavior of the VACF in a nonequilibrium steady state is
also studied. In the linear response regime the behavior is similar to that in
the equilibrium state, whereas it changes drastically in the nonlinear response
regime.
