Gaseous detectors are fundamental components of all present and planned high
energy physics experiments.
  Over the past decade two representatives (GEM, Micromegas) of the
Micro-Pattern Gas Detector (MPGD) concept have become increasingly important;
the high radiation resistance and excellent spatial and time resolution make
them an invaluable tool to confront future detector challenges at the next
generation of colliders.
  Novel structures where GEM and Micromegas are directly coupled to the CMOS
multi-pixel readout represent an exciting field and allow to reconstruct
fine-granularity, two-dimensional images of physics events. Originally
developed for the high energy physics, MPGD applications have expanded to
astrophysics, neutrino physics, neutron detection and medical imaging.
