Various self-organized characteristics of the international system can be
identified with the help of a complexity science perspective. The perspective
discussed in this article is based on various complexity science concepts and
theories, and concepts related to ecology and ecosystems. It can be argued that
the Great Power war dynamics of the international system in Europe during the
period 1480-1945, showed self-organized critical (SOC) characteristics,
resulting in a punctuated equilibrium dynamic. It seems that the
SOC-characteristics of the international system and the punctuated equilibrium
dynamic were - in combination with chaotic war dynamics - functional in a
process of social expansion in Europe. According to a model presented in this
article, population growth was a component of the driving force of the
international system during this time frame. The findings of this exploratory
research project contradict with generally held opinions in International
Relations theory.
