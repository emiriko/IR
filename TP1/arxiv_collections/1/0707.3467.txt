We present a technique that allows to obtain certain results in the
compressible fluid theory: in particular, it is a nonexistence result for the
highly decreasing at infinity solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, the
construction of the solutions with uniform deformation and the study of
behavior of the boundary of a material volume of liquid.
