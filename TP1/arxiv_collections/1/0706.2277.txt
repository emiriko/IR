We present and investigate different external cavity diode laser (ECDL)
configurations for the manipulation of neutrals atoms, wavelength-stabilized by
a narrow-band high transmission interference filter. A novel diode laser,
providing high output power of more than 1 W, with a linewidth of less than 200
kHz, based on a self-seeded tapered amplifier chip has been developed.
Additionally, we compare the optical and spectral properties of two laser
systems based on common laser diodes, differing in their coating, as well as
one, based on a distributed-feedback (DFB) diode. The linear cavity setup in
all these systems combines a robust and compact design with a high wavelength
tunability and an improved stability of the optical feedback compared to diode
laser setups using diffraction gratings for wavelength discrimination.
