We measure a sequence of quantum Hall-like plateaux at 1/q: 9 >= q >= 2 and
p/q = 2/9 fractions in the magnetisation with increasing magnetic field in the
geometrically frustrated spin system SrCu2(BO3)2. We find that the entire
observed sequence of plateaux is reproduced by solving the Hofstadter problem
on the system lattice when short-range repulsive interactions are included,
thus providing a sterling demonstration of bosons confined by a magnetic and
lattice potential mimicking fermions in the extreme quantum limit.
