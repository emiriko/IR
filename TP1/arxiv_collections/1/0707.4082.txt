We report on the dewetting of a monolayer on a solid substrate, where mass
transport occurs via surface diffusion. For a wide range of parameters, a
labyrinthine pattern of bilayer islands is formed. An irreversible regime and a
thermodynamic regime are identified. In both regimes, the velocity of a
dewetting front, the wavelength of the bilayer island pattern, and the rate of
nucleation of dewetted zones are obtained. We also point out the existence of a
scaling behavior, which is analyzed by means of a geometrical model.
