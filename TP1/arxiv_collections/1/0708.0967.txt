We consider a gyroscopic system under the action of small dissipative and
non-conservative positional forces, which has its origin in the models of
rotating bodies of revolution being in frictional contact. The spectrum of the
unperturbed gyroscopic system forms a "spectral mesh" in the plane "frequency
-gyroscopic parameter" with double semi-simple purely imaginary eigenvalues at
zero value of the gyroscopic parameter. It is shown that dissipative forces
lead to the splitting of the semi-simple eigenvalue with the creation of the
so-called "bubble of instability" - a ring in the three-dimensional space of
the gyroscopic parameter and real and imaginary parts of eigenvalues, which
corresponds to complex eigenvalues. In case of full dissipation with a
positive-definite damping matrix the eigenvalues of the ring have negative real
parts making the bubble a latent source of instability because it can "emerge"
to the region of eigenvalues with positive real parts due to action of both
indefinite damping and non-conservative positional forces. In the paper, the
instability mechanism is analytically described with the use of the
perturbation theory of multiple eigenvalues. As an example stability of a
rotating circular string constrained by a stationary load system is studied in
detail. The theory developed seems to give a first clear explanation of the
mechanism of self-excited vibrations in the rotating structures in frictional
contact, that is responsible for such well-known phenomena of acoustics of
friction as the squealing disc brake and the singing wine glass.
