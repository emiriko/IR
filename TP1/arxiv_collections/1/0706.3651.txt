We have studied the structure of K- pp comprehensively by solving this
three-body system in a variational method, starting from the Ansatz that the
Lambda(1405) resonance (~ Lambda*) is a K-p bound state. The structure of K-pp
reveals a molecular feature, namely, the K- in Lambda* as an "atomic center"
plays a key role in producing strong covalent bonding with the other proton. We
point out that strongly bound Kbar nuclear systems are formed by ``super
strong" nuclear force due to migrating real bosonic particles Kbar a la
Heitler-London-Heisenberg, whereas the normal nuclear force is caused by
mediating virtual pions. We have shown that the elementary process, p + p -->
K+ + Lambda* + p, which occurs in a short impact parameter and with a large
momentum transfer, leads to unusually large self-trapping of Lambda* by the
involved proton, since the Lambda*-p system exists as a compact doorway state
propagating to K-pp.
