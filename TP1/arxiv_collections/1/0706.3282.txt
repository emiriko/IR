We construct unified products for braided Lie bialgebras. Some special cases
of unified products such as crossed product and matched pair of braided Lie
bialgebras are studied. It is proved that the extending problem for Lie
bialgebras can be classified by some non-abelian cohomology theory of braided
Lie bialgebras. As a byproduct, a non-abelian extension theory of Lie
bialgebras is developed. Furthermore, one dimensional flag extending systems of
Lie bialgebras are also investigated.
