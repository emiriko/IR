The impedance measurement technique consists in that the phase-dependent
(parametric) inductance of the system is probed by the classical tank circuit
via measuring the voltage. The notion of the parametric inductance for the
impedance measurement technique is revisited for the case when a quantum system
is probed. Measurement of the quantum state of the system of superconducting
circuits (qubits) is studied theoretically. It is shown that the result of the
measurement is defined by the partial energy levels populations in the qubits.
