In this paper, we study the competition of linear and nonlinear lattices and
its effects on the stability and dynamics of bright solitary waves. We consider
both lattices in a perturbative framework, whereby the technique of Hamiltonian
perturbation theory can be used to obtain information about the existence of
solutions, and the same approach, as well as eigenvalue count considerations,
can be used to obtained detailed conditions about their linear stability. We
find that the analytical results are in very good agreement with our numerical
findings and can also be used to predict features of the dynamical evolution of
such solutions.
