This paper contains the results of our investigations of BPS instantons and
of our work on N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories. The BPS instantons we study
appear in type II string theory compactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds. In
the corresponding four-dimensional effective supergravity actions the BPS
instantons arise as finite action solutions to the Euclidean equations of
motion. For N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories we construct general Lagrangians
involving gauge groups with (non-abelian) electric and magnetic (dyonic)
charges. In this work a coupling to hypermultiplets is included.
