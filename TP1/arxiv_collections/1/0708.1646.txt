Self excitation is a mechanism which is ubiquitous for electromechanical
power devices such as electrical generators. This is conventionally achieved by
making use of the magnetic field component in electrical generators [1], where
a good example are the overall visible wind farm turbines [2]. In other words,
a static force, like wind acting on the rotor blades, can generate a resonant
excitation at a certain mechanical frequency. For nanomechanical systems
[3,4,5] such a self excitation (SE) mechanism is highly desirable as well,
since it can generate mechanical oscillations at radio frequencies by simply
applying a DC bias voltage. This is of great importance for low-power signal
communication devices and detectors, as well as for mechanical computing
elements. For a particular nanomechanical system - the single electron shuttle
- this effect was predicted some time ago by Gorelik et al. [6]. Here, we use a
nano-electromechanical single electron transistor (NEMSET) to demonstrate self
excitation for both the soft and hard regime, respectively. The ability to use
self excitation in nanomechanical systems may enable the detection of quantum
mechanical backaction effects [7] in direct tunneling, macroscopic quantum
tunneling [8], and rectification [9]. All these effects have so far been over
shadowed by the large driving voltages, which had to be applied.
