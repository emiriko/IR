Small-angle detectors at the LHC give access to a broad physics programme
within and beyond the Standard Model (SM). We review the capabilities of ALICE,
ATLAS, CMS, LHCb, LHCf and TOTEM for forward physics studies in various
sectors: soft and hard diffractive processes, exclusive Higgs production, low-x
QCD, ultra-high-energy cosmic-rays, and electro-weak measurements.
