The Kd reactions are considered in the impulse approximation with NN
final-state interactions (NN FSI) taken into account. The realistic parameters
for the KN phase shifts are used. The "quasi-elastic" energy region, in which
the elementary KN interaction is predominantly elastic, is considered. The
theoretical predictions are compared with the data on the K^+d->K^+pn,
K^+d->K^0pp, K^+d->K^+d and K^+d total cross sections. The NN FSI effect in the
reaction K^+d->K^+pn has been found to be large. The predictions for the Kd
cross sections are also given for slow kaons, produced from phi(1020) decays,
as the functions of the isoscalar KN scattering length a_0. These predictions
can be used to extract the value of a_0 from the data.
