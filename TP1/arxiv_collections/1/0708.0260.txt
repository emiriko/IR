We discuss neutrino oscillations in an experiment with M\"ossbauer recoilless
resonance absorbtion of tritium antineutrinos, proposed recently by Raghavan.
We demonstrate that small energy uncertainty of antineutrinos which ensures a
large resonance absorption cross section is in a conflict with the energy
uncertainty which, according to the time-energy uncertainty relation, is
necessary for neutrino oscillations to happen. The search for neutrino
oscillations in the M\"ossbauer neutrino experiment would be an important test
of the applicability of the time-energy uncertainty relation to a newly
discovered interference phenomenon.
