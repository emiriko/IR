The axial charge g_A is calculated in the epsilon regime of Heavy Baryon
Chiral Perturbation Theory to order epsilon^3. To perform this calculation, we
develop a technique to compute baryon properties in the epsilon regime of
Chiral Perturbation Theory. This technique includes contributions from pion
zero momentum modes and can be used at arbitrary order, diagram by diagram, in
the $\epsilon$ regime to calculate any matrix element. Also, a calculation of
g_A in the epsilon' regime to order epsilon'^3 is performed. A discussion of
the domain of applicability for both the epsilon and epsilon' regimes is also
included.
