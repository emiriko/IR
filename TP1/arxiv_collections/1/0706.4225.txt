In this paper we describe the well studied process of renormalization of
quadratic polynomials from the point of view of their natural extensions. In
particular, we describe the topology of the inverse limit of infinitely
renormalizable quadratic polynomials and prove that when they satisfy a-priori
bounds, the topology is rigid modulo its combinatorics.
