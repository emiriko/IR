We give a goal-oriented a posteriori error estimator for the
atomistic-continuum modeling error in the quasicontinuum method, and we use
this estimator to design an adaptive algorithm to compute a quantity of
interest to a given tolerance by using a nearly minimal number of atomistic
degrees of freedom. We present computational results that demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm for a periodic array of dislocations described
by a Frenkel-Kontorova type model.
