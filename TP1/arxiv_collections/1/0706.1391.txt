Electron properties of graphene are described in terms of Dirac fermions.
Here we thoroughly outline the elastic scattering theory for the
two-dimensional massive Dirac fermions in the presence of an axially symmetric
potential. While the massless limit is relevant for pristine graphene, keeping
finite mass allows for generalizations onto situations with broken symmetry
between the two sublattices, and provides a link to the scattering theory of
electrons in a parabolic band. We demonstrate that the Dirac theory requires
short-distance regularization for potentials which are more singular than 1/r.
The formalism is then applied to scattering off a smooth short-ranged
potential. Next we consider the Coulomb potential scattering, where the Dirac
theory is consistent for a point scatterer only for the effective impurity
strength below 1/2. From the scattering phase shifts we obtain the exact
Coulomb transport cross-section in terms of the impurity strength. The results
are relevant for transport in graphene in the presence of impurities that do
not induce scattering between the Dirac points in the Brillouin zone.
