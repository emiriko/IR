A detailed investigation of first order ferrimagnetic (FRI) to
antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition in Co (15%) doped $Mn_2Sb$ is carried out.
These measurements demonstrate anomalous thermomagnetic irreversibility and
glass-like frozen FRI phase at low temperatures. The irreversibility arising
between the supercooling and superheating spinodals is distinguised in an
ingenious way from the irreversibility arising due to kinetic arrest. Field
annealing measurements shows reentrant FRI-AFM-FRI transition with increasing
temperature. These measurements also show that kinetic arrest band and
supercooling band are anitcorrelated i.e regions which are kinetically arrested
at higher temperature have lower supercooling temperature and vice versa.
