The real Ginibre ensemble consists of random $N \times N$ matrices formed
from i.i.d. standard Gaussian entries. By using the method of skew orthogonal
polynomials, the general $n$-point correlations for the real eigenvalues, and
for the complex eigenvalues, are given as $n \times n$ Pfaffians with explicit
entries. A computationally tractable formula for the cumulative probability
density of the largest real eigenvalue is presented. This is relevant to May's
stability analysis of biological webs.
