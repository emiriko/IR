We study the quantization of abelian gauge theories of principal torus
bundles over compact manifolds with and without boundary. It is shown that
these gauge theories suffer from a Gribov ambiguity originating in the
non-triviality of the bundle of connections whose geometrical structure will be
analyzed in detail. Motivated by the stochastic quantization approach we
propose a modified functional integral measure on the space of connections that
takes the Gribov problem into account. This functional integral measure is used
to calculate the partition function, the Greens functions and the field
strength correlating functions in any dimension using the fact that the space
of inequivalent connections itself admits the structure of a bundle over a
finite dimensional torus. The Greens functions are shown to be affected by the
non-trivial topology, giving rise to non-vanishing vacuum expectation values
for the gauge fields.
