Bibliometric measures of individual scientific achievement are of particular
interest if they can be used to predict future achievement. Here we report
results of an empirical study of the predictive power of the h-index compared
to other indicators. Our findings indicate that the h-index is better than
other indicators considered (total citation count, citations per paper, and
total paper count) in predicting future scientific achievement. We discuss
reasons for the superiority of the h-index.
