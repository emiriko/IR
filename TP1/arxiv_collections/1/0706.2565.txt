Measurements of Zgamma* production are presented using data collected by the
DELPHI detector at centre-of-mass energies ranging from 183 to 209 GeV,
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 667 pb^{-1}. The
measurements cover a wide range of the possible final state four-fermion
configurations: hadronic and leptonic (e+ e- q qbar, mu+ mu- q qbar, q qbar nu
nubar), fully leptonic (l+ l- l'+ l'-) and fully hadronic final states (q qbar
q qbar, with a low mass q qbar pair). Measurements of the Zgamma* cross-section
for the various final states have been compared with the Standard Model
expectations and found to be consistent within the errors. In addition, a total
cross-section measurement of the l+ l- l'+ l'- cross-section is reported, and
found to be in agreement with the prediction of the Standard Model.
