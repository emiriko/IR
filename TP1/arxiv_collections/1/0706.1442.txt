An extension of the New Standard Model, by introducing a mixing of the low
mass ``active'' neutrinos with heavy ones, or by any model with lepton flavor
violation, is considered. This leads to non-orthogonal neutrino production and
detection states and to modifications of neutrino oscillations in both, vacuum
and matter. The possibility of the discovery of such effects in current and
future neutrino oscillation experiments is discussed. First order approximation
formulas for the flavor transition probabilities in constant density matter,
for all experimentally available channels, are given. Numerical calculations of
flavor transition probabilities for two sets of New Physics parameters
describing a single ``effective'' heavy neutrino state, both satisfying present
experimental constraints, have been performed. Two energy ranges and several
baselines, assuming both the current ($\pm2\sigma$) and the expected in future
($\pm3%$) errors of the neutrino oscillation parameters are considered, keeping
their present central values. It appears that the biggest potential of the
discovery of the possible presence of any New Physics is pronounced in
oscillation channels in which $\nu_{e}$, $\nu_{\bar{e}}$ are not involved at
all, especially for two baselines, $L=3000 km$ and $L=7500 km$, which for other
reasons are also called ``magic'' for future $Neutrino Factory$ experiments.
