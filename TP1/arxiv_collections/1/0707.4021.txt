Results are presented of beam tests in which a small electromagnetic
calorimeter consisting of lead tungstate crystals was exposed to 50 GeV
electrons and pions. This calorimeter was backed up by the DREAM Dual-Readout
calorimeter, which measures the scintillation and \v{C}erenkov light produced
in the shower development, using two different media. The signals from the
crystal calorimeter were analyzed in great detail in an attempt to determine
the contributions from these two types of light to the signals, event by event.
This information makes it possible to eliminate the dominating source of
fluctuations and thus achieve an important improvement in hadronic calorimeter
performance.
