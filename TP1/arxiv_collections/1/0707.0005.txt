We interpret the current experimental limit on the lightest Higgs boson mass
to suggest that if nature is supersymmetric, there are additional interactions
beyond those of the MSSM coming from new degrees of freedom around the TeV
scale. Within an effective field theory analysis, the leading order corrections
to the MSSM are described in terms of only two operators. This provides a
highly constrained description of Beyond MSSM (BMSSM) physics. The scalar Higgs
spectrum as well as the chargino and neutralino spectrum and couplings are
modified in a distinctive way. These operators can be generated by a variety of
microscopic mechanisms.
