We report on the realization of a Chromium Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)
with strong dipolar interaction. By using a Feshbach resonance, we reduce the
usual isotropic contact interaction, such that the anisotropic magnetic
dipole-dipole interaction between 52Cr atoms becomes comparable in strength.
This induces a change of the aspect ratio of the cloud, and, for strong dipolar
interaction, the inversion of ellipticity during expansion - the usual "smoking
gun" evidence for BEC - can even be suppressed. These effects are accounted for
by taking into account the dipolar interaction in the superfluid hydrodynamic
equations governing the dynamics of the gas, in the same way as classical
ferrofluids can be described by including dipolar terms in the classical
hydrodynamic equations. Our results are a first step in the exploration of the
unique properties of quantum ferrofluids.
