It is known that the biological activity of the brain involves radiation of
electric waves. These waves result from ionic currents and charges traveling
among the brain's neurons. But it is obvious that these ions and charges are
carried by their relevant masses which should give rise, according to the
gravitational theory, to extremely weak gravitational waves.
  We use in the following the stochastic quantization (SQ) theory to calculate
the probability to find a large ensemble of brains radiating similar
gravitational waves. We also use this SQ theory to derive the equilibrium state
related to the known Lamb shift.
