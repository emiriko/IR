Very thin (1.2-2.5nm) self-assembled organic dielectric monolayers have been
integrated into organic thin-film diode to achieve electrical characteristics.
These dielectrics are fabricated by self-assembling deposition, resulting in
smooth, strongly adherent, thermally stable, organosiloxane thin films having
interesting electrical capacitances (around 150 nF cm-2 at -3V) and insulating
properties (leakage current densities around 10-5 A cm2 at -1V).
