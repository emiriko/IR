We exactly solve the ferromagnetic spin-1/2 Ising model on the Bethe lattice
in the presence of an external magnetic field by means of the equations of
motion method within the Green's function formalism. In particular, such an
approach is applied to an isomorphic model of localized Fermi particles
interacting via an intersite Coulomb interaction. A complete set of
eigenoperators is found together with the corresponding eigenvalues. The
Green's functions and the correlation functions are written in terms of a
finite set of parameters to be self-consistently determined. A procedure is
developed, that allows us to exactly fix the unknown parameters in the case of
a Bethe lattice with any coordination number z. Non-local correlation functions
up to four points are also provided together with a study of the relevant
thermodynamic quantities.
