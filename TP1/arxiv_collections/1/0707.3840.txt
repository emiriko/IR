We present the Composite Operator Method (COM) as a modern approach to the
study of strongly correlated electronic systems, based on the equation of
motion and Green's function method. COM uses propagators of composite operators
as building blocks at the basis of approximate calculations and algebra
constrains to fix the representation of Green's functions in order to maintain
the algebraic and symmetry properties.
