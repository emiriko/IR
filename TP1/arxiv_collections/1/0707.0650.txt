The running mass of the b-quark defined in DRbar-scheme is one of the
important parameters of SUSY QCD. To find its value it should be related to
some known experimental input. In this paper the b-quark running mass defined
in nonsupersymmetric QCD is chosen for determination of corresponding parameter
in SUSY QCD. The relation between these two quantities is found by considering
five-flavor QCD as an effective theory obtained from its supersymmetric
extension. A numerical analysis of the calculated two-loop relation and its
impact on the MSSM spectrum is discussed. Since for nonsupersymmetric models
MSbar-scheme is more natural than DRbar, we also propose a new procedure that
allows one to calculate relations between MSbar- and DRbar-parameters.
Unphysical epsilon-scalars that give rise to the difference between mentioned
schemes are assumed to be heavy and decoupled in the same way as physical
degrees of freedom. By means of this method it is possible to ``catch two
rabbits'', i.e., decouple heavy particles and turn from DRbar to MSbar, at the
same time. Explicit two-loop example of DRbar -> MSbar transition is given in
the context of QCD. The advantages and disadvantages of the method are briefly
discussed.
