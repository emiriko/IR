AES VHF inductively coupled plasmatron may be applied to wide range of
studies. It enables rapid microanalysis of various solutions including
biological objects and peripheral blood serum. In addition, it may be used for
investigation of water desorption from solid bodies and for determination of
energetic metal-macromolecule complexes. Study of hydration energy and
hydration number by kinetic curves of water glow discharge atomic spectral
analysis of hydrogen (GD EAS analysis of hydrogen) desorption from Na-DNA
humidified fibers allowed to reveal that structural and conformational changes
in activation energy of hydrated water molecules increases by 0.65kcal/Mole of
water. The developed method of analysis of elements in solutions containing
high concentrations of organic materials allows systematic study of practically
healthy persons and reveals risk factors for several diseases. Microelemental
content of blood serum fractions showed that amount of not bounded with
ceruloplasmin copper was three times more at limphogranulomatose disease than
that in healthy persons.
