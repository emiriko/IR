In this paper is investigated the influence of net baryon density on baryon
and meson yields in relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions, based on the
recombination model for hadronization. Unitarity condition is used as a
constraint on the model. Three cases with different assumptions on the
expansion of partonic system are considered and the baryon to meson ratio is
calculated for those situations.
