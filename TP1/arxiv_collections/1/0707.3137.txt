Anderson has recently proposed a theory of the strange metal state above Tc
in the high Tc superconductors. [arXiv:cond-mat/0512471] It is based on the
idea that the unusual transport properties and spectral functions are caused by
the strong Mott- Hubbard interactions and can be computed by using the formal
apparatus of Gutzwiller projection. In ref. 1 Anderson computed only the
tunneling spectrum and the power-law exponent of the infrared conductivity. He
had calculated the energy distribution curves (EDCs) in angle resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) but was discouraged when these differed
radically from the best ARPES measurements available at the time, and did not
include them. In this letter we compare the spectral functions computed within
this model to the novel laser-ARPES data of the Dessau group.These are found to
capture the shape of the experimental EDCs with unprecedented accuracy and in
principle have only one free parameter.
