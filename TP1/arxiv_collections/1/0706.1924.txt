We present an efficient architecture for quantum repeaters based on
single-photon sources in combination with quantum memories for photons. Errors
inherent to previous repeater protocols using photon-pair sources are
eliminated, leading to a significant gain in efficiency. We establish the
requirements on the single-photon sources and on the photon detectors.
