A simpler method of quantization is given for massive gauge theories. This
method gives the same results as those of the conventional massive gauge theory
with ghost and Higgs fields under the Higgs mass. Besides, we point out
physical importance of helicity zero states in non-Abelian gauge theories even
in massless case. Furthermore, forms of mass terms that were impossible before,
e.g. symmetric mass, are possible now. Applying our method to SU(2)xU(1)
symmetry has no particular difficulty, and gives a variant of the standard
model without the Higgs boson.
