We systematically study the influence of ferromagnetic leads on the Kondo
resonance in a quantum dot tuned to the local moment regime. We employ Wilson's
numerical renormalization group method, extended to handle leads with a spin
asymmetric density of states, to identify the effects of (i) a finite spin
polarization in the leads (at the Fermi-surface), (ii) a Stoner splitting in
the bands (governed by the band edges) and (iii) an arbitrary shape of the
leads density of states. For a generic lead density of states the quantum dot
favors being occupied by a particular spin-species due to exchange interaction
with ferromagnetic leads leading to a suppression and splitting of the Kondo
resonance. The application of a magnetic field can compensate this asymmetry
restoring the Kondo effect. We study both the gate-voltage dependence (for a
fixed band structure in the leads) and the spin polarization dependence (for
fixed gate voltage) of this compensation field for various types of bands.
Interestingly, we find that the full recovery of the Kondo resonance of a
quantum dot in presence of leads with an energy dependent density of states is
not only possible by an appropriately tuned external magnetic field but also
via an appropriately tuned gate voltage. For flat bands simple formulas for the
splitting of the local level as a function of the spin polarization and gate
voltage are given.
