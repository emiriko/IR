We demonstrate numerically the existence of a spin-motive force acting on
spin-carriers when moving in a time and space dependent internal field. This is
the case of electrons in a one-dimensional wires with a precessing domain wall.
The effect can be explained solely by considering adiabatic dynamics and it is
shown to exist for both classical and quantum systems.
