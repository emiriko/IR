We propose a quantum non-demolition method - giant Faraday rotation - to
detect a single electron spin in a quantum dot inside a microcavity where
negatively-charged exciton strongly couples to the cavity mode. Left- and
right-circularly polarized light reflected from the cavity feels different
phase shifts due to cavity quantum electrodynamics and the optical spin
selection rule. This yields giant and tunable Faraday rotation which can be
easily detected experimentally. Based on this spin-detection technique, a
scalable scheme to create an arbitrary amount of entanglement between two or
more remote spins via a single photon is proposed.
