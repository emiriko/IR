In Hanbury-Brown-Twiss interferometry measurements using identical bosons,
the chaoticity parameter lambda has been introduced phenomenologically to
represent the momentum correlation function at zero relative momentum. It is
useful to study an exactly solvable problem in which the lambda parameter and
its dependence on the coherence properties of the boson system can be worked
out in great detail. We are therefore motivated to study the state of a gas of
noninteracting identical bosons at various temperatures held together in a
harmonic oscillator potential that arises either externally or from bosons' own
mean fields. We determine the degree of Bose-Einstein condensation and its
momentum correlation function as a function of the attributes of the boson
environment. The parameter lambda can then be evaluated from the momentum
correlation function. We find that the lambda(p,T) parameter is a sensitive
function of both the average pair momentum p and the temperature T, and the
occurrence of lambda=1 is not a consistent measure of the absence of a coherent
condensate fraction. In particular, for large values of p, the lambda parameter
attains the value of unity even for significantly coherent systems with large
condensate fractions. We find that if a pion system maintains a static
equilibrium within its mean field, and if it contains a root-mean-squared
radius, a pion number, and a temperature typical of those in high-energy
heavy-ion collisions, then it will contain a large fraction of the
Bose-Einstein pion condensate.
