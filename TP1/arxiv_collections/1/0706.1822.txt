Upon reviewing the physical review letter which describes the processes
involved in "demonstration of a controllable three-dimensional Brownian motor
in symmetric potentials" we conclude that such processes are not compatible
with what Einstein and many other physicists and engineers define as Brownian
motors or Brownian movements.
