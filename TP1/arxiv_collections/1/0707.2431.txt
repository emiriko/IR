A non-linear non-perturbative relativistic atomic theory introduces spin in
the dynamics of particle motion. The resulting energy levels of Hydrogen atom
are exactly same as the Dirac theory. The theory accounts for the energy due to
spin-orbit interaction and for the additional potential energy due to spin and
spin-orbit coupling. Spin angular momentum operator is integrated into the
equation of motion. This requires modification to classical Laplacian operator.
Consequently the Dirac matrices and the k operator of Dirac's theory are
dispensed with. The theory points out that the curvature of the orbit draws on
certain amount of kinetic and potential energies affecting the momentum of
electron and the spin-orbit interaction energy constitutes a part of this
energy. The theory is developed for spin 1/2 bound state single electron in
Coulomb potential and then further extended to quarkonium physics by
introducing the linear confining potential. The unique feature of this
quarkonium model is that the radial distance can be exactly determined and does
not have a statistical interpretation. The established radial distance is then
used to determine the wave function. The observed energy levels are used as the
input parameters and the radial distance and the string tension are predicted.
This ensures 100% conformance to all observed energy levels for the heavy
quarkonium.
