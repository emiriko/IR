The purpose of this communication is to suggest that the mechanism for
generating the geomagnetic field and the energy source for powering it are one
and the same, a nuclear georeactor at the center of the Earth. Toward this end,
I: i) Present evidence that the nuclear georeactor fission-product sub-shell is
fluid; ii)Suggest that the geomagnetic field is generated within the georeactor
sub-shell, rather than within Earth's iron-alloy fluid core; iii) Describe why
convection appears more feasible within the georeactor sub-shell than within
the iron-alloy core; iv) Disclose additional relative physical advantages for
georeactor sub-shell dynamo operation; and, v) Outline briefly the research
that should be conducted to advance the state of knowledge of
georeactor-geomagnetic field generation. The concept of geomagnetic field
production by the nuclear georeactor is presented specifically for the Earth.
The concepts and principles, however, are generally applicable to planetary
magnetic field production.
