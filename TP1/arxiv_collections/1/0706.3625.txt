Superconducting circuits are among the leading contenders for quantum
information processing. This promising avenue has been strengthened with the
advent of circuit quantum electrodynamics, underlined by recent experiments
coupling on-chip microwave resonators to superconducting qubits. However,
moving towards more qubits will require suitable novel architectures. Here, we
propose a scalable setup for quantum computing where such resonators are
arranged in a two-dimensional grid with a qubit at each intersection. Its
versatility allows any two qubits on the grid to be coupled at a swapping
overhead independent of their distance and yields an optimal balance between
reducing qubit transition frequency spread and spurious cavity-induced
couplings. These features make this setup unique and distinct from existing
proposals in ion traps, optical lattices, or semiconductor spins. We
demonstrate that this approach encompasses the fundamental elements of a
scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture.
