We have performed a search for new particles which decay to two photons using
1.2/fb of integrated luminosity from p-pbar collisions at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV
collected using the CDF II Detector at the Fermilab Tevatron. We find the
diphoton mass spectrum to be in agreement with the standard model expectation,
and set limits on the cross section times branching ratio for the
Randall-Sundrum graviton, as a function of diphoton mass. We subsequently
derive lower limits for the graviton mass of 230 GeV/c2 and 850 GeV/c2, at the
95% confidence level, for coupling parameters (k/M_Pl) of 0.01 and 0.1
respectively.
