We study the azimuthal correlation distribution for dijet production in QCD
hard processes. This observable is sensitive to soft and/or collinear emissions
in the back-to-back region, giving rise to single and double logarithms. We
provide resummed predictions to NLL accuracy for both DIS at HERA and hadronic
collisions at Tevatron and perform a NLO matching to NLOJET++ results in the
DIS case.
