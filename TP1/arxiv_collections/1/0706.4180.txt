The orthodox interpretation of quantum theory treats the subject and the
object on an equal footing. It has been suggested that the cyclical-time
process, which resolves self-reference in consciousness, interconnects the
observed universe and the mind of the subject. Based on the analogy between
cryptography and language, the concept of the common innate structure of
language, also known as universal grammar, may be associated with the
continuity in consciousness. Extending this connection, Levi-Strauss's proposal
on universal culture may be considered as a shared structure of continuity
among the consciousness of multiple subjects.
