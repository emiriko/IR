Three-jet event-shape distributions can be exploited to investigate the
dependence of hadronisation effects on the colour and the geometry of the
underlying hard event. We present here the first comparison of data in e+e-
annihilation and state-of-the-art theoretical predictions, including
resummation of large logarithms at next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy matched
to exact next-to-leading order and leading non-perturbative power corrections.
