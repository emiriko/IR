The longest spin lifetimes in bulk n-GaAs exceed 100 ns for doping
concentrations near the metal-insulator transition (J.M. Kikkawa, D.D.
Awschalom, Phys. Rev. Lett. 80, 4313 (1998)). The respective electronic states
have yet not been identified. We therefore investigate the energy dependence of
spin lifetimes in n-GaAs by time-resolved Kerr rotation. Spin lifetimes vary by
three orders of magnitude as a function of energy when occupying donor and
conduction band states. The longest spin lifetimes (>100 ns) are assigned to
delocalized donor band states, while conduction band states exhibit shorter
spin lifetimes. The occupation of localized donor band states is identified by
short spin lifetimes (~300 ps) and a distinct Overhauser shift due to dynamic
nuclear polarization.
