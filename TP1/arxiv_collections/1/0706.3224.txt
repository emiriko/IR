We generalize Fermi coordinates, which correspond to an adapted set of
coordinates describing the vicinity of an observer's worldline, to the
worldsheet of an arbitrary spatial curve in a static spacetime. The spatial
coordinate axes are fixed using a covariant Frenet triad so that the metric can
be expressed using the curvature and torsion of the spatial curve. As an
application of Fermi-Frenet coordinates, we show that they allow covariant
inertial forces to be expressed in a simple and physically intuitive way.
