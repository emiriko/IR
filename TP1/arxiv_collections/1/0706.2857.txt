We discuss microscopic origin of integrability in Seiberg-Witten theory,
following mostly the results of hep-th/0612019, as well as present their
certain extension and consider several explicit examples. In particular, we
discuss in more detail the theory with the only switched on higher perturbation
in the ultraviolet, where extra explicit formulas are obtained using
bosonization and elliptic uniformization of the spectral curve.
