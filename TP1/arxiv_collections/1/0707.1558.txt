This paper presents a model of autonomy called autonomy with regard to an
attribute applicable to cognitive and not cognitive artificial agents. Three
criteria (global / partial, social / nonsocial, absolute / relative) are
defined and used to describe the main characteristics of this type of autonomy.
A software agent autonomous with regard to the mobility illustrates a possible
implementation of this model.
