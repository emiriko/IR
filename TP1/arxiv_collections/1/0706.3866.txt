We present a theory of Hall effect in granular systems at large tunneling
conductance $g_{T}\gg 1$. Hall transport is essentially determined by the
intragrain electron dynamics, which, as we find using the Kubo formula and
diagrammatic technique, can be described by nonzero diffusion modes inside the
grains. We show that in the absence of Coulomb interaction the Hall resistivity
$\rho_{xy}$ depends neither on the tunneling conductance nor on the intragrain
disorder and is given by the classical formula $\rho_{xy}=H/(n^* e c)$, where
$n^*$ differs from the carrier density $n$ inside the grains by a numerical
coefficient determined by the shape of the grains and type of granular lattice.
Further, we study the effects of Coulomb interactions by calculating
first-order in $1/g_T$ corrections and find that (i) in a wide range of
temperatures $T \gtrsim \Ga$ exceeding the tunneling escape rate $\Ga$, the
Hall resistivity $\rho_{xy}$ and conductivity $\sig_{xy}$ acquire logarithmic
in $T$ corrections, which are of local origin and absent in homogeneously
disordered metals; (ii) large-scale ``Altshuler-Aronov'' correction to
$\sig_{xy}$, relevant at $T\ll\Ga$, vanishes in agreement with the theory of
homogeneously disordered metals.
