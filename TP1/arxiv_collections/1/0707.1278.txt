Tunnelling between two-dimensional electron systems has been studied in the
magnetic field perpendicular to the systems planes. The satellite conductance
peaks of the main resonance have been observed due to the electron tunnelling
assisted by the elastic scattering on impurities in the barrier layer. These
peaks are shown to shift to the higher voltage due to the Coulomb pseudogap in
the intermediate fields. In the high magnetic fields the pseudogap shift is
disappeared.
