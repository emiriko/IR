Adopting the frame of mesoscopic physics, we describe a Bell type experiment
involving time-delayed two-particle correlation measurements. The
indistinguishability of quantum particles results in a specific interference
between different trajectories. We show how the non-locality in the
time-delayed correlations due to the indistinguishability of the quantum
particles manifests itself in the violation of a Bell inequality, where the
degree of violation is related to the accuracy of the measurement. We
demonstrate how the interrelation between the orbital- and the spin exchange
symmetry can by exploited to infer knowledge on spin-entanglement from a
measurement of orbital entanglement.
