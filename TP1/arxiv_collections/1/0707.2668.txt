We derive the differential probability of the photoelectric effect realized
at the very low temperature of double graphene in the very strong magnetic
field. The relation of this effect to the elementary particle physics, nuclear
physics and Einstein gravity is mentioned. Our approach is the analogue of the
Landau discovery of the diamagnetism, where Landau supposed the parabolic
dispersion relations for the model of diamagnetism.
