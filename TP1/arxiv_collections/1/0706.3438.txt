We compare results of $k_t$-factorization approach and next-to-leading order
collinear-factorization approach for dijet correlations in proton-proton
collisions at RHIC energies. We discuss correlations in azimuthal angle as well
as correlations in two-dimensional space of transverse momenta of two jets.
Some $k_t$-factorization subprocesses are included for the first time in the
literature. Different unintegrated gluon/parton distributions are used in the
$k_t$-factorization approach. The results depend on UGDF/UPDF used. Limitations
due to leading jet condition are discussed.
