For any L-infinity algebra L, we construct an A-infinity structure on the
space of symmetric tensors Sym*(L), which generalizes the classical universal
enveloping for Lie algebras. Our construction is based on an invariant homotopy
on a cobar construction of the symmetric coalgebra, which is obtained through
its relation with permutahedra and Young tableaux.
