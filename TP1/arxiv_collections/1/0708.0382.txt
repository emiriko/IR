We report on numerical study of the Dirac fermions in partially filled N=3
Landau level (LL) in graphene. At half-filling, the equal-time density-density
correlation function displays sharp peaks at nonzero wavevectors $\pm {\bf
q^{*}}$. Finite-size scaling shows that the peak value grows with electron
number and diverges in the thermodynamic limit, which suggests an instability
toward a charge density wave. A symmetry broken stripe phase is formed at large
system size limit, which is robust against purturbation from disorder
scattering. Such a quantum phase is experimentally observable through transport
measurements. Associated with the special wavefunctions of the Dirac LL, both
stripe and bubble phases become possible candidates for the ground state of the
Dirac fermions in graphene with lower filling factors in the N=3 LL.
