In the present work we discuss based on extensive fully atomistic molecular
dynamics simulations the dynamics of Neon atoms oscillating inside
(5,5)single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and boron-nitride (BNNT) ones. Our
results show that sustained high frequency oscillatory regimes are possible for
a large range of temperatures. Our results also show that the general features
of the oscillations are quite similar to CNT and BNNT, in contrast with some
speculations in previous work literature about the importance of broken
symmetry and chirality exhibited by BNNTs.
