We examine the stability of the nonextremal D1-D5-P black hole solutions. In
particular, we look for the appearance of a superradiant instability for the
spinning black holes but we find no evidence of such an instability. We compare
this situation with that for the smooth soliton geometries, which were recently
observed to suffer from an ergoregion instability, and consider the
implications for the fuzzball proposal.
