We present a detailed study of a linear sigma model containing one chiral
nonet transforming under U(1)$_A$ as a quark-antiquark composite and another
chiral nonet transforming as a diquark-anti diquark composite (or, equivalently
from a symmetry point of view, as a two meson molecule). The model provides an
intuitive explanation of a current puzzle in low energy QCD: Recent work has
suggested the existence of a lighter than 1 GeV nonet of scalar mesons which
behave like four quark composites. On the other hand, the validity of a
spontaneously broken chiral symmetric description would suggest that these
states be chiral partners of the light pseudoscalar mesons, which are two quark
composites. The model solves the problem by starting with the two chiral nonets
mentioned and allowing them to mix with each other. The input of physical
masses in the SU(3) invariant limit for two scalar octets and an "excited" pion
octet results in a mixing pattern wherein the light scalars have a large four
quark content while the light pseudoscalars have a large two quark content. One
light isosinglet scalar is exceptionally light. In addition, the pion pion
scattering is also studied and the current algebra theorem is verified for
massless pions which contain some four quark admixture.
