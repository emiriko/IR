We consider the supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY QM) with three-
component normal modes for the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) states. An
explicit form of the SUSY QM matrix superpotential is presented and the
corresponding three-component bosonic zero-mode eigenfunction is investigated.
