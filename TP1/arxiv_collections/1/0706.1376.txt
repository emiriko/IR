Our previous point-contact Andreev reflection studies of the heavy-fermion
superconductor CeCoIn$_5$ using Au tips have shown two clear features: reduced
Andreev signal and asymmetric background conductance [1]. To explore their
physical origins, we have extended our measurements to point-contact junctions
between single crystalline heavy-fermion metals and superconducting Nb tips.
Differential conductance spectra are taken on junctions with three
heavy-fermion metals, CeCoIn$_5$, CeRhIn$_5$, and YbAl$_3$, each with different
electron mass. In contrast with Au/CeCoIn$_5$ junctions, Andreev signal is not
reduced and no dependence on effective mass is observed. A possible explanation
based on a two-fluid picture for heavy fermions is proposed. [1] W. K. Park et
