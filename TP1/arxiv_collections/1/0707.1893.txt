We consider an example of tubes of hypersurfaces in Euclidean space and
generalise the tube formula to supercase. By this we assign to a point of the
hypersurface in superspace a rational characteristic function. Does this
rational function appear when we calculate the zeta-function of an arithmetic
variety?
