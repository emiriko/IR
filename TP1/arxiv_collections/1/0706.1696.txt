Different theoretical and phenomenological aspects of the Minimal and
Nonminimal Walking Technicolor theories have recently been studied. The goal
here is to make the models ready for collider phenomenology. We do this by
constructing the low energy effective theory containing scalars, pseudoscalars,
vector mesons and other fields predicted by the minimal walking theory. We
construct their self-interactions and interactions with standard model fields.
Using the Weinberg sum rules, opportunely modified to take into account the
walking behavior of the underlying gauge theory, we find interesting relations
for the spin-one spectrum. We derive the electroweak parameters using the newly
constructed effective theory and compare the results with the underlying gauge
theory. Our analysis is sufficiently general such that the resulting model can
be used to represent a generic walking technicolor theory not at odds with
precision data.
