We investigate electrical conduction through individual oligopeptide
molecules thiol-bonded between gold nanocontacts using ab initio and
semi-empirical techniques. Our theory explains for the first time these
molecules' experimentally observed current-voltage characteristics, including
both the magnitude and rectification of the current, and uses no adjustable
parameters. We identify the mechanism of the observed current rectification,
and predict that it will result in negative differential resistance at moderate
biases. Our findings open the way to the realization of protein-based
nanoelectronic devices.
