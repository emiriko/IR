The possibility of deforming the (associative or Lie) product to obtain
alternative descriptions for a given classical or quantum system has been
considered in many papers. Here we discuss the possibility of obtaining some
novel alternative descriptions by changing the linear structure instead. In
particular we show how it is possible to construct alternative linear
structures on the tangent bundle TQ of some classical configuration space Q
that can be considered as "adapted" to the given dynamical system. This fact
opens the possibility to use the Weyl scheme to quantize the system in
different non equivalent ways, "evading", so to speak, the von Neumann
uniqueness theorem.
