We discuss multipole properties of filled skutterudites containing heavy
lanthanide Ln from a microscopic viewpoint on the basis of a seven-orbital
Anderson model. For Ln=Gd, in contrast to naive expectation, quadrupole moments
remain in addition to main dipole ones. For Ln=Ho, we find an exotic state
governed by octupole moment. For Ln=Tb and Tm, no significant multipole moments
appear at low temperatures, while for Ln=Dy, Er, and Yb, dipole and
higher-order multipoles are dominant. We briefly discuss possible relevance of
these multipole states with actual materials.
