In applications for high-Tc superconducting DC-SQUIDs such as biomagnetism,
nondestructive evaluation and the relaxation of magnetic nanoparticles, it is
important to maintain reliable sensor performance over an extended time period.
We designed and produced DC-SQUID gradiometers based on YBCO thin films which
are inductively coupled to a flux transformer to achieve a higher sensitivity.
The gradiometers are protected against ambient atmosphere and humidity by SiO2
and amorphous YBCO layers.
  The noise properties of the sensor in flip-chip configuration, especially in
unshielded environments, are shown. We present a comparison of TBCCO thin films
on buffered sapphire or LaAlO3 substrates for the flux transformer in shielded
and unshielded environments. We reach a low white field gradient noise of 72
fT/(cm sqrt(Hz)) with the TBCCO on LaAlO3 flux transformer. The electric
properties of the gradiometers (critical current IC, normal state resistance RN
and the transfer function VPhi) were measured over a period of one year and do
not show significant signs of degradation.
