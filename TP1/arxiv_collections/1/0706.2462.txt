We present experimental evidence of the fact that lysozyme crystals, which
are grown from their mother solution and exist in it, dissolve on heating above
T=307 K. We argue that the anomaly in the light scattering recently observed at
the temperature T=307 K and identified in the reference [Svanidze A. V. et al.
2006. JETP Lett. 84: 551] as a structural crystalline phase transition in the
single lysozyme crystals, in fact, corresponds to a temperature limit of the
crystal existence.
