In this paper we embed $m$-dimensional Euclidean space in the geometric
algebra $Cl_m $ to extend the operators of incidence in ${R^m}$ to operators of
incidence in the geometric algebra to generalize the notion of separator to a
decision boundary hyperconic in the Clifford algebra of hyperconic sections
denoted as ${Cl}({Co}_{2})$. This allows us to extend the concept of a linear
perceptron or the spherical perceptron in conformal geometry and introduce the
more general conic perceptron, namely the {elliptical perceptron}. Using
Clifford duality a vector orthogonal to the decision boundary hyperplane is
determined. Experimental results are shown in 2-dimensional Euclidean space
where we separate data that are naturally separated by some typical plane conic
separators by this procedure. This procedure is more general in the sense that
it is independent of the dimension of the input data and hence we can speak of
the hyperconic elliptic perceptron.
