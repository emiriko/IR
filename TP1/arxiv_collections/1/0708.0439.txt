We present the intersecting brane configurations consisting of NS-branes,
D4-branes(and anti D4-branes) and O6-plane, of type IIA string theory
corresponding to the meta-stable nonsupersymmetric vacua in four dimensional
N=1 supersymmetric SU(N_c) x SU(N_c') x SU(N_c'') gauge theory with a symmetric
tensor field, a conjugate symmetric tensor field and bifundamental fields. We
also describe the intersecting brane configurations of type IIA string theory
corresponding to the nonsupersymmetric meta-stable vacua in the above gauge
theory with an antisymmetric tensor field, a conjugate symmetric tensor field,
eight fundamental flavors and bifundamentals. These brane configurations
consist of NS-branes, D4-branes(and anti D4-branes), D6-branes and O6-planes.
