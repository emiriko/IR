We present hydrodynamic predictions for the charged pion HBT radii for a
range of initial conditions covering those presumably reached in Pb+Pb
collisions at the LHC. We study central (b=0) and semi-central (b=7fm)
collisions and show the expected increase of the HBT radii and their azimuthal
oscillations. The predicted trends in the oscillation amplitudes reflect a
change of the final source shape from out-of-plane to in-plane deformation as
the initial entropy density is increased.
