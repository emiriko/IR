This paper studies a specific metric on plane curves that has the property of
being isometric to classical manifold (sphere, complex projective, Stiefel,
Grassmann) modulo change of parametrization, each of these classical manifolds
being associated to specific qualifications of the space of curves
(closed-open, modulo rotation etc...) Using these isometries, we are able to
explicitely describe the geodesics, first in the parametric case, then by
modding out the paremetrization and considering horizontal vectors. We also
compute the sectional curvature for these spaces, and show, in particular, that
the space of closed curves modulo rotation and change of parameter has positive
curvature. Experimental results that explicitly compute minimizing geodesics
between two closed curves are finally provided
