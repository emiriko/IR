We study the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter with three quark
flavors at low and intermediate densities and non-zero temperatures in the
framework of an NJL-type model with four-point interactions. At large
densities, when the interactions are weak due to asymptotic freedom, quarks
form loosely bound Cooper pairs. However, when the density decreases,
interactions become stronger and quark Cooper pairs transform smoothly into
tightly bound diquark molecules. We find that such molecules are stable at low
density and temperature and that they dissociate above a temperature $T_{\rm
diss}$ of the order of the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c \sim 170$
MeV. We also explore the conditions under which these molecules undergo
Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). We find that BEC is only possible if we
increase the attractive interaction in the diquark channel to (probably
unrealistically) large values.
