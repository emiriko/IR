We investigate the QCD effects in the associated production of the chargino
and the neutralino, $\tilde\chi^\pm_{1}$ and $\tilde\chi^0_{2}$, in the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) at both the Fermilab Tevatron and the CERN
Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We include the next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD
corrections (including supersymmetric QCD) and the threshold resummation
effects. Our results show that, compared to the NLO predictions, the threshold
resummation effects can increase the total cross sections by 3.6% and 3.9% for
the associated production of $\tilde\chi^+_{1}\tilde\chi^0_{2}$ and
$\tilde\chi^-_{1}\tilde\chi^0_{2}$ at the LHC, respectively, and by 4.7% for
those of $\tilde\chi^\pm_{1}\tilde\chi^0_{2}$ at the Tevatron. In the invariant
mass distributions the resummation effects are significant for large invariant
mass. The threshold resummation reduces the dependence of the total cross
sections at the LHC (Tevatron) on the renormalization/factorization scales to
5% (4%) from up to 7% (11%) at NLO.
