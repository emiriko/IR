We propose a new description of inclusive diffraction in deep inelastic
scattering (DIS). The diffractive structure functions are expressed in the
dipole picture and contain heavy-quark contributions. The dipole scattering
amplitude, a saturation model fitted on inclusive DIS data, features a
saturation scale Q_s(x) larger than 1 GeV for x=10^{-5}. The q\bar{q}g
contribution to the diffractive final state is modeled in such a way that both
the large-Q^2 and small-beta limits are implemented. In the regime xpom<0.01 in
which saturation is expected to be relevant, we obtain a parameter-free
description of the HERA data with chi^2/points=1.2.
