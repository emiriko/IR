A partial-wave analysis of NN elastic scattering data has been updated to
include a number of recent measurements. Experiments carried out at the Cooler
Synchrotron (COSY) by the EDDA Collaboration have had a significant impact
above 1 GeV. Results are discussed in terms of the partial-wave and
direct-reconstruction amplitudes.
