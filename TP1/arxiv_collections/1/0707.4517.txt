We examine the behavior of a one-dimensional superconducting wire exposed to
an applied electric current. We use the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model to
describe the system and retain temperature and applied current as parameters.
Through a combination of spectral analysis, asymptotics and canonical numerical
computation, we divide this two-dimensional parameter space into a number of
regions. In some of them only the normal state or a stationary state or an
oscillatory state are stable, while in some of them two states are stable. One
of the most interesting features of the analysis is the evident collision of
real eigenvalues of the associated PT-symmetric linearization, leading as it
does to the emergence of complex elements of the spectrum. In particular this
provides an explanation to the emergence of a stable oscillatory state. We show
that part of the bifurcation diagram and many of the emerging patterns are
directly controlled by this spectrum, while other patterns arise due to
nonlinear interaction of the leading eigenfunctions.
