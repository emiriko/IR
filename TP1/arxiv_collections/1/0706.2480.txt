The efficiency of time dependent density matrix renormalization group methods
is intrinsically connected with the rate of entanglement growth. We introduce a
new measure of entanglement in the space of operators and show, for transverse
Ising spin 1/2 chain, that the simulation of observables, contrary to
simulation of typical pure quantum states, is efficient for initial local
operators. For initial operators with a finite index in Majorana
representation, the operator space entanglement entropy saturates with time to
a level which is calculated analytically, while for initial operators with
infinite index the growth of operator space entanglement entropy is shown to be
logarithmic.
