To determine the superconducting gap function of YNi2B2C, we calculate the
local density of states (LDOS) around a single vortex core with the use of
Eilenberger theory and the band structure calculated by local density
approximation assuming various gap structures with point-nodes at different
positions. We also calculate the angular-dependent heat capacity in the vortex
state on the basis of the Doppler-Shift method. Comparing our results with the
STM/STS experiment, the angular-dependent heat capacity and thermal
conductivity, we propose the gap-structure of YNi2B2C, which has the
point-nodes and gap minima along <110>. Our gap-structure is consistent with
all results of angular-resolved experiments.
