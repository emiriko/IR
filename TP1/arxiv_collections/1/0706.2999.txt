We present recent results from the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) and D0
experiments using data from proton-antiproton collisions with sqrt(s) = 1.96
TeV at Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron. New physics may appear in events with
high transverse momentum objects, including photons and quark or gluon jets.
The results described here are of signature-based searches and model-based
searches probing supersymmetry, leptoquarks, 4th generation quarks, and large
extra dimensions.
