We numerically investigate Heisenberg XXZ spin-1/2 chain in a spatially
random static magnetic field. We find that tDMRG simulations of time evolution
can be performed efficiently, namely the dimension of matrices needed to
efficiently represent the time-evolution increases linearly with time and
entanglement entropies for typical chain bipartitions increase logarithmically.
As a result, we show that for large enough random fields infinite temperature
spin-spin correlation function displays exponential localization in space
indicating insulating behavior of the model.
