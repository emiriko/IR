We present a study of heavy quarkonium production in hard diffractive process
by the Pomeron exchange for Tevatron and LHC energies. The numerical results
are computed using recent experimental determination of the diffractive parton
density functions in Pomeron and are corrected by unitarity corrections through
gap survival probability factor. We give predictions for single as well as
central diffractive ratios. These processes are sensitive to the gluon content
of the Pomeron at small Bjorken-x and may be particularly useful in studying
the small-x physics. They may also be a good place to test the different
available mechanisms for quarkonium production at hadron colliders.
