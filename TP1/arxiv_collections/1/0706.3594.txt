We study the pi phase in a superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor
Josephson junction, with a ferromagnet showing a cycloidal spiral spin
modulation with in-plane propagation vector. Our results reveal a high
sensitivity of the junction to the spiral order and indicate the presence of
0-pi quantum phase transitions as function of the spiral wave vector. We find
that the chiral magnetic order introduces chiral superconducting triplet pairs
that strongly influence the physics in such Josephson junctions, with potential
applications in nanoelectronics and spintronics.
