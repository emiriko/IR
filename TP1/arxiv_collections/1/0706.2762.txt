I study the contact between a rigid solid with a randomly rough surface and
an elastic block with a flat surface. I derive a relation between the (average)
interfacial separation $u$ and the applied normal squeezing pressure $p$. I
show that for non-adhesive inte raction and small applied pressure, p is
proportional to exp (-u/u_0), in good agreement with recent experimental
observation.
