We have managed to correlate the stability constants of complex formation,
which can be registered in equilibrium state, to the dynamic characteristic of
the complex lifetime. Thus, the principal concept of molecular biophysics
regarding biomolecule, structure-dynamics-function can be reformatted as
structure-stability-function. It should be specially noted that such an
approach highly simplifies end widens the time interval of investigation of
dynamic characteristics of macromolecules.
  Study of hydration energy and hydration number by kinetic curves of water
desorption from Na-DNA humidified fibers by glow discharge atomic spectral
analysis of hydrogen allowed us to reveal that after transition of DNA from B
form to unordered state the activation energy of hydrated water desorption
increases by 0.65kcal/Mole of water. This increase of energy is 0.1 kcal/Mole
for transition from B to C form (from 20 to 10 water molecules per nucleotide)
and 0.55 kcal/Mole for the one from C form to A unordered state (from 10 to 5
molecules per nucleotide).
  Simultaneous use of UDS and AES allows identifying the number of Wrong
Watson-Crick pairs in DNA. The quantitative analysis is based on increase of
informativity of UDS via its combination with atomic-emission spectroscopy. The
number of the total metal-induced tautomerization makes six hundred per million
base pairs of DNA. Such approach enables estimation of risk factors during
clinical check-ups and evaluation of DNA suitability for nanotechnological
purposes.
