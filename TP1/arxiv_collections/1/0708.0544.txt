Continuous-time random walks are a well suited tool for the description of
market behaviour at the smallest scale: the tick-to-tick evolution. We will
apply this kind of market model to the valuation of perpetual American options:
derivatives with no maturity that can be exercised at any time. Our approach
leads to option prices that fulfil financial formulas when canonical
assumptions on the dynamics governing the process are made, but it is still
suitable for more exotic market conditions.
