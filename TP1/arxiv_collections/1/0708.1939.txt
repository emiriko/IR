Higgs bosons with very suppressed couplings to fermions ("Fermiophobic Higgs
bosons", h_f) can decay to two photons (\gamma\gamma) with a branching ratio
significantly larger than that expected for the Standard Model Higgs boson for
m_{h_f}<150 GeV. Such a particle would give a clear signal at the LHC and can
arise in the Two Higgs Doublet Model (type I) in which h_f -> \gamma\gamma is
mediated by W^+ and charged Higgs boson (H^+) loops. We show that the H^+ loops
can cause both constructive and destructive contributions with a magnitude
considerably larger than the anticipated precision in the measurement of the
photonic decay channel at future hadron and lepton colliders.
