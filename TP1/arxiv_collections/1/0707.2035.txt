We study the magnetic properties of electron in a constant magnetic field and
confined by a isotropic two dimensional harmonic oscillator on a space where
the coordinates and momenta operators obey generalized commutation relations
leading to the appearance of a minimal length. Using the momentum space
representation we determine exactly the energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.
We prove that the usual degeneracy of Landau levels is removed by the presence
of the minimal length in the limits of weak and strong magnetic field.The
thermodynamical properties of the system, at high temperature, are also
investigated showing a new magnetic behavior in terms of the minimal length.
