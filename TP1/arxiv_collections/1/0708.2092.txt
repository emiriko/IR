We report magnetization and magetoresistance measurements in hybrid
ferromagnetic metal/semiconductor heterostructures comprised of MnAs/(Ga,Mn)As
bilayers. Our measurements show that the (metallic) MnAs and (semiconducting)
(Ga,Mn)As layers are exchange coupled, re- sulting in an exchange biasing of
the magnetically softer (Ga,Mn)As layer that weakens with layer thickness.
Magnetoresistance measurements in the current-perpendicular-to-the-plane
geometry show a spin valve effect in these self-exchange biased bilayers.
Similar measurements in MnAs/p- GaAs/(Ga,Mn)As trilayers show that the exchange
coupling diminishes with spatial separation between the layers.
