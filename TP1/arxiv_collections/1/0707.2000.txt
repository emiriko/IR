We have constructed a noise measurement setup for high impedance carbon
nanotube samples. Our setup, working in the frequency range of 600 - 900 MHz,
takes advantage of the fact that the shot noise power is reasonably large for
high impedance sources so that relatively large, fixed non-matching conditions
can be tolerated.
