We study the reliability of spike output in a general class of pulse-coupled
oscillators receiving a fluctuating input. Showing that this problem is
equivalent to noise-induced synchronization between identical networks of
oscillators, we employ the phase reduction method to analytically derive the
average Lyapunov exponent of the synchronized state. We show that a transition
occurs between reliable and unreliable responses at a critical coupling
strength, which is determined through the competition between the external
input and recurrent input. To our surprise, the critical value does not depend
on intrinsic properties of oscillators.
