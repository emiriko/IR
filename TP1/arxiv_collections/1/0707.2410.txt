We introduce a method based on the loudest event statistic to calculate an
upper limit or interval on the astrophysical rate of binary coalescence. The
calculation depends upon the sensitivity and noise background of the detectors,
and a model for the astrophysical distribution of coalescing binaries. There
are significant uncertainties in the calculation of the rate due to both
astrophysical and instrumental uncertainties as well as errors introduced by
using the post--Newtonian waveform to approximate the full signal. We catalog
these uncertainties in detail and describe a method for marginalizing over
them. Throughout, we provide an example based on the initial LIGO detectors.
