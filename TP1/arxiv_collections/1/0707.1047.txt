Long coherence lifetimes of electron spins transported using moving potential
dots are shown to result from the mesoscopic confinement of the spin vector.
The confinement dimensions required for spin control are governed by the
characteristic spin-orbit length of the electron spins, which must be larger
than the dimensions of the dot potential. We show that the coherence lifetime
of the electron spins is independent of the local carrier densities within each
potential dot and that the precession frequency, which is determined by the
Dresselhaus contribution to the spin-orbit coupling, can be modified by varying
the sample dimensions resulting in predictable changes in the spin-orbit length
and, consequently, in the spin coherence lifetime.
