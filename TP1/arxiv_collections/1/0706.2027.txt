We perform the analog to the "water bell" experiment using non-cohesive
granular material. When a jet of granular material, many particles wide,
rebounds from a fixed cylindrical target, it deforms into a sharply-defined
sheet or cone with a shape that mimics a liquid with zero surface tension. The
particulate nature of granular material becomes apparent when the number of
particles in the cross-section of the jet is decreased and the emerging sheets
and cones broaden and gradually disintegrate into a broad spray. This
experiment has its counterpart in the behavior of the quark-gluon plasma
generated by collisions of gold ions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.
There a high density of inter-particle collisions gives rise to collective
behavior that has also been described as a liquid.
