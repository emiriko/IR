We present a novel approach to look for the existence of maximum entanglement
in a system of two identical quantum dots coupled by the Forster process and
interacting with a classical laser field. Our approach is not only able to
explain the existing treatments, but also provides further detailed insights
into the coupled dynamics of quantum dots systems. The result demonstrates that
there are two ways for generating maximum entangled states, one associated with
far off-resonance interaction, and the other associated with the weak field
limit. Moreover, it is shown that exciton decoherence results in the decay of
entanglement.
