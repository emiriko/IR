A study of the Model of Embedded Spaces (MES) with a relativistic version of
Finslerian geometry is continued. The field equations of the MES (Einstein and
Maxwell types) are derived, and this formally completes geometrization of
classical electrodynamics. The minimal action principle leads to geometrization
of the field sources (the right-hand sides of the equations) and, as a
consequence, to a field hypothesis of matter, a direct confirmation of W.
Clifford's ideas.
