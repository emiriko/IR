Microscopic optical model potential results for reaction cross sections of
proton elastic scattering are presented. The applications cover the 10-1000 MeV
energy range and consider both stable and unstable nuclei. The study is based
on in-medium g-matrix full-folding optical model approach with the appropriate
relativistic kinematic corrections needed for the higher energy applications.
The effective interactions are based on realistic NN potentials supplemented
with a separable non-Hermitian term to allow optimum agreement with current NN
phase-shift analyzes, particularly the inelasticities above pion production
threshold. The target ground-state densities are obtained from
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations based on the finite range, density
dependent Gogny force. The evaluated reaction cross sections for proton
scattering are compared with measurements and their systematics is analyzed. A
simple function of the total cross sections in terms of the atomic mass number
is observed at high energies. At low energies, however, discrepancies with the
available data are observed, being more pronounced in the lighter systems.
