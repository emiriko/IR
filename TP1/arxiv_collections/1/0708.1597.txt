We study encodings that give the best known thresholds for the non-zero
capacity of quantum channels, i.e., the upper bound for correctable noise,
using an entropic approach to calculation of the threshold values. Our results
show that Pauli noise is correctable up to the hashing bound. For a
depolarizing channel, this approach allows one to achieve a non-zero capacity
for a fidelity (probability of no error) of f=0.80870.
