In this paper, we consider the effect of Planck scale operators on neutrino
magnetic moments. We assume that the main part of neutrino masses and mixings
arise through GUT scale operators. We further assume that additional discrete
symmetries make the neutrino mixing bi-maximal. Quantum gravitational (Planck
scale) effects lead to an effective $SU(2)_{L}\times U(1)$ invariant
dimension-5 Lagrangian involving neutrino and Higgs fields, which gives rise to
additional terms in neutrino mass matrix. These additional terms can be
considered to be perturbation of the GUT scale bi-maximal neutrino mass matrix.
We assume that the gravitational interaction is flavour blind and we study the
neutrino mixings and magnetic moments due to the physics above the GUT scale.
