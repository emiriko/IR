Local minima and the saddle points separating them in the energy landscape
are known to dominate the dynamics of biopolymer folding. Here we introduce a
notion of a "folding funnel" that is concisely defined in terms of energy
minima and saddle points, while at the same time conforming to a notion of a
"folding funnel" as it is discussed in the protein folding literature.
