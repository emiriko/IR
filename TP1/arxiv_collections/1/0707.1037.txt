Concatenated dynamical decoupling (CDD) pulse sequences hold much promise as
a strategy to mitigate decoherence in quantum information processing. It is
important to investigate the actual performance of these dynamical decoupling
strategies in real systems that are promising qubit candidates. In this Rapid
Communication, we compute the echo decay of concatenations of the Hahn echo
sequence for a solid-state electronic spin qubit in a nuclear spin bath using a
cluster expansion technique. We find that each level of concatenation reverses
the effect of successive levels of intrabath fluctuations. On the one hand,
this advances CDD as a versatile and realistic decoupling strategy. On the
other hand, this invalidates, as overly optimistic, results of the simple pair
approximation used previously to study restoration, through CDD, of coherence
lost to a mesoscopic spin bath.
