Quantum amplitudes for $s=1$ at Maxwell fields and for $s=2$ linearised
gravitational wave perturbations of a spherically symmetric Einstein/massless
scalar background, describing gravitational collapse to a black hole, are
treated by analogy with a previous treatment of $s=0$ scalar-field
perturbations of gravitational collapse at late times. In both the $s=1$ and
$s=2$ cases, we isolate suitable 'co-ordinate' variables which can be taken as
boundary data on a final space-like hypersurface $\Sigma_F$. For simplicity, we
take the data on an initial pre-collapse surface $\Sigma_I$ to be exactly
spherically symmetric. The (large) Lorentzian proper-time interval between
$\Sigma_{I}, \Sigma_{F}$, measured at spatial infinity, is denoted by $T$. The
complexified classical boundary-value problem is expected to be well-posed,
provide that the time interval $T$ has been rotated into the complex:
$T\to{\mid}T{\mid}\exp(-i\theta)$, for $0<\theta\leq{\pi}/2$. We calculate the
second-variation classical Lorenztian action $S ^{(2)}_{\rm class}$. Following
Feynman, we recover the Lorentzian quantum amplitude by taking the limit as
$\theta\to 0_+$ of the semi-classical amplitude $\exp(iS^{(2)}_{\rm class})$.
The boundary data for $ s=1$ involve the Maxwell magnetic field; the data for
$s=2$ involve the magnetic part of the Weyl curvature tensor. The magnetic
boundary conditions are related to each other and to the natural $s={1 \over
2}$ boundary conditions by supersymmetry.
