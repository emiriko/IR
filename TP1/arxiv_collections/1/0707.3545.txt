We introduce and study a class of exchangeable random graph ensembles. They
can be used as statistical null models for empirical networks, and as a tool
for theoretical investigations. We provide general theorems that carachterize
the degree distribution of the ensemble graphs, together with some features
that are important for applications, such as subgraph distributions and kernel
of the adjacency matrix. These results are used to compare to other models of
simple and complex networks. A particular case of directed networks with
power-law out--degree is studied in more detail, as an example of the
flexibility of the model in applications.
