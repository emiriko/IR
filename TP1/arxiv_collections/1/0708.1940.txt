We prove an inequality for H\"older continuous differential forms on compact
manifolds in which the integral of the form over the boundary of a sufficiently
small, smoothly immersed disk is bounded by a certain multiplicative convex
combination of the volume of the disk and the area of its boundary. This
inequality has natural applications in dynamical systems, where H\"older
continuity is ubiquitous. We give two such applications. In the first one, we
prove a criterion for the existence of global cross sections to Anosov flows in
terms of their expansion-contraction rates. The second application provides an
analogous criterion for non-accessibility of partially hyperbolic
diffeomorphisms.
