A population of firing neurons is expected to carry not only mean firing rate
but also its fluctuation and synchrony among neurons. In order to examine this
possibility, we have studied responses of neuronal ensembles to three kinds of
inputs: mean-, fluctuation- and synchrony-driven inputs. The generalized
rate-code model including additive and multiplicative noise (H. Hasegawa, Phys.
Rev. E {\bf 75}, 051904 (2007)) has been studied by direct simulations (DSs)
and the augmented moment method (AMM) in which equations of motion for mean
firing rate, fluctuation and synchrony are derived. Results calculated by the
AMM are in good agreement with those by DSs. The independent component analysis
(ICA) of our results has shown that mean firing rate, fluctuation (or
variability) and synchrony may carry independent information in the population
rate-code model. The input-output relation of mean firing rates is shown to
have higher sensitivity for larger multiplicative noise, as recently observed
in prefrontal cortex. A comparison is made between results obtained by the
integrate-and-fire (IF) model and our rate-code model. The relevance of our
results to experimentally obtained data is also discussed.
