We give an exact solution for the complete distribution of component sizes in
random networks with arbitrary degree distributions. The solution tells us the
probability that a randomly chosen node belongs to a component of size s, for
any s. We apply our results to networks with the three most commonly studied
degree distributions -- Poisson, exponential, and power-law -- as well as to
the calculation of cluster sizes for bond percolation on networks, which
correspond to the sizes of outbreaks of SIR epidemic processes on the same
networks. For the particular case of the power-law degree distribution, we show
that the component size distribution itself follows a power law everywhere
below the phase transition at which a giant component forms, but takes an
exponential form when a giant component is present.
