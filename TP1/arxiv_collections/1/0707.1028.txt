This paper identifies a new class of shape invariant models. These models are
based on extensions of conventional quantum mechanics that satisfy a
string-motivated minimal length uncertainty relation. An important feature of
our construction is the pairing of operators that are not adjoints of each
other. The results in this paper thus show the broader applicability of shape
invariance to exactly solvable systems.
