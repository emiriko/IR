We perform a survey whether higher dimensional Schwarzschild space-time is
compatible with some of the solar system phenomena. As a test we examine five
well known solar system effects, viz., (1) Perihelion shift, (2) Bending of
light, (3) Gravitational redshift, (4) Gravitational time delay and (5) Motion
of test particle in the framework of general relativity with higher dimensions.
It is shown that the results related to all these physical phenomena are mostly
incompatible with the higher dimensional version of general relativity except
that of Motion of test particle. We compare all these results with the
available data in the literature.
