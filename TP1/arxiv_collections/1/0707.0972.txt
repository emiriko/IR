Communication security with quantum key distribution has been one of the
important features of quantum information theory. A novel concept of secured
direct communication has been the next step forward without the need to
establish any shared secret key. The present paper is based on the ping-pong
protocol with three particle GHZ state as the initial state where the receiver
can simultaneously receive information from two parties. Possible eavesdropping
on the travelling particle has been examined.
