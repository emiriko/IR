Electromagnetic transition probabilities have been measured for the intra-
and inter-band transitions in the two sequences in the nucleus ^{135}Nd that
were previously identified as a composite chiral pair of rotational bands. The
measurements are in good agreement with results of a new combination of TAC and
RPA calculations. The chiral character of the bands is affirmed and it is shown
that their behavior is associated with a transition from a vibrational into a
static chiral regime.
