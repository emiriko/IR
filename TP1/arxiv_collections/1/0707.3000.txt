Dynamical Einstein cluster is a spherical self-gravitating system of
counterrotating particles, which may expand, oscillate and collapse. This
system exhibits critical behaviour in its collapse at the threshold of black
hole formation. It appears when the specific angular momentum of particles is
tuned finely to the critical value. We find the unique exact self-similar
solution at the threshold. This solution begins with a regular surface,
involves timelike naked singularity formation and asymptotically approaches a
static self-similar cluster.
