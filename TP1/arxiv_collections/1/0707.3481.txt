Canonical orders, introduced in the minimal model program for orders, are
simultaneous generalisations of Kleinian singularities and their associated
skew group rings. In this paper, we construct minimal resolutions of canonical
orders via non-commutative cyclic covers and skew group rings. This allows us
to exhibit a derived equivalence between minimal resolutions of canonical
orders and the skew group ring form of the canonical order in all but one case.
The Fourier-Mukai transform used to construct this equivalence allows us to
make explicit, the numerical version of the McKay correspondence for canonical
orders which, relates the exceptional curves of the minimal resolution to the
indecomposable reflexive modules of the canonical order.
