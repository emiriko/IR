Two-dimensional electron gas coupled to adjacent impurity sites in
high-frequency out-of-plane ac control electric field is investigated.
Modification of tunneling rates as a function of the field amplitude is
calculated. Nonlinear dependence on the ac field strength is reported for the
conductivity of two-dimensional electron gas. It develops a periodic peak
structure.
