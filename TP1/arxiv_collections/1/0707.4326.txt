We extend the stationary-state work fluctuation theorem to periodically
modulated nonlinear systems. Such systems often have coexisting stable periodic
states. We show that work fluctuations sharply increase near a kinetic phase
transition where the state populations are close to each other. The work
variance is proportional here to the reciprocal rate of interstate switching.
We also show that the variance displays scaling with the distance to a
bifurcation point and find the critical exponent for a saddle-node bifurcation.
