We argue that the existence of a modular differential equation implies that a
certain vector vanishes in Zhu's C2 quotient space, and we check this assertion
in numerous examples. If this connection is true in general, it would imply
that the recently conjectured extremal self-dual conformal field theories at
c=24 k cannot exist for k\geq 42.
