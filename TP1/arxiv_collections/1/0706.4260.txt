The response of ultracold atomic Bose gases in time-dependent optical
lattices is discussed based on direct simulations of the time-evolution of the
many-body state in the framework of the Bose-Hubbard model. We focus on
small-amplitude modulations of the lattice potential as implemented in several
recent experiment and study different observables in the region of the first
resonance in the Mott-insulator phase. In addition to the energy transfer we
investigate the quasimomentum structure of the system which is accessible via
the matter-wave interference pattern after a prompt release. We identify
characteristic correlations between the excitation frequency and the
quasimomentum distribution and study their structure in the presence of a
superlattice potential.
