According to Bell's theorem, local realism is incompatible with quantum
theory. However, it depends on an implied assumption about quantum measurement.
We suggest that the assumption might be removed by a detailed quantum analysis
of the interaction between the measured system and measuring apparatus using
Born's statistical interpretation. But it is conceivable that detailed analysis
of all possible Bell experiments would allow the compatibility of quantum
theory and local realism. The difficulties of theory and experiment are closely
related.
