By using of vector diquark ideas in the chiral limit diquark correlations in
the relativistic region and imposing HF interactions between quarks in a vector
diquark we calculated the mass of two multiquark states (Theta pentaquark and H
dibaryon), also by using of tunneling method we simultaneously calculated their
decay width
