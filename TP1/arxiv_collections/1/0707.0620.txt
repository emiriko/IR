We prove a generalized version of the no-broadcasting theorem, applicable to
essentially \emph{any} nonclassical finite-dimensional probabilistic model
satisfying a no-signaling criterion, including ones with ``super-quantum''
correlations. A strengthened version of the quantum no-broadcasting theorem
follows, and its proof is significantly simpler than existing proofs of the
no-broadcasting theorem.
