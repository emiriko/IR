A method is suggested to separately determine the surface density of
positively and negatively charged impurities that limit the mobility in a
graphene monolayer. The method is based on the exact result for the transport
cross-section, according to which the massless carriers are scattered more
strongly when they are attracted to a charged impurity than when they are
repelled from it.
