We propose a protocol of remote implementations of quantum operations by
hybridizing bidirectional quantum state teleportation's (BQST) and Wang's one.
The protocol is available for remote implemetations of quantum operations in
the restricted sets specified in Sec. III. We also give the proof of the
protocol and point out its optimization. As an extension, this hybrid protocol
can be reduced to BQST and Wang protocols.
