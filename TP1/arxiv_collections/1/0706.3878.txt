Inherent structure theory is used to discover strong connections between
simple characteristics of protein structure and the energy landscape of a Go
model. The potential energies and vibrational free energies of inherent
structures are highly correlated, and both reflect simple measures of networks
of native contacts. These connections have important consequences for models of
protein dynamics and thermodynamics.
