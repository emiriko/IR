We first review the definition of superprojective spaces from the
functor-of-points perspective. We derive the relation between superprojective
spaces and supercosets in the framework of the theory of sheaves. As an
application of the geometry of superprojective spaces, we extend Donaldson's
definition of balanced manifolds to supermanifolds and we derive the new
conditions of a balanced supermanifold. We apply the construction to
superpoints viewed as submanifolds of superprojective spaces. We conclude with
a list of open issues and interesting problems that can be addressed in the
present context.
