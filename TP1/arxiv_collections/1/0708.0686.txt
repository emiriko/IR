The spectrum of a one-parameter family of signed transfer operators
associated to the Farey map is studied in detail. We show that when acting on a
suitable Hilbert space of analytic functions they are self-adjoint and exhibit
absolutely continuous spectrum and no non-zero point spectrum. Polynomial
eigenfunctions when the parameter is a negative half-integer are also
discussed.
