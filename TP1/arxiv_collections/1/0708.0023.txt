Recent inelastic neutron scattering experiments in CeIn3 and CePd2Si2 single
crystals, measured spin wave excitations at low temperatures. These two heavy
fermion compounds exhibit antiferromagnetic long-range order, but a strong
competition between the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida(RKKY) interaction and
Kondo effect is evidenced by their nearly equal Neel and Kondo temperatures.
Our aim is to show how magnons such as measured in the antiferromagnetic phase
of these Ce compounds, can be described with a microscopic Heisenberg-Kondo
model as introduced by J.R.Iglesias, C.Lacroix and B.Coqblin, used before for
studies of the non-magnetic phase. The model includes the correlated Ce-4f
electrons hybridized with the conduction band, and we consider competing RKKY
(Heisenberg-like J_{H}) and Kondo (J_{K}) antiferromagnetic couplings. Carrying
on a series of unitary transformations, we perturbatively derive a second-order
effective Hamiltonian which, projected onto the antiferromagnetic electron
ground state, describes the spin wave excitations, renormalized by their
interaction with correlated itinerant electrons. We numerically study how the
different parameters of the model influence the renormalization of the magnons,
yielding useful information for the analysis of inelastic neutron scattering
experiments in antiferromagnetic heavy fermion compounds. We also compare our
results with available experimental data, finding good agreement with the spin
wave measurements in cubic CeIn3.
