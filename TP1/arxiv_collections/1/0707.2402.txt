With sufficiently light up and down quarks the isovector ($a_0$) and
isosinglet ($f_0$) scalar meson propagators are dominated at large distance by
two-meson states. In the staggered fermion formulation of lattice quantum
chromodynamics, taste-symmetry breaking causes a proliferation of two-meson
states that further complicates the analysis of these channels. Many of them
are unphysical artifacts of the lattice approximation. They are expected to
disappear in the continuum limit. The staggered-fermion fourth-root procedure
has its purported counterpart in rooted staggered chiral perturbation theory
(rSXPT). Fortunately, the rooted theory provides a strict framework that
permits the analysis of scalar meson correlators in terms of only a small
number of low energy couplings. Thus the analysis of the point-to-point scalar
meson correlators in this context gives a useful consistency check of the
fourth-root procedure and its proposed chiral realization. Through numerical
simulation we have measured correlators for both the $a_0$ and $f_0$ channels
in the ``Asqtad'' improved staggered fermion formulation in a lattice ensemble
with lattice spacing $a = 0.12$ fm. We analyze those correlators in the context
of rSXPT and obtain values of the low energy chiral couplings that are
reasonably consistent with previous determinations.
