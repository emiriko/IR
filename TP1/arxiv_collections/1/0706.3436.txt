The rare kaon decays K_L -> pi^0 nu {bar nu}, K^+ -> pi^+ nu {bar nu}, K_L ->
pi^0 e^+ e^- and K_L -> pi^0 mu^+ mu^- are theoretically very clean and, being
strongly CKM suppressed, highly sensitive to New Physics (NP). Recent Flavour
Physics analyses show that they represent unique probes for revealing NP
effects and to provide information on the NP flavour structure. After a brief
discussion of the main properties that make rare K decays so promising and of
the basic ideas of the most interesting NP models, we review the results of
recent phenomenological analyses both within and beyond the framework of
Minimal Flavour Violation (MFV), where the sources of flavour violation are the
same as in the Standard Model. Within MFV we present the expectations found for
rare K decays from a model-independent analysis and in three MFV models: the
Littlest Higgs (LH) model, the (extra-dimension) Appelquist-Cheng-Dobrescu
model and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with MFV. Beyond
MFV, we discuss the results recently found within the MSSM (without MFV), the
LH model with T-parity (LHT) and the 3-3-1 (Z') model. While in MFV models only
small (<30%) NP effects are allowed in the branching ratios of K_L -> pi^0 nu
{bar nu}, K^+ -> pi^+ nu {bar nu}, K_L -> pi^0 e^+ e^- and K_L -> pi^0 mu^+
mu^-, beyond MFV, in particular in the MSSM and in the LHT model, large (up to
an order of magnitude) enhancements w.r.t. the SM turn out to be possible.
