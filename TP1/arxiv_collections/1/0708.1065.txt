We establish a super Frobenius formula for the characters of Iwahori-Hecke
algebras. We show that the Hall-Littlewood sypersymmetric function, up to
constant, generates the values of the irreducible characters of Iwahori-Hecke
algebras at the elements corresponding to cycle permutations. Our formula in
this article includes both the ordinary quantum case and the classical super
case.
