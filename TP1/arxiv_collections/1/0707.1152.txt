This paper examines the variance of quantum and classical predictions in the
quantum realm, as well as unexpected presence and absence of variances. Some
features are found that share an indirect commonality with the Aharonov-Bohm
and Aharonov-Casher effects in that there is a quantum action in the absence of
a force. Variances are also found in the presence of a force that are more
subtle as they are of higher order. Significant variances related to the
harmonic oscillator and particle in a box periods are found. This paper raises
the question whether apparent quantum self-inconsistency may be examined
internally, or must be empirically ascertained. These inherent variances may
either point to inconsistencies in quantum mechanics that should be fixed, or
that nature is manifestly more non-classical than expected. For the harmonic
oscillator it is proven that the second spatial moment is the same in QM and
CM.
