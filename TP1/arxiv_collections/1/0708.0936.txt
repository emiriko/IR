The couplings $g_{\rho HH}$ of the $\rho$ meson with any hadron H are
calculated in a holographic dual of QCD where the Regge trajectories for mesons
are manifest. The resulting couplings grow linearly with the exciting number of
H, thus are far from universal. A simple argument has been given for this
behavior based on quasi-classical picture of excited hadrons. It seems that in
holographic duals with exact Regge trajectories the $g_{\rho HH}$ universality
should be violated. The $\rho$-dominance for the electromagnetic form factors
of H are also strongly violated, except for the lowest state, the pion. Quite
unexpected, the form factor of the pion is completely saturated by the
contribution of the $\rho$. The asymptotic behavior of the form factors are
also calculated, and are found to be perfectly accordant with the prediction of
conformal symmetry and pertubative QCD.
