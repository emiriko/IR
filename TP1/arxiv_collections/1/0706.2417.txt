Systems whose underlying classical dynamics are chaotic exhibit signatures of
the chaos in their quantum mechanics. We investigate the possibility of using
time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to study the case when chaos
is induced by electron-interaction alone. Nearest-neighbour level-spacing
statistics are in principle exactly and directly accessible from TDDFT. We
discuss how the TDDFT linear response procedure can reveal the mechanism of
chaos induced by electron-interaction alone. A simple model of a two-electron
quantum dot highlights the necessity to go beyond the adiabatic approximation
in TDDFT.
