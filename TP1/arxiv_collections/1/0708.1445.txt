A short overview is given of recent advances in the field of
nanosemiconductors, which are suitable as materials for spin polarized
transport of charge carriers. On the basis of last theoretical and experimental
achievements it is shown that development of diluted and wide forbidden zone
semiconductors with controlled disorders as well as their molecular structures
is the very prospective way for magnetic semiconductors preparation.
