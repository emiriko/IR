A coarse-grained multi-blob description of polymer solutions is presented,
based on soft, transferable effective interactions between bonded and
non-bonded blobs. The number of blobs is chosen such that the blob density does
not exceed their overlap threshold, allowing polymer concentrations to be
explored deep into the semi-dilute regime. This quantitative multi-blob
description is shown to preserve known scaling laws of polymer solutions and
provides accurate estimates of amplitudes, while leading to orders of magnitude
increase of simulation efficiency and allowing analytic calculations of
structural and thermodynamic properties.
