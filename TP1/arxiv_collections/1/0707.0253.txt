In the framework of the k_t-factorization approach, the production of
$\Upsilon mesons at the Fermilab Tevatron and CERN LHC is considered, and the
predictions on the spin alignment parameter $\alpha$ are presented. We argue
that measuring the polarization of quarkonium states can serve as a crucial
test discriminating two competing theoretical approaches to parton dynamics in
QCD.
