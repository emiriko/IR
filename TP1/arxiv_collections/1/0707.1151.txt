This paper encompasses a super helical memory system's design, 'Boolean logic
& image-logic' as a theoretical concept of an invention-model to 'store
time-data' in terms of anticipating the best memory location ever for
data/time. A waterfall effect is deemed to assist the process of
potential-difference output-switch into diverse logic states in quantum dot
computational methods via utilizing coiled carbon nanotubes (CCNTs) and carbon
nanotube field effect transistors (CNFETs). A 'quantum confinement' is thus
derived for a flow of particles in a categorized quantum well substrate with a
normalized capacitance rectifying high B-field flux into electromagnetic
induction. Multi-access of coherent sequences of 'qubit addressing' is gained
in any magnitude as pre-defined for the orientation of array displacement.
Briefly, Gaussian curvature of k<0 is debated in aim of specifying the 2D
electron gas characteristics in scenarios where data is stored in short
intervals versus long ones e.g. when k'>(k<0) for greater CCNT diameters,
space-time continuum is folded by chance for the particle. This benefits from
Maxwell-Lorentz theory in Minkowski's space-time viewpoint alike to crystal
oscillators for precise data timing purposes and radar systems e.g., time
varying self-clocking devices in diverse geographic locations. This application
could also be optional for data depository versus extraction, in the best
supercomputer system's locations, autonomously. For best performance in
minimizing current limiting mechanisms including electromigration, a multilevel
metallization and implant process forming elevated sources/drains for the
circuit's staircase pyramidal construction, is discussed accordingly.
