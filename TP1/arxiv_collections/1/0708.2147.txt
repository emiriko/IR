Species coexistence is one of the central themes in modern ecology.
Coexistence is a prerequisite of biological diversity. However, the question
arises how biodiversity can be reconciled with the statement of competition
theory, which asserts that competing species cannot coexist. To solve this
problem natural selection theory is rejected because it contradicts kinetic
models of interacting populations. Biological evolution is presented as a
process equivalent to a chemical reaction. The main point is that interactions
occur between self-replicating units. Under these assumptions biodiversity is
possible if and only if species are identical with respect to the patterns of
energy flow in which individuals are involved.
