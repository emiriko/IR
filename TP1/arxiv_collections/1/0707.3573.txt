Over the past decade, dust particulate contamination has increasingly become
an area of concern within the fusion research community. In a burning plasma
machine design like the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor
(ITER), dust contamination presents problems for diagnostic integration and may
contribute to tritium safety issues. Additionally due to ITER design, such dust
contamination problems are projected to become of even greater concern due to
dust/wall interactions and possible instabilities created within the plasma by
such particulates. Since the dynamics of such dust can in general be explained
employing a combination of the ion drag, Coulomb force, and ion pre-sheath
drifts, recent research in complex (dusty) plasma physics often offers unique
insights for this research area. This paper will discuss the possibility of how
experimental observations of the dust and plasma parameters within a GEC rf
Reference Cell might be employed to diagnose conditions within fusion reactors,
hopefully providing insight into possible mechanisms for dust detection and
removal.
