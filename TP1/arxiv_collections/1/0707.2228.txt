The workspace topologies of a family of 3-revolute (3R) positioning
manipulators are enumerated. The workspace is characterized in a half-cross
section by the singular curves. The workspace topology is defined by the number
of cusps that appear on these singular curves. The design parameters space is
shown to be divided into five domains where all manipulators have the same
number of cusps. Each separating surface is given as an explicit expression in
the DH-parameters. As an application of this work, we provide a necessary and
sufficient condition for a 3R orthogonal manipulator to be cuspidal, i.e. to
change posture without meeting a singularity. This condition is set as an
explicit expression in the DH parameters.
