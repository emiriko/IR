We address the issue of the neutrino masses and mixing in TeV scale $B-L$
extension of the Standard Model. We show that if Dirac neutrino masses are of
order $10^{-4}$ Gev, then the measured neutrino masses are correctly obtained.
We propose a mass relation between quarks and leptons that may account for such
small Dirac neutrino masses. We analyze the leptogenesis in this type of models
and provide analytical expressions for the new contributions due to the
predicted extra Higgs and extra neutral gauge boson. We find that thermal
leptogenesis, with a resonant enhancement due to nearly degenerate right-handed
neutrinos, can yield sufficient baryon asymmetry. Finally, we comment on a
possible scheme for non-thermal leptogenesis, which is due to the decay of
extra Higgs into right-handed neutrino.
