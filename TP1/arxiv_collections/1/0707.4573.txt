The existence of a finite threshold, the yield stress, for the onset of
plastic yielding is a universal feature of plasticity. This jamming-unjamming
transition is naturally accounted for by the dynamics of a bistable internal
state field. We show, within the athermal Shear Transformation Zones (STZ)
theory of amorphous plasticity, that the transition is accompanied by the
propagation of plastic fronts. We further show that the mean-field theory
cannot select the velocity of these fronts and go beyond the mean-field
description to include fluctuations and correlations effects, resulting in new
nonlocal terms in the equations. Finally, we demonstrate that the new terms,
with an associated intrinsic lengthscale, provide a velocity selection
mechanism for the plastic fronts.
