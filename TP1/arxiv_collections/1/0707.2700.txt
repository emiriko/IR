We study different types of radiative decays involving f0(980) and a0(980)
mesons within a unified ChPT-based approach at one-loop level. Light scalar
resonances which are seen in pi pi, pi eta, K K-bar channels of phi(1020)
radiative decays and in J/psi decays are responsible for key questions of
low-energy dynamics in the strong interaction sector, and decays phi(1020) ->
gamma a0(980), phi(1020) -> gamma f0(980), a0(980) -> gamma gamma, f0(980) ->
gamma gamma are of interest for current experimental programs in Juelich,
Frascati and Novosibirsk. From theoretical point of view it is important to
verify whether light scalar mesons are members of some flavor octet or nonet.
We find a value of mixing angle dictated by consistency with experiment and
coupling structures of ChPT Lagrangian. Decay widths f0(980)/a0(980) -> gamma
rho(770)/omega(782), which are not studied experimentally yet, are predicted.
We also obtain several relations between widths, which hold independently of
coupling constants and represent a fingerprint of the model.
