Chaotic attractors with toroidal topology (van der Pol attractor) have
counterparts with symmetry that exhibit unfamiliar phenomena. We investigate
double covers of toroidal attractors, discuss changes in their morphology under
correlated peeling bifurcations, describe their topological structures and the
changes undergone as a symmetry axis crosses the original attractor, and
indicate how the symbol name of a trajectory in the original lifts to one in
the cover. Covering orbits are described using a powerful synthesis of kneading
theory with refinements of the circle map. These methods are applied to a
simple version of the van der Pol oscillator.
