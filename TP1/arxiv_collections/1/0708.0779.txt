We investigate simulations for gauge theories on a Minkowskian space-time
lattice. We employ stochastic quantization with optimized updating using
stochastic reweighting or gauge fixing, respectively. These procedures do not
affect the underlying theory but strongly improve the stability properties of
the stochastic dynamics, such that simulations on larger real-time lattices can
be performed.
