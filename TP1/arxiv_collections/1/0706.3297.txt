We report on our recent results for deep-inelastic neutrino-proton
scattering. We have computed the perturbative QCD corrections to three loops
for the harged current structure functions F_2, F_L and F_3 for the combination
nu P - nubar P. In leading twist approximation we have calculated the first six
odd-integer Mellin moments in the case of F_2 and F_L and the first six
even-integer moments in the case of F_3. As a new result we have obtained the
coefficient functions to O(alpha_s^3) and we have found the corresponding
anomalous dimensions to agree with known results in the literature.
