We show that the intriguing observation of noise enhancement in the charge
transport through two vertically coupled quantum dots can be explained by the
interplay of quantum coherence and strong Coulomb blockade. We demonstrate that
this novel mechanism for super-Poissonian charge transfer is very sensitive to
decoherence caused by electron-phonon scattering as inferred from the measured
temperature dependence.
