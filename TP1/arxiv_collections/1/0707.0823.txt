This paper addresses the issues of conservativeness and computational
complexity of probabilistic robustness analysis. We solve both issues by
defining a new sampling strategy and robustness measure. The new measure is
shown to be much less conservative than the existing one. The new sampling
strategy enables the definition of efficient hierarchical sample reuse
algorithms that reduce significantly the computational complexity and make it
independent of the dimension of the uncertainty space. Moreover, we show that
there exists a one to one correspondence between the new and the existing
robustness measures and provide a computationally simple algorithm to derive
one from the other.
