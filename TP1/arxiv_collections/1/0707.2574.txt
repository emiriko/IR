We use all-optical methods to produce a highly-degenerate Fermi gas of
spin-1/2 $^6$Li atoms. A magnetic field tunes the gas near a collisional
(Feshbach) resonance, producing strong interactions between spin-up and
spin-down atoms. This atomic gas is a paradigm for strong interactions in
nature, and provides tests of current quantum many-body calculational methods
for diverse systems, including very high temperature superconductors, nuclear
matter in neutron stars, and the quark-gluon plasma of the Big Bang. We have
measured properties of a breathing mode over a wide range of temperatures. At
temperatures both below and well above the superfluid transition, the frequency
of the mode is nearly constant and very close to the hydrodynamic value.
However, explaining both the frequency and the damping rate in the normal
collisional regime has not been achieved. Our measurements of the damping rate
as a function of the energy of the gas are used to estimate an upper bound on
the viscosity. Using our new measurements of the entropy of the gas, we
estimate the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density, and compare
the result with the lower bound for quantum viscosity recently predicted using
string theory methods.
