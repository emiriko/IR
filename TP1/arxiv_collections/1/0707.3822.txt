We study the spin-$\frac32$ Hubbard-Kondo lattice model by means of the
Composite Operator Method, after applying a Holstein-Primakov transformation.
The spin and particle dynamics in the ferromagnetic state are calculated by
taking into account strong on-site correlations between electrons and
antiferromagnetic exchange among $\frac32$ spins, together with usual Hund
coupling between electrons and spins.
