In these lectures, I will attempt a pedagogical and qualitative introduction
to the theory of equilibrium and thermalization of quark-gluon plasmas. I
assume only that the reader is familiar with quantum field theory at zero
temperature and with QCD as the theory of the strong interactions. I focus on
the limit of small alpha_s, which in principle should be relevant at extremely
high temperature because of asymptotic freedom, and in any case provides a
clean theoretical context in which to discuss a variety of phenomena. Topics
discussed include the basic equilibrium formalism for finite-temperature
quantum field theory, Debye screening, electric deconfinement, magnetic
confinement, dimensional reduction, plasma waves, kinetic theory, hydrodynamic
properties such as viscosity, the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect,
thermalization in (arbitrarily high energy) heavy ion collisions, and QCD
plasma instabilities.
