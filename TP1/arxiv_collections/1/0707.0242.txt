We study the electron transport through a magnetic molecular transistor in
the Kondo limit using the slave boson technique. We include the electron-phonon
coupling and analyze the cases where the spin of the molecule is either S=1/2
or S=1. We use the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation to write down a low energy
Hamiltonian for the system. In the presence of electron-phonon coupling, and
for $S\smeq1$, the resulting Kondo Hamiltonian has two active channels. At low
temperature, these two channels interfere destructively, leading to a zero
conductance.
