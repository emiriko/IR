In this Article we review some recent progresses in the field of
non-equilibrium linear response theory. We show how a generalization of the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be derived for Markov processes, and
discuss the Cugliandolo-Kurchan \cite{Cugliandolo93} fluctuation dissipation
relation for aging systems and the theorem by Franz {\it et. al.}
\cite{Franz98} relating static and dynamic properties. We than specialize the
subject to phase-ordering systems examining the scaling properties of the
linear response function and how these are determined by the behavior of
topological defects. We discuss how the connection between statics and dynamics
can be violated in these systems at the lower critical dimension or as due to
stochastic instability.
