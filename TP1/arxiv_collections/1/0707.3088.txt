We present a next-to-leading order calculation of heavy flavour production in
hadronic collisions that can be interfaced to shower Monte Carlo programs. The
calculation is performed in the context of the POWHEG method. It is suitable
for the computation of charm, bottom and top hadroproduction. In the case of
top production, spin correlations in the decay products are taken into account.
