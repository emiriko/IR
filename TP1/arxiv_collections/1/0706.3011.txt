We evaluate the nucleon axial form factor, $G_A(q^2)$, and induced
pseudoscalar form factor, $G_p(q^2)$, as well as the pion-nucleon form factor,
$G_{\pi N N}(q^2)$, in lattice QCD. We also evaluate the corresponding nucleon
to $\Delta$ transition form factors, $C_5^A(q^2)$ and $C_6^A(q^2)$, and the
pion-nucleon-$\Delta$ form factor $G_{\pi N\Delta}(q^2)$. The nucleon form
factors are evaluated in the quenched theory and with two degenerate flavors of
dynamical Wilson fermions. The nucleon to $\Delta$ form factors, besides Wilson
fermions, are evaluated using domain wall valence fermions with staggered sea
quark configurations for pion masses as low as about 350 MeV. Using these form
factors, together with an evaluation of the renormalized quark mass, we
investigate the validity of the diagonal and non-diagonal Goldberger-Treiman
relations. The ratios $G_{\pi N\Delta}(q^2)/G_{\pi NN}(q^2)$ and
$2C_5^A(q^2)/G_A(q^2)$ are constant as a function of the momentum transfer
squared and show almost no dependence on the quark mass. We confirm equality of
these two ratios consistent with the Goldberger-Treiman relations extracting a
mean value of $1.61(2)$.
