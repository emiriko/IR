We investigate the low temperature behaviour of the integrable 1D
two-component spinor Bose gas using the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. We find
that for strong coupling the characteristics of the thermodynamics at low
temperatures are quantitatively affected by the spin ferromagnetic states,
which are described by an effective ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain. The free
energy, specific heat, susceptibility and local pair correlation function are
calculated for various physical regimes in terms of temperature and interaction
strength. These thermodynamic properties reveal spin effects which are
significantly different than those of the spinless Bose gas. The zero-field
susceptibility for finite strong repulsion exceeds that of a free spin
paramagnet. The critical exponents of the specific heat $c_v \sim T^{1/2}$ and
the susceptibility $\chi \sim T^{-2}$ are indicative of the ferromagnetic
signature of the two-component spinor Bose gas. Our analytic results are
consistent with general arguments by Eisenberg and Lieb for polarized spinor
bosons.
