The lightest superparticle in the MSSM is expected to be a Bino, Higgsino or
Wino. We consider the dark matter abundance constraint on these LSP scenarios
in the minimal SUGRA and AMSB models. We discuss the resulting collider signals
for the Bino LSP at LHC and the Higgsino and Wino LSP at CLIC. The Bino,
Higgsino and Wino LSP signals in dark matter experiments are also discussed
briefly. We conclude with a discussion of these LSP scenarios in nonminimal
SUSY models.
