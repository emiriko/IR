We prove that the Gelfand-Shilov spaces $S^\beta_\alpha$ are topological
algebras under the Moyal star product if and only if $\alpha\ge\beta$. These
spaces of test functions can be used in quantum field theory on noncommutative
spacetime. The star product depends on the noncommutativity parameter
continuously in their topology. We also prove that the series expansion of the
Moyal product converges absolutely in $S^\beta_\alpha$ if and only if
$\beta<1/2$.
