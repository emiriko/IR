Unbound states of $^{10}$C nuclei produced as quasi-projectiles in
$^{12}$C+$^{24}$Mg collisions at E/A = 53 and 95 MeV are studied with the Indra
detector array. Multi-particle correlation function analyses provide
experimental evidence of sequential de-excitation mechanisms through the
production of intermediate $^{9}$B, $^{6}$Be and $^{8}$Be unbound nuclei. The
relative contributions of different decay sequences to the total decay width of
the explored states is estimated semi-quantitatively. The obtained results show
that heavy-ion collisions can be used as a tool to access spectroscopic
information about exotic nuclei.
