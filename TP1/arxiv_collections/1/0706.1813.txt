A classical deterministic, reversible dynamical systems, reproducing the
Einstein--Podolsky--Rosen (EPR) correlations in full respect of causality and
locality and without the introduction of any ad hoc selection procedure, was
constructed in the paper [AIR02].
  In the present paper we prove that the above mentioned model is unique (see
Theorem (2) in the sense that any local causal probability measure which
reproduces the EPR correlations must coincide, under natural and generic
assumptions, with the one constructed in [AIR02].
