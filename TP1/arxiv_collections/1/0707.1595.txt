We study a class of flux compactifications that have all the moduli
stabilised, a high (GUT) string scale and a low (TeV) gravitino mass that is
generated dynamically. These non-geometric compactifications correspond to type
II string theories on SU(3)xSU(3) structure orientifolds. The resulting
superpotentials admit, excluding non-perturbative effects, supersymmetric
Minkowski vacua with any number of moduli stabilised. We argue that
non-perturbative effects are present and introduce terms in the superpotential
that are exponentially suppressed by the same moduli that appear
perturbatively. These deform the supersymmetric Minkowski vacua to
supersymmetric AdS vacua with an exponentially small gravitino mass. The
resulting vacua allow for low scale supersymmetry breaking which can be
realised by a number of mechanisms.
