Measurements of inclusive-jet and dijet cross-sections in high-Q2
deep-inelastic scattering are presented together with a short overview of
extractions of the strong coupling parameter alpha_S from jets. The data
samples used were collected with the ZEUS detector at HERA-1 and HERA-2. The
measured distributions are compared to QCD calculations in next-to-leading
order which describe the data very well. The various determinations of alpha_S
give a consistent picture, have competitive uncertainties and clearly
demonstrate the running of the coupling predicted by QCD.
