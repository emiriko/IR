In Lorentz-violating electrodynamics a steady current (and similarly a static
charge) generates both static magnetic and electric fields. These induced
fields, acting on interfering particles, change the interference pattern. We
find that particle interference experiments are sensitive to small Lorentz
violating effects, and thus they can be used to improve current bounds on some
Lorentz-violating parameters.
