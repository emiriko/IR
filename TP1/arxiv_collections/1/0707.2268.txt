We study the implication of R-parity violating Rp Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model (MSSM) model in lepton polarization asymmetry ALP in B l l(bar)
decays . The analysis show that the ALP is significant in a certain
phenomenological parametric region of Yukawa couplings. We have also placed
indirect bounds on Lambda' lambda couplings as obtained from B t t(bar).
