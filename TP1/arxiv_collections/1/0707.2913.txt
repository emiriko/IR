We propose that the observed splitting of the vortices in the cuprates into
fractional vortices (partons) may be of static rather than of dynamic origin.
This interpretation is backed by a study of a model with a dominant d-wave and
subdominant s-wave pairing interaction. We find that the vortex may split into
two partons, both of which carry one half of the magnetic flux quantum. The
partons are hold together by a confining string along which the phase jumps
approximately by pi and their equilibrium distance increases with lowering the
energy difference epsilon between the pairing states. The partons become
deconfined at the critical point where epsilon vanishes.
