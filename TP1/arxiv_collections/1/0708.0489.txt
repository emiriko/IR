We consider overdamped diffusion processes driven out of thermal equilibrium
and we analyze their dynamical steady fluctuations. We discuss the
thermodynamic interpretation of the joint fluctuations of occupation times and
currents; they incorporate respectively the time-symmetric and the
time-antisymmetric sector of the fluctuations. We highlight the canonical
structure of the joint fluctuations. The novel concept of traffic complements
the entropy production for the study of the occupation statistics. We explain
how the occupation and current fluctuations get mutually coupled out of
equilibrium. Their decoupling close-to-equilibrium explains the validity of
entropy production principles.
