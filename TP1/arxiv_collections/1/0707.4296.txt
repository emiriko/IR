We describe details of the renormalization of two-loop integrals relevant to
the calculation of the nucleon mass in the framework of manifestly
Lorentz-invariant chiral perturbation theory using infrared renormalization. It
is shown that the renormalization can be performed while preserving all
relevant symmetries, in particular chiral symmetry, and that renormalized
diagrams respect the standard power counting rules. As an application we
calculate the chiral expansion of the nucleon mass to order O(q^6).
