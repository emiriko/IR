Within the context of the nascent e-Science infrastructure in Venezuela, we
describe several web-based scientific applications developed at the Centro
Nacional de Calculo Cientifico Universidad de Los Andes (CeCalCULA), Merida,
and at the Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientificas (IVIC), Caracas.
The different strategies that have been followed for implementing quantum
chemistry and atomic physics applications are presented. We also briefly
discuss a damage portal based on dynamic, nonlinear, finite elements of lumped
damage mechanics and a biomedical portal developed within the framework of the
\textit{E-Infrastructure shared between Europe and Latin America} (EELA)
initiative for searching common sequences and inferring their functions in
parasitic diseases such as leishmaniasis, chagas and malaria.
