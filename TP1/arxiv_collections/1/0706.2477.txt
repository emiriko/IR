Spin-orbital entanglement in the ground state of a one-dimensional
SU(2)$\otimes$SU(2) spin-orbital model is analyzed using exact diagonalization
of finite chains. For $S=1/2$ spins and $T=1/2$ pseudospins one finds that the
quantum entanglement is similar at the SU(4) symmetry point and in the
spin-orbital valence bond state. We also show that quantum transitions in
spin-orbital models turn out to be continuous under certain circumstances, in
constrast to the discontinuous transitions in spin models with SU(2) symmetry.
