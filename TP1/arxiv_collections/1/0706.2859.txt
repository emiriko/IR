In 1998 the Adapted Ordering Method was developed for the representation
theory of the superconformal algebras in two dimensions. It allows: to
determine maximal dimensions for a given type of space of singular vectors, to
identify all singular vectors by only a few coefficients, to spot subsingular
vectors and to set the basis for constructing embedding diagrams. In this
article we present the Adapted Ordering Method for general Lie algebras and
superalgebras, and their generalizations, provided they can be triangulated. We
also review briefly the results obtained for the Virasoro algebra and for the
N=2 and Ramond N=1 superconformal algebras.
