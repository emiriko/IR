In a variety of situations, isolated polymer molecules are found in a vacuum
and here we examine their properties. Angular momentum conservation is shown to
significantly alter the average size of a chain and its conservation is only
broken slowly by thermal radiation. The time autocorrelation for monomer
position oscillates with a characteristic time proportional to chain length.
The oscillations and damping are analyzed in detail. Short range repulsive
interactions suppress oscillations and speed up relaxation but stretched chains
still show damped oscillatory time correlations.
