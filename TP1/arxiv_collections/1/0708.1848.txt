Experimentally observed self-organization of a 2D lattice on the surface of
Ge single crystal after irradiation by pulsed YAG: Nd laser is repoted. The
calculation of time depended distribution of temperature in bulk of the Ge
sample show that overheating of the crystal lattice occurs at laser radiation
intensities exceeding 30MW/cm2.The two temperature gradients are exists.
