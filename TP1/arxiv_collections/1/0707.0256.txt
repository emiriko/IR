The azimuthal angle correlation of Mueller-Navelet jets at hadron colliders
is studied in the NLO BFKL formalism. We highlight the need of collinear
improvements in the kernel to obtain good convergence properties and we obtain
better fits for the Tevatron data than at LO accuracy. We also estimate these
correlations for larger rapidity differences available at the LHC.
