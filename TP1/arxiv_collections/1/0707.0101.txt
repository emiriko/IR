The D4-D8 brane system of Sakai-Sugimoto model at high quark density is
studied in the weak coupling regime. We show that the color superconducting
phase (for Nc~3) or the chiral density wave (for Nc->infinity) disappears at
very large chemical potential, or equivalently at very large compactified
dimension that the model possesses. We also comment on the prospects in the
strong coupling regime along with the QCD phase diagram.
