We present experimental magnetotunneling results and atomistic
pseudopotential calculations of quasiparticle electron and hole wave functions
of self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots. The combination of a predictive
theory along with the experimental results allows us to gain direct insight
into the quantum states. We monitor the effects of (i) correlations, (ii)
atomistic symmetry and (iii) piezoelectricity on the confined carriers and (iv)
observe a peculiar charging sequence of holes that violates the Aufbau
principle.
