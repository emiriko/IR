We report direct experimental evidence of room temperature spin filtering in
magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) containing CoFe2O4 tunnel barriers via
tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) measurements.
Pt(111)/CoFe2O4(111)/gamma-Al2O3(111)/Co(0001) fully epitaxial MTJs were grown
in order to obtain a high quality system, capable of functioning at room
temperature. Spin polarized transport measurements reveal significant TMR
values of -18% at 2 K and -3% at 290 K. In addition, the TMR ratio follows a
unique bias voltage dependence that has been theoretically predicted to be the
signature of spin filtering in MTJs containing magnetic barriers. CoFe2O4
tunnel barriers therefore provide a model system to investigate spin filtering
in a wide range of temperatures.
