The kinetics of droplet and bridge formation within striped nano-capillaries
is studied when the wetting film grows via interface-limited growth. The
phenomenological time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL)-type model with thermal
noise is used and numerically solved using the cell dynamics method. The model
is two-dimensional and consists of undersaturated vapor confined within a
nano-capillary made of two infinitely wide flat substrates. The surface of the
substrate is chemically heterogeneous with a single stripe of lyophilic domain
that exerts long-range attractive potential to the vapor molecule. The dynamics
of nucleation and subsequent growth of droplet and bridge can be simulated and
visualized. In particular, the evolution of the morphology from droplet or bump
to bridge is clearly identified. Crucial role played by the substrate potential
on the morphology of bridge of nanoscopic size is clarified. Nearly
temperature-independent evolution of capillary condensation is predicted when
the interface-limited growth dominates. In addition, it is shown that the
dynamics of capillary condensation follows the scenario of capillary
condensation proposed by Everett and Haynes three decades ago.
