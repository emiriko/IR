We first review some aspects of the determination of the sides and angles of
the unitarity triangle. We pay particular attention to theory shortcomings, and
present many alternative proposals for the determination of |Vub| (which at
present is problematic). We then turn our attention to the more general
question: What have we learned so far about flavor physics and where do we go
from here? We argue that the aim of Flavor Physics should be to establish or
rule out Minimal Flavor Violating interactions up to a scale of 10 TeV.
