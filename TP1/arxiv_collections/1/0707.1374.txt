A derivation is presented of the quantummechanical wave equations based upon
the Equity Principle of Einstein's General Relativity Theory. This is believed
to be more generic than the common derivations based upon Einstein's energy
relationship for moving particles. It is shown that Schrodinger's Equation, if
properly formulated, is relativisticly covariant. This makes the critisized
Klein-Gordon Equation for spinless massparticles obsolete. Therefore Dirac's
Equation is presented from a different viewpoint and it is shown that the
relativistic covariance of Schrodinger's Equation gives a natural explanation
for the dual energy outcome of Dirac's derivation and for the nature of
antiparticles. The propagation of wave functions in an energy field is studied
in terms of propagation along geodesic lines in curved space-time, resulting in
an equivalent formulation as with Feynman's path integral. It is shown that
Maxwell's wave equation fits in the developed framework as the massless limit
of moving particles. Finally the physical appearance of electrons is discussed
including a quantitative calculation of the jitter phenomenon of a free moving
electron.
