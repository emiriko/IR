The usual brane world scenario with anti de Sitter bulk has been generalized
by considering a general form of energy momentum tensor in the bulk. The
modified Einstein equation on the brane has been constructed. Two examples have
been cited of which, the first one shows the usual brane equations when matter
in the bulk is a negative cosmological constant. In the second example, the
bulk matter is in the form of perfect fluid and as a result, an effective
perfect fluid is obtained in the brane. Also it is noted that the effect of the
dust bulk on the brane shows a dark energy behaviour and may be a possible
explanation of the dark energy from the present day observational point of
view.
