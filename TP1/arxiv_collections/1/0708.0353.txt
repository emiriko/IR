We investigate the local fractal properties of the financial time series
based on the evolution of the Warsaw Stock Exchange Index (WIG) connected with
the largest developing financial market in Europe. Calculating the local Hurst
exponent for the WIG time series we find an interesting dependence between the
behavior of the local fractal properties of the WIG time series and the crashes
appearance on the financial market.
