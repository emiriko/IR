From a total data sample of 701.1 pb^-1 recorded with e+e- centre-of-mass
energies of sqrt = 161-209 GeV with the OPAL detector at LEP, 11693 W-pair
candidate events are selected. These data are used to obtain measurements of
the W-pair production cross sections at 10 different centre-of-mass energies.
The ratio of the measured cross sections to the Standard Model expectation is
found to be: data/SM = 1.002 +- 0.011(stat.) +- 0.007(syst.) +- 0.005(theory),
where the uncertainties are statistical, experimental systematics and theory
systematics respectively. The data are used to determine the W boson branching
fractions, which are found to be consistent with lepton universality of the
charged current interaction. Assuming lepton universality, the branching ratio
to hadrons is determined to be 67.41 +- 0.37(stat.) +- 0.23(syst.)%, from which
the CKM matrix element Vcs is determined to be
0.96+-0.017(stat.)+-0.012(syst.).
  The differential cross section as a function of the W^- production angle is
measured for the qqev and qqmv final states. The results described in this
paper are consistent with the expectations from the Standard Model.
