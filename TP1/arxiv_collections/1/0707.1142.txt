We report on theoretical and experimental investigations of the integer
quantized Hall effect in narrow channels at various mobilities. The Hall bars
are defined electrostatically in two-dimensional electron systems by biasing
metal gates on the surfaces of GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. In the low
mobility regime the classical Hall resistance line is proportional to the
magnetic field as measured in the high temperature limit and cuts through the
center of each Hall plateau. For high mobility samples we observe in linear
response measurements, that this symmetry is broken and the classical Hall line
cuts the plateaus not at the center but at higher magnetic fields near the
edges of the plateaus. These experimental results confirm the unconventional
predictions of a model for the quantum Hall effect taking into account mutual
screening of charge carriers within the Hall bar. The theory is based on
solving the Poisson and Schr\"odinger equations in a self-consistent manner.
