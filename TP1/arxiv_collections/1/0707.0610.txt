It is shown that every orthogonal terrain, i.e., an orthogonal (right-angled)
polyhedron based on a rectangle that meets every vertical line in a segment,
has a grid unfolding: its surface may be unfolded to a single non-overlapping
piece by cutting along grid edges defined by coordinate planes through every
vertex.
