It is shown that in all odd dimensional Chern-Simons theories states in which
the torsion is non zero (but it can approach smoothly to zero outside suitable
regions) do exist. Some possible observational effects related to neutrino
oscillations are pointed out. In the theory of continuum media (in which
suitable defects can be described by localized non vanishing torsion) "the
gravitational intuition" is a rather useful tool to describe the physical
effects of such defects. A possible astrophysical application is shortly
described.
