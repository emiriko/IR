Superconductors separated by a thin tunneling barrier exhibit the Josephson
effect that allows charge transport at zero voltage, typically with no phase
shift between the superconductors in the lowest energy state. Recently,
Josephson junctions with ground state phase shifts of pi proposed by theory
three decades ago have been demonstrated. In superconducting loops,
pi-junctions cause spontaneous circulation of persistent currents in zero
magnetic field, analogous to spin-1/2 systems. Here we image the spontaneous
zero-field currents in superconducting networks of temperature-controlled
pi-junctions with weakly ferromagnetic barriers using a scanning SQUID
microscope. We find an onset of spontaneous supercurrents at the 0-pi
transition temperature of the junctions Tpi = 3 K. We image the currents in
non-uniformly frustrated arrays consisting of cells with even and odd numbers
of pi-junctions. Such arrays are attractive model systems for studying the
exotic phases of the 2D XY-model and achieving scalable adiabatic quantum
computers.
