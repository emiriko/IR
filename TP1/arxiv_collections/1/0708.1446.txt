We report the observation of capillary wave turbulence on the surface of a
fluid layer in a low-gravity environment. In such conditions, the fluid covers
all the internal surface of the spherical container which is submitted to
random forcing. The surface wave amplitude displays power-law spectrum over two
decades in frequency, corresponding to wavelength from $mm$ to a few $cm$. This
spectrum is found in roughly good agreement with wave turbulence theory. Such a
large scale observation without gravity waves has never been reached during
ground experiments. When the forcing is periodic, two-dimensional spherical
patterns are observed on the fluid surface such as subharmonic stripes or
hexagons with wavelength satisfying the capillary wave dispersion relation.
