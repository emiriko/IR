Generation and measurement of non-equilibrium spin current in two probe
configuration is discussed. It is argued and shown that spin current can be
generated in two terminal non-magnetic system. Further it is shown that these
spin currents can be measured via conductance in two probe configuration when
the detector probe is ferromagnetic.
