Mixtures of bosonic and fermionic atoms in optical lattices provide a
promising arena to study strongly correlated systems. In experiments realizing
such mixtures in the quantum degenerate regime the temperature is a key
parameter. In this work, we investigate the intrinsic heating and cooling
effects due to an entropy-preserving raising of the optical lattice potential.
We analyze this process, identify the generic behavior valid for a wide range
of parameters, and discuss it quantitatively for the recent experiments with
87Rb and 40K atoms. In the absence of a lattice, we treat the bosons in the
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov-Popov-approximation, including the fermions in a
self-consistent mean field interaction. In the presence of the full
three-dimensional lattice, we use a strong coupling expansion. As a result of
the presence of the fermions, the temperature of the mixture after the lattice
ramp-up is always higher than for the pure bosonic case. This sheds light onto
a key point in the analysis of recent experiments.
