In this paper we describe a Bayesian inference framework for analysis of data
obtained by LISA. We set up a model for binary inspiral signals as defined for
the Mock LISA Data Challenge 1.2 (MLDC), and implemented a Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to facilitate exploration and integration of the
posterior distribution over the 9-dimensional parameter space. Here we present
intermediate results showing how, using this method, information about the 9
parameters can be extracted from the data.
