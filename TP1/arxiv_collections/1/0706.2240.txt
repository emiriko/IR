Motivated by a recent experiment on nonlinear tunneling in a suspended Carbon
nanotube connected to two normal electrodes [S. Sapmaz, {\it et al}., Phys.
Rev. Lett. {\bf 96}, 26801 (2006)], we investigate nonequilibrium
vibration-mediated sequential tunneling through a molecular quantum dot with
two electronic orbitals asymmetrically coupled to two electrodes and strongly
interacting with an internal vibrational mode, which is itself weakly coupled
to a dissipative phonon bath. For this purpose, we establish rate equations
using a generic quantum Langevin equation approach. Based on these equations,
we study in detail the current-voltage characteristics and zero-frequency shot
noise, paying special attention to the advanced or postponed of the appearance
of negative differential conductance and super-Poissonian current noise
resulting from electron-phonon-coupling induced {\em selective unidirectional
cascades of single-electron transitions}.
