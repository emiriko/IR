Certain aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence are studied in detail. We
investigate the one-loop mass shift to certain two-impurity string states in
light-cone string field theory on a plane wave background. We find that there
exist logarithmic divergences in the sums over intermediate mode numbers which
cancel between the cubic Hamiltonian and quartic "contact term". We argue that
generically, every order in intermediate state impurities contributes to the
mass shift at leading perturbative order. The same mass shift is also computed
using an improved 3-string vertex proposed by Dobashi and Yoneya. The result is
found to agree with gauge theory at leading order and is close but not quite in
agreement at subleading order. We extend the analysis to include discrete
light-cone quantization, considering states with up to three units of p+. We
study the (apparently) first-order phase transition in the weakly coupled
plane-wave matrix model at finite temperature. We analyze the effect of
interactions by computing the relevant parts of the effective potential for the
Polyakov loop operator to three loop order. We show that the phase transition
is indeed of first order. We also compute the 2-loop correction to the Hagedorn
temperature. Finally, correlation functions of 1/4 BPS Wilson loops with the
infinite family of 1/2 BPS chiral primary operators are computed in N=4 super
Yang-Mills theory by summing planar ladder diagrams. The correlation functions
are also computed in the strong-coupling limit using string theory; the result
is found to agree with the extrapolation of the planar ladders. The result is
related to similar correlators of 1/2 BPS loops by a simple re-scaling of the
coupling constant, discovered by Drukker for the case of the 1/4 BPS loop VEV.
