From July-December 2004 the experimental campaign 'Bray 2004' was conducted
in the coniferous forest of Les Landes near Bordeaux, France, using a
multi-angle L-band (1.4 GHz) radiometer to measure upwelling radiation above
the forest. At the same time, ground measurements were taken of soil and litter
moisture content. This experiment was done in the context of the upcoming SMOS
mission in order to improve our understanding of the behaviour of the L-band
signal above forested areas. Very little information exists on this subject at
the moment, especially for varying hydrological conditions. Furthermore,
additional measurements were done at the University of Bordeaux (PIOM
laboratory) to determine the dielectric behaviour of a litter layer such as
that found at the Bray site. There is some evidence that this layer may have a
different influence on the L-band signal than either the soil or the
vegetation, however the exact behaviour of the litter layer and the extent of
its influence on the L-band signal are as yet unknown. This paper presents 1)
results of the Bray experiment describing the behaviour of the above-canopy
L-band emissivity for different conditions of ground moisture and 2) the
relationship between soil and litter moisture content and results of the
laboratory experiments on litter dielectric properties. Together this will give
a first insight into the L-band radiometric properties of the different forest
layers for varying hydrological conditions.
