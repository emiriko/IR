We report the temperature and field dependence of dc magnetization on sol-gel
prepared nanoparticles of Ni(OH)_2. At higher temperature the system is found
to behave as a paramagnet while we find evidence for superparamagnetic blocking
at low temperature. The system shows a paramagnet-superparamagnet transition
and we discuss the underlying mechanism.
