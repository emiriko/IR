The phase diagram of the coupled sine circle map lattice shows
spatio-temporal intermittency of two distinct types: spatio-temporal
intermittency of the directed percolation (DP) class, and spatial intermittency
which does not belong to this class. These two types of behaviour are seen to
be special cases of the spreading and non-spreading regimes seen in the system.
In the spreading regime, each site can infect its neighbours permitting an
initial disturbance to spread, whereas in the non-spreading regime no infection
is possible. The two regimes are separated by a line which we call the
infection line. The coupled map lattice can be mapped on to an equivalent
cellular automaton which shows a transition from a probabilistic cellular
automaton (PCA) to a deterministic cellular automaton (DCA) at the infection
line. Thus the existence of the DP and non-DP universality classes in the same
system is signalled by the PCA to DCA transition. We also discuss the dynamic
origin of this transition.
