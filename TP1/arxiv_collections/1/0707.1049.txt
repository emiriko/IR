We generalize the Momentum Average approximations MA$^{(0)}$ and MA$^{(1)}$
to study the effects of coupling to multiple optical phonons on the properties
of a Holstein polaron. As for a single phonon mode, these approximations are
numerically very efficient. They become exact for very weak or very strong
couplings, and are highly accurate in the intermediate regimes, {\em e.g.} the
spectral weights obey exactly the first six, respectively eight, sum rules. Our
results show that the effect on ground-state properties is cumulative in
nature. In particular, if the effective coupling to one mode is much larger
than to the others, this mode effectively determines the GS properties.
However, even very weak coupling to a second phonon mode has important
non-perturbational effects on the higher energy spectrum, in particular on the
dispersion and the phonon statistics of the polaron band.
