It is practically shown that a pair of neutrinos from tau decay can form a
flavor entangled state. With this kind of state we show that the locality
constrains imposed by Bell inequality are violated by the quantum mechanics,
and an experimental test of this effect is feasible within the earth's length
scale. Theoretically, the quantum entanglement of neutrino pairs can be
employed to the use of long distance cryptography distribution in a protocol
similar to the BB84.
