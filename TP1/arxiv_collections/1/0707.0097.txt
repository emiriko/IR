We propose a novel metamaterial for Surface Plasmon Polarition guiding,
amplification and modulation. Specific example of AlN/GaN Quantum Cascade
Amplifier and its dispersion engineering are studied in details. The general
original concept of metamaterials based on inclusions of low-dimensional
quantum structures (artificial atoms) is discussed.
