We develop a theory for the electron-phonon interaction effects on the
electronic properties of graphene. We analytically calculate the electron
self-energy, spectral function and band velocity renormalization due to
phonon-mediated electron-electron interaction. We find that phonon-mediated
electron-electron coupling has a large effect on the graphene band structure
renormalization, and our analytic theory successfully captures the essential
features of the observed graphene electron spectra in the ARPES experiments,
predicting a kink at $\sim 200\mathrm{meV}$ below the Fermi level and a
reduction of the band velocity by $\sim 10-20%$ at the experimental doping
level.
