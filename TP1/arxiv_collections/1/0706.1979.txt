Recent detailed analysis within the Loop Quantum Gravity calculation of black
hole entropy shows a stair-like structure in the behavior of entropy as a
function of horizon area. The non-trivial distribution of the degeneracy of the
black hole horizon area eigenstates is at the origin of this behavior. This
degeneracy distribution is analyzed and a phenomenological model is put forward
to study the implications of this distribution in the black hole radiation
spectrum. Some qualitative quantum effects are obtained within the isolated
horizon framework. This result provides us with a possible observational test
of this model for quantum black holes.
