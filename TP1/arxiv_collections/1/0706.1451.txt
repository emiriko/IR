We demonstrate spin injection into a graphene thin film with high reliability
by using non-local magnetoresistance (MR) measurements, in which the electric
current path is completely separated from the spin current path. Using these
non-local measurements, an obvious MR effect was observed at room temperature;
and the MR effect was ascribed to magnetization reversal of ferromagnetic
electrodes. This result is a direct demonstration of spin injection into a
graphene thin film. Furthermore, this is the first report of spin injection
into molecules at room temperature.
