Based on the hard-thermal-loop resummed improved ladder Dyson-Schwinger
quation for the fermion mass function, we propose a procedure how we can get
the gauge invariant solution in the sense it satisfies the Ward-Takahashi
identity. Results of the numerical analysis are shown and properties of the
``gauge-invariant'' solutions are discussed.
