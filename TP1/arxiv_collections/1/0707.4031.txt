Recent experiments on the organic compound \kappa-(ET)_2Cu_2(CN)_3 have
provided a promising example of a two dimensional spin liquid state. This phase
is described by a two-dimensional spinon Fermi sea coupled to a U(1) gauge
field. We study Kohn-Luttinger-like pairing instabilities of the spinon Fermi
surface due to singular interaction processes with twice-the-Fermi-momentum
transfer. We find that under certain circumstances the pairing instability
occurs in odd-orbital-angular-momentum/spin-triplet channels. Implications to
experiments are discussed.
