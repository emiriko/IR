It is shown that the criticism of Voitkiv [Phys. Rev. A 74, 027403 (2006)] is
based on one assumption, which is false for an ionized electron, initially
bound by the Coulomb potential, in a strong circularly polarized laser field. A
certain new Coulomb correction to the Volkov wavefunction is proposed.
