The current-voltage characteristic of a planar vacuum diode with electrons
possessing velocity distribution function during an emission from the cathode
(electron beam) is theoretically considered in this article. The electron beam
movement in the volume is examined. An integral-differential equation for the
electric field potential is got in a correct form. A current-voltage
characteristic of the diode for a model function of the velocity distribution
of the emitted electrons is obtained.
