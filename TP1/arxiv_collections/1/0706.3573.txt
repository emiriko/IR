Starting from the resurgence equation discovered by Berry and Howls [M. V.
Berry and C. Howls "Hyperasymptotics for integrals with saddles," Proc. R. Soc.
Lond. A 434, 657-675 (1991)], the Weniger transformation is here proposed as a
natural, efficient, and straightforwardly implementable scheme for the
efficient asymptotics evaluation of a class of integrals occurring in several
areas of physics and, in particular, of optics. Preliminary numerical tests,
carried out on the Pearcey function, provide a direct comparison between the
performances of Weniger transformation and those of Hyperasymptotics, which
seems to corroborate the theoretical predictions. We believe that Weniger
transformation would be a very useful computational tool for the asymptotic
treatment of several optical problems.
