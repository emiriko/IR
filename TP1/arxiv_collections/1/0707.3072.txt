We analyze an advanced two-spring model with an ultra-low effective tip mass
to predict nontrivial and physically rich 'fine structure' in the atomic
stick-slip motion in Friction Force Microscopy (FFM) experiments. We
demonstrate that this fine structure is present in recent, puzzling
experiments. This shows that the tip apex can be completely or partially
delocalized, thus shedding new light on what is measured in FFM and, possibly,
what can happen with the asperities that establish the contact between
macroscopic sliding bodies.
