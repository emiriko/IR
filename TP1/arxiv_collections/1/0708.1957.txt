Using the recently proposed definition of a conserved spin-current operator
[J. Shi et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 076604 (2006)] we explore the frequency
dependent spin Hall conductivity for a two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba
and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction in response to an oscillating electric
field. We show that the optical spectrum of the spin Hall conductivity exhibit
remarkable changes when the new definition of spin current is applied. Such
behavior is mainly due to a significant contribution of the spin torque term
which is absent in the conventional form of the spin current. In addition, it
is observed that the magnitude and direction of the dynamic spin Hall current
strongly depends on the electric field frequency as with the interplay of the
spin-orbit coupling strengths.
