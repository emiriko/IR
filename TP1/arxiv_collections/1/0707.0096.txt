The phase coherence of an ultrastable optical frequency reference is fully
maintained over actively stabilized fiber networks of lengths exceeding 30 km.
For a 7-km link installed in an urban environment, the transfer instability is
$6 \times 10^{-18}$ at 1-s. The excess phase noise of 0.15 rad, integrated from
8 mHz to 25 MHz, yields a total timing jitter of 0.085 fs. A 32-km link
achieves similar performance. Using frequency combs at each end of the
coherent-transfer fiber link, a heterodyne beat between two independent
ultrastable lasers, separated by 3.5 km and 163 THz, achieves a 1-Hz linewidth.
