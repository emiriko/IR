I consider the monopole condensate of five color QCD. The naive lowest energy
state is unobtainable at one-loop for five or more colors due to simple
geometric considerations. The consequent adjustment of the vacuum condensate
generates a hierarchy of confinement scales in a natural Higgs-free manner. The
accompanying symmetry hierarchy contains hints of standard model phenomenology.
