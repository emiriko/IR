We propose a generalization of the Bjorken in-out Ansatz for fluid
trajectories which, when applied to the (1+1) hydrodynamic equations, generates
a one-parameter family of analytic solutions interpolating between the
boost-invariant Bjorken picture and the non boost-invariant one by Landau. This
parameter characterises the proper-time scale when the fluid velocities
approach the in-out Ansatz. We discuss the resulting rapidity distribution of
entropy for various freeze-out conditions and compare it with the original
Bjorken and Landau results.
