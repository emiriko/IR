Treating the ideal coherent state as a reference state, the effects due to
departure from coherence of an initial wave packet propagating through a
nonlinear medium, were examined, specifically in the context of non-classical
effects such as revivals, fractional revivals, squeezing and higher-order
squeezing during its temporal evolution. Further, these studies were extended
to examine the role of quantum entanglement in bipartite systems. The dynamics
of quantum expectation values were tracked carefully in various cases and the
conditions under which a wave packet spreads chaotically, were investigated.
