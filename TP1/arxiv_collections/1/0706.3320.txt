We present an approach which enables to identify phase synchronization in
coupled chaotic oscillators without having to explicitly measure the phase. We
show that if one defines a typical event in one oscillator and then observes
another one whenever this event occurs, these observations give rise to a
localized set. Our result provides a general and easy way to identify PS, which
can also be used to oscillators that possess multiple time scales. We
illustrate our approach in networks of chemically coupled neurons. We show that
clusters of phase synchronous neurons may emerge before the onset of phase
synchronization in the whole network, producing a suitable environment for
information exchanging. Furthermore, we show the relation between the localized
sets and the amount of information that coupled chaotic oscillator can
exchange.
