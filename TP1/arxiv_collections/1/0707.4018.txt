We present a new multigrid solver that is suitable for the Dirac operator in
the presence of disordered gauge fields. The key behind the success of the
algorithm is an adaptive projection onto the coarse grids that preserves the
near null space. The resulting algorithm has weak dependence on the gauge
coupling and exhibits very little critical slowing down in the chiral limit.
Results are presented for the Wilson Dirac operator of the 2d U(1) Schwinger
model.
