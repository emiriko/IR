The search for signals of new physics at the forthcoming LHC experiments
involves the analysis of final states characterised by a high number of
hadronic jets or identified particles. Precise theoretical predictions for
these processes require the computation of scattering amplitudes with a large
number of external particles and beyond leading order in perturbation theory.
The complexity of a calculation grows with the number of internal loops as well
as with the number of external legs. Automatisation of at least next-to-leading
order calculations for LHC processes is therefore a timely task. I will discuss
various approaches.
