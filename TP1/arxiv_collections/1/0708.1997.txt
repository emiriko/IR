It is argued that recent experiments refuting nonlocal realism, can also be
considered as experiments refuting time-ordered nonlocality and, hence,
confirming the result of the before-before experiment. However, the
before-before experiment provides a broader refutation because it also
falsifies the testable relativistic version of Bohm's nonlocal model. All this
stresses the interest of a new before-before experiment demonstrating together
the failure of time-ordered nonlocality and the violation of the Leggett's
inequality.
