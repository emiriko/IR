The charged particles multiplicity distribution in the KNO form is discussed
in processes of $e^+e^-$ annihilation at energies $\sqrt{s}$ 14 -- 206.2 GeV.
The experimental data are compared to data, obtained with Monte Carlo
simulation in PYTHIA in the Lund quark string model. It is shown, that both
experimental and simulated data are described by the same distribution function
in the KNO form. It is shown, that the KNO scaling is consequence of quark
string hadronization dynamics in the Lund string model.
