We report on recent heavy flavor measurements from the STAR experiment at
RHIC. The measured charm cross section in heavy-ion collisions scales with the
number of binary collisions, which is an indication for exclusive charm
production in the initial state of the collision. The observed strong
suppression of non-photonic electrons at high $\pt$ in Au+Au collisions
together with the azimuthal correlation measurements in p+p collisions imply a
suppression of $B$ production in heavy-ion collisions. We also present recent
measurements of the $\Upsilon$ cross section in p+p collisions.
