We study the dynamics of the electrons in a non-uniform magnetic field
applied perpendicular to a graphene sheet in the low energy limit when the
excitation states can be described by a Dirac type Hamiltonian. We show that as
compared to the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) snake states in graphene
exibit peculiar properties related to the underlying dynamics of the Dirac
fermions. The current carried by snake states is locally uncompensated even if
the Fermi energy lies between the first non-zero energy Landau levels of the
conduction and valence bands. The nature of these states is studied by
calculating the current density distribution. It is shown that besides the
snake states in finite samples surface states also exist.
