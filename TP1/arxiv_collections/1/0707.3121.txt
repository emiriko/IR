To overcome the limitations of the traditional state-averaging approaches in
excited state calculations, where one solves for and represents all states
between the ground state and excited state of interest, we have investigated a
number of new excited state algorithms. Building on the work of van der Vorst
and Sleijpen (SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 17, 401 (1996)), we have implemented
Harmonic Davidson and State-Averaged Harmonic Davidson algorithms within the
context of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). We have assessed
their accuracy and stability of convergence in complete active space DMRG
calculations on the low-lying excited states in the acenes ranging from
naphthalene to pentacene. We find that both algorithms offer increased accuracy
over the traditional State-Averaged Davidson approach, and in particular, the
State-Averaged Harmonic Davidson algorithm offers an optimal combination of
accuracy and stability in convergence.
