The first limit on the branching ratio of the electric charge-nonconserving
invisible muon decay $Br(\mu^+ \to invisible) < 5.2 \times 10^{-3}$ is obtained
from the recently reported results on new determination of the Fermi constant
from muon decays. The results of a feasibility study of a new proposed
experiment for a sensitive search for this decay mode at the level of a few
parts in 10^{11} are presented. Constrains on the $\tau \to invisible$ decay
rate are discussed. These leptonic charge-nonconserving processes may hold in
four-dimensional world in models with infinite extra dimensions, thus making
their searches complementary to collider experiments probing new physics.
