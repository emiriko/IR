For each d>=2, the mapping class group for plane curves of degree d will be
defined and it is proved that there exists uniquely the Meyer function on this
group. In the case of d=4, using our Meyer function, we can define the local
signature for 4-dimensional fiber spaces whose general fibers are
non-hyperelliptic compact Riemann surfaces of genus 3. Some computations of our
local signature will be given.
