If the LHC experiments discover new particles that couple to the Standard
Model fermions, then measurements by ATLAS and CMS can contribute to our
understanding of the flavor puzzles. We demonstrate this statement by
investigating a scenario where extra SU(2)-singlet down-type quarks are within
the LHC reach. By measuring masses, production cross sections and relative
decay rates, minimal flavor violation (MFV) can in principle be excluded.
Conversely, these measurements can probe the way in which MFV applies to the
new degrees of freedom. Many of our conclusions are valid in a much more
general context than this specific extension of the Standard Model.
