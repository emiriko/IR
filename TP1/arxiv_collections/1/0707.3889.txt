We use the mean crossover functions [Garrabos and Bervillier, Phys Rev. E 74,
021113 (2006)] estimated from the bounded results of the Massive
Renormalization scheme applied to the $\Phi_{d}^{4}(n)$ model in three
dimensions ($d=3$) and scalar order parameter ($n=1$) [Bagnuls and Bervillier,
Phys. Rev. E 65, 066132 (2002)], to represent the singular behavior of the
isothermal compressibility of xenon along the critical isochore in the
homogeneous preasymptotic domain. The validity range and the Ising nature of
the crossover description are discussed in terms of a single scale factor whose
value can be analytically estimated beyond the Ising-like preasymptotic domain.
