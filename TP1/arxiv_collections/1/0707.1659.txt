We consider shock probes in a one-dimensional driven diffusive medium with
nearest neighbor Ising interaction (KLS model). Earlier studies based on an
approximate mapping of the present system to an effective zero-range process
concluded that the exponents characterising the decays of several static and
dynamical correlation functions of the probes depend continuously on the
strength of the Ising interaction. On the contrary, our numerical simulations
indicate that over a substantial range of the interaction strength, these
exponents remain constant and their values are the same as in the case of no
interaction (when the medium executes an ASEP). We demonstrate this by
numerical studies of several dynamical correlation functions for two probes and
also for a macroscopic number of probes. Our results are consistent with the
expectation that the short-ranged correlations induced by the Ising interaction
should not affect the large time and large distance properties of the system,
implying that scaling forms remain the same as in the medium with no
interactions present.
