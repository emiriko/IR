We study the effect of unparticle stuff on $B_s - \bar{B}_s$ mixing and
consider possible implications of it for the decaymodes $B_s \to J/\psi \phi$
and $\phi \phi$. We find that due to the new contributions from the unparticles
the $B_s - \bar{B}_s$ mixing phase could be observable at the LHC along with
the possible sizable CP asymmetry parameters $S_{\psi \phi(\phi \phi)}$ in $B_s
\to J/\psi \phi(\phi \phi)$ decay modes.
