In this paper, we model a nonlinear dynamics of infectious diseases transfer.
Particularly, we study possible applications to tubercular infection in models
with different profiles (peak values) of the population density dependence on
spatial coordinates. Our approach is based on the well known method of
instantons which has been used by the authors to describe kinetics of adiabatic
chemical reactions as a function of the heat-bath temperature and other system
parameters. In our approach, we use "social temperature" T as one of the
controlling parameters. Increase of T leads to acceleration of the infectious
diseases transfer. The "blockage" effect for the infectious diseases transfer
has been demonstrated in the case when peak values (in the population density)
are equal to one and under condition that the "social temperature" is low.
Existence of such effect essentially depends from environment "activity"
(social and prophylactic). Results of our modeling qualitatively meet the
tuberculosis dynamic spread data in Penza region of Russia.
