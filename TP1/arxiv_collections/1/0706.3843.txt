Light localization on commensurate arrangements of metallic sub-wavelength
grooves is studied. We theoretically show that as the degree of commensuration
tends to an irrational number new light localization states are produced. These
have properties close to that reported for hot spots on disordered surfaces and
are not permitted for simple period gratings. Some theoretical predictions are
experimentally provided in the infra-red region by reflectivity measurements
performed on two commensurate samples with respectively two and three slits per
period.
