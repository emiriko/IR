The coordinate transformation technique is applied to the design of perfect
lenses and superlenses. In particular, anisotropic metamaterials that magnify
two-dimensional planar images beyond the diffraction limit are designed by the
use of oblate spheroidal coordinates. The oblate spheroidal perfect lens or
superlens can naturally be used in reverse for lithography of planar
subwavelength patterns.
