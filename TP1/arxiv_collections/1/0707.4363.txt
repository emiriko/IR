Heat conduction of a real quasi-one dimensional material, the finite length
carbon nanowire (CNW), inserted into the single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT)
has been studied by the molecular dynamical (MD) method, in which both of the
longitudinal as well as transverse motions of the chain atoms in the SWNT have
been permitted. It is found that the thermal conductivity $\kappa $ of the
carbon nanowire is very high at room temperature, and diverges more likely with
the chain length logarithmically.
