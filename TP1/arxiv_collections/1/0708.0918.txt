We introduce a simple spherical model whose structural properties are similar
to the ones generated by models with directional interactions, by employing a
binary mixture of large and small hard spheres, with a square-well attraction
acting only between particles of different size. The small particles provide
the bonds between the large ones. With a proper choice of the interaction
parameters, as well as of the relative concentration of the two species, it is
possible to control the effective valence. Here we focus on a specific choice
of the parameters which favors tetrahedral ordering and study the equilibrium
static properties of the system in a large window of densities and
temperatures. Upon lowering the temperature we observe a progressive increase
in local order, accompanied by the formation of a four-coordinated network of
bonds. Three different density regions are observed: at low density the system
phase separates into a gas and a liquid phase; at intermediate densities a
network of fully bonded particles develops; at high densities -- due to the
competition between excluded volume and attractive interactions -- the system
forms a defective network. The very same behavior has been previously observed
in numerical studies of non-spherical models for molecular liquids, such as
water, and in models of patchy colloidal particles. Differently from these
models, theoretical treatments devised for spherical potentials, e.g. integral
equations and ideal mode coupling theory for the glass transition can be
applied in the present case, opening the way for a deeper understanding of the
thermodynamic and dynamic behavior of low valence molecules and particles.
