Considering corrections to all orders in the Planck length on the quantum
state density from a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP), we calculate the
statistical entropy of the scalar field on the background of the Schwarzschild
black hole without any cutoff. We obtain the entropy of the massive scalar
field proportional to the horizon area.
