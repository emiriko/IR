We study the dynamics of extended test bodies in flat
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetimes. It is shown that such objects can
usually alter their inertial mass, spin, and center-of-mass trajectory purely
through the use of internal deformations. Many of these effects do not have
Newtonian analogs, and exist despite the presence of conserved momenta
associated with the translational and rotational symmetries of the background.
