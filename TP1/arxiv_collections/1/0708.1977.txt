By using two primary doublets and one induced bidoublet Higgs fields as a
result of the interactions of the two doublets, we evaluate the predictive
power of the left-right symmetry model based on $SU(2)_{L}\otimes
SU(2)_{R}\otimes U(1)$ gauge group to the gauge bosons masses, leptons masses,
and the structure of electroweak interactions. We found that the contribution
of the right charge-current to the electroweak interaction is only around
0.0073 percent. The neutrino mass emerges naturally without introducing exotic
particles. We obtain that the mixing angle $\theta = 45^{0}$ for boson sector,
$\theta \approx 45^{0}$ for neutrino sector, and $\theta = 0^{0}$ for electron
sector. The parity violation in our model could be associated with the mass
mixing in the bosons and leptons masses arise from the induced bidoublet Higgs
via symmetry breaking.
