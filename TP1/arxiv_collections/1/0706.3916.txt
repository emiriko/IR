The kinetic pathways resulting from the formation of coherent L12-ordered
y'-precipitates in the g-matrix (f.c.c.) of Ni-7.5 Al-8.5 Cr at.% and Ni-5.2
Al-14.2 Cr at.% alloys, aged at 873 K, are investigated by atom-probe
tomography (APT) over a range of aging times from 1/6 to 1024 hours; these
alloys have approximately the same volume fraction of the y'-precipitate phase.
Quantification of the phase decomposition within the framework of classical
nucleation theory reveals that the y-matrix solid-solution solute
supersaturations of both alloys provide the chemical driving force, which acts
as the primary determinant of the nucleation behavior. In the coarsening
regime, the temporal evolution of the y'-precipitate average radii and the
y-matrix supersaturations follow the predictions of classical coarsening
models, while the temporal evolution of the y'-precipitate number densities of
both alloys do not. APT results are compared to equilibrium calculations of the
pertinent solvus lines determined by employing both Thermo-Calc and
Grand-Canonical Monte Carlo simulation.
