Following a recent conjecture by Lapan, Simons and Strominger, we revisit and
discuss an intrinsically heterotic class of conformal field theories,
emphasizing their Lagrangian construction as asymmetrically gauged WZW models,
which may be useful in several applications to the study of supersymmetric
strings and black holes in heterotic and type II string theory compactified on
T^6 and K3 X T^2 respectively. In these cases, the leading supergravity
geometry is singular, but higher order corrections remove this singularity in a
way that is consistent with, for example the non-zero entropy for the black
holes that these strings form after wrapping on an additional circle. The
conformal field theories have the right structure to capture the features of
the supergravity analysis, and possess precisely the microscopic target spaces
required. We describe in detail the model with AdS_3 X S^2 geometry, which is
conjectured by Lapan et. al. to represent a fundamental heterotic string in
five dimensions, and then propose conformal field theories which are potential
candidates for the microscopic geometry of heterotic strings in $D$ dimensions,
with target space AdS_3 X S^{D-3}. We also discuss some conformal field
theories that give microscopic AdS target spaces in various dimensions.
