I review theoretical developments of the last year or so in nonperturbative
supersymmetry. Topics: (i) Metastable vacua at strong coupling; (ii)
Non-Abelian flux tubes, confined monopoles; (iii) One step beyond Seiberg's
duality; (iv) Planar equivalence; (v) Multileg/multiloop amplitudes; (vi) N=
(2,0) sigma model on the string worldsheet.
