A quantum version of transition state theory based on a quantum normal form
(QNF) expansion about a saddle-centre-...-centre equilibrium point is
presented. A general algorithm is provided which allows one to explictly
compute QNF to any desired order. This leads to an efficient procedure to
compute quantum reaction rates and the associated Gamov-Siegert resonances. In
the classical limit the QNF reduces to the classical normal form which leads to
the recently developed phase space realisation of Wigner's transition state
theory. It is shown that the phase space structures that govern the classical
reaction d ynamicsform a skeleton for the quantum scattering and resonance
wavefunctions which can also be computed from the QNF. Several examples are
worked out explicitly to illustrate the efficiency of the procedure presented.
