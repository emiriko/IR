We show a natural form of the interaction between unparticle and
supersymmetry. Using the couplings of unparticle to supersymmetry presented, as
examples, we calculate the differential decay rates for the processes ${\it
{\tilde f}}\to {\it f}+{\cal U}_{3/2}$, ${\it {\tilde \chi}}^0\to{\it
\gamma}+{\cal U}_{3/2}$, ${\it {\tilde \chi}}^\pm\to W^\pm+{\cal U}_{3/2}$ and
${\it {\tilde \chi}}^0\to Z^0+{\cal U}_{3/2}$. Finally, we discuss the
phenomenological implication of our results and give some comments.
