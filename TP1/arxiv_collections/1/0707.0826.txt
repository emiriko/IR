We show that the third-order optical response of disordered linear
J-aggregates can be calculated by considering only a limited number of
transitions between (multi-) exciton states. We calculate the pump-probe
absorption spectrum resulting from the truncated set of transitions and show
that, apart from the blue wing of the induced absorption peak, it agrees well
with the exact spectrum.
