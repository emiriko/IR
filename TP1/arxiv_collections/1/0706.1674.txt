We consider the quantum fluctuations of the Casimir-Polder force between a
neutral atom and a perfectly conducting wall in the ground state of the system.
In order to obtain the atom-wall force fluctuation we first define an operator
directly associated to the force experienced by the atom considered as a
polarizable body in an electromagnetic field, and we use a time-averaged force
operator in order to avoid ultraviolet divergences appearing in the fluctuation
of the force. This time-averaged force operator takes into account that any
measurement involves a finite time. We also calculate the Casimir-Polder force
fluctuation for an atom between two conducting walls. Experimental
observability of these Casimir-Polder force fluctuations is also discussed, as
well as the dependence of the relative force fluctuation on the duration of the
measurement.
