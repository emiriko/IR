We present a detailed investigation of the acene series using high-level
wavefunction theory. Our ab-initio Density Matrix Renormalization Group
algorithm has enabled us to carry out Complete Active Space calculations on the
acenes from napthalene to dodecacene correlating the full pi-valence space.
  While we find that the ground-state is a singlet for all chain-lengths,
examination of several measures of radical character, including the natural
orbitals, effective number of unpaired electrons, and various correlation
functions, suggests that the longer acene ground-states are polyradical in
nature.
