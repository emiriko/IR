During the last year many important results have been achieved in heavy
flavour physics: New measurements of charm and beauty production have been
performed at HERA and the Tevatron. A wealth of new spectroscopy data with
several new, unexpected states in the charmonium and the D_s systems has been
collected and b to d gamma transitions have been established. The oscillation
frequency in the B_s Bbar_s is now measured, and mixing in the D0 D0bar system
has been observed. Theoretical progress in the areas of open heavy flavour
production, quarkonium production and decays, and multiquark spectroscopy has
been presented at this workshop.
