Two causes of non-locality inherent in nucleon-nucleus scattering are
considered. They are the results of two-nucleon antisymmetry of the projectile
with each nucleon in the nucleus and the dynamic polarization potential
representation of channel coupling. For energies $\sim 40 - 300$ MeV, a
g-folding model of the optical potential is used to show the influence of the
knock-out process that is a result of the two-nucleon antisymmetry. To explore
the dynamic polarization potential caused by channel coupling, a multichannel
algebraic scattering model has been used for low-energy scattering.
