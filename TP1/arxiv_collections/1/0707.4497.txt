We establish some properties of a within host mathematical model of malaria
proposed by Recker et al which includes the role of the immune system during
the infection. The model accounts for the antigenic variation exhibited by the
malaria parasite (P. falciparum). We show that the model can exhibit a wide
variety of dynamical behaviors. We provide criteria for global stability,
competitive exclusion, and persistence. We also demonstrate that the disease
equilibrium can be destabilized by non-symmetric cross-reactive responses.
