The History of HCI is briefly reviewed together with three HCI models and
structure including CSCW, CSCL and CSCR. It is shown that a number of
authorities consider HCI to be a fragmented discipline with no agreed set of
unifying design principles. An analysis of usability criteria based upon
citation frequency of authors is performed in order to discover the eight most
recognised HCI principles.
