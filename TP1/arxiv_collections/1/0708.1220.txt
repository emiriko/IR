The goal of this paper is to investigate the final stage of black hole
evaporation process in the framework of Lorentz violating Modified Dispersion
Relations(MDRs). As a consequence of MDRs, the high energy sector of the
underlying field theory does not decouple from the low energy sector, the
phenomenon which is known as UV/IR mixing. In the absence of exact
supersymmetry, we derive a modified dispersion relation which shows UV/IR
mixing by a novel energy dependence. Then we investigate the effects of these
type of MDRs on the thermodynamics of a radiating noncommutative Schwarzschild
black hole. The final stage of black hole evaporation obtained in this
framework is compared with existing pictures.
