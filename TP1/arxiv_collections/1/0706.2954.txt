Using a model Hamiltonian for a single-mode electromagnetic field interacting
with a nonlinear medium, we show that quantum expectation values of subsystem
observables can exhibit remarkably diverse ergodic properties even when the
dynamics of the total system is regular. The time series of the mean photon
number is studied over a range of values of the ratio of the strength $\gamma$
of the nonlinearity to that of the inter-mode coupling $g$. We obtain the power
spectrum, estimate the embedding dimension of the reconstructed phase space and
the maximal Liapunov exponent $\lambda_{\rm max}$, and find the recurrence-time
distribution of the coarse-grained dynamics. The dynamical behavior ranges from
quasiperiodicity (for $\gamma/g \ll 1$) to chaos as characterized by
$\lambda_{\rm max} > 0$ (for $\gamma/g \gtrsim 1$), and is interpreted.
