We investigate quantum phase transitions in the extended periodic Anderson
model, which includes electron correlations within and between itinerant and
localized bands. We calculate zero and finite temperature properties of the
system using the combination of dynamical mean-field theory and the numerical
renormalization group. At half filling, a phase transition between a Mott
insulating state and a Kondo insulating state occurs in the strong coupling
regime. We furthermore find that a metallic state is stabilized in the weak
coupling regime. This state should be adiabatically connected to the orbital
selective Mott state with one orbital localized and the other itinerant. The
effect of hole doping is also addressed.
