A fermion-boson-type Composite Model is proposed.
  Elementary fields are only one kind of spin-1/2 and spin-0 {\bf preon}. Both
are in the global supersymmetric pair with the common electric charge of e/6
and belong to the fundamental representations of (3, 2, 2) under the
spontaneously unbroken SU(3)_C\otimes{SU(2)}_L^{h}\otimes{SU(2)}_R^{h} gauge
symmetry (h means hyper-color gauge). Preons are composed into subquarks which
are intermediate clusters towards quarks and leptons. Weak interactions are
residual ones of hyper-color gauge interactions. W-and Z-boson are also
composite objects of subquarks, which introduces the idea of existence of their
scalar partners (S) by hyper-fine-splitting whose masses would be around
110-120 GeV. The mechanism of making higher generations is obtained by adding
neutral scalar subquark (y) composed of a preon-antipreon pair. Creation or
annihilation of y inside quarks induces the coupling constants of flavor-mixing
weak interactions which are all complex numbers (contrary to CKM-matrix
elements) and then they all become sources of direct and mixing-induced CP
violations. Exchange of y between quark and anti-quark inside neutral
pseudo-scalar meson (P^0) gives indirect CP violation and mass-difference of
P^0 and P^0. Current experimental results of CP violation (Belle, BaBar, CLEO,
KTeV and NA48) are inspected by this Composite Model. This model suggests the
candidates for Dark Energy and Dark Matter.
