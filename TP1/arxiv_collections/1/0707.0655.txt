X-ray absorption spectroscopy was used to study the microscopic origin of
conductance and resistive switching in chromium doped strontium titanate
(Cr:SrTiO3). Differences in the x-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES)
at the Cr K-edge indicate that the valence of Cr changes from 3+ to 4+
underneath the anode of our sample device after the application of an electric
field. Spatially resolved x-ray fluorescence microscopy ($\mu$-XRF) maps show
that the Cr4+ region retracts from the anode-Cr:SrTiO3 interface after a
conducting state has been achieved. This interface region is studied with
extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and the results are compared
with structural parameters obtained from density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. They confirm that oxygen vacancies which are localized at the
octahedron with a Cr at its center are introduced at the interface. It is
proposed that the switching state is not due to a valence change of chromium
but caused by changes of oxygen vacancies at the interface.
