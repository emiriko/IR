We present a full experimental characterization of continuous variable
quantum communication channels established by shared entanglement together with
local operations and classical communication. The resulting teleportation
channel was fully characterized by measuring all elements of the covariance
matrix of the shared two-mode squeezed Gaussian state. From the experimental
data we determined the lower bound to the quantum channel capacity, the
teleportation fidelity of coherent states and the logarithmic negativity and
the purity of the shared state. Additionally, a positive secret key rate was
obtained for two of the established channels.
