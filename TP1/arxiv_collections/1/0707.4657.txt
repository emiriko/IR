In our previous arXiv papers ("The Information and the Matter", v1, v5; more
systematically the informational conception is presented in the paper "The
Information as Absolute", 2010) it was rigorously shown that Matter in our
Universe - and Universe as a whole - are some informational systems
(structures), which exist as uninterruptedly transforming [practically]
infinitesimal sub-sets of the absolutely infinite and fundamental set
"Information". Such a conception allows not only to clear essentially a number
of metaphysical and epistemological problems in philosophy but, besides, allows
to suggest a reasonable physical model. Since Matter in Universe is an
informational system where any interaction between Matter's sub-structures,
i.e. - particles and systems of the particles - happens always as an exchange
by exclusively true information between these structures, the model is based on
the conjecture that Matter is some analogue of computer. The conjecture, in
turn, allows to introduce in the model the basic logical elements that
constitute the material structures and support the informational exchange -
i.e. the forces - between the structures. The model is experimentally testable
and yet now makes be more clear a number of basic problems in special
relativity, quantum mechanics, and, rather probably, in [now - in Newtonian]
gravity.
