We present a high-pressure x-ray diffuse scattering study of the ABO$_3$
ferroelectric perovskites BaTiO_3 and KNbO_3. The well-known diffuse lines are
observed in all the phases studied. In KNbO_3, we show that the lines are
present up to 21.8 GPa, with constant width and a slightly decreasing
intensity. At variance, the intensity of the diffuse lines observed in the
cubic phase of BaTiO_3 linearly decreases to zero at $\sim 11$ GPa. These
results are discussed with respect to x-ray absorption measurements, which
leads to the conclusion that the diffuse lines are only observed when the B
atom is off the center of the oxygen tetrahedron. The role of such disorder on
the ferroelectric instability of perovskites is discussed.
