The designs integrating the promising carbon nanotube transistors (CNTFET)
will have to take into account the constraints implied by the strong dispersion
inherent to nanotube manufacturing. This paper proposes to characterize the
main CNTFET performances : on-current Ion, Ion/Ioff ratio and inverse
sub-threshold slope S according to the dispersion on the nanotube diameter. For
this purpose, we use a compact model suitable for testing several diameter
values.
