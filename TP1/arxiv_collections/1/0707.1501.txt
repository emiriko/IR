In this paper we discuss generic properties of "random subgroups" of a given
group G. It turns out that in many groups G (even in most exotic of them) the
random subgroups have a simple algebraic structure and they "sit" inside G in a
very particular way. This gives a strong mathematical foundation for
cryptanalysis of several group-based cryptosystems and indicates on how to
chose "strong keys". To illustrate our technique we analyze the
Anshel-Anshel-Goldfeld (AAG) cryptosystem and give a mathematical explanation
of recent success of some heuristic length-based attacks on it. Furthermore, we
design and analyze a new type of attacks, which we term the quotient attacks.
Mathematical methods we develop here also indicate how one can try to choose
"parameters" in AAG to foil the attacks.
