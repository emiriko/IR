We consider the effect of different unitary noise mechanisms on the evolution
of a quantum walk (QW) on a linear chain with a generic coin operation: (i)
bit-flip channel noise, restricted to the coin subspace of the QW, and (ii)
topological noise caused by randomly broken links in the linear chain.
Similarities and differences in the respective decoherent dynamics of the
walker as a function of the probability per unit time of a decoherent event
taking place are discussed.
