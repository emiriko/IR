Could anthropogenic saturation with pumped seawater of the porous ground of
active sand dune fields in major deserts (e.g., the westernmost Sahara) cause a
beneficial reduction of global sea level? Seawater extraction from the ocean,
and its deposition on deserted sand dune fields in Mauritania and elsewhere via
a Solar-powered Seawater Textile Pipeline (SSTP) can thwart the postulated
future global sea level. Thus, Macro-engineering offers an additional cure for
anticipated coastal change, driven by global sea level rise, that could
supplement, or substitute for (1) stabilizing the shoreline with costly
defensive public works (armoring macroprojects) and (2) permanent retreat from
the existing shoreline (real and capital property abandonment). We propose
Macro-engineering use tactical technologies that sculpt and vegetate barren
near-coast sand dune fields with seawater, seawater that would otherwise, as
commonly postulated, enlarge Earth seascape area! Our Macro-engineering
speculation blends eremology with hydrogeology and some hydromancy. We estimate
its cost at 1 billion dollars - about 0.01 per sent of the USA 2007 Gross
Domestic Product.
