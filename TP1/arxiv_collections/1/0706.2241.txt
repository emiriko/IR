We present a systematic theory of Coulomb-induced correlation effects in the
nonlinear optical processes within the strong-coupling regime. In this paper we
shall set a dynamics controlled truncation scheme \cite{Axt Stahl} microscopic
treatment of nonlinear parametric processes in SMCs including the
electromagnetic field quantization. It represents the starting point for the
microscopic approach to quantum optics experiments in the strong coupling
regime without any assumption on the quantum statistics of electronic
excitations (excitons) involved. We exploit a previous technique, used in the
semiclassical context, which, once applied to four-wave mixing in quantum
wells, allowed to understand a wide range of observed phenomena \cite{Sham
PRL95}. We end up with dynamical equations for exciton and photon operators
which extend the usual semiclassical description of Coulomb interaction
effects, in terms of a mean-field term plus a genuine non-instantaneous
four-particle correlation, to quantum optical effects.
