We study the possibility of using an uniformly coupled finite
antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain as a channel for transmitting
entanglement. One member of a pair of maximally entangled spins is initially
appended to one end of a chain in its ground state and the dynamical
propagation of this entanglement to the other end is calculated. We show that
compared to the analogous scheme with a ferromagnetic chain in its ground
state, here the entanglement is transmitted faster, with less decay, with a
much higher purity and as a narrow pulse form rising non-analytically from
zero. Here non-zero temperatures and depolarizing environments are both found
to be less destructive in comparison to the ferromagnetic case. The
entanglement is found to propagate through the chain in a peculiar fashion
whereby it hops to skip alternate sites.
