We study the TeV scale partial mirage unification scenario, where the gluino
and wino masses are degenerate around a TeV scale, but the bino mass is not
degenerate. This scenario has phenomenologically interesting aspects. First,
because of the degeneracy between the gluino and wino masses, this scenario
does not have the little hierarchy problem, that is, the higgisino mass is
around 150 GeV. The lightest superparticle is a mixture of the bino and
higgsino, and can lead to a right amount of thermal relic density as a dark
matter candidate.
