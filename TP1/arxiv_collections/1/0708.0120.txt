The h index was introduced by Hirsch to quantify an individual's scientific
research output. It has been widely used in different fields to show the
relevance of the research work of prominent scientists. I have worked out 26
practical cases of physicists which are not so prominent. Therefore this case
study should be more relevant to discuss various features of the Hirsch index
which are interesting or disturbing or both for the more average situation. In
particular, I investigate quantitatively some pitfalls in the evaluation and
the influence of self-citations.
