The hypothesis that the causal properties of space-time, as well as other
properties of physical systems like unitarity, charge conservation, etc., might
be decided by the higher dimensional structure (in particular,
higher-dimensional physical laws), rather than by the four-dimensional one, is
explored in order to evade the most awkward problems of higher-dimensional
theories with compact extra time-like dimensions: violation of causality and of
unitarity.
