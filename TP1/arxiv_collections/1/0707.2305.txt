In this paper we describe ideas about the string landscape, and how to relate
it to the physics of the Standard Model of particle physics. First, we give a
short status report about heterotic string compactifications. Then we focus on
the statistics of D-brane models, on the problem of moduli stabilization, and
finally on some attempts to derive a probability wave function in moduli space,
which goes beyond the purely statistical count of string vacua.
