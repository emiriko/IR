The manipulation of locked intrinsic localized modes/discrete breathers is
studied experimentally in nonlinear electric transmission line arrays.
Introducing a static lattice impurity in the form of a capacitor, resistor or
inductor has been used both to seed or destroy and attract or repel these
localized excitations. In a nonlinear di-element array counter propagating
short electrical pulses traveling in the acoustic branch are used to generate a
stationary intrinsic localized mode in the optic branch at any particular
lattice site. By changing the pulse polarity the same localized excitation can
be eliminated demonstrating that the dynamical impurity associated with the
propagating electrical pulse in the acoustic branch can trigger optical
localized mode behavior.
