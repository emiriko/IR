The average charged track multiplicity and the normalised distribution of the
scaled momentum, $\xp$, of charged final state hadrons are measured in
deep-inelastic $\ep$ scattering at high $Q^2$ in the Breit frame of reference.
The analysis covers the range of photon virtuality $100 < Q^2 < 20 000
\GeV^{2}$. Compared with previous results presented by HERA experiments this
analysis has a significantly higher statistical precision and extends the phase
space to higher $Q^{2}$ and to the full range of $\xp$. The results are
compared with $e^+e^-$ annihilation data and with various calculations based on
perturbative QCD using different models of the hadronisation process.
