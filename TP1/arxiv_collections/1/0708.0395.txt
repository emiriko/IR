Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analysis have been carried
out to study the critical behavior and universality for the isotropic-nematic
phase transition in a system of long straight rigid rods of length $k$
($k$-mers) on two-dimensional lattices. The nematic phase, characterized by a
big domain of parallel $k$-mers, is separated from the isotropic state by a
continuous transition occurring at a finite density. The determination of the
critical exponents, along with the behavior of Binder cumulants, indicate that
the transition belongs to the 2D Ising universality class for square lattices
and the three-state Potts universality class for triangular lattices.
