Insulated cantilever probes with a high aspect ratio conducting apex have
been fabricated and their dynamic and electrical properties analyzed. The
cantilevers were coated with silicon dioxide and a via was fabricated through
the oxide at the tip apex and backfilled with tungsten to create an insulated
probe with a conducting tip. The stiffness and Q-factor of the cantilevers
increased after the modifications and their resonances shifted to higher
frequencies. The coupling strength between the cantilever and the coating are
determined. The applications to conductive and electromechanical imaging of
ferroelectric domains are illustrated, and a probe apex repair process is
demonstrated.
