A review of recent experimental results of Dalitz analyses of charmed meson
decays into three-body final states is presented. These analyses can help in
understanding the strong interaction dynamics leading to the observed light
mesons spectrum (low mass scalar $\sigma$, $f_0(980)$, $a_0(980)$). A model for
the decay amplitude into such states is very important for the extraction of
the angle $\gamma$ of the CKM unitarity triangle. Implications for such
measurement are discussed.
