We discuss the issue of phase separation in the SU(2) slave boson theory of
Wen and Lee of the doped Mott insulator. It is shown that the constraint
structure of the theory leads to the interpretation of the holons to have
hard-core interactions, which is demonstrated further by studying the empty
limit (no electrons). Surprisingly, with hard-core interactions even the empty
limit is described well by the slave-boson theory, both as an energy density
and with the regard to dynamical properties. The consequences are investigated
in the overdoped superconducting regime, where both phase separation and a d+s
structure of the order parameter is obtained. This s-wave component is already
imminent in the description of the hole in the slave boson theory. The
interacting nature of the holons also lead to sound modes in the
single-electron propagator. The novel idea of the isospin spiral is introduced,
based on the projective symmetry principles of Wen. This isospin spiral
explains the coexistence of superconductivity and the Mott insulating state,
being the consequence of phase separation. Secondly, it might be able to
explain why nodal fermions survive in the presence of charge inhomogeneities.
