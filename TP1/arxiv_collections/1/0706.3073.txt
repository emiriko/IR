We introduce the tau-function of a rational d-connection and its isomonodromy
transformations. We show that in a continuous limit our tau-function agrees
with the Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno tau-function, compute the tau-function for the
isomonodromy transformations leading to difference Painleve V and difference
Painleve VI equations, and prove that the gap probability for a wide class of
discrete random matrix type models can be viewed as the tau-function for an
associated d-connection.
