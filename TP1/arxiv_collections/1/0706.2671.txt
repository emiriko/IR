We present Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of a generalization of the
Feynman-Kikuchi model which includes the possibility of vacancies and
interactions between the particles undergoing exchange. By measuring the
winding number (superfluid density) and density structure factor, we determine
the phase diagram, and show that it exhibits regions which possess both
superfluid and charge ordering.
