Mixings of 4-quark components in the non-singlet scalar mesons are studied in
the QCD sum rules. We propose a formulation to evaluate the cross correlators
of q\bar q and qq\bar q \bar q operators and to define the mixings of different
Fock states in the sum rule. It is applied to the non-singlet scalar mesons,
a_0 and K_0^\ast. It is found that the 4-quark operators predict lower masses
than the q\bar q operators and that the 4-quark states occupy about 70-90% of
the lowest mass states.
