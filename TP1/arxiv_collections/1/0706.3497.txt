A new effective interaction PKA1 with $\rho$-tensor couplings for the
density-dependent relativistic Hartree-Fock (DDRHF) theory is presented. It is
obtained by fitting selected empirical ground state and shell structure
properties. It provides satisfactory descriptions of nuclear matter and the
ground state properties of finite nuclei at the same quantitative level as
recent DDRHF and RMF models. Significant improvement on the single-particle
spectra is also found due to the inclusion of $\rho$-tensor couplings. As a
result, PKA1 cures a common disease of the existing DDRHF and RMF Lagrangians,
namely the artificial shells at 58 and 92, and recovers the realistic sub-shell
closure at 64. Moreover, the proper spin-orbit splittings and well-conserved
pseudo-spin symmetry are obtained with the new effective interaction PKA1. Due
to the extra binding introduced by the $\rho$-tensor correlations, the balance
between the nuclear attractions and the repulsions is changed and this
constitutes the physical reason for the improvement of the nuclear shell
structure.
