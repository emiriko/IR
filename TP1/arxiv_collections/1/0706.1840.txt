The formation of vortices by topological phase engineering has been realized
experimentally to create the first two- and four-quantum vortices in dilute
atomic Bose-Einstein condensates [A. E. Leanhardt et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 89,
190403 (2002)]. We consider a similar system, but in addition to the
Ioffe-Pritchard magnetic trap we employ an additional hexapole field. By
controlling cyclicly the strengths of these magnetic fields, we show that a
fixed amount of vorticity can be added to the condensate in each cycle. In an
adiabatic operation of this vortex pump, the appearance of vortices into the
condensate is interpreted as the accumulation of a local Berry phase. Our
design can be used as an experimentally realizable vortex source for possible
vortex-based applications of dilute Bose-Einstein condensates.
