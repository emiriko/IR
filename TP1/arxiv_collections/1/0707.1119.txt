We describe a method to execute globally controlled quantum information
processing which admits a fault tolerant quantum error correction scheme. Our
scheme nominally uses three species of addressable two-level systems which are
arranged in a one dimensional array in a specific periodic arrangement. We show
that the scheme possesses a fault tolerant error threshold.
