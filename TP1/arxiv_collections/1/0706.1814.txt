Mexico is one of the most volcanically active regions in North America.
Volcanic activity in central Mexico is associated with the subduction of the
Cocos and Rivera plates beneath the North American plate. Periods of enhanced
microseismic activity, associated with the volcanic activity of the
Popocatepetl volcano is compared with periods, during which the microseismic
activity was low. We detected systematical changes in the number of lineaments,
associated with the microseismic activity due to lineament analysis of a
temporal sequence of high resolution satellite images of the Popocatepetl
volcano, provided by the ASTER/VNIR instrument. The Lineament Extraction and
Stripes Statistic Analysis (LESSA) software package was used for the lineament
extraction. In the future it would allow develop a methodology for detection of
possible elevation of pressure in volcano edifice.
