We calculate the charge current in a metallic ferromagnet to first order in
the time derivative of the magnetization direction. Irrespective of the
microscopic details, the result can be expressed in terms of the conductivities
of the majority and minority electrons and the non-adiabatic spin transfer
torque parameter $\beta$. The general expression is evaluated for the specific
case of a field-driven domain wall and for that case depends strongly on the
ratio of $\beta$ and the Gilbert damping constant. These results may provide an
experimental method to determine this ratio, which plays a crucial role for
current-driven domain-wall motion.
