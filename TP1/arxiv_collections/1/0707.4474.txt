Recent schemes for experimentally probing non-abelian statistics in the
quantum Hall effect are based on geometries where current-carrying
quasiparticles flow along edges that encircle bulk quasiparticles, which are
localized. Here we consider one such scheme, the Fabry-Perot interferometer,
and analyze how its interference patterns are affected by a coupling that
allows tunneling of neutral Majorana fermions between the bulk and edge. While
at weak coupling this tunneling degrades the interference signal, we find that
at strong coupling, the bulk quasiparticle becomes essentially absorbed by the
edge and the intereference signal is fully restored.
