We study the vortex formation in optical lattices submitted to artificial
gauge potentials. We compute the superfluid density for Abelian and non-Abelian
gauge potentials with a mean-field approach of the Bose-Hubbard model and we
determine the rule describing the number of vortices as a function of the
effective magnetic flux. This simple rule is represented by a remarkably rich
figure that represents the superfluid density as a function of the flux. The
phenomena which emanate from this work should be observed experimentally in
optical lattices within which atom tunneling is laser-assisted and described by
commutative or non-commutative tunneling operators.
