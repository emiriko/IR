In this thesis, two different aspects of asymptotically charged rotating
black branes in various dimensions are studied. In the first part, the
thermodynamics of these spacetimes is investigated, while in the second part
the no hair theorem for these spacetimes in four dimensions is considered. In
part I, first, the Euclidean actions of a d-dimensional charged rotating black
brane are computed through the use of the counterterms renormalization method
both in the canonical and the grand-canonical ensemble, and it is shown that
the logarithmic divergencies associated to the Weyl anomalies and matter field
vanish. Second, a Smarr-type formula for the mass as a function of the entropy,
the angular momenta and the electric charge is obtained, which shows that these
quantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. Third, by using the
conserved quantities and the Euclidean actions, the thermodynamics potentials
of the system in terms of the temperature, the angular velocities and the
electric potential are obtained both in the canonical and the grand-canonical
ensemble. Fourth, a stability analysis in these two ensembles is performed,
which shows that the system is thermally stable. This is in commensurable with
the fact that there is no Hawking-Page phase transition for black object with
zero curvature horizon. Finally, the logarithmic correction of the entropy due
to the thermal fluctuation around the equilibrium is calculated. In part II,
the cosmological defects are studied, and it is shown that the Abelian Higgs
field equations in the background of a four-dimensional rotating charged black
string have vortex solutions.
