Degeneracies near the real axis in a complex-extended parameter space of a
hermitian Hamiltonian are studied. We present a method to measure distributions
of such degeneracies on the Riemann sheet of a selected level and apply it in
classification of quantum phase transitions. The degeneracies are shown to
behave similarly as complex zeros of a partition function.
