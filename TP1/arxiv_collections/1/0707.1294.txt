We compare the theoretical frameworks and the phenomenological applications
of the factorization approaches to exclusive $B$ meson decays, which include
QCD-improved factorization, perturbative QCD, and soft-collinear effective
theory. Recent progress on two-body nonleptonic $B$ meson decays made in these
approaches are reviewed.
