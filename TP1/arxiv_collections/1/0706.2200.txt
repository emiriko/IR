We report searches for standard model (SM) Higgs production decaying to WW(*)
and continuum ZZ production in the two charged lepton and two neutrino final
states. The data were collected with the CDF II detector at the Fermilab
Tevatron and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 1.1^fb-1. In order to
separate the processes contributing to the final state, event probabilities
calculated using the leading order differential cross-sections were used to
construct a likelihood ratio discriminant. The observed (median expected) 95%
C.L. upper limit for sigma(H->WW^(*)) with 160 GeV/c^2 mass hypothesis is 1.3
(1.8) pb which corresponds to 3.4 (4.8) times the SM prediction at
next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic level (NNLL) calculation. The significance
of the observed ZZ signal is 1.9 sigma and the 95% C.L. upper limit is 3.4 pb
which is consistent with the next-to-leading order (NLO) calculation of
1.4+/-0.1 pb.
