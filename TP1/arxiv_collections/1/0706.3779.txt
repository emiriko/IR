A number of laws being characteristic for switching waves are illustrated by
the examples of waves of a falling dominoes. The specificity of a switching
wave at the martensite crystal growth caused by dynamic structure of interphase
area is noted. For the first time the influence of finite deformation on the
condition of elastic waves generation by non-equilibrium electrons is
discussed. The rigid regime of initial excitation of waves is connected with
the influence of finite deformations on the threshold value of an inverse
population difference of the electronic states.
