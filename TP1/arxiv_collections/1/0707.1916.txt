We investigate the waveguiding properties of the optical interference pattern
of two counter-propagating Laguerre-Gaussian beams. The number, helicity,
radius, pitch, depth and frequencies of transverse confinement of the
waveguides are simply related to the beam parameters. Quantitative connections
to the familiar Gaussian optical lattice are made and an application to quantum
transport is suggested.
