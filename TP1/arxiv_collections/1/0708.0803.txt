We continue our study of the construction of analytical coefficients of the
epsilon-expansion of hypergeometric functions and their connection with Feynman
diagrams. In this paper, we apply the approach of obtaining iteratated
solutions to the differential equations associated with hypergeometric
functions to prove the following result (Theorem 1): The epsilon-expansion of a
generalized hypergeometric function with integer values of parameters is
expressible in terms of generalized polylogarithms with coefficients that are
ratios of polynomials. The method used in this proof provides an efficient
algorithm for calculatiing of the higher-order coefficients of Laurent
expansion.
