Wakefield oscillations created by the ion wakefield existing below a dust
particle within the plasma sheath generated above a powered lower electrode in
a GEC rf reference cell carry information about the plasma sheath, the dust
particle charge and the speed of the streaming ions. An experimental method to
investigate such wakefield oscillations is discussed.
