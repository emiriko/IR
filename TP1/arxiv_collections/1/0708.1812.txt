This paper considers gauge-invariant and covariant gravitational
perturbations on arbitrary vacuum locally rotationally symmetric (LRS) class II
space-times. Ultimately, we derive four decoupled equations governing four
specific combinations of the gravito-electromagnetic (GEM) 2-tensor harmonic
amplitudes. We use the gauge-invariant and covariant 1+1+2 formalism which
Clarkson and Barrett developed for analysis of vacuum Schwarzschild
perturbations. In particular we focus on the first-order 1+1+2 GEM system and
use linear algebra techniques suitable for exploiting its structure.
Consequently, we express the GEM system new 1+1+2 complex form by choosing new
complex GEM tensors, which is conducive to decoupling. We then show how to
derive a gauge-invariant and covariant decoupled equation governing a newly
defined complex GEM 2-tensor. Finally, the GEM 2-tensor is expanded in terms of
arbitrary tensor harmonics and linear algebra is used once again to decouple
the system further into 4 real decoupled equations.
