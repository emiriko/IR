Using the semi-classical Boltzmann theory, we calculate the conductivity as
function of the carrier density. As usually, we include the scattering from
charged impurities, but conclude that the estimated impurity density is too low
in order to explain the experimentally observed mobilities. We thus propose an
additional scattering mechanism involving midgap states which leads to a
similar k-dependence of the relaxation time as charged impurities. The new
scattering mechanism can account for the experimental findings such as the
sublinear behavior of the conductivity versus gate voltage and the increase of
the minimal conductivity for clean samples. We also discuss temperature
dependent scattering due to acoustic phonons.
