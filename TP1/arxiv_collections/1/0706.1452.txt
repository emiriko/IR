We propose a method to reconstruct the vibrational quantum state of molecules
excited by a general excitation laser pulse. Unlike existing methods, we do not
require the molecules before excitation to be in a pure state, allowing us to
treat the important case of initially thermally excited molecules. Even if only
a single initial level is appreciably populated, initial levels with small
populations can still give major contributions to the unknown vibrational
state, making it essential to take them into account. In addition to the
excitation pulse, the method uses two incident, short laser pulses in a
non-co-linear geometry to create four-wave mixing in the molecules. The
measurements used in the reconstruction are spectra of the outgoing four-wave
mixing pulse at different time delays of the excitation laser pulse. An
important point is that the method does not require detailed knowledge of
molecular transition moments between excited states nor of any of the incoming
laser pulses, but circumvents this requirement by using one or more calibration
laser pulses in a separate experiment either before or after the main data are
recorded. The only requirements for the calibration laser pulses are that the
constant parts of their spectrums should together cover the spectral range of
the excitation laser pulse, and the constant part of each should have
sufficient spectral overlap with one other calibration pulse to populate two of
the same levels. Finally, we discuss the extension of the reconstruction method
in this paper to more general situations, hereby presenting the new idea of
quantum state reconstruction through perturbations with calibration.
