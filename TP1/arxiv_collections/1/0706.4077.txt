A coherent superposition of rotational states in D$_2$ has been excited by
nonresonant ultrafast (12 femtosecond) intense (2 $\times$ 10$^{14}$
Wcm$^{-2}$) 800 nm laser pulses leading to impulsive dynamic alignment.
Field-free evolution of this rotational wavepacket has been mapped to high
temporal resolution by a time-delayed pulse, initiating rapid double
ionization, which is highly sensitive to the angle of orientation of the
molecular axis with respect to the polarization direction, $\theta$. The
detailed fractional revivals of the neutral D$_2$ wavepacket as a function of
$\theta$ and evolution time have been observed and modelled theoretically.
