In recent years, the effects of Lorentz symmetry breaking in cosmology has
attracted considerable amount of attention. In cosmological context several
topics can be affected by Lorentz violation,e.g., inflationary scenario, CMB,
dark energy problem and barryogenesis. In this paper we consider the
cosmological particle creation due to Lorentz violation (LV). We consider an
exactly solvable model for finding the spectral properties of particle creation
in an expanding space-time exhibiting Lorentz violation. In this model we
calculate the spectrum and its variations with respect to the rate and the
amount of space-time expansion.
