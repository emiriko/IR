SCI model gives a good and natural description of DDIS cross-sections.
Howevere, this model is pure phenomenological, and does not explain the nature
of soft color rearrangment. In this paper we argue, that the most capabilities
of SCI model can be derived from low constituent model and overview
applicability of low constituent model to DDIS processes.
