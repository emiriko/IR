The structural, electronic, optical and vibrational properties of the
collapsed (10,10) single-walled carbon nanotube bundle under hydrostatic
pressure have been studied by the first-principles calculations. Some features
are observed in the present study: First, a collapsed structure is found, which
is distinct from both of the herringbone and parallel structures obtained
previously. Secondly, a pseudo-gap induced by the collapse appears along the
symmetry axis \textit{$\Gamma $X}. Thirdly, the relative orientation between
the collapsed tubes has an important effect on their electronic, optical and
vibrational properties, which provides an efficient experimental method to
distinguish unambiguously three different collapsed structures.
