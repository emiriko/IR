In the framework of the Density Functional Theory for superconductors, we
study the restoration of the particle number symmetry by means of the
projection technique. Conceptual problems are outlined and numerical
difficulties are discussed. Both are related to the fact that neither the
many-body Hamiltonian nor the wave function of the system appear explicitly in
the Density Functional Theory. Similar obstacles are encountered in
self-consistent theories utilizing density-dependent effective interactions.
