The Desktop Grid offers solutions to overcome several challenges and to
answer increasingly needs of scientific computing. Its technology consists
mainly in exploiting resources, geographically dispersed, to treat complex
applications needing big power of calculation and/or important storage
capacity. However, as resources number increases, the need for scalability,
self-organisation, dynamic reconfigurations, decentralisation and performance
becomes more and more essential. Since such properties are exhibited by P2P
systems, the convergence of grid computing and P2P computing seems natural. In
this context, this paper evaluates the scalability and performance of P2P tools
for discovering and registering services. Three protocols are used for this
purpose: Bonjour, Avahi and Free-Pastry. We have studied the behaviour of
theses protocols related to two criteria: the elapsed time for registrations
services and the needed time to discover new services. Our aim is to analyse
these results in order to choose the best protocol we can use in order to
create a decentralised middleware for desktop grid.
