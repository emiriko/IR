The general conclusion of Seevinck and Larsson is that our model exploits the
so-called coincidence-time loophole and produces sinusoidal (quantum-like)
correlations but does not model the singlet state because it does not violate
the relevant Bell inequality derived by Larsson and Gill, since in order to
obtain the sinusoidal correlations the probability of coincidences in our model
goes to zero. In this reply, we refute their arguments that lead to this
conclusion and demonstrate that our model can reproduce results of photon and
ion-trap experiments with frequencies of coincidences that are not in conflict
with the observations.
