Measurements at low energies provide interesting indirect information about
masses of particles that are (so far) too heavy to be produced directly.
Motivated by recent progress in consistently and rigorously calculating
electroweak precision observables and flavour related observables, we derive
the preferred value for m_h in the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model (CMSSM), obtained from a fit taking into account electroweak precision
data, flavour physics observables and the abundance of Cold Dark Matter. No
restriction is imposed on m_h itself: the experimental bound from direct Higgs
boson search at LEP is not included in the fit. A multi-parameter chi^2 is
minimized with respect to the free parameters of the CMSSM, M_0, M_1/2, A_0,
tan(beta). A statistical comparison with the Standard Model fit to the
electroweak precision data is made. The preferred value for the lightest Higgs
boson mass in the CMSSM is found to be m_h^CMSSM = 110+8-10(exp.)+-3(theo.)
GeV/c^2, where the first uncertainty is experimental and the second uncertainty
is theoretical. This value is in agreement with the limit from direct Higgs
boson search at LEP.
