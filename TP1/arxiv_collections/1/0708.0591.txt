A Gauss-Bonnet dark energy model is considered, which is inspired in
string/M-theory and takes also into account quantum contributions. Those are
introduced from a conformal quantum anomaly. The corresponding solutions for
the Hubble rate, $H$, are studied starting from the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
equation. It is seen that, as a pure effect of the quantum contributions, a new
solution for $H$ exists in some region, which does not appear in the classical
case. The behavior of all encountered solutions is studied with care, in
particular, the role played by the quantum correction term--which depends on
the number of matter fields--on the stability of the solutions around its
asymptotic value. It is argued that, contrary to what happens in the classical
case, quantum effects remarkably lead to the realization of a de Sitter stage
which corresponds to the inflation/dark energy stages, even for positive values
of the f_0 constant (coupling of the field with the Gauss-Bonnet invariant).
