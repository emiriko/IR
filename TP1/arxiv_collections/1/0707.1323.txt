We provide a review of predictions for sin 2beta_eff in b->s penguin
dominated modes based on 1/m_b expansion and/or SU(3) flavor symmetry. The
experimental results are consistently lower than the theoretical predictions.
In order to interpret whether this effect is a sign of new physics
contributions or can be explained away within the Standard Model a theoretical
input cannot be avoided. The effect survives at a level larger than 2.1 sigma
in a conservative average over different modes that includes theoretical
predictions.
