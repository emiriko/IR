Hard-scattering in p-p collisions was discovered in 1972 at the CERN-ISR, the
first hadron collider. Techniques were developed and several hard-processes
were discovered which form the basis for many of the measurements made in p-p
and Au+Au collisions at RHIC. Recent measurements of hard-scattering and
related reactions by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC are presented in this
context.
