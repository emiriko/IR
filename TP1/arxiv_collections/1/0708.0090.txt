The thermophoretic motion of a charged spherical colloidal particle and its
accompanying cloud of counterions and co-ions in a temperature gradient is
studied theoretically. Using the Debye-Huckel approximation, the Soret drift
velocity of a weakly charged colloid is calculated analytically. For highly
charged colloids, the nonlinear system of electrokinetic equations is solved
numerically, and the effects of high surface potential, dielectrophoresis, and
convection are examined. Our results are in good agreement with some of the
recent experiments on highly charged colloids without using adjustable
parameters.
