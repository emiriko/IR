One of the celebrated results of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) is the
discreteness of the spectrum of geometrical operators such as length, area and
volume operators. This is an indication that Planck scale geometry in LQG is
discontinuous rather than smooth. However, there is no rigorous proof thereof
at present, because the afore mentioned operators are not gauge invariant, they
do not commute with the quantum constraints. The relational formalism in the
incarnation of Rovelli's partial and complete observables provides a possible
mechanism for turning a non gauge invariant operator into a gauge invariant
one. In this paper we investigate whether the spectrum of such a physical, that
is gauge invariant, observable can be predicted from the spectrum of the
corresponding gauge variant observables. We will not do this in full LQG but
rather consider much simpler examples where field theoretical complications are
absent. We find, even in those simpler cases, that kinematical discreteness of
the spectrum does not necessarily survive at the gauge invariant level. Whether
or not this happens depends crucially on how the gauge invariant completion is
performed. This indicates that ``fundamental discreteness at Planck scale in
LQG'' is far from established. To prove it, one must provide the detailed
construction of gauge invariant versions of geometrical operators.
