Earlier, the magnetoelectric effect of chromium sesquioxide Cr_2O_3 has been
determined experimentally as a function of temperature. One measures the
electric field-induced magnetization on Cr_2O_3 crystals or the magnetic
field-induced polarization. From the magnetoelectric moduli of Cr_2O_3 we
extract a 4-dimensional relativistic invariant pseudoscalar
$\widetilde{\alpha}$. It is temperature dependent and of the order of
10^{-4}/Z_0, with Z_0 as vacuum impedance. We show that the new pseudoscalar is
odd under parity transformation and odd under time inversion. Moreover,
$\widetilde{\alpha}$ is for Cr_2O_3 what Tellegen's gyrator is for two port
theory, the axion field for axion electrodynamics, and the PEMC (perfect
electromagnetic conductor) for electrical engineering.
