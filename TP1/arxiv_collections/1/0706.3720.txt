Recent analyses indicate that the amount of atmospheric CO2 required to cause
dangerous climate change is at most 450 ppm, and likely less than that.
Reductions of non-CO2 climate forcings can provide only moderate, albeit
important, adjustments to the CO2 limit. Realization of how close the planet is
to "tipping points" with unacceptable consequences, especially ice sheet
disintegration with sea level rise out of humanity's control, has a bright
side. It implies an imperative: we must find a way to keep the CO2 amount so
low that it will also avert other detrimental effects that had begun to seem
inevitable, e.g., ocean acidification, loss of most alpine glaciers and thus
the water supply for millions of people, and shifting of climatic zones with
consequent extermination of species. Here I outline from a scientific
perspective actions needed to achieve low limits on CO2 and global warming.
These changes are technically feasible and have ancillary benefits. Achievement
of needed changes requires overcoming the spurious argument that developed and
developing countries have equivalent responsibilities, as well as overcoming
special interests advocating minimalist or counterproductive actions such as
corn-based ethanol and liquid-fuel-from-coal programs.
