We report highly efficient single photon generation from InGaAs
self-assembled quantum dots emitting within a two-dimensional photonic bandgap.
A strongly suppressed multiphoton probability is obtained for single quantum
dots in bulk GaAs and those emitting into the photonic bandgap. In the latter
case, photoluminescence saturation spectroscopy is employed to measure a ~17
times enhancement of the average photon extraction efficiency, when compared to
quantum dots in bulk GaAs. For quantum dots in the photonic crystal we measure
directly an external quantum efficiency up to 26%, much higher than for quantum
dots on the same sample without a tailored photonic environment. The results
show that highly efficient quantum dot single photon sources can be realized,
without the need for complex nanopositioning techniques.
