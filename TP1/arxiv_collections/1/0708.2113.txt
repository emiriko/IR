We introduce a new technique to detect separable states using semidefinite
programs. This approach provides a sufficient condition for separability of a
state that is based on the existence of a certain local linear map applied to a
known separable state. When a state is shown to be separable, a proof of this
fact is provided in the form of an explicit convex decomposition of the state
in terms of product states. All states in the interior of the set of separable
states can be detected in this way, except maybe for a set of measure zero.
Even though this technique is more suited for a numerical approach, a new
analytical criterion for separability can also be derived.
