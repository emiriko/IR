We perform a detailed analysis of the SO(10) SUSY GUT model with D3 family
symmetry of Dermisek and Raby (DR). The model is specified in terms of 24
parameters and predicts, as a function of them, the whole MSSM set of
parameters at low energy scales. Concerning the SM subset of such parameters,
the model is able to give a satisfactory description of the quark and lepton
masses, of the PMNS matrix and of the CKM matrix. We perform a global fit to
the model, including flavour changing neutral current (FCNC) processes Bs -->
mu+ mu-, B --> Xs gamma, B --> Xs l+ l- and the B(d,s) - bar B(d,s) mass
differences Delta M(d,s) as well as the flavour changing (FC) process B+ -->
tau+ nu. These observables provide at present the most sensitive probe of the
SUSY mass spectrum and couplings predicted by the model. Our analysis
demonstrates that the simultaneous description of the FC observables in
question represents a serious challenge for the DR model, unless the masses of
the scalars are moved to regions which are problematic from the point of view
of naturalness and probably beyond the reach of the LHC. We emphasize that this
problem could be a general feature of SUSY GUT models with third generation
Yukawa unification and weak-scale minimal flavour violation.
