Functional limit theorem for continuous-time random walks (CTRW) are found in
general case of dependent waiting times and jump sizes that are also position
dependent. The limiting anomalous diffusion is described in terms of fractional
dynamics. Probabilistic interpretation of generalized fractional evolution is
given in terms of the random time change (subordination) by means of hitting
times processes.
