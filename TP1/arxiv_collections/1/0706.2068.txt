The structure of a laminar rich premixed 1,3-C4H6/CH4/O2/Ar flame have been
investigated. 1,3-Butadiene, methane, oxygen and argon mole fractions are
0.033; 0.2073; 0.3315, and 0.4280, respectively, for an equivalent ratio of
1.80. The flame has been stabilized on a burner at a pressure of 6.7 kPa (50
Torr). The concentration profiles of stable species were measured by gas
chromatography after sampling with a quartz probe. Quantified species included
carbon monoxide and dioxide, methane, oxygen, hydrogen, ethane, ethylene,
acetylene, propyne, allene, propene, cyclopropane, 1,3-butadiene, butenes,
1-butyne, vinylacetylene, diacetylene, C5 compounds, benzene, and toluene. The
temperature was measured thanks to a thermocouple in PtRh (6%)-PtRh (30%)
settled inside the enclosure and ranged from 900 K close to the burner up to
2100 K.
