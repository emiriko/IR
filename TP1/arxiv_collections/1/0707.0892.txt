Using series expansions around the dimer limit, we show that the ground state
of the Heisenberg Antiferromagnet on the Kagome Lattice appears to be a Valence
Bond Crystal (VBC) with a 36-site unit cell, and an energy per site of
$E/J=-0.433\pm0.001$. It is a honeycomb lattice of `perfect hexagons' as
discussed by Nikolic and Senthil. The energy difference between the ground
state and other ordered states with the maximum number of `perfect hexagons',
such as a stripe-ordered state, is of order $0.001 J$. The energy of the
36-site system with periodic boundary conditions is further lowered by an
amount of $0.005\pm 0.001 J$, consistent with Exact Diagonalization. Every unit
cell of the VBC has two singlet states whose degeneracy is not lifted to $6th$
order in the expansion. We estimate this energy difference to be smaller than
$0.001 J$. Two leading orders of perturbation theory find the lowest-energy
triplet excitations to be dispersionless and confined to the `perfect
hexagons'.
