This paper presents rigorous forward error bounds for linear conic
optimization problems. The error bounds are formulated in a quite general
framework; the underlying vector spaces are not required to be
finite-dimensional, and the convex cones defining the partial ordering are not
required to be polyhedral. In the case of linear programming, second order cone
programming, and semidefinite programming specialized formulas are deduced
yielding guaranteed accuracy. All computed bounds are completely rigorous
because all rounding errors due to floating point arithmetic are taken into
account. Numerical results, applications and software for linear and
semidefinite programming problems are described.
