In this paper, the different operator forms of classical Yang-Baxter equation
are given in the tensor expression through a unified algebraic method. It is
closely related to left-symmetric algebras which play an important role in many
fields in mathematics and mathematical physics. By studying the relations
between left-symmetric algebras and classical Yang-Baxter equation, we can
construct left-symmetric algebras from certain classical r-matrices and
conversely, there is a natural classical r-matrix constructed from a
left-symmetric algebra which corresponds to a parak\"ahler structure in
geometry. Moreover, the former in a special case gives an algebraic
interpretation of the ``left-symmetry'' as a Lie bracket ``left-twisted'' by a
classical r-matrix.
