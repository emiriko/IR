Motivated by recent experiments, we address, in a fully self consistent
fashion, the behavior and evolution of radio frequency (RF) spectra as
temperature and polarization are varied in population imbalanced Fermi gases.
We discuss a series of scenarios for the experimentally observed zero
temperature pseudogap phase and show how present and future RF experiments may
help in its elucidation. We conclude that the MIT experiments at the lowest $T$
may well reflect ground state properties, but take issue with their claim that
the pairing gap survives up to temperatures of the order of the degeneracy
temperature $T_F$ at unitarity.
