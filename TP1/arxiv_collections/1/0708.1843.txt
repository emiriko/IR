The way of reduction of metal oxyde semiconductor (MOS) structures is going
to reach limitations and new devices have to be explored as an alternative to
MOS technology. Molecular electronic and more particularly
self-assembly-molecular technique on silicon substrate gives interesting
results as seen in the literature. We are going to study n-alkyltrichlorosilane
grafting on oxidised silicon, characterise it macroscopically with ellipsometer
and goniometry measurements, and down to microscopic scale with atomic force
microscopy. Once the uniformity of the monolayer is verified (roughness of few
Angstr\"oms) we have tested a sputtering method deposition to form aluminium
dots onto the surface. Also metal-insulator-semiconductor diodes are tested
measuring both leakage current between gate and substrate and
capacitance-voltage. The sputtering method deposition can be improved in order
to decrease the gate leakage current and we would like to test another
evaporation method. Further application we want to study is gas sensors using
conjugated organic films or synthetic polymers and concerns the drift current
with gas absorption.
