Across all kingdoms of biological life, protein-coding genes exhibit unequal
usage of synonmous codons. Although alternative theories abound, translational
selection has been accepted as an important mechanism that shapes the patterns
of codon usage in prokaryotes and simple eukaryotes. Here we analyze patterns
of codon usage across 74 diverse bacteriophages that infect E. coli, P.
aeruginosa and L. lactis as their primary host. We introduce the concept of a
`genome landscape,' which helps reveal non-trivial, long-range patterns in
codon usage across a genome. We develop a series of randomization tests that
allow us to interrogate the significance of one aspect of codon usage, such a
GC content, while controlling for another aspect, such as adaptation to
host-preferred codons. We find that 33 phage genomes exhibit highly non-random
patterns in their GC3-content, use of host-preferred codons, or both. We show
that the head and tail proteins of these phages exhibit significant bias
towards host-preferred codons, relative to the non-structural phage proteins.
Our results support the hypothesis of translational selection on viral genes
for host-preferred codons, over a broad range of bacteriophages.
