Bose-Einstein condensates subject to short pulses (`kicks') from standing
waves of light represent a nonlinear analogue of the well-known chaos paradigm,
the quantum kicked rotor. Previous studies of the onset of dynamical
instability (ie exponential proliferation of non-condensate particles)
suggested that the transition to instability might be associated with a
transition to chaos. Here we conclude instead that instability is due to
resonant driving of Bogoliubov modes. We investigate the excitation of
Bogoliubov modes for both the quantum kicked rotor (QKR) and a variant, the
double kicked rotor (QKR-2). We present an analytical model, valid in the limit
of weak impulses which correctly gives the scaling properties of the resonances
and yields good agreement with mean-field numerics.
