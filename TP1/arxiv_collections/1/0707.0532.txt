We generalize the generating formula for plane partitions known as MacMahon's
formula as well as its analog for strict plane partitions. We give a
2-parameter generalization of these formulas related to Macdonald's symmetric
functions. The formula is especially simple in the Hall-Littlewood case. We
also give a bijective proof of the analog of MacMahon's formula for strict
plane partitions.
