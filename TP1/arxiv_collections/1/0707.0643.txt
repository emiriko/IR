We proposed a new search heuristic using the scuba diving metaphor. This
approach is based on the concept of evolvability and tends to exploit
neutrality in fitness landscape. Despite the fact that natural evolution does
not directly select for evolvability, the basic idea behind the scuba search
heuristic is to explicitly push the evolvability to increase. The search
process switches between two phases: Conquest-of-the-Waters and
Invasion-of-the-Land. A comparative study of the new algorithm and standard
local search heuristics on the NKq-landscapes has shown advantage and limit of
the scuba search. To enlighten qualitative differences between neutral search
processes, the space is changed into a connected graph to visualize the
pathways that the search is likely to follow.
