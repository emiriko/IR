We show that a conjecture of Einsiedler, Kapranov, and Lind on adelic amoebas
of subvarieties of tori and their intersections with open halfspaces of
complementary dimension is false for subvarieties of codimension greater than
one that have degenerate projections to smaller dimensional tori. We prove a
suitably modified version of the conjecture using algebraic methods,
functoriality of tropicalization, and a theorem of Zhang on torsion points in
subvarieties of tori.
