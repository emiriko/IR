The characteristic and selective nature of the electro-magnetic production of
Lambda-hypernuclei in exciting states is demonstrated assuming the medium-mass
targets 28Si, 40Ca, and 52Cr. Formalism of DWIA is used adopting the
Saclay-Lyon, Kaon-MAID, Adelseck-Saghai, and Williams-Ji-Cotanch models for the
elementary amplitudes and various nuclear and hypernuclear wave functions. The
elementary amplitudes are discussed in detail presenting their basic properties
and comparison with data. The unique features of the electro-magnetic
production of Lambda-hypernuclei shown on examples are the slective excitation
of unnatural parity highest-spin states (natural parity ones for the LS-closed
targets) and a possibilty to investigate the Lambda single-particle energies
including a spin-orbit splitting using variety of medium-mass targets.
