We discuss the lightest scalar resonances, $f_0(600)$, $\kappa(800)$,
$a_0(980)$ and $f_0(980)$ in the extended Nambu Jona-Lasinio model. We find
that the model parameters can be tuned, but unnaturally, to accommodate for
those scalars except the $f_0(980)$. We also discuss problems encountered in
the K Matrix unitarization approximation by using $N_c$ counting technique.
