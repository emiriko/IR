We study the effect of the magnetic field (Zeeman splitting) on the triplet
pairing. We show generally that the enhancement of spin triplet pairing
mediated by coexisting $2k_F$ spin and $2k_F$ charge fluctuations can be much
larger than in the case of triplet pairing mediated by ferromagnetic spin
fluctuations. We propose that this may be related to the recent experiment for
(TMTSF)$_2$ClO$_4$, in which a possibility of singlet to triplet pairing
transition has been suggested.
