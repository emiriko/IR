The magnetic and electrical transport properties of Mn-doped amorphous
silicon (\textit{a-}Mn$_{x}$Si$_{1-x}$) thin films have been measured. The
magnetic susceptibility obeys the Curie-Weiss law for a wide range of $x$
(0.005-0.175) and the saturation moment is small. While all Mn atoms contribute
to the electrical transport, only a small fraction (interstitial Mn$^{2+}$
states with $J$=$S$=5/2) contribute to the magnetization. The majority of the
Mn atoms do not possess any magnetic moment, contrary to what is predicted by
the Ludwig-Woodbury model for Mn in crystalline silicon. Unlike
\textit{a-}Gd$_{x}$Si$_{1-x}$ films which have an enormous \textit{negative}
magnetoresistance, \textit{a-}Mn$_{x}$Si$_{1-x}$ films have only a small
\textit{positive} magnetoresistance, which can be understood by this quenching
of the Mn moment.
