Starting from Plebanski formulation of gravity as a constrained BF theory we
propose a new spin foam model for 4d Riemannian quantum gravity that
generalises the well-known Barrett-Crane model and resolves the inherent to it
ultra-locality problem. The BF formulation of 4d gravity possesses two sectors:
gravitational and topological ones. The model presented here is shown to give a
quantization of the gravitational sector, and is dual to the recently proposed
spin foam model of Engle et al. which, we show, corresponds to the topological
sector. Our methods allow us to introduce the Immirzi parameter into the
framework of spin foam quantisation. We generalize some of our considerations
to the Lorentzian setting and obtain a new spin foam model in that context as
well.
