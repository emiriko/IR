The contribution of the sub-process $\gamma q \to q' l_1\bar{l}_2$ in
hadron-hadron interactions is considered. It is a part of one-loop electroweak
radiative corrections for the Drell-Yan production of lepton pairs at hadron
colliders. It is shown that this contribution should be taken into account
aiming at the 1% accuracy of the Drell-Yan process theoretical description.
Both the neutral and charged current cases are evaluated. Numerical results are
presented for typical conditions of LHC experiments.
