We prove new theorems about properties of generalized functions defined on
Gelfand-Shilov spaces $S^\beta$ with $0\le\beta<1$. For each open cone
$U\subset\mathbb R^d$ we define a space $S^\beta(U)$ which is related to
$S^\beta(\mathbb R^d)$ and consists of entire analytic functions rapidly
decreasing inside U and having order of growth $\le 1/(1-\beta)$ outside the
cone. Such sheaves of spaces arise naturally in nonlocal quantum field theory,
and this motivates our investigation. We prove that the spaces $S^\beta(U)$ are
complete and nuclear and establish a decomposition theorem which implies that
every continuous functional defined on $S^\beta(\mathbb R^d)$ has a unique
minimal closed carrier cone in $\mathbb R^d$. We also prove kernel theorems for
spaces over open and closed cones and elucidate the relation between the
carrier cones of multilinear forms and those of the generalized functions
determined by these forms.
