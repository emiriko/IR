Interacting Growth Walks is a recently proposed stochastic model for studying
the coil-globule transition of linear polymers. We propose a flat energy
histogram version for Interacting Growth Walk. We demonstrate the algorithm on
two dimensional square and triangular lattices by calculating the density of
energy states of Interacting Self Avoiding Walks.
