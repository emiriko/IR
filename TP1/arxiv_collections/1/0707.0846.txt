We consider an array of coupled optical cavities, each containing a
multi-atom ensemble. We show that the nonlinearity inherent in the cooperative
dynamics of the atoms in each ensemble coupled to the respective cavity field
allows for the formation of solitary waves. Such a prediction can be tested in
state-of-the-art semiconducting photonic-crystal microcavities with embedded
impurities.
