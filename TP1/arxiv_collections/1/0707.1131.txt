We systematically investigate the universal spin decoherence dynamics of a
localized electron in an arbitrary nuclear spin bath, which can be even far
away from equilibrium due to the weak nuclear-lattice interaction. We show that
the electron spin relaxation dynamics (as well as spin pure dephasing and Hahn
echo decay) can {\it always} have a universal behavior as long as the initial
state is composed of a sufficiently large amount of spin eigenstates. For a
given system, the pattern of the universal dynamics depends on the complicated
initial condition only via a {\it single} parameter, which measures the amount
of phase coherence between different spin eigenstates in the initial state. Our
results apply even when the number of the involved nuclei is not large, and
therefore provide a solid foundation in the comparison of theoretical/numerical
results with the experimental measurement. As an example, we also show
numerical results for systems of noninteracting spin bath in zero magnetic
field regime, and discuss the features of universal decoherent dynamics.
