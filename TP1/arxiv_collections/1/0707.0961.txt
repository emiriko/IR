An analysis of radiating perfect fluid models with asymptotically AdS
boundary conditions is presented. Such scenarios consist of a spherical gas of
radiation (a "star") localised near the centre of the spacetime due to the
confining nature of the AdS potential. We consider the variation of the total
mass of the star as a function of the central density, and observe that for
large enough dimensionality, the mass increases monotonically with the density.
However in the lower dimensional cases, oscillations appear, indicating that
the perfect fluid model of the star is becoming unrealistic. We find the
critical dimension separating these two regimes to be eleven.
