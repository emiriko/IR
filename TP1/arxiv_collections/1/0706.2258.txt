In this chapter we review our findings on the bonding structure and growth
mechanisms of carbon-based thin solid films with fullerene-like (FL)
microstructure. The so-called FL arrangements arise from the curvature and
cross-linking of basal planes in graphitic-like structures, partially
resembling that of molecular fullerenes. This three-dimensional superstructure
takes advantage of the strength of planar pi bonds in sp2 hybrids and confers
the material interesting mechanical properties, such as high hardness, high
elastic recovery, low-friction and wear-resistance. These properties can be
tailored by controlling the curvature, size and connectivity of the FL
arrangements, making these materials promising coatings for tribological
applications. We have focused our interest mostly on carbon nitride (CNx) since
nitrogen promotes the formation of FL arrangements at low substrate
temperatures and they are emerging over pure carbon coatings in tribological
applications such as protective overcoats in magnetic hard disks. We address
structural issues such as origin of plane curvature, nature of the
cross-linking sites and sp2 clustering, together with growth mechanisms based
on the role of film-forming precursors, chemical re-sputtering or concurrent
ion assistance during growth.
