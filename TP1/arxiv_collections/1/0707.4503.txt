In response to a sound stimulus, the inner ear emits sounds called
otoacoustic emissions. While the exact mechanism for the production of
otoacoustic emissions is not known, active motion of individual hair cells is
thought to play a role. Two possible sources for otoacoustic emissions, both
localized within individual hair cells, include somatic motility and hair
bundle motility. Because physiological models of each of these systems are
thought to be poised near a Hopf bifurcation, the dynamics of each can be
described by the normal form for a system near a Hopf bifurcation. Here we
demonstrate that experimental results from three-frequency suppression
experiments can be predicted based on the response of an array of
noninteracting Hopf oscillators tuned at different frequencies. This supports
the idea that active motion of individual hair cells contributes to active
processing of sounds in the ear. Interestingly, the model suggests an
explanation for differing results recorded in mammals and nonmammals.
