The nature of the scientific method is controversial with claims that a
single scientific method does not even exist. However the scientific method
does exist. It is the building of logical and self consistent models to
describe nature. The models are constrained by past observations and judged by
their ability to correctly predict new observations and interesting phenomena.
The observations exist independent of the models but acquire meaning from their
context within a model. Observations must be carefully done and reproducible to
minimize errors. Models assumptions that do not lead to testable predictions
are rejected as unnecessary.
