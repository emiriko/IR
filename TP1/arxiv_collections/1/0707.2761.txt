The information accessible from a muon-spin relaxation experiment is often
limited since we lack knowledge of the precise muon stopping site. We
demonstrate here the possibility of localizing a spin polarized muon in a known
stopping state in a molecular material containing fluorine. The muon-spin
precession that results from the entangled nature of the muon-spin and
surrounding nuclear spins is sensitive to the nature of the stopping site and
we use this property to identify three classes of site. We are also able to
describe the extent to which the muon distorts its surroundings.
