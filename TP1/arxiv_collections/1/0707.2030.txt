In the framework of effective field theory we show that, at two-loop order,
the mass and width of the \Delta resonance defined via the (relativistic)
Breit-Wigner parametrization both depend on the choice of field variables. In
contrast, the complex-valued position of the pole of the propagator is
independent of this choice.
