Magnetic and transport properties of Ti substituted
La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$ are drastically affected with a change in
preparation conditions. Low temperature infra-red absorption measurements
reveal that this is perhaps due to inhomogeniety in substitution of Ti$^{4+}$
on Mn sites. It is found that, in the high temperature annealed samples, the
substitution of Ti supresses the double exchange interaction due to the
formation of Mn$^{3+}$-O-Ti$^{4+}$ chains. While in the low temperature
annealed case substitution of Ti causes formation of isolated ferromagnetic
clusters linked to each other by a variable range hopping polaron.
