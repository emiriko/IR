We present the results of non-linear tunnelling spectroscopy between an array
of independent quantum wires and an adjacent two-dimensional electron gas
(2DEG) in a double-quantum-well structure. The two layers are separately
contacted using a surface-gate scheme, and the wires are all very regular, with
dimensions chosen carefully so that there is minimal modulation of the 2DEG by
the gates defining the wires. We have mapped the dispersion spectrum of the 1D
wires down to the depletion of the last 1D subband by measuring the conductance
\emph{G} as a function of the in-plane magnetic field \emph{B}, the interlayer
bias $V_{\rm dc}$ and the wire gate voltage. There is a strong suppression of
tunnelling at zero bias, with temperature and dc-bias dependences consistent
with power laws, as expected for a Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquid caused by
electron-electron interactions in the wires. In addition, the current peaks fit
the free-electron model quite well, but with just one 1D subband there is extra
structure that may indicate interactions.
