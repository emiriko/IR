One of the simplified solutions of the Dirac equations with the pure Coulomb
potential given in a paper published in 1985 is pseudo. The original paper
solved the Dirac equations by introducing a transformation of functions with
two strange parameters a and b to transform the original system of the
first-order differential equations into two uncoupled differential equations of
second order. However, not only the given eigenvalues sets violate the
uniqueness of solution but also the said second-order equations are not any
necessarily mathematical deduction. In order to determine the introduced
parameters, formally, the author actually introduced some self-contradictory
mathematical formulas, such as sinh(theta)=2ab, cosh(theta)=a^2+b^2,
tanh(theta)=-Z(alpha)/k, a^2-b^2=1, b=sinh((theta/2), a=cosh((theta/2). But one
has not known the value of the parameters a and b all the while, whereas the
parameters were insensibly deleted in the given second-order Dirac-Coulomb
equation last. One cannot recover any result given in the paper by making
corresponding correctly mathematical calculations.
