Iron, cobalt and nickel nanoparticles, grown in the gas phase, are known to
arrange in chains and bracelet-like rings due to the long-range dipolar
interaction between the ferromagnetic (or super-paramagnetic) particles. We
investigate the dynamics and thermodynamics of such magnetic dipolar
nanoparticles for low densities using molecular dynamics simulations and
analyze the influence of temperature and external magnetic fields on two- and
three-dimensional systems. The obtained phase diagrams can be understood by
using simple energetic arguments.
