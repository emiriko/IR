Spin noise sets fundamental limits to the precision of measurements using
spin-polarized atomic vapors, such as performed with sensitive atomic
magnetometers. Spin squeezing offers the possibility to extend the measurement
precision beyond the standard quantum limit of uncorrelated atoms. Contrary to
the current understanding, we show that even in the presence of spin
relaxation, spin squeezing can lead to a significant reduction of spin noise,
and hence an increase in magnetometric sensitivity, for a long measurement
time. This is the case when correlated spin relaxation due to binary
alkali-atom collisions dominates independently acting decoherence processes.
