It is known that evaluating a certain approximation to the Jones polynomial
for the plat closure of a braid is a BQP-complete problem. That is, this
problem exactly captures the power of the quantum circuit model. The one clean
qubit model is a model of quantum computation in which all but one qubit starts
in the maximally mixed state. One clean qubit computers are believed to be
strictly weaker than standard quantum computers, but still capable of solving
some classically intractable problems. Here we show that evaluating a certain
approximation to the Jones polynomial at a fifth root of unity for the trace
closure of a braid is a complete problem for the one clean qubit complexity
class. That is, a one clean qubit computer can approximate these Jones
polynomials in time polynomial in both the number of strands and number of
crossings, and the problem of simulating a one clean qubit computer is
reducible to approximating the Jones polynomial of the trace closure of a
braid.
