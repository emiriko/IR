IIn 2006 the PVLAS collaboration reported the observation of an optical
rotation generated in vacuum by a magnetic field. To further check against
possible instrumental artifacts several upgrades to the PVLAS apparatus have
been made during the last year. Two data taking runs, at the wavelength of 1064
nm, have been performed in the new configuration with magnetic field strengths
of 2.3 T and 5 T. The 2.3 T field value was chosen in order to avoid stray
fields. The new observations do not show the presence of a rotation signal down
to the levels of $1.2\cdot 10^{-8}$ rad at 5 T and $1.0\cdot 10^{-8}$ rad at
2.3 T (at 95% c.l.) with 45000 passes in the magnetic field zone. In the same
conditions no ellipticity signal was detected down to $1.4\cdot 10^{-8}$ at 2.3
T (at 95% c.l.), whereas at 5 T a signal is still present. The physical nature
of this ellipticity as due to an effect depending on $B^2$ can be excluded by
the measurement at 2.3 T. These new results completely exclude the previously
published magnetically induced vacuum dichroism results, indicating that they
were instrumental artifacts. These new results therefore also exclude the
particle interpretation of the previous PVLAS results as due to a spin zero
boson. The background ellipticity at 2.3 T can be used to determine a new limit
on the total photon-photon scattering cross section of $\sigma_{\gamma\gamma} <
4.5 \cdot10^{-34}$ barn at 95% c.l..
