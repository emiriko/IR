In this paper, we develop a structure-preserving discretization of the
Lagrangian framework for electromagnetism, combining techniques from
variational integrators and discrete differential forms. This leads to a
general family of variational, multisymplectic numerical methods for solving
Maxwell's equations that automatically preserve key symmetries and invariants.
  In doing so, we demonstrate several new results, which apply both to some
well-established numerical methods and to new methods introduced here. First,
we show that Yee's finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) scheme, along with a
number of related methods, are multisymplectic and derive from a discrete
Lagrangian variational principle. Second, we generalize the Yee scheme to
unstructured meshes, not just in space but in 4-dimensional spacetime. This
relaxes the need to take uniform time steps, or even to have a preferred time
coordinate at all. Finally, as an example of the type of methods that can be
developed within this general framework, we introduce a new asynchronous
variational integrator (AVI) for solving Maxwell's equations. These results are
illustrated with some prototype simulations that show excellent energy and
conservation behavior and lack of spurious modes, even for an irregular mesh
with asynchronous time stepping.
