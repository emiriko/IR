We present results for a lattice model of bio-polymers where the type of
$\beta$-sheet formation can be controlled by different types of hydrogen bonds
depending on the relative orientation of close segments of the polymer. Tuning
these different interaction strengths leads to low-temperature structures with
different types of orientational order. We perform simulations of this model
and so present the phase diagram, ascertaining the nature of the phases and the
order of the transitions between these phases.
