The future e-e+ 500 GeV International Linear Collider will rely on
unprecedented nanometer scale particle beam size at the interaction point, in
order to achieve the design luminosity. Tight tolerances on static and dynamic
alignment of the accelerator cavities and optical components are demanded to
transport and focus the high energy electron and positron beams with reasonable
position jitter and low emittance. A brief review of techniques and devices
evaluated and developed so far for the vibration diagnostics of the machine is
presented in this paper.
