We calculate quarkonium spectral functions in a quark-gluon plasma using a
potential model based on full QCD lattice calculations of the free energy of
static quark-antiquark pair. We estimate the binding energy and the thermal
width of different quarkonium states. The estimated upper limit for the
dissociation temperatures is considerably lower than the ones suggested in the
recent literature.
