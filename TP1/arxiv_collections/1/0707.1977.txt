We present a computer simulation, which is inspired by Penna model, to help
understanding the effect of genetic coding tables on population dynamics. To
represent populations we used real and artificial gene sequences in this model.
We coded these sequences using different amino acid tables in Nature, the
standard table as well as the tables which are used by mithocondria and some
eukaryotes. Contrary to common belief we find that the standard code table
which is used in most organisms in Nature, does not give the most resilient
coding against point mutations.
