A generalized version of Chernoff's theorem has been obtained. Namely, the
version of Chernoff's theorem for semigroups obtained in a paper by Smolyanov,
Weizsaecker, and Wittich is generalized for a time-inhomogeneous case. The main
theorem obtained in the current paper, Chernoff's theorem for evolution
families, deals with a family of time-dependent generators of semigroups $A_t$
on a Banach space, a two-parameter family of operators $Q_{t,t+\Delta t}$
satisfying the relation: $\frac{\partial}{\partial \Delta t}Q_{t,t+\Delta
t}|_{\Delta t = 0}=A_t$, whose products $Q_{t_i,t_{i+1}}... Q_{t_{k-1},t_k}$
are uniformly bounded for all subpartitions $s = t_0 < t_1 < >... < t_n = t$.
The theorem states that $Q_{t_0,t_1}... Q_{t_{n-1},t_n}$ converges to an
evolution family $U(s,t)$ solving a non-autonomous Cauchy problem. Furthermore,
the theorem is formulated for a particular case when the generators $A_t$ are
time dependent second order differential operators. Finally, an example of
application of this theorem to a construction of time-inhomogeneous diffusions
on a compact Riemannian manifold is given.
