We show that the Lorentz shear modulus -- one of the three elastic moduli of
a homogeneous electron gas in a magnetic field -- can be calculated exactly in
the limit of high magnetic field (i.e. in the lowest Landau level). Its value
is $\pm \hbar n/4$, where $n$ is the two-dimensional electron density and the
sign is determined by the orientation of the magnetic field. We use this result
to refine our previous calculations of the dispersion of the collective modes
of fractional quantum Hall liquids.
