We analyze the prospect of measuring the neutron form factor of a nucleus
through the detection of neutrino-nucleus coherent elastic scattering. We
predict numbers of events in a liquid noble nuclear recoil detector at a
stopped pion neutrino source. We discuss the precision required to distinguish
between different theoretical models for the form factor.
