We investigate the multiphoton ionization of hydrogen driven by a strong
bichromatic microwave field. In a regime where classical and quantum
simulations agree, periodic orbit analysis captures the mechanism: Through the
linear stability of periodic orbits we match qualitatively the variation of
experimental ionization rates with control parameters such as the amplitudes of
the two modes of the field or their relative phases. Moreover, we discuss an
empirical formula which reproduces quantum simulations to a high degree of
accuracy. This quantitative agreement shows the mechanism by which short
periodic orbits organize the dynamics in multiphoton ionization. We also
analyze the effect of longer pulse durations. Finally we compare our results
with those based on the peak amplitude rule. Both qualitative and quantitative
analyses are implemented for different mode locked fields. In parameter space,
the localization of the period doubling and halving allows one to predict the
set of parameters (amplitudes and phase lag) where ionization occurs.
