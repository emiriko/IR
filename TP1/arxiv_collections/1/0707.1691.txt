In this overview of the MACRO experiment we recall the structure of the
detector and discuss several physics topics: atmospheric neutrinos and neutrino
oscillations, high energy neutrino astronomy, searches for WIMPs and for low
energy stellar gravitational collapse neutrinos, stringent upper limits on GUT
magnetic monopoles, high energy downgoing muons, primary cosmic ray composition
and shadowing of primary cosmic rays by the Moon and the Sun.
