Inclusive jet production is studied in neutral current deep-inelastic
positron-proton scattering at large four momentum transfer squared Q^2>150
GeV^2 with the H1 detector at HERA. Single and double differential inclusive
jet cross sections are measured as a function of Q^2 and of the transverse
energy E_T of the jets in the Breit frame. The measurements are found to be
well described by calculations at next-to-leading order in perturbative QCD.
The running of the strong coupling is demonstrated and the value of
alpha_s(M_Z) is determined. The ratio of the inclusive jet cross section to the
inclusive neutral current cross section is also measured and used to extract a
precise value for
alpha_s(M_Z)=0.1193+/-0.0014(exp.)^{+0.0047}_{-0.0030}(th.)+/-0.0016(pdf).
