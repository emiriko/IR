For cylindrically symmetric functions dyadically supported on the paraboloid,
we obtain a family of sharp linear and bilinear adjoint restriction estimates.
As corollaries, we first extend the ranges of exponents for the classical
\textit{linear or bilinear adjoint restriction conjectures} for such functions
and verify the \textit{linear adjoint restriction conjecture} for the
paraboloid. We also interpret the restriction estimates in terms of solutions
to the Schr\"odinger equation and establish the analogous results when the
paraboloid is replaced by the lower third of the sphere.
