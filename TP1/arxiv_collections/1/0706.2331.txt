We approximate the price of the American put for jump diffusions by a
sequence of functions, which are computed iteratively. This sequence converges
to the price function uniformly and exponentially fast. Each element of the
approximating sequence solves an optimal stopping problem for geometric
Brownian motion, and can be numerically computed using the classical finite
difference methods. We prove the convergence of this numerical scheme and
present examples to illustrate its performance.
