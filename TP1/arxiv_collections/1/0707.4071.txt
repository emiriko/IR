We study the formation of a colloidal gel by means of Molecular Dynamics
simulations of a model for colloidal suspensions. A slowing down with gel-like
features is observed at low temperatures and low volume fractions, due to the
formation of persistent structures. We show that at low volume fraction the
dynamic susceptibility, which describes dynamic heterogeneities, exhibits a
large plateau, dominated by clusters of long living bonds. At higher volume
fraction, where the effect of the crowding of the particles starts to be
present, it crosses over towards a regime characterized by a peak. We introduce
a suitable mean cluster size of clusters of monomers connected by "persistent"
bonds which well describes the dynamic susceptibility.
