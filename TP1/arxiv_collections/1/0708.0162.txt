By means of the 10-resonance unitary and analytic model of nucleon
electromagnetic structure it is demonstrated that the JLab proton polarization
data on the ratio $\mu_p G_{Ep}(Q^2)/G_{Mp}(Q^2)$ are consistent with all form
factor properties, however, they strongly require an existence of the zero in
G_{Ep}(Q^2) around Q^2=13 GeV^2. As a result there are two contradicting
behaviors of G_{Ep}(Q^2) in space-like region. Consequences of this phenomenon
on the charge distribution within the proton, on the saturation of the new
proton-neutron q^2-dependent sum rule, on the behavior of strange nucleon form
factors and the deuteron elastic structure functions through the impulse
approximation are investigated.
