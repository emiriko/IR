In our previous arXiv papers (more systematically the informational
conception is presented in the paper "The Information as Absolute", 2010) it
was rigorously shown that Matter in our Universe - and Universe as a whole -
are some informational systems (structures), which exist as uninterruptedly
transforming [practically] infinitesimal sub-sets in the absolutely infinite
and fundamental set "Information". Such a conception allows to suggest a
reasonable physical model that is based on the conjecture that Matter is some
analogue of computer (more correct - of a [huge] number of mutually
comparatively independent automata). The conjecture, in turn, allows
introducing in the model the basic logical elements that constitute the
material structures and support the informational exchange - i.e. the forces -
between the structures. The model yet now makes more clear a number of basic
problems in special relativity, quantum mechanics, and, rather probably, in
[now - in Newtonian] gravity. In this paper some possible experiments for the
model testing are considered.
