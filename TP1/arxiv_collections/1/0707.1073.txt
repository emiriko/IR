Transport and mixing properties of passive particles advected by an array of
vortices are investigated. Starting from the integrable case, it is shown that
a special class of perturbations allows one to preserve separatrices which act
as effective transport barriers, while triggering chaotic advection. In this
setting, mixing within the two dynamical barriers is enhanced while long range
transport is prevented. A numerical analysis of mixing properties depending on
parameter values is performed; regions for which optimal mixing is achieved are
proposed. Robustness of the targeted mixing properties regarding errors in the
applied perturbation are considered, as well as slip/no-slip boundary
conditions for the flow.
