We show that the emergent relativistic symmetry of electrons in graphene near
its quantum critical point (QCP) implies a crucial importance of the Coulomb
interaction. We derive scaling laws, valid near the QCP, that dictate the
nontrivial magnetic and charge response of interacting graphene. Our analysis
yields numerous predictions for how the Coulomb interaction will be manifested
in experimental observables such as the diamagnetic response and electronic
compressibility.
