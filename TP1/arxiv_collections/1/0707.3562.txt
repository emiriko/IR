The animation of human avatars seems very successful; the computer graphics
industry shows outstanding results in films everyday, the game industry
achieves exploits... Nevertheless, the animation and control processes of such
manikins are very painful. It takes days to a specialist to build such animated
sequences, and it is not adaptive to any type of modifications. Our main
purpose is the virtual human for engineering, especially virtual prototyping.
As for this domain of activity, such amounts of time are prohibitive.
