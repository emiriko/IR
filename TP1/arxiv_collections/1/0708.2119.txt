A quantum control landscape is defined as the observable as a function(al) of
the system control variables. Such landscapes were introduced to provide a
basis to understand the increasing number of successful experiments controlling
quantum dynamics phenomena. This paper extends the concept to encompass the
broader context of the environment having an influence. For the case that the
open system dynamics are fully controllable, it is shown that the control
landscape for open systems can be lifted to the analysis of an equivalent
auxiliary landscape of a closed composite system that contains the
environmental interactions. This inherent connection can be analyzed to provide
relevant information about the topology of the original open system landscape.
Application to the optimization of an observable expectation value reveals the
same landscape simplicity observed in former studies on closed systems. In
particular, no false sub-optimal traps exist in the system control landscape
when seeking to optimize an observable, even in the presence of complex
environments. Moreover, a quantitative study of the control landscape of a
system interacting with a thermal environment shows that the enhanced
controllability attainable with open dynamics significantly broadens the range
of the achievable observable values over the control landscape.
