It's the key research topic of signal processing that recognizing genuine
targets real time from the disturbed signal which has giant amount of data. A
quantum algorithm for pattern recognition of classical signal which has time
complexity O(sqrt(N)) is presented in this paper.
  Key Words: Pattern recognition, Grover's algorithm, Rotation on subspace
