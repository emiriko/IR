We address parametric-downconversion seeded by multimode pseudo-thermal
fields. We show that this process may be used to generate multimode pairwise
correlated states with entanglement properties that can be tuned by controlling
the seed intensities. Multimode pseudo-thermal fields seeded
parametric-downconversion represents a novel source of correlated states, which
allows one to explore the classical-quantum transition in pairwise correlations
and to realize ghost imaging and ghost diffraction in regimes not yet explored
by experiments.
