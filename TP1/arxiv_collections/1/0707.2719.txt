We consider the gravity back reaction on the metric due to the baryon density
in effective ads/qcd model by reconsidering the role of the charged AdS black
hole. Previously it has been known that the U(1) charge is dual to the
R-charge. Here we point out that if we consider the case where $AdS_5$ is
completely filled with $N_f$ flavor branes, the gravity back reaction produces
charged AdS black hole where the effect of charge on the metric is proportional
to $N_f/N_c$. As a consequence, phase diagram changes qualitatively if we allow
$N_f/N_c$ finite: it closes at the finite density unlike the probe brane
embedding approach.
  Another issue we discuss here is the question whether there is any chemical
potential dependence in the confining phase. We consider this problem in the
hard wall model with baryon charge. We conclude that there is a non-trivial
dependence on the chemical potential in this case also.
