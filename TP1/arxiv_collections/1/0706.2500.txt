The unusual temperature behavior of the entropy of the antiferromagnetic
(AFM) spin state in symmetric nuclear matter with the Gogny D1S interaction,
being larger at low temperatures than the entropy of nonpolarized matter, is
related to the dependence of the entropy on the effective masses of nucleons in
a spin polarized state. The corresponding conditions for comparing the
entropies of the AFM and nonpolarized states in terms of the effective masses
are formulated, including low and high temperature limits. It is shown that the
unexpected temperature behavior of the entropy of the AFM spin state at low
temperatures is caused by the violation of the corresponding low temperature
criterium.
