Established in 2005, YouTube has become the most successful Internet site
providing a new generation of short video sharing service. Today, YouTube alone
comprises approximately 20% of all HTTP traffic, or nearly 10% of all traffic
on the Internet. Understanding the features of YouTube and similar video
sharing sites is thus crucial to their sustainable development and to network
traffic engineering. In this paper, using traces crawled in a 3-month period,
we present an in-depth and systematic measurement study on the characteristics
of YouTube videos. We find that YouTube videos have noticeably different
statistics compared to traditional streaming videos, ranging from length and
access pattern, to their active life span, ratings, and comments. The series of
datasets also allows us to identify the growth trend of this fast evolving
Internet site in various aspects, which has seldom been explored before. We
also look closely at the social networking aspect of YouTube, as this is a key
driving force toward its success. In particular, we find that the links to
related videos generated by uploaders' choices form a small-world network. This
suggests that the videos have strong correlations with each other, and creates
opportunities for developing novel caching or peer-to-peer distribution schemes
to efficiently deliver videos to end users.
