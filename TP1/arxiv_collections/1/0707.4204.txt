We derive equations of motion for the dynamics of anisotropic particles
directly from the dissipative Vlasov kinetic equations, with the dissipation
given by the double bracket approach (Double Bracket Vlasov, or DBV). The
moments of the DBV equation lead to a nonlocal form of Darcy's law for the mass
density. Next, kinetic equations for particles with anisotropic interaction are
considered and also cast into the DBV form. The moment dynamics for these
double bracket kinetic equations is expressed as Lie-Darcy continuum equations
for densities of mass and orientation. We also show how to obtain a
Smoluchowski model from a cold plasma-like moment closure of DBV. Thus, the
double bracket kinetic framework serves as a unifying method for deriving
different types of dynamics, from density--orientation to Smoluchowski
equations. Extensions for more general physical systems are also discussed.
