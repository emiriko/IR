We report the observation of spin-glass-like behavior and strong magnetic
anisotropy in extremely smooth (~1-3 \AA) roughness) epitaxial (110) and (010)
SrRuO3 thin films. The easy axis of magnetization is always perpendicular to
the plane of the film (unidirectional) irrespective of crystallographic
orientation. An attempt has been made to understand the nature and origin of
spin-glass behavior, which fits well with Heisenberg model.
