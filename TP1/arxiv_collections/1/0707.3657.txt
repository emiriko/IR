Individual cellular automata rules are attractive models for a range of
biological and physical self-assembling systems. While coexpression and
coevolution are common in such systems, ensembles of cellular automata rules
remain poorly understood. Here we report the first known analysis of the
equally weighted ensemble of all elementary cellular automata (ECA) rules.
Ensemble dynamics reveal persistent, localized, non-interacting patterns,
rather than homogenization. The patterns are strongly correlated by velocity
and have a quasi-linear dependence on initial conditions. Dispersion from a
single initial site generates peaks traveling at low-denominator fractional
velocities, some of which are not discernible in individual rules, suggesting
collective excitation. Further analysis of the time-evolved rule space shows
the 256 ECA rules can be represented by only approximately 111 principal
components. These results suggest the rather surprising conclusion that rich
self-assembly is possible without favoring particular local interactions.
