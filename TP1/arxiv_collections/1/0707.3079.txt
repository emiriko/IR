We review recently developed two-step approach for description of electronic
and magnetic properties of a new class of materials, the diluted magnetic
semiconductors. In the first step we construct, on the basis of the
state-of-the-art first-principles electronic structure calculations, the
effective Ising and Heisenberg Hamiltonians which describe, respectively, the
alloy phase stability and the magnetic excitations in the system. In the second
step, we analyze properties of these effective Hamiltonians by various methods
of statistical physics. As a case study, the prototypical diluted magnetic
semiconductor Ga_{1-x}Mn_{x}As is studied in detail. We determine, among
others, a possibility for clustering in this system, formation energies of
various compensating defects, and estimate short-range order parameters
describing ordering tendencies in a system. On the other hand, by using
recently developed local random-phase approximation approach, we evaluate the
system Curie temperature and demonstrate its strong dependence on the sample
preparation. We also emphasize the relevance of proper inclusion of the
randomness in positions of magnetic impurities for a reliable estimate of the
system critical temperature. Finally, we compare calculated Curie temperatures
with available experimental data and briefly mention relation to other
theoretical approaches.
