We discuss mechanical buckling instabilities of a rigid film under
compression interacting repulsively with a substrate through a thin fluid
layer. The buckling occurs at a characteristic wavelength that increases as the
1/4th power of the bending stiffness, like a gravitational instability studied
previously by Milner et al. However, the potential can affect the
characteristic buckling wavelength strongly, as predicted by Huang and Suo. If
the potential changes sufficiently sharply with thickness, this instability is
continuous, with an amplitude varying as the square root of overpressure. We
discuss three forms of interaction important for the case of Langmuir
monolayers transferred to a substrate: Casimir-van der Waals interaction,
screened charged double-layer interaction and the Sharma potential. We verify
these predictions numerically in the Van der Waals case.
