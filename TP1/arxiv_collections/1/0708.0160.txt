From several neutrino oscillation experiments, we understand now that
neutrinos have mass. However, we really don't know what mechanism is
responsible for producing this neutrino mass. Current or planned neutrino
experiments utilize neutrino beams and long-baseline detectors to explore
flavor mixing but do not address the question of the origin of neutrino mass.
In order to answer that question, neutrino interactions need to be explored at
much higher energies. This paper outlines a program to explore neutrinos and
their interactions with various particles through a series of experiments
involving colliding neutrino beams.
