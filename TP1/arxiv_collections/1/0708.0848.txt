Using simulations to understand backgrounds from muon-induced neutrons is
important in designing next-generation low-background underground experiments.
Validation of relevant physics within the Geant4 simulation package has been
completed by comparing to data from two recent experiments. Verification
focused on the production and propagation of neutrons at energies important to
underground experiments. Discrepancies were observed between experimental data
and the simulation. Techniques were explored to correct for these
discrepancies.
