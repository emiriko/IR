The possibility of Bose-Einstein condensation of excitations has been
discussed for a long time. The phenomenon of the phase-coherent precession of
magnetization in superfluid 3He and the related effects of spin superfluidity
are based on the true Bose-Einstein condensation of magnons. Several different
states of coherent precession has been observed in 3He-B: homogeneously
precessing domain (HPD); persistent signal formed by Q-balls at very low
temperatures; coherent precession with fractional magnetization; and two new
modes of the coherent precession in compressed aerogel. In compressed aerogel
the coherent precession has been also found in 3He-A. Here we demonstrate that
all these cases are examples of a Bose-Einstein condensation of magnons, with
the magnon interaction term in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation being provided by
different types of spin-orbit coupling in the background of the coherent
precession.
