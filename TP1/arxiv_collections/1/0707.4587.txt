One of the few methods for generating efficient function spaces for multi-D
Schrodinger eigenproblems is given by Garashchuk and Light in J.Chem.Phys. 114
(2001) 3929. Their Gaussian basis functions are wider and sparser in high
potential regions, and narrower and denser in low ones. We suggest a
modification of their approach based on the following observation: In very
steep potential regions, wide, sparse, Gaussians should be avoided even if
their centers have high potential values. Our numerical results illustrate that
a dramatic improvement in accuracy may be obtained in this way. We also compare
the errors of collocation to those of a Galerkin approach, test a criterion for
scaling Gaussian widths based on deviation from orthogonality of collocation
eigenfunctions, and suggest a criterion for scaling Gaussian widths based on
Hamiltonian trace minimization.
