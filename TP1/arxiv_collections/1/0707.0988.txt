Many models for physics beyond the Standard Model predict lepton-flavour
violating decays of charged leptons at a level which may become observable very
soon. In the present paper we investigate the decays of a Tau into three
charged leptons in a generic way, based on effective-field-theory methods,
where the relevant operators are classified according to their chirality
structure. We work out the decay distributions and discuss phenomenological
implications.
