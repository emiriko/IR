The possible existence of astronomical references in the planning of the
so-called Great Hopewell Road, a 90 Kilometres straight road composed of two
parallel earthen embankments which, according to recent surveys, likely
connected the Hopewell ceremonial centres of Newark and Chillicothe, Ohio, are
investigated. It turns out that a very peculiar, although simple, set of
astronomical alignments took place in connection with the road during possible
periods of its construction. The possibility of a non-fortuitous connection is
thus proposed and analysed.
