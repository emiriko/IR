We investigate the electron spin states in the bilayer quantum Hall system at
total Landau level filling factor nu =2 exploiting current-pumped and
resistively detected NMR. The measured Knight shift, KS, of 75As nuclei reveals
continuous variation of the out-of-plane electronic spin polarization between
nearly full and zero as a function of density imbalance. Nuclear spin
relaxation measurements indicate a concurrent development of an in-plane spin
component. These results provide direct information on the spin configuration
in this system and comprise strong evidence for the spin canting suggested by
previous experiments.
