We analyze the charge and spin dynamics in a DC biased double quantum dot
driven by crossed DC and AC magnetic fields. In this configuration, spatial
delocalization due to inter-dot tunnel competes with intra-dot spin rotations
induced by the time dependent magnetic field, giving rise to a complicated time
dependent behavior of the tunnelling current. When the Zeeman splitting has the
same value in both dots and spin flip is negligible, the electrons remain in
the triplet subspace (dark subspace) performing coherent spin rotations and the
current does not flow. This electronic trapping is removed either by finite
spin relaxation or when the Zeeman splitting is different in each quantum dot.
In the first case, our results show that measuring the current will allow to
get information on the spin relaxation time. In the last case, we will show
that applying a resonant bichromatic magnetic field, the electrons become
trapped in a coherent superposition of states and electronic transport is
blocked. Then, manipulating AC magnetic fields, electrons are driven to perform
coherent spin rotations which can be unambiguously detected by direct
measurement of the tunneling current.
