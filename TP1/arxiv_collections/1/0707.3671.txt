The sensory contact model allows forming different psychopathological states
(anxious depression, catalepsy, social withdrawal, pathological aggression,
hypersensitivity, cognition disturbances, anhedonia, alcoholism etc.) produced
by repeated agonistic interactions in male mice and investigating the
therapeutic and preventive properties of any drug as well as its efficiency
under simulated clinical conditions. This approach can be useful for a better
understanding of the drugs' action in different stages of disease development
in individuals. It is suggested that this pharmacological approach may be
applied for the screening of different novel psychotropic drugs.
