Observationally and experimentally, physical laws express how particles
interact. Conversely, physical laws should be invariant under any
re-arrangement of those particles, e.g., the laws of gravity do not change if
one re-arranges the stars in the sky. To explore the physical meaning of these
assertions, arguments are presented that show how the freedom of particle
re-arrangement leads to an identical twin associated with any photon, i.e.,
nature sees double. These twins can become spatially separated for
astronomically distant objects and are special in that detection of the one
causes the disappearance of the other. A tilting detector then leads to
brightness variations across an image for twin separations on the order of the
detector size.
