We introduce a certain type of representations for the quantum Teichmuller
space of a punctured surface, which we call local representations. We show
that, up to finitely many choices, these purely algebraic representations are
classified by classical geometric data. We also investigate the family of
intertwining operators associated to such a representations. In particular, we
use these intertwiners to construct a natural fiber bundle over the Teichmuller
space and its quotient under the action of the mapping class group. This
construction also offers a convenient framework to exhibit invariants of
surface diffeomorphisms.
