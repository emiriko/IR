Charge-ordered rare earth manganites Nd0.5Ca0.5MnO3, La0.25Nd0.25Ca0.5MnO3,
Pr0.7Ca0.3MnO3 and Pr0.6Ca0.4MnO3 are found to exhibit dielectric constant
anomalies around the charge-ordering or the magnetic transition temperatures.
Magnetic fields have a marked effect on the dielectric properties, indicating
the presence of coupling between the magnetic and electrical order parameters.
The observation of magnetoferroelectricity in these manganites is in accord
with the recent theoretical predictions of Khomskii and coworkers.
