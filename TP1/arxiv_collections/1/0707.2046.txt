We analyze the deviations of the mixing induced CP asymmetry in B-->phi Ks
from sin(2beta), as well as the deviations of the asymmetries in Bs-->K*K*,
Bs-->phi K* and Bs-->phi phi from sin(2beta_s), that arise in SM due to penguin
pollution. We use a theoretical input which is short-distance dominated in
QCD-factorization and thus free of IR-divergencies. We also provide alternative
ways to extract angles of the unitarity triangle from penguin-mediated decays,
and give predictions for Bs-->K*K* observables.
