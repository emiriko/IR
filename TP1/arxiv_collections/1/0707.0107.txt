We describe the occurence and properties of liquid crystal phases showing two
dimensional splay and bend distortions which are stabilised by flexoelectric
interactions. These phases are characterised by regions of locally double
splayed order separated by topological defects and are thus highly analogous to
the blue phases of cholesteric liquid crystals. We present a mean field
analysis based upon the Landau--de Gennes Q-tensor theory and construct a phase
diagram for flexoelectric structures using analytic and numerical results. We
stress the similarities and discrepancies between the cholesteric and
flexoelectric cases.
