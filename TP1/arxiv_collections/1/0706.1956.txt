We consider the conformal group of the unit sphere $S^{n-1},$ the so-called
proper Lorentz group Spin$^+(1,n),$ for the study of spherical continuous
wavelet transforms (CWT). Our approach is based on the method for construction
of general coherent states associated to square integrable group
representations over homogeneous spaces. The underlying homogeneous space is an
extension to the whole of the group Spin$^+(1,n)$ of the factorization of the
gyrogroup of the unit ball by an appropriate gyro-subgroup. Sections on this
homogeneous space are constituted by rotations of the subgroup Spin$(n)$ and
M\"{o}bius transformations of the type $\phi_a(x)=(x-a)(1+ax)^{-1},$ where $a$
belongs to a given section on a homogeneous space of the unit ball. This
extends in a natural way the work of Antoine and Vandergheynst to anisotropic
conformal dilations.
