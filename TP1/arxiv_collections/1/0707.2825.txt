We discuss the exact solutions of brane universes and the results indicate
the Friedmann equations on the branes are modified with a new density term.
Then, we assume the new term as the density of dark energy. Using Wetterich's
parametrization equation of state (EOS) of dark energy, we obtain the new term
varies with the red-shift z. Finally, the evolutions of the mass density
parameter $\Omega_2$, dark energy density parameter $\Omega_x$ and deceleration
parameter q_2 are studied.
