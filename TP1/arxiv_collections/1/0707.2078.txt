We have investigated the electrical transport properties of Dirac electrons
in a monolayer graphene sheet in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field
that is modulated weakly and periodically along one direction.We find that the
Landau levels broaden into bands and their width oscillates as a function of
the band index and the magnetic field.We determine the $\sigma_{yy}$ component
of the magnetoconductivity tensor for this system which is shown to exhibit
Weiss oscillations.We also determine analytically the asymptotic expressions
for $\sigma_{yy}$.We compare these results with recently obtained results for
electrically modulated graphene as well as those for magnetically modulated
conventional two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) system.We find that in the
magnetically modulated graphene system cosidered in this work,Weiss
oscillations in $\sigma_{yy}$ have a reduced amplitude compared to the 2DEG but
are less damped by temperature while they have a higher amplitude than in the
electrically modulated graphene system. We also find that these oscillations
are out of phase by $\pi$ with those of the electrically modulated system while
they are in phase with those in the 2DEG system.
