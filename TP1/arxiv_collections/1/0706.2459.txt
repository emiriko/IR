We discuss the exact cloning of orthogonal but entangled qubits under local
operations and classical communication. The amount of entanglement necessary in
blank copy is obtained for various cases. Surprisingly this amount is more than
1 ebit for certain set of two nonmaximal but equally entangled states of two
qubits system. To clone any three two qubits Bell states at least log2 3 ebit
is necessary.
