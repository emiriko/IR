We update the constraints on new-physics contributions to Delta F=2 processes
from the generalized unitarity triangle analysis, including the most recent
experimental developments. Based on these constraints, we derive upper bounds
on the coefficients of the most general Delta F=2 effective Hamiltonian. These
upper bounds can be translated into lower bounds on the scale of new physics
that contributes to these low-energy effective interactions. We point out that,
due to the enhancement in the renormalization group evolution and in the matrix
elements, the coefficients of non-standard operators are much more constrained
than the coefficient of the operator present in the Standard Model. Therefore,
the scale of new physics in models that generate new Delta F=2 operators, such
as next-to-minimal flavour violation, has to be much higher than the scale of
minimal flavour violation, and it most probably lies beyond the reach of direct
searches at the LHC.
