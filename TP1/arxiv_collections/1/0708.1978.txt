The paper studies some ill-posed boundary value problems on semi-plane for
parabolic equations with homogenuous Cauchy condition at initial time and with
the second order Cauchy condition on the boundary of the semi-plane. A class of
inputs that allows some regularity is suggested and described explicitly in
frequency domain. This class is everywhere dense in the space of square
integrable functions.
