Silver staining is used to detect proteins after electrophoretic separation
on polyacrylamide gels. It combines excellent sensitivity (in the low nanogram
range) with the use of very simple and cheap equipment and chemicals. It is
compatible with downstream processing, such as mass spectrometry analysis after
protein digestion. The sequential phases of silver staining are protein
fixation, then sensitization, then silver impregnation and finally image
development. Several variants of silver staining are described here, which can
be completed in a time range from 2 h to 1 d after the end of the
electrophoretic separation. Once completed, the stain is stable for several
weeks.
