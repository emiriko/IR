We study the impact of beam polarization on radiative neutralino production
e+e- \to \chi^0_1 \chi^0_1 photon at the International Linear Collider. We show
that longitudinal polarized beams significantly enhance the signal and
simultaneously reduce the Standard Model background from radiative neutrino
production e+e- \to \nu \bar\nu photon. We point out that the radiative
production of neutralinos could be the only accessible SUSY particles, if
neutralinos, charginos, sleptons, as well as squarks and gluinos are too heavy
to be pair-produced in the first stage of the ILC at sqrt{s} = 500 GeV.
