Quantum, in contrast to classical, information theory, allows for different
incompatible types (or species) of information which cannot be combined with
each other. Distinguishing these incompatible types is useful in understanding
the role of the two classical bits in teleportation (or one bit in one-bit
teleportation), for discussing decoherence in information-theoretic terms, and
for giving a proper definition, in quantum terms, of ``classical information.''
Various examples (some updating earlier work) are given of theorems which
relate different incompatible kinds of information, and thus have no
counterparts in classical information theory.
