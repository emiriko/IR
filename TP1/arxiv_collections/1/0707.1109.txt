We describe random walk boundaries (in particular, the Poisson--Furstenberg,
or PF-boundary) for a vast family of groups in terms of the hyperbolic boundary
of a special free subgroup. We prove that almost all trajectories of the random
walk (with respect to an arbitrary nondegenerate measure on the group) converge
to points of that boundary. This implies the stability (in the sense of
\cite{Ver}) of the so-called Markov--Ivanovsky normal form for braids.
