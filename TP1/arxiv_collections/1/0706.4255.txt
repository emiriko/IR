We report on the implementation of a reverse-reconciliated coherent-state
continuous-variable quantum key distribution system, with which we generated
secret keys at a rate of more than 2 kb/s over 25 km of optical fiber. Time
multiplexing is used to transmit both the signal and phase reference in the
same optical fiber. Our system includes all experimental aspects required for a
field implementation of a quantum key distribution setup. Real-time reverse
reconciliation is achieved by using fast and efficient LDPC error correcting
codes.
