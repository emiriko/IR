The dynamics associated with a measurement-based master equation for quantum
Brownian motion are investigated. A scheme for obtaining time evolution from
general initial conditions is derived. This is applied to analyze dissipation
and decoherence in the evolution of both a Gaussian and a Schr\"{o}dinger cat
initial state. Dependence on the diffusive terms present in the master equation
is discussed with reference to both the coordinate and momentum
representations.
