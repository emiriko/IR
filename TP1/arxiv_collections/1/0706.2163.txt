The recent observation by CDF of Sigma_b^{+-} (uub and ddb) baryons within 2
MeV of the predicted Sigma_b - Lambda_b splitting has provided strong
confirmation for the theoretical approach based on modeling the color hyperfine
interaction. We now apply this approach to predict the masses of the Xi_b
family of baryons with quark content usb and dsb - the ground state Xi_b at
5790 to 5800 MeV, and the excited states Xi_b^' and Xi_b^*. The main source of
uncertainty is the method used to estimate the mass difference m_b - m_c from
known hadrons. We verify that corrections due to the details of the interquark
potential and to Xi_b-Xi_b^' mixing are small.
