We investigate correlation effects in the regime of a few electrons in
uncapped InAs quantum dots by tunneling spectroscopy and wave function (WF)
mapping at high tunneling currents where electron-electron interactions become
relevant. Four clearly resolved states are found, whose approximate symmetries
are roughly s and p, in order of increasing energy. Because the major axes of
the p-like states coincide, the WF sequence is inconsistent with the imaging of
independent-electron orbitals. The results are explained in terms of many-body
tunneling theory, by comparing measured maps with those calculated by taking
correlation effects into account.
