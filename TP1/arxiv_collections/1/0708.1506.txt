In this paper we present a two channel model with the goal of reproducing the
soft scattering data available in the ISR-Tevatron energy range, and extend the
model results to LHC and Cosmic Rays energies. A characteristic feature of the
model is that we represent the sum of all diffractive final states at a vertex,
by a single diffractive state. Our two main results are: (i) The approach of
the elastic scattering amplitude to the black disc bound is very slow, reaching
it at energies far higher than the GZK ankle cutoff. (ii) Our predicted
survival probability for Higgs exclusive central diffractive production at the
LHC is 0.7%, which is considerably smaller than our previous estimate. The
above features are compatible with a parton-like model in which the traditional
soft Pomeron is replaced by an amplitude describing the partonic system, which
issaturated in the soft (long distance) limit.
