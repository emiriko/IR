In a previous paper we showed that the electromagnetic superenergy tensor,
the Chevreton tensor, gives rise to a conserved current when there is a
hypersurface orthogonal Killing vector present. In addition, the current is
proportional to the Killing vector. The aim of this paper is to extend this
result to the case when we have a two-parameter Abelian isometry group that
acts orthogonally transitive on non-null surfaces. It is shown that for
four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory with a source-free electromagnetic
field, the corresponding superenergy currents lie in the orbits of the group
and are conserved. A similar result is also shown to hold for the trace of the
Chevreton tensor and for the Bach tensor, and also in Einstein-Klein-Gordon
theory for the superenergy of the scalar field. This links up well with the
fact that the Bel tensor has these properties and the possibility of
constructing conserved mixed currents between the gravitational field and the
matter fields.
