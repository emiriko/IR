The electric forces acting on an atomic force microscope tip in solution have
been measured using a microelectrochemical cell formed by two periodically
biased electrodes. The forces were measured as a function of lift height and
bias amplitude and frequency, providing insight into electrostatic interactions
in liquids. Real-space mapping of the vertical and lateral components of
electrostatic forces acting on the tip from the deflection and torsion of the
cantilever is demonstrated. This method enables direct probing of electrostatic
and convective forces involved in electrophoretic and dielectroforetic
self-assembly and electrical tweezer operation in liquid environments.
