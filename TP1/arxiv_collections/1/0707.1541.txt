Some education researchers have claimed that we should not teach the Bohr
model of the atom because it inhibits students' ability to learn the true
quantum nature of electrons in atoms. Although the evidence for this claim is
weak, many have accepted it. This claim has implications for how to present
atoms in classes ranging from elementary school to graduate school. We present
results from a study designed to test this claim by developing a curriculum on
models of the atom, including the Bohr and Schrodinger models. We examine
student descriptions of atoms on final exams in transformed modern physics
classes using various versions of this curriculum. We find that if the
curriculum does not include sufficient connections between different models,
many students still have a Bohr-like view of atoms, rather than a more accurate
Schrodinger model. However, with an improved curriculum designed to develop
model-building skills and with better integration between different models, it
is possible to get most students to describe atoms using the Schrodinger model.
In comparing our results with previous research, we find that comparing and
contrasting different models is a key feature of a curriculum that helps
students move beyond the Bohr model and adopt Schrodinger's view of the atom.
We find that understanding the reasons for the development of models is much
more difficult for students than understanding the features of the models. We
also present interactive computer simulations designed to help students build
models of the atom more effectively.
