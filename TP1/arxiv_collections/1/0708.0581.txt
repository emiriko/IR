Several studies suggest that cyclooxygenase-2 contributes to the delayed
progression of ischemic brain damage. In this study we examined whether the
highly selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor DFU reduces neuronal damage when
administered several hours after 5 min of transient forebrain ischemia in
gerbils. The extent of ischemic injury was assessed behaviorally by measuring
the increases in locomotor activity and by histopathological evaluation of the
extent of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cell injury 7 days after ischemia. DFU
treatment (10 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly reduced hippocampal neuronal damage
even if the treatment is delayed until 12 h after ischemia. These results
suggest that selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors may be a valuable
therapeutic strategy for ischemic brain injury.
