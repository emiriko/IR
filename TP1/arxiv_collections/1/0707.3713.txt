High-field specific heat measurements on BaCo2V2O8, which is a good
realization of an S = 1/2 quasi one-dimensional Ising-like antifferomagnet,
have been performed in magnetic fields up to 12 T along the chain and at
temperature down to 200 mK. We have found a new magnetic ordered state in the
field-induced phase above Hc ~ 3.9 T. We suggest that a novel type of the
incommensurate order, which has no correspondence to the classical spin system,
is realized in the field-induced phase.
