The linear polarizability absorption spectra of the double-walled carbon
nanotubes (DWNTs) have been calculated by using the tight-binding (TB) model
and sum-over-state (SOS) method, supplemented by the first principles CASTEP
calculations. It is found that the chiral symmetries of both outer and inner
tubes in the DWNTs can always be identified distinctly by the characteristic
peaks in the absorption spectra of the DWNTs, no matter what kind of the outer
tube is, offering a powerful experimental tool to measure precisely the chiral
angle of the inner tube of a DWNT.
