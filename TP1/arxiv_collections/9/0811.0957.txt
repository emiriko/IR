We show that alternative relativity theories that are essentially based on
varied distant clock synchronization procedures can be recovered by using the
standard Lorentz-Einstein transformations for the space-time coordinates of the
same event. Through this approach we offer modest support for the Rizzi et al.
stating that: "Once correctly and explicitly phrased, the principles of special
relativity theory allow for a wide range of theories that differ from the
standard Einstein's theory only for the difference in the chosen
synchronization procedure, but are wholly equivalent to special relativity
theory in predicting empirical facts." Our approach requires of the reader no
more then a correct understanding of the physics behind the Lorentz-Einstein
transformations equations which we use.
