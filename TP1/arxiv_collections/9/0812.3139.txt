We use Bloch oscillations to transfer coherently many photon momenta to
atoms. Then we can measure accurately the recoil velocity $\hbar k/m$ and
deduce the fine structure constant $\alpha$. The velocity variation due to
Bloch oscillations is measured using atom interferometry. This method yields to
a value of the fine structure constant $\alpha^{-1}= 137.035 999 45 (62)$ with
a relative uncertainty of about $4.5 \times 10^{-9}$.
