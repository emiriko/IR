We study structural transitions in a system of interacting particles arranged
as a crystalline bilayer, as a function of the density $\rho$ and the distance
$d$ between the layers. As $d$ is decreased a sequence of transitions involving
triangular, rhombic, square and centered rectangular lattices is observed. The
sequence of phases and the order of transitions depends on the nature of
interactions.
