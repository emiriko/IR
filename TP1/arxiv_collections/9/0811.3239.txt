We use charge sensing of Pauli blockade (including spin and isospin) in a
two-electron 13C nanotube double quantum dot to measure relaxation and
dephasing times. The relaxation time, T1, first decreases with parallel
magnetic field then goes through a minimum in a field of 1.4 T. We attribute
both results to the spin-orbit-modified electronic spectrum of carbon
nanotubes, which suppresses hyperfine mediated relaxation and enhances
relaxation due to soft phonons. The inhomogeneous dephasing time, T2*, is
consistent with previous data on hyperfine coupling strength in 13C nanotubes.
