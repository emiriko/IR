We show that measurement can recover the quantum coherence of a qubit in a
non-Markovian environment. The experimental demonstration in an optical system
is provided by comparing the visibilities (and fidelities) of the final states
with and without measurement. This method can be extended to other two-level
quantum systems and entangled states in a non-Markovian evolution environment.
It may also be used to implement other quantum information processing.
