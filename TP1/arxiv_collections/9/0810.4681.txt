We present numerical calculations of the impact of charge carriers-carriers
interactions on the dynamical properties of quasiparticles such as renormalized
velocity and quasiparticle inelastic scattering lifetime in a gapped graphene
sheet. Our formalism is based on the many-body $G_0W$-approximation for the
self-energy. We present results for the many-body renormalized velocity
suppression and the renormalization constant over a broad range of energy gap
values. We find that the renormalized velocity is almost independence of the
carrier densities at large density regime. We also show that the quasiparticle
inelastic scattering lifetime decreases by increasing the gap value. Finally,
we present results for the mean free path of charge carriers suppression over
the energy gap values.
