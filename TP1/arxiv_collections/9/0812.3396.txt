Unparticle degrees of freedom, no matter how weakly coupled to the standard
model particles, must affect the evolution of a black hole, which thermally
decays into all available degrees of freedom. We develop a method for
calculating the grey-body factors for scalar unparticles for 3+1 and higher
dimensional black holes. We find that the power emitted in unparticles may be
quite different from the power emitted in ordinary particles. Depending on the
parameters in the model, unparticles may become the dominant channel. This is
of special interest for small primordial black holes and also in models with
low scale quantum gravity where the experimental signature may significantly be
affected. We also discuss the sensitivity of the results on the (currently
unknown) unparticle normalization.
