The carrier mobility \mu of few-layer graphene (FLG) field-effect transistors
increases ten-fold when the SiO_2 substrate is replaced by single-crystal
epitaxial Pb(Zr_0.2Ti_0.8)O_3 (PZT). In the electron-only regime of the FLG,
\mu reaches 7x10^4 cm^2/Vs at 300K for n = 2.4x10^12/cm^2, 70% of the intrinsic
limit set by longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonons; it increases to 1.4x10^5
cm^2/Vs at low temperature. The temperature-dependent resistivity \rho(T)
reveals a clear signature of LA phonon scattering, yielding a deformation
potential D = 7.8+/-0.5 eV.
