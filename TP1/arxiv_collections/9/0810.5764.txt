We emphasize that the motivation for including our hadronic matrix elements
in TAUOLA is not only theoretical. We also show that our expressions describe
better the tau to 3pi ALEPH data and are able to fit BABAR data on the
isovector component of e^+e^- -> KKpi. The theoretical foundations of our
framework are the large-N_C limit of QCD, the chiral structure exhibited at low
energies and the proper asymptotic behaviour, ruled by QCD, that is demanded to
the associated form factors.
