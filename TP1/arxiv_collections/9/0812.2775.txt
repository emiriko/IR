For a static array A of n ordered objects, a range minimum query asks for the
position of the minimum between two specified array indices. We show how to
preprocess A into a scheme of size 2n+o(n) bits that allows to answer range
minimum queries on A in constant time. This space is asymptotically optimal in
the important setting where access to A is not permitted after the
preprocessing step. Our scheme can be computed in linear time, using only n +
o(n) additional bits at construction time. In interesting by-product is that we
also improve on LCA-computation in BPS- or DFUDS-encoded trees.
