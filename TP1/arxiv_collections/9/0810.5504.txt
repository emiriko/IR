We introduce a new species of gap solitons (GSs) supported by an azimuthally
modulated guiding ring in defocusing cubic media. The periodicity in the
azimuthal direction strongly modifies properties and existence domains of GSs.
In addition to the fundamental solitons, we report even and twisted bound
states. The former type is found to be stable, while the twisted states are
always unstable in defocusing media.
