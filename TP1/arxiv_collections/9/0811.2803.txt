How can one prove that a given state is entangled? In this paper we review
different methods that have been proposed for entanglement detection. We first
explain the basic elements of entanglement theory for two or more particles and
then entanglement verification procedures such as Bell inequalities,
entanglement witnesses, the determination of nonlinear properties of a quantum
state via measurements on several copies, and spin squeezing inequalities. An
emphasis is given on the theory and application of entanglement witnesses. We
also discuss several experiments, where some of the presented methods have been
implemented.
