We consider fluxon dynamics in a stack of inductively coupled long Josephson
junctions connected capacitively to a common resonant cavity at one of the
boundaries. We study, through theoretical and numerical analysis, the
possibility for the cavity to induce a transition from the energetically
favored state of spatially separated shuttling fluxons in the different
junctions to a high velocity, high energy state of identical fluxon modes.
