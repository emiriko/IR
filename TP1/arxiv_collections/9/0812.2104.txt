We review the idea of generating non-extensive stationary distributions based
on abstract composition rules for the subsystem energies, in particular the
relativistic generalized Boltzmann equation method. The thermodynamical
behavior of such systems is investigated and hadron spectra stemming from
relativistic heavy ion collisions are calculated by assuming quark coalescence.
