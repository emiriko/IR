Visualization of turbulent flows is a powerful tool to help understand the
turbulence dynamics and induced transport. However, it does not provide a
quantitative description of the observed structures. In this paper, an approach
to characterize quantitatively the topology of the flows is given. The
technique, which can be applied to any type of turbulence dynamics, is
illustrated through the example of resistive ballooning instabilities.
