Path integral quantization of quantum gauge general relativity is discussed
in this paper. First, we deduce the generating functional of green function
with external fields. Based on this generating functional, the propagators of
gravitational gauge field and related ghost field are deduced. Then, we
calculate Feynman rules of various interaction vertices of three or four
gravitational gauge fields and vertex between ghost field and gravitational
gauge field. Results in this paper are the bases of calculating vacuum
polarization of gravitational gauge field and vertex correction of
gravitational couplings in one loop diagram level. As we have pointed out in
previous paper, quantum gauge general relativity is perturbative
renormalizable, and a formal proof on its renormalizability is also given in
the previous paper. Next step, we will calculate one-loop and two-loop
renormalization constant, and to prove that the theory is renormalizable in
one-loop and two-loop level by direct calculations.
