We construct examples of compact and one-ended constant mean curvature
surfaces with large mean curvature in Riemannian manifolds with axial symmetry
by gluing together small spheres positioned end-to-end along a geodesic. Such
surfaces cannot exist in Euclidean space, but we show that the gradient of the
ambient scalar curvature acts as a `friction term' which permits the usual
analytic gluing construction to be carried out.
