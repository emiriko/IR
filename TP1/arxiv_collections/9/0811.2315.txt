We investigate how entangled coherent states and superpositions of low
intensity coherent states of non-Gaussian nature can be generated via
non-resonant interaction between either two linearly or circularly polarized
field modes and an ensemble of X-like four-level atoms placed in an optical
cavity. We compare our results to recent experimental observations and argue
that the non-Gaussian structure of the field states may be present in those
systems.
