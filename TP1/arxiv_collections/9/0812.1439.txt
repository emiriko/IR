The low lying excitations of coreless vortex states in F = 1 spinor
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) are theoretically investigated using the
Gross-Pitaevskii and Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. The spectra of the
elementary excitations are calculated for different spin-spin interaction
parameters and ratios of the number of particles in each sublevel. There exist
dynamical instabilities of the vortex state which are suppressed by
ferromagnetic interactions, and conversely, enhanced by antiferromagnetic
interactions. In both of the spin-spin interaction regimes, we find vortex
splitting instabilities in analogy with scalar BECs. In addition, a phase
separating instability is found in the antiferromagnetic regime.
