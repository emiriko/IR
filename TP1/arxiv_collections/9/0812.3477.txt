The relativistic model of the ground state and excited heavy tetraquarks with
hidden bottom is formulated within the diquark-antidiquark picture. The diquark
structure is taken into account by calculating the diquark-gluon vertex in
terms of the diquark wave functions. Predictions for the masses of bottom
counterparts to the charm tetraquark candidates are given.
