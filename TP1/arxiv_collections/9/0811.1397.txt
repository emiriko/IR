We consider terahertz absorption and gain in a single miniband of
semiconductor superlattice subject to a bichromatic electric field in the most
general case of commensurate frequencies of the probe and pump fields. Using an
exact solution of Boltzmann transport equation, we show that in the
small-signal limit the formulas for absorption always contain two distinct
terms related to the parametric and incoherent interactions of miniband
electrons with the alternating pump field. It provides a theoretical background
for a control of THz gain without switching to the negative differential
conductivity state. For pedagogical reasons we present derivations of formulas
in detail.
