We use quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study the phase diagram of
hard-core bosons with short-ranged {\it attractive} interactions, in the
presence of uniform diagonal disorder. It is shown that moderate disorder
stabilizes a glassy superfluid phase in a range of values of the attractive
interaction for which the system is a Mott insulator, in the absence of
disorder. A transition to an insulating Bose glass phase occurs as the strength
of the disorder or interactions increases.
