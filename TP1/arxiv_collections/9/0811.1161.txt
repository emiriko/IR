We have studied magneto-optical traps (MOTs) for efficient on-line trapping
of radioactive atoms. After discussing a model of the trapping process in a
vapor cell and its efficiency, we present the results of detailed experimental
studies on Rb MOTs. Three spherical cells of different sizes were used. These
cells can be easily replaced, while keeping the rest of the apparatus
unchanged: atomic sources, vacuum conditions, magnetic field gradients, sizes
and power of the laser beams, detection system. By direct comparison, we find
that the trapping efficiency only weakly depends on the MOT cell size. It is
also found that the trapping efficiency of the MOT with the smallest cell,
whose diameter is equal to the diameter of the trapping beams, is about 40%
smaller than the efficiency of larger cells. Furthermore, we also demonstrate
the importance of two factors: a long coated tube at the entrance of the MOT
cell, used instead of a diaphragm; and the passivation with an alkali vapor of
the coating on the cell walls, in order to minimize the losses of trappable
atoms. These results guided us in the construction of an efficient
large-diameter cell, which has been successfully employed for on-line trapping
of Fr isotopes at INFN's national laboratories in Legnaro, Italy.
