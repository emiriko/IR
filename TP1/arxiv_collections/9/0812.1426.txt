Magnetic translation symmetry on a finite periodic square lattice is
investigated for an arbitrary uniform magnetic field in arbitrary dimensions.
It can be used to classify eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian. The system can be
converted to another system of half or lower dimensions. A higher dimensional
generalization of Harper equation is obtained for tight-binding systems.
