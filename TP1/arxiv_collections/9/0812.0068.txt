The Kaluza-Klein reduction of 4d conformally flat spacetimes is reconsidered.
The corresponding 3d equations are shown to be equivalent to 2d gravitational
kink equations augmented by a centrifugal term. For space-like gauge fields and
non-trivial values of the centrifugal term the gravitational kink solutions
describe a spacetime that is divided in two disconnected regions.
