The scaled-particle theory equation of state for the two-dimensional
hard-disk fluid on a curved surface is proposed and used to determine the
saddle-splay modulus of a particle-laden fluid interface. The resulting
contribution to saddle-splay modulus, which is caused by thermal motion of the
adsorbed particles, is comparable in magnitude with the saddle-splay modulus of
a simple fluid interface.
