We report on correlated real-time detection of individual electrons in an
InAs nanowire double quantum dot. Two self-aligned quantum point contacts in an
underlying two-dimensional electron gas material serve as highly sensitive
charge detectors for the double quantum dot. Tunnel processes of individual
electrons and all tunnel rates are determined by simultaneous measurements of
the correlated signals of the quantum point contacts.
