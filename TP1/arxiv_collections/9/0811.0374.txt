We report on the observation of the natural isotopic spread of carbon from
single-molecule Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SM-SERS). By choosing a
dye molecule with a very localized Raman active vibration in a cyano bond
(C$\equiv$N triple bond), we observe (in a SERS colloidal liquid) a small
fraction of SM-SERS events where the frequency of the cyano mode is softened
and in agreement with the effect of substituting $^{12}$C by the next most
abundant $^{13}$C isotope. This example adds another demonstration of single
molecule sensitivity in SERS through isotopic editing which is done, in this
case, not by artificial isotopic editing but rather by nature itself. It also
highlights SERS as a unique spectroscopic tool, capable of detecting an
isotopic change in one atom of a single molecule.
