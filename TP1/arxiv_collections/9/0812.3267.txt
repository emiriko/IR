In the Hartree approximation of Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) formalism of
the real scalar field theory, we show that for the strongly coupled scalar
system near phase transition, the shear viscosity over entropy density is
small, however, the bulk viscosity over entropy density is large. The large
bulk viscosity is related to the highly nonconformal equation of state. It is
found that the square of the sound velocity near phase transition is much
smaller than the conformal value 1/3, and the trace anomaly at phase transition
deviates far away from 0. These results agree well with the lattice results of
the complex QCD system near phase transition.
