We have shown that the non-Abelian spin-orbit gauge field strength of the
Rashba and Dresselhaus interactions, when split into two Abelian field
strengths, the Hamiltonian of the system can be re-expressed as a Landau level
problem with a particular relation between the two coupling parameters. The
quantum levels are created with up and down spins with opposite chirality and
leads to the quantum spin Hall effect.
