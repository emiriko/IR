We show that the In\"on\"u-Wigner contraction naturally associated to a
reduction chain $\frak{s}\supset \frak{s}^{\prime}$ of semisimple Lie algebras
induces a decomposition of the Casimir operators into homogeneous polynomials,
the terms of which can be used to obtain additional mutually commuting missing
label operators for this reduction. The adjunction of these scalars that are no
more invariants of the contraction allow to solve the missing label problem for
those reductions where the contraction provides an insufficient number of
labelling operators.
