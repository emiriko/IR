By using Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) technique we study the
phase diagram of 1D extended anisotropic Heisenberg model with ferromagnetic
nearest-neighbor and antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor interactions. We
analyze the static correlation functions for the spin operators both in- and
out-of-plane and classify the zero-temperature phases by the range of their
correlations. On clusters of $64,100,200,300$ sites with open boundary
conditions we isolate the boundary effects and make finite-size scaling of our
results. Apart from the ferromagnetic phase, we identify two gapless spin-fluid
phases and two ones with massive excitations. Based on our phase diagram and on
estimates for the coupling constants known from literature, we classify the
ground states of several edge-sharing materials.
