The local reggeon field theory is studied perturbatively taking advantage of
the PT symmetry in the Hamiltonian formulation. In the lowest non trivial order
we show that the pomeron interactions renormalize the slope. In the same order
we find a non local pair potential acting between pomerons, which has a
singular structure. However the analysis of the scattering operator shows that
at small coupling constant bound states do not appear so that the two-particle
spectrum is not changed.
