Several recent works have emphasized the role of spatial dispersion in wire
media, and demonstrated that arrays of parallel metallic wires may behave very
differently from a uniaxial local material with negative permittivity. Here, we
investigate using local and non-local homogenization methods the effect of
spatial dispersion on reflection from the mushroom structure introduced by
Sievenpiper. The objective of the paper is to clarify the role of spatial
dispersion in the mushroom structure and demonstrate that under some conditions
it is suppressed. The metamaterial substrate, or metasurface, is modeled as a
wire medium covered with an impedance surface. Surprisingly, it is found that
in such configuration the effects of spatial dispersion may be nearly
suppressed when the slab is electrically thin, and that the wire medium can be
modeled very accurately using a local model. This result paves the way for the
design of artificial surfaces that exploit the plasmonic-type response of the
wire medium slab.
