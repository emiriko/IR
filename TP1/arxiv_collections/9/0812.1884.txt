A simple way to define the flow rules of plasticity models is the assumption
of generalized normality associated with a suitable pseudo-potential function.
This approach, however, is not usually employed to formulate endochronic theory
and non-linear kinematic (NLK) hardening rules as well as generalized
plasticity models. In this paper, generalized normality is used to give a new
formulation of these classes of models. As a result, a suited pseudo-potential
is introduced for endochronic models and a non-standard description of NLK
hardening and generalized plasticity models is also provided. This new
formulation allows for an effective investigation of the relationships between
these three classes of plasticity models.
