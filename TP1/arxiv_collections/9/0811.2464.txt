The outbreaks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in
2003 resulted in unprecedented impacts on people's daily life. One of the most
significant impacts to people is the risk of contacting SARS while engaging
daily routine activity. In this work we use data from daily underground
ridership in Taipei and daily reported SARS cases in Taiwan to model the
dynamics of the public underground usage during the wax and wane of the SARS
period. We found that for each reported SARS case there is an immediate loss of
about 1200 underground ridership. These loss rates propagate to the following
days with an e-folding decay time of about 28 days, reflecting the public
perception on the risk of contacting SARS disease when travelling with the
underground system. About 50% of daily ridership was lost during the peak of
the 2003 SARS period, compared with the loss of 80% daily ridership during the
closure of the underground system after Typhoon Nari, the loss of 50-70%
ridership due to the closure of the governmental offices and schools during
typhoon periods, and the loss of 60% daily ridership during Chinese New Year
holidays.
