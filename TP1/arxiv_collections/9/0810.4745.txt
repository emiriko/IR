A high activity of reactions can be confined in a model cell with a
semipermeable membrane in the Schl\"ogl model. It is interpreted as a model of
primitive metabolism in a cell. We study two generalized models to understand
the creation of primitive cell systems conceptually from the view point of the
nonlinear-nonequilibrium physics. In the first model, a single-cell system with
a highly active state confined by a semipermeable membrane is spontaneously
created from an inactive homogeneous state by a stochastic jump process. In the
second model, many cell structures are reproduced from a single cell, and a
multicellular system is created.
