Among recent proposals for next-generation, non-charge-based logic is the
notion that a single electron can be trapped and its spin can be manipulated
through the application of gate potentials. In this paper, we present numerical
simulations of such spins in single electron devices for realistic (asymmetric)
confining potentials in two-dimensional electrostatically confined quantum
dots. Using analytical and numerical techniques we show that breaking the
in-plane rotational symmetry of the confining potential leads to a significant
effect on the tunability of the g-factor with applied gate potentials. In
particular, anisotropy extends the range of tunability to larger quantum dots.
