In this paper, we first study the existence-uniqueness and large deviation
estimate of solutions for stochastic Volterra integral equations with singular
kernels in 2-smooth Banach spaces. Then, we apply them to a large class of
semilinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) driven by Brownian
motions as well as by fractional Brownian motions, and obtain the existence of
unique maximal strong solutions (in the sense of SDE and PDE) under local
Lipschitz conditions. Lastly, high order SPDEs in a bounded domain of Euclidean
space, second order SPDEs on complete Riemannian manifolds, as well as
stochastic Navier-Stokes equations are investigated.
