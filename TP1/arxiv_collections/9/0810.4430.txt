We show some evidences that the Southeastern Brazilian Continental Shelf
(SBCS) has a devil's staircase structure, with a sequence of scarps and
terraces with widths that obey fractal formation rules. Since the formation of
these features are linked with the sea level variations, we say that the sea
level changes in an organized pulsating way. Although the proposed approach was
applied in a particular region of the Earth, it is suitable to be applied in an
integrated way to other Shelves around the world, since the analyzes favor the
revelation of the global sea level variations.
