In this work we present the first passive attack over the SASI lightweight
authentication protocol with modular rotations. This can be used to fully
recover the secret $ID$ of the RFID tag, which is the value the protocol is
designed to conceal. The attack is described initially for recovering $\lfloor
log_2(96) \rfloor=6$ bits of the secret value $ID$, a result that by itself
allows to mount traceability attacks on any given tag. However, the proposed
scheme can be extended to obtain any amount of bits of the secret $ID$,
provided a sufficiently large number of successful consecutive sessions are
eavesdropped. We also present results on the attack's efficiency, and some
ideas to secure this version of the SASI protocol.
