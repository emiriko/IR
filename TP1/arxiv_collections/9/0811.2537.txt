Cascade decays of Supersymmetric (SUSY) particles are likely to be prolific
sources of Higgs bosons at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In this work, we
explore, with the help of detailed simulation, the role of non-universal
gaugino masses in the production of the Higgs bosons under SUSY cascades. The
analysis is carried out by choosing an appropriate set of benchmark points with
non-universal gaugino masses in the relevant SUSY parameter space and then
contrasting the resulting observations with the corresponding cases having
universal relationship among the same. It is shown that even of data at an
early phase of the LHC-run with 10 fb$^{-1}$ one would be able to see, under
favourable situations, the imprint of non-universal gaugino masses by
reconstructing various Higgs boson resonances and comparing their rates. With
increased accumulated luminosities, the indications would naturally become
distinct over a larger region of the parameter space.
