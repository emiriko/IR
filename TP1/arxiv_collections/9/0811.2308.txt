The kinetics and microstructure of solid-phase crystallization under
continuous heating conditions and random distribution of nuclei are analyzed.
An Arrhenius temperature dependence is assumed for both nucleation and growth
rates. Under these circumstances, the system has a scaling law such that the
behavior of the scaled system is independent of the heating rate. Hence, the
kinetics and microstructure obtained at different heating rates differ only in
time and length scaling factors.Concerning the kinetics, it is shown that the
extended volume evolves with time according to alpha_ex=[exp(kappa Ct)]^m+1,
where t' is the dimensionless time. This scaled solution not only represents a
significant simplification of the system description, it also provides new
tools for its analysis. For instance, it has been possible to find an
analytical dependence of the final average grain size on kinetic parameters.
Concerning the microstructure, the existence of a length scaling factor has
allowed the grain-size distribution to be numerically calculated as a function
of the kinetic parameters.
