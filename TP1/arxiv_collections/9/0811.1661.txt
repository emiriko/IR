I review recent machine trends and algorithmic developments for dynamical
lattice QCD simulations with the HMC algorithm for Wilson-type fermions. The
topics include the trend toward multi-core processors and general purpose GPU
(GPGPU) computing, and improvements on the quark determinant preconditioning,
molecular dynamics integrator, and quark solvers. I also discuss the prospect
on the use of these techniques on the forthcoming petaflops machines.
