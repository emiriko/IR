We propose a scheme for the determination of the coupling parameters in a
chain of interacting spins. This requires only time-resolved measurements over
a single particle, simple data post-processing and no state initialization or
prior knowledge of the state of the chain. The protocol fits well into the
context of quantum-dynamics characterization and is efficient even when the
spin-chain is affected by general dissipative and dephasing channels. We
illustrate the performance of the scheme by analyzing explicit examples and
discuss possible extensions.
