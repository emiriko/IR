We present lifetime measurements of the $5D_{3/2}$ and $5D_{5/2}$ states of
rubidium using the time correlated single photon counting method. We perform
the experiment in a magneto-optical trap of $^{87}$Rb atoms using a two-step
excitation with the trap laser at 780 nm as the first step. We record the 761.9
nm fluorescence from the decay of the $5D_{3/2}$ state to the $5P_{1/2}$ state,
and measure the lifetime of the $5D_{3/2}$ state $\tau=246.3(1.6)$ ns. We
record the 420.2 nm fluorescence from the cascade decay of the $5D_{5/2}$ state
to the $5S_{1/2}$ state through the $6P_{3/2}$ state, and extract the lifetime
of the $5D_{5/2}$ state ${\tau}=238.5(2.3)$ ns.
