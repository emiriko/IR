A direct relation between the time dependent Milne geometry and the Rindler
spacetime is shown. Milne's metric corresponds to that one beyond Rindler's
event horizon (in the region $t \succ |x|)$). It was found that the shear
tensor from the dissipative term of the RHIC expanding fireball has the same
structure as that corresponding to the anisotropic fluid from the black hole
interior, even though the latter geometry is curved.
