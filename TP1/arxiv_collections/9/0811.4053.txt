Nuclear electron capture rate from continuum in an astrophysical plasma
environment (like solar core) is calculated using a modified Debye-Huckel
screening potential and the related non-Gaussian q-distribution of electron
momenta. For q=1 the well-known Debye-Huckel results are recovered. The value
of q can be derived from the fluctuation of number of particles and temperature
inside the Debye sphere. For 7Be continuum electron capture in solar core, we
find an increase of 7 -- 10 percent over the rate calculated with standard
Debye-Huckel potential. The consequence of this results is a reduction of the
same percentage of the SSM 8B solar neutrino flux, leaving unchanged the SSM
7Be flux.
