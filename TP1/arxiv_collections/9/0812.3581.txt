The finite element computation of structures such as waveguides can lead to
heavy computations when the length of the structure is large compared to the
wavelength. Such waveguides can in fact be seen as one-dimensional periodic
structures. In this paper a simple recursive method is presented to compute the
global dynamic stiffness matrix of finite periodic structures. This allows to
get frequency response functions with a small amount of computations. Examples
are presented to show that the computing time is of order $\log_2 N$ where $N$
is the number of periods of the waveguide.
