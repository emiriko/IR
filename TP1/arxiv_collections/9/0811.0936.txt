We derive transport equations for fermions and bosons in spatially or
temporally varying backgrounds with special symmetries, by use of the
Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. In a noninteracting theory the coherence
information is shown to be encoded in new singular shells for the 2-point
function. Imposing this phase space structure to the interacting theory leads
to a a self-consistent equation of motion for a physcial density matrix,
including coherence and a well defined collision integral. The method is
applied e.g. to demonstrate how an initially coherent out-of-equlibrium state
approaches equlibrium through decoherence and thermalization.
