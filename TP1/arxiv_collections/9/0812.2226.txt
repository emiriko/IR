This paper deals with the asymptotic study of the so-called canard solutions,
which arise in the study of real singularly perturbed ODEs. Starting near an
attracting branch of the "slow curve", those solutions are crossing a turning
point before following for a while a repelling branch of the "slow curve".
Assuming that the turning point is degenerate (or non-generic), we apply a
correspondence presented in a recent paper. This application needs the
definition of a family of functions $\phi$ that is studied in a first part.
Then, we use the correspondence is used to compute the asymptotic expansion in
the powers of the small parameter for the canard solution.
