We report, for the first time, quadrupole mass spectrometry of neutral and
positive ionic hydrocarbon species measured at the rf biased substrate
electrode of an inductively coupled plasma for acetylene rich C2H2:Ar mixtures
under various bias, frequency and pressure conditions. It has been observed
that, irrespective of initial gas mixture, the resultant plasma is dominated by
argon neutrals and ions. This is attributed to highly efficient conversion of
acetylene to C2H due to the enhanced electron density compared to a standard
capacitive plasma where the acetylene (neutral and ion) species remain
dominant. This conversion may be crucial to film formation via inert rather
than hydrocarbon ion bombardment. In addition, the transient formation of CH4
from acetylene has been discovered using IR absorption spectroscopy with time
constants similar to observed pressure variations. Rate coefficients and rates
for many of the reaction mechanisms, calculated using measured EEDFs and
species densities, are given. These results have important application in
plasma models and growth studies for hydrogenated amorphous or diamond-like
carbon film deposition. Film growth under similar plasma conditions is reported
in an associated paper along with ion energy distributions for important growth
species.
