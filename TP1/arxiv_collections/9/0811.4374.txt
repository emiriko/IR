We characterize all linear operators on finite or infinite-dimensional spaces
of univariate real polynomials preserving the sets of elliptic, positive, and
non-negative polynomials, respectively. This is done by means of Fischer-Fock
dualities, Hankel forms, and convolutions with non-negative measures. We also
establish higher-dimensional analogs of these results. In particular, our
classification theorems solve the questions raised in [9] originating from
entire function theory and the literature pertaining to Hilbert's 17th problem.
