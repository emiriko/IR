The p + 6Li --> eta + 7Be reaction has been investigated with an emphasis on
the eta meson and 7Be interaction in the final state. Considering the 6Li and
7Be nuclei to be alpha-d and alpha-3He clusters respectively, the reaction is
modelled to proceed via the p + d [alpha] --> 3He [\alpha] + eta reaction with
the alpha remaining a spectator. The eta meson interacts with 7Be via multiple
scatterings on the 3He and alpha clusters inside 7Be. The individual eta-3He
and eta-alpha scatterings are evaluated using few body equations for the eta-3N
and eta-4N systems with a coupled channel eta-N interaction as an input.
Calculations including four low-lying states of 7Be lead to a double hump
structure in the total cross section corresponding to the $L = 1 (J = (1/2)^-,
(3/2)^-)$ and $L = 3 (J = (5/2)^-, (7/2)^-)$ angular momentum states. The humps
arise due to the off-shell rescattering of the eta meson on the 7Be nucleus in
the final state.
