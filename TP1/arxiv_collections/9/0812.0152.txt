We consider spherical gravitational perturbations of AdS4 space-time
satisfying general boundary conditions at spatial infinity. Using the
holographic renormalization method, we compute the energy-momentum tensor and
show that it can always be cast in the form of Cotton tensor for a dual
boundary metric. In particular, axial and polar perturbations obeying the same
boundary conditions for the effective Schrodinger wave-functions exhibit an
energy-momentum/Cotton tensor duality at conformal infinity. We demonstrate
explicitly that this is holographic manifestation of the electric/magnetic
duality of linearized gravity in the bulk, which simply exchanges axial with
polar perturbations of AdS4 space-time. We note on the side that this
particular realization of gravitational duality is also valid for perturbations
near flat and dS4 space-time, depending on the value of cosmological constant.
