At LHC energies the Lorentz factor will be 3400 for the Pb + Pb collisions
and the electromagnetic interactions will play important roles. Cross sections
for the electromagnetic particle productions are very large and can not be
ignored for the lifetimes of the beams and background. In this article, we are
going to study some of the electromagnetic processes at RHIC and LHC and show
the cross section calculations of the electron-positron pair production with
the giant dipole resonance of the ions.
