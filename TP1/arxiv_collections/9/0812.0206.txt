We present experimental heat transport measurements of turbulent
Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection with rotation about a vertical axis. The fluid,
water with Prandtl number ($\sigma$) about 6, was confined in a cell which had
a square cross section of 7.3 cm$\times$7.3 cm and a height of 9.4 cm. Heat
transport was measured for Rayleigh numbers $2\times 10^5 <$ Ra $ < 5\times
10^8$ and Taylor numbers $0 <$ Ta $< 5\times 10^{9}$. We show the variation of
normalized heat transport, the Nusselt number, at fixed dimensional rotation
rate $\Omega_D$, at fixed Ra varying Ta, at fixed Ta varying Ra, and at fixed
Rossby number Ro. The scaling of heat transport in the range $10^7$ to about
$10^9$ is roughly 0.29 with a Ro dependent coefficient or equivalently is also
well fit by a combination of power laws of the form $a Ra^{1/5} + b Ra^{1/3}$.
The range of Ra is not sufficient to differentiate single power law or combined
power law scaling. The overall impact of rotation on heat transport in
turbulent convection is assessed.
