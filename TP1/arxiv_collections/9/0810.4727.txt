In this paper, we develop a computational approach for estimating the mean
value of a quantity in the presence of uncertainty. We demonstrate that, under
some mild assumptions, the upper and lower bounds of the mean value are
efficiently computable via a sample reuse technique, of which the computational
complexity is shown to posses a Poisson distribution.
