Infinitesimal holomorphic realizations for the Schr\"{o}dinger-Weil
representation and the discrete series representations of the Jacobi group are
constructed. Explicit expressions of the basic differential operators are
obtained. The squeezed states for the unitary irreducible representation of the
Jacobi group are introduced. Matrix elements of the squeezed operators,
expectation values of polynomial operators in infinitesimal generators of the
Jacobi group, the squeezing region and a description of Mandel's parameter are
presented.
