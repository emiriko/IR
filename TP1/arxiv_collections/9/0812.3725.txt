It has been shown three different views in relativistic thermodynamics can be
derived from the basic formulation proposed by van Kampen and Israel. The way
to decompose energy-momentum into the reversible and irreversible parts is not
uniquely determined, and different choices result in different views. The
effect of difference in the definition of a finite volume is also considered.
