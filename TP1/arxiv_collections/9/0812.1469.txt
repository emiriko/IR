Traditionally, the difference in binding energy from the experimental value
with respect to the theoretical liquid-drop model value, has been seen as
indication of independent-particle character along with magicity for particular
number of protons and neutrons. We study this carefully to demonstrate that it
actually indicates that the liquid-drop and the independent-particle phases of
the nucleus have equal fundamental primacy and coexist simultaneously in a
nucleus to provide a complete and a consistent description of the same.
