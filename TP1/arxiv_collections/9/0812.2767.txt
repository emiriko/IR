The boundary of the region in spacetime containing future-trapped closed
surfaces is considered. In asymptotically flat spacetimes, this boundary does
not need to be the event horizon nor a dynamical/trapping horizon. Some
properties of this boundary and its localization are analyzed, and illustrated
with examples. In particular, fully explicit future-trapped compact surfaces
penetrating into flat portions of a Vaidya spacetime are presented.
