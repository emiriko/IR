We report developments of the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method with improved
accuracy and increased versatility for the description of atomic diffusivity on
metal surfaces. The on-lattice constraint built into our recently proposed
Self-Learning KMC (SLKMC) [1] is released, leaving atoms free to occupy
Off-Lattice positions to accommodate several processes responsible for
small-cluster diffusion, periphery atom motion and hetero-epitaxial growth. The
technique combines the ideas embedded in the SLKMC method with a new pattern
recognition scheme fitted to an Off-Lattice model in which relative atomic
positions is used to characterize and store configurations. Application of a
combination of the drag and the Repulsive Bias Potential (RBP) methods for
saddle points searches, allows the treatment of concerted cluster, and multiple
and single atom motions on equal footing. This tandem approach has helped
reveal several new atomic mechanisms which contribute to cluster migration. We
present applications of this Off-Lattice SLKMC to the diffusion of 2D islands
of Cu (containing 2 to 30 atoms) on Cu and Ag(111), using interatomic potential
from the Embedded Atom Method. For the hetero system Cu/Ag(111), this technique
has uncovered mechanisms involving concerted motions such as shear, breathing
and commensurate-incommensurate occupancies. Although the technique introduces
complexities in storage and retrieval, it does not introduce noticeable extra
computational cost.
