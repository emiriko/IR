The Centurion-Halite experiment demonstrated the feasibility of igniting a
deuterium-tritium micro-explosion with an energy of not more than a few
megajoule, and the Mike test, the feasibility of a pure deuterium explosion
with an energy of more than 10^6 megajoule. In both cases the ignition energy
was supplied by a fission bomb explosive. While an energy of a few megajoule,
to be released in the time required of less than 10^-9 sec, can be supplied by
lasers and intense particle beams, this is not enough to ignite a pure
deuterium explosion. Because the deuterium-tritium reaction depends on the
availability of lithium, the non-fusion ignition of a pure deuterium fusion
reaction would be highly desirable. It is shown that this goal can conceivably
be reached with a "Super Marx Generator", where a large number of "ordinary"
Marx generators charge (magnetically insulated) fast high voltage capacitors of
a second stage Marx generator, called a "Super Marx Generator", ultimately
reaching gigavolt potentials with an energy output of 100 megajoule. An intense
10^7 Ampere-GeV proton beam drawn from a "Super Marx Generator" can ignite a
deuterium thermonuclear detonation wave in a compressed deuterium cylinder,
where the strong magnetic field of the proton beam entraps the charged fusion
reaction products inside the cylinder. In solving the stand-off problem, the
stiffness of a GeV proton beam permits to place the deuterium target at a
comparatively large distance from the wall of a cavity confining the deuterium
micro-explosion.
