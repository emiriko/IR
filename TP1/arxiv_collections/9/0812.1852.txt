Epitaxial LaRh1/2Mn1/2O3 thin films have been grown on (001)-oriented LaAlO3
and SrTiO3 substrates using pulsed laser deposition. The optimized thin film
samples are semiconducting and ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature close to
100 K, a coercive field of 1200 Oe, and a saturation magnetization of 1.7muB
per formula unit. The surface texture, structural, electrical, and magnetic
properties of the LaRh1/2Mn1/2O3 films was examined as a function of the oxygen
concentration during deposition. While an elevated oxygen concentration yields
thin films with optimal magnetic properties, slightly lower oxygen
concentrations result in films with improved texture and crystallinity.
