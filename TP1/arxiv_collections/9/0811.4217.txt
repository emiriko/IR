A uniqueness theorem is established for autonomous systems of ODEs,
$\dot{x}=f(x)$, where $f$ is a Sobolev vector field with additional geometric
structure, such as delta-monoticity or reduced quasiconformality. Specifically,
through every non-critical point of $f$ there passes a unique integral curve.
