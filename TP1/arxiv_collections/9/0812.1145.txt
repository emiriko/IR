A new scheme to calculate the exchange tensor
$\underline{\underline{J}}_{ij}$ describing in a phenomenological way the
anisotropic exchange coupling of two moments in a magnetically ordered system
is presented. The ab-initio approach is based on spin-polarised relativistic
multiple-scattering theory within the framework of spin-density functional
theory. The scheme is applied to ferromagnetic CrTe as well as the diluted
magnetic semiconductor (DMS) system Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$As. In the later case the
results show that there is a noticeable anisotropy in the exchange coupling
present, although not as pronounced as suggested in recent theoretical
investigations.
