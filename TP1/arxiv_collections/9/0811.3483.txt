We have synthesized a new superconductor ZnNyNi3 with Tc ~3 K. The crystal
structure has the same anti-perovskite-type such as MgCNi3 and CdCNi3. As far
as we know, this is the third superconducting material in Ni-based
anti-perovskite series. For this material, superconducting parameters,
lower-critical field Hc1(0), upper-critical field Hc2(0), coherence length
x(0), penetration depth l(0), and Gintzburg -Landau parameter k(0) have been
experimentally determined.
