Recent work suggested that head-to-head and tail-to-tail domain walls could
be induced to form in ferroelectric superlattices by introducing compensating
"delta doping" layers via chemical substitution in specified atomic planes
[Phys. Rev. B 73, 020103(R), 2006]. Here we investigate a variation of this
approach in which superlattices are formed of alternately stacked groups of
II-IV and I-V perovskite layers, and the "polar discontinuity" at the II-IV/I-V
interface effectively provides the delta-doping layer. Using first-principles
calculations on SrTiO3/KNbO3 as a model system, we show that this strategy
allows for the growth of a superlattice with stable polarized regions and large
polarization discontinuities at the internal interfaces. We also generalize a
Wannier-based definition of layer polarizations in perovskite superlattices
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 107602 (2006)] to the case in which some (e.g., KO or
NbO2) layers are non-neutral, and apply this method to quantify the local
variations in polarization in the proposed SrTiO3/KNbO3 superlattice system.
