We study the robustness of functionals of probability distributions such as
the R\'enyi and nonadditive S_q entropies, as well as the q-expectation values
under small variations of the distributions. We focus on three important types
of distribution functions, namely (i) continuous bounded (ii) discrete with
finite number of states, and (iii) discrete with infinite number of states. The
physical concept of robustness is contrasted with the mathematically stronger
condition of stability and Lesche-stability for functionals. We explicitly
demonstrate that, in the case of continuous distributions, once unbounded
distributions and those leading to negative entropy are excluded, both Renyi
and nonadditive S_q entropies as well as the q-expectation values are robust.
For the discrete finite case, the Renyi and nonadditive S_q entropies and the
q-expectation values are robust. For the infinite discrete case, where both
Renyi entropy and q-expectations are known to violate Lesche-stability and
stability respectively, we show that one can nevertheless state conditions
which guarantee physical robustness.
