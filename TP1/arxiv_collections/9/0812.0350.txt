We prove that bootstrap type Monte Carlo particle filters approximate the
optimal nonlinear filter in a time average sense uniformly with respect to the
time horizon when the signal is ergodic and the particle system satisfies a
tightness property. The latter is satisfied without further assumptions when
the signal state space is compact, as well as in the noncompact setting when
the signal is geometrically ergodic and the observations satisfy additional
regularity assumptions.
