The 7.6-eV-isomer of Thorium-229 offers the opportunity to perform high
resolution laser spectroscopy of a nuclear transition. We give a brief review
of the investigations of this isomer. The nuclear resonance connecting ground
state and isomer may be used as the reference of an optical clock of very high
accuracy using trapped and laser-cooled thorium ions, or in a compact
solid-state optical frequency standard of high stability.
