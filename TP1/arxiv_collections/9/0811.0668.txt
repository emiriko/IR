We study radial excitations of pseudoscalar and vector (q bar q) mesons
within a chiral approach. We derive a general form for a chiral Lagrangian
describing processes involving excited pseudoscalar and vector mesons. The
parameters of the chiral Lagrangian are fitted using data and previous
calculations in the framework of the 3P0 model. Finite-width effects are
examined and predictions for mesons previously not discussed are given.
Available experimental data is analyzed whenever possible. Possible hints for
exotic mesons and open interpretation-issues are discussed.
