Berry phase in a single quantum dot with Rashba spin-orbit coupling is
investigated theoretically. Berry phases as functions of magnetic field
strength, dot size, spin-orbit coupling and photon-spin coupling constants are
evaluated. It is shown that the Berry phase will alter dramatically from 0 to
$2\pi$ as the magnetic field strength increases. The threshold of magnetic
field depends on the dot size and the spin-orbit coupling constant.
