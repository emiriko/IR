We recently proposed a dynamical mesoscopic model for DNA, which is based,
like statistical ones, on site-dependent finite stacking and pairing
enthalpies. In the present article, we first describe how the parameters of
this model are varied to get predictions in better agreement with experimental
results that were not addressed up to now, like mechanical unzipping, the
evolution of the critical temperature with sequence length, and temperature
resolution. We show that the model with the new parameters provides results
that are in quantitative agreement with those obtained from statistical models.
Investigation of the critical properties of the dynamical model suggests that
DNA denaturation looks like a first-order phase transition in a broad
temperature interval, but that there necessarily exists, very close to the
critical temperature, a crossover to another regime. The exact nature of the
melting dynamics in this second regime still has to be elucidated. We finally
point out that the descriptions of the physics of the melting transition
inferred from statistical and dynamical models are not completely identical and
discuss the relevance of our model from the biological point of view.
