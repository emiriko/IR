The algebra of observables associated with a quantum field theory is
invariant under the connected component of the Lorentz group and under parity
reversal, but it is not invariant under time reversal. If we take general
covariance seriously as a long-term goal, the algebra of observables should be
time-reversal invariant, and any breaking of time-reversal symmetry will have
to be described by the state over the algebra. In consequence, the modified
algebra of observables is a presentation of a classical continuous random
field.
