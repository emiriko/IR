Renormalization techniques in perturbative quantum field theory were known,
from their inception, to have a strong combinatorial content emphasized, among
others, by Zimmermann's celebrated forest formula. The present article reports
on recent advances on the subject, featuring the role played by the Dynkin
operators (actually their extension to the Hopf algebraic setting) at two
crucial levels of renormalization, namely the Bogolioubov recursion and the
renormalization group (RG) equations. For that purpose, an iterated integrals
toy model is introduced to emphasize how the operators appear naturally in the
setting of renormalization group analysis. The toy model, in spite of its
simplicity, captures many key features of recent approaches to RG equations in
pQFT, including the construction of a universal Galois group for quantum field
theories.
