It is an increasingly important problem to study conditions on the structure
of a network that guarantee a given behavior for its underlying dynamical
system. In this paper we report that a Boolean network may fall within the
chaotic regime, even under the simultaneous assumption of several conditions
which in randomized studies have been separately shown to correlate with
ordered behavior. These properties include using at most two inputs for every
variable, using biased and canalyzing regulatory functions, and restricting the
number of negative feedback loops.
  We also prove for n-dimensional Boolean networks that if in addition the
number of outputs for each variable is bounded and there exist periodic orbits
of length c^n for c sufficiently close to 2, any network with these properties
must have a large proportion of variables that simply copy previous values of
other variables. Such systems share a structural similarity to a relatively
small Turing machine acting on one or several tapes.
