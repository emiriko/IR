We report on a self-consistent calculation of the in-medium spectral
functions of the rho and omega mesons at finite baryon density. The
corresponding in-medium dilepton spectrum is generated and compared with HADES
data. We find that an iterative calculation of the vector meson spectral
functions provides a reasonable description of the experimental data.
