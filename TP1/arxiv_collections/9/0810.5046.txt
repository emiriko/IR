We investigate the zero-temperature properties of a superfluid Bose-Fermi
mixture by introducing a set of coupled Galilei-invariant nonlinear
Schr\"odinger equations valid from weak-coupling to unitarity. The Bose
dynamics is described by a Gross-Pitaevskii-type equation including
beyond-mean-field corrections possessing the correct weak-coupling and
unitarity limits. The dynamics of the two-component Fermi superfluid is
described by a density-functional equation including beyond-mean-field terms
with correct weak-coupling and unitarity limits. The present set of equations
is equivalent to the equations of generalized superfluid hydrodynamics, which
take into account also surface effects. The equations describe the mixture
properly as the Bose-Bose repulsive (positive) and Fermi-Fermi attractive
(negative) scattering lengths are varied from zero to infinity in the presence
of a Bose-Fermi interaction. The present model is tested numerically as the
Bose-Bose and Fermi-Fermi scattering lengths are varied over wide ranges
covering the weak-coupling to unitarity transition.
