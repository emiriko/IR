Single crystals of SrFe2As2 grown using a self-flux solution method were
characterized via x-ray, transport and magnetization studies, revealing a
superconducting phase below T_c = 21 K characterized by a full electrical
resistivity transition and partial diamagnetic screening. The reversible
destruction and reinstatement of this phase by heat treatment and mechanical
deformation studies, along with single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements,
indicate that internal crystallographic strain originating from c-axis-oriented
planar defects plays a central role in promoting the appearance of
superconductivity under ambient pressure conditions in ~90% of as-grown
crystals. The appearance of a ferromagnetic moment with magnitude proportional
to the tunable superconducting volume fraction suggests that these phenomena
are both stabilized by lattice distortion.
