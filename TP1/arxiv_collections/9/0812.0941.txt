We first recall that the system of fluid mechanics equations (Euler and
continuity) that describes a fluid in irrotational motion subjected to a
generalized quantum potential (in which the constant is no longer reduced to
the standard quantum constant hbar) is equivalent to a generalized Schrodinger
equation. Then we show that, even in the case of the presence of vorticity, it
is also possible to obtain, for a large class of systems, a Schrodinger-like
equation of the vectorial field type from the continuity and Euler equations
including a quantum potential. The same kind of transformation also applies to
a classical charged fluid subjected to an electromagnetic field and to an
additional potential having the form of a quantum potential. Such a fluid can
therefore be described by an equation of the Ginzburg-Landau type, and is
expected to show some superconducting-like properties. Moreover, a Schrodinger
form can be obtained for the fluctuating rotational motion of a solid. In this
case the mass is replaced by the tensor of inertia, and a generalized form of
the quantum potential is derived. We finally reconsider the case of a standard
diffusion process, and we show that, after a change of variable, the diffusion
equation can also be given the form of a continuity and Euler system including
an additional potential energy. Since this potential is exactly the opposite of
a quantum potential, the quantum behavior may be considered, in this context,
as an anti-diffusion.
