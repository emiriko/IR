This chapter introduces and elaborates on the fruitful interplay of coding
theory and algebraic combinatorics, with most of the focus on the interaction
of codes with combinatorial designs, finite geometries, simple groups, sphere
packings, kissing numbers, lattices, and association schemes. In particular,
special interest is devoted to the relationship between codes and combinatorial
designs. We describe and recapitulate important results in the development of
the state of the art. In addition, we give illustrative examples and
constructions, and highlight recent advances. Finally, we provide a collection
of significant open problems and challenges concerning future research.
