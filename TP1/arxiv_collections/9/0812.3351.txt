We studied the quantum oscillations in superconducting vortex mixed states
with d-wave pairing. We showed that the Onsager relation does not always apply.
Furthermore, at mean field level the quantum oscillations from electron pockets
are suppressed by the pairing. We conclude that an interpretation of the
experimental results asccoming from the four hole pockets created by a
$(\pi,\pi)$ folding cannot be ruled out.
