We investigate the spin accumulation effect in eccentric semiconductor
multichannel rings with Rashba spin-orbit interaction and threaded by a
magnetic flux. Due to the finite eccentricity, the spin polarization induced at
the borders of the sample is anisotropic and exhibits different patterns and
intensities at specific angular directions. This effect, reminiscent of the
spin polarization drift induced by the application of an in plane electric
field, could be used to manipulate and functionalize the spin polarization in
electronic nanorings.
