We present a quantum theory of cooling of a mechanical resonator using
back-action with constant electron current. The resonator device is based on a
doubly clamped nanotube, which mechanically vibrates and acts as a double
quantum dot for electron transport. Mechanical vibrations and electrons are
coupled electrostatically using an external gate. The fundamental eigenmode is
cooled by absorbing phonons when electrons tunnel through the double quantum
dot. We identify the regimes in which ground state cooling can be achieved for
realistic experimental parameters.
