In this work we calculate the decay rate of the electron type neutrinos into
$W$ bosons and electrons in presence of an external uniform magnetic field. The
decay rate is calculated from the imaginary part of the $W$ exchange neutrino
self-energy diagram but in the weak field limit and compare our result with the
existing one.
