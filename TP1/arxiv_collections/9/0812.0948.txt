We investigate dynamical properties of a one-component Fermi gas with
dipole-dipole interaction between particles. Using a variational function based
on the Thomas-Fermi density distribution in phase space representation, the
total energy is described by a function of deformation parameters in both real
and momentum space. Various thermodynamic quantities of a uniform dipolar Fermi
gas are derived, and then instability of this system is discussed. For a
trapped dipolar Fermi gas, the collective oscillation frequencies are derived
with the energy-weighted sum rule method. The frequencies for the monopole and
quadrupole modes are calculated, and softening against collapse is shown as the
dipolar strength approaches the critical value. Finally, we investigate the
effects of the dipolar interaction on the expansion dynamics of the Fermi gas
and show how the dipolar effects manifest in an expanded cloud.
