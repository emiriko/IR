We have studied the zero and low-temperature behavior of anisotropic
alternating antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic Heisenberg spin-1/2 chains in a
transverse magnetic field. Using the analytical spinless fermion approach, the
thermodynamic behavior of the model has been studied. We have introduced a new
order parameter to distinguish the gapless Luttinger liquid phase from the
other gapped phases. The exact diagonalization Lanczos results are also used to
compare with the spinless fermion ones. We have found a double peak structure
in the specific heat curves for the region between the two quantum critical
points. Using the numerical full diagonalization results, the existence of the
double peak structure is confirmed.
