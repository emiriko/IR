Using the adaptive time-dependent density matrix renormalization group, we
study the time evolution of density correlations of interacting spinless
fermions on a one-dimensional lattice after a sudden change in the interaction
strength. Over a broad range of model parameters, the correlation function
exhibits a characteristic light-cone-like time evolution representative of a
ballistic transport of information. Such behavior is observed both when
quenching an insulator into the metallic region and also when quenching within
the insulating region. However, when a metallic state beyond the quantum
critical point is quenched deep into the insulating regime, no indication for
ballistic transport is observed. Instead, stable domain walls in the density
correlations emerge during the time evolution, consistent with the predictions
of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism.
