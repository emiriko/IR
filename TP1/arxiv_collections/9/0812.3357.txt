We study the line shapes of radiative $\phi$-decays with a direct coupling of
the $\phi$ meson to the $f_{0}(980)$ and $a_{0}(980)$ scalar mesons. The latter
couple via derivative interactions to $\pi_0 \pi_0$ and $\pi_0 \eta$,
respectively. Although the kaon-loop mechanism is usually regarded as the
dominant mechanism in radiative $\phi$ decays, here we test a different
possibility: we set the kaon-loop to zero and we fit the theoretical curves to
the data by retaining only the direct coupling. Remarkably, satisfactory fits
can be achieved, mainly due to the effects of derivative interactions of scalar
with pseudoscalar mesons.
