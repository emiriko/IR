A version of the secretary problem is considered. The ranks of items, whose
values are independent, identically distributed random variables
$X_1,X_2,...,X_n$ from a uniform distribution on $[0; 1]$, are observed
sequentially by the grader. He has to select exactly one item, when it appears,
and receives a payoff which is a function of the unobserved realization of
random variable assigned to the item diminished by some cost. The methods of
analysis are based on the existence of an embedded Markov chain and use the
technique of backward induction. The result is a generalization of the
selection model considered by Bearden(2006). The asymptotic behaviour of the
solution is also investigated.
