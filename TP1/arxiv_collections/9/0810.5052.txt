We consider the heat equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions on the
tubular neighborhood of a closed Riemannian submanifold. We show that, as the
tube diameter tends to zero, a suitably rescaled and renormalized semigroup
converges to a limit semigroup in Sobolev spaces of arbitrarily large Sobolev
index.
