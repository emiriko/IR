We report upper critical field measurements in the metal-free-all-organic
superconductor $\beta''$-(ET)$_{2}$SF$_{5}$CH$_{2}$CF$_{2}$SO$_{3}$ obtained
from measuring the in-plane penetration depth using the tunnel diode oscillator
technique. For magnetic field applied parallel to the conducting planes the low
temperature upper critical fields are found to exceed the Pauli limiting field
calculated by using a semi-empirical method. Furthermore, we found a signature
that could be the phase transition between the superconducting vortex state and
the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state in the form of a kink just below the
upper critical field and only at temperatures below 1.23 K.
