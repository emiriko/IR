Covariant quantization of gauge theories generally requires the inclusion of
Fadeev Popov ghosts in the gauge-fixed Lagrangian. Normally these ghosts have
fermionic statistics, but in supersymmetric theories that include fermionic
gauge fields, there can also be ghosts with bosonic statistics. Since these
ghosts are scalar bosons, they can have vacuum expectation values (VEVs)
without violating Lorentz invariance. In particular, for the supersymmetric
group SU(2/3), one can choose a gauge with a Higgs-like bosonic ghost potential
that is minimized when one of the ghosts develops a VEV. This VEV breaks the
SU(2) x U(1) subgroup of SU(2/3) down to U(1) and spontaneously generates
vector boson masses, but without the "hierarchy" problems that accompany the
Higgs field. SU(2/3) also has an SU(3) subgroup, and unitarity requires that
the SU(3) gauge bosons must be confined. Since bosonic ghosts do not exist as
particles asymptotically, this kind of theory could be a possible explanation
if no Higgs Boson is detected at the LHC.
