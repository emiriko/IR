This communication reports the formation of complex Langmuir monolayer at the
air-water interface by charge transfer types of interaction with the water
soluble N- cetyl N, N, N trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) molecules doped with
rosebengal (RB), with the stearic acid (SA) molecules of a preformed SA
Langmuir monolayer. The reaction kinetics of the formation of RB-CTAB-SA
complex monolayer was monitored by observing the increase in surface pressure
with time while the barrier was kept fixed. Completion of interaction kinetics
was confirmed by FTIR study. This complex Langmuir films at the air-water
interface was transferred onto solid substrates at a desired surface pressure
to form multilayered Langmuir-Blodgett films. Spectroscopic characterizations
reveal some molecular level interactions as well as formation of
microcrystalline aggregates depending upon the molar ratios of CTAB and RB
within the complex LB films. Presence of two types of species in the complex LB
films was confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy.
