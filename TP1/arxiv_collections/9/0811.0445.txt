We calculate the nuclear modification factor for RHIC and LHC conditions
accounting for the radiative and collisional parton energy loss with the
running coupling constant.We find that the RHIC data can be explained both in
the scenario with the chemically equilibrium quark-gluon plasma and purely
gluonic plasma with slightly different thermal suppression of the coupling
constant. The role of the parton energy gain due to gluon absorption is also
investigated. Our results show that the energy gain gives negligible effect.
