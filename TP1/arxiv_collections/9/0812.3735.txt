The weak vector and axial-vector form factors have been investigated for the
semi-leptonic octet baryon decays in the chiral constituent quark model with
configuration mixing (\chiCQM_{config}). The effects of SU(3) symmetry breaking
and configuration mixing have also been investigated and the results are not
only in good agreement with existing experimental data but also show
improvement over other phenomenological models.
