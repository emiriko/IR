We reveal a generic mechanism of generating sign-alternating inter-site
interactions mediated by strongly correlated lattice bosons. The ground state
phase diagram of the two-component hard-core Bose-Hubbard model on a square
lattice at half-integer filling factor for each component, obtained by worm
algorithm Monte Carlo simulations, is strongly modified by these interactions
and features the solid+superfluid phase for strong anisotropy between the
hopping amplitudes. The new phase is a direct consequence of the effective
nearest-neighbor repulsion between "heavy" atoms mediated by the "light"
superfluid component. Due to their sign-alternating character, mediated
interactions lead to a rich variety of yet to be discovered quantum phases.
