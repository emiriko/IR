We propose a model for the dynamics of a social system, which includes
diffusive effects and a biased rule for spin-flips, reproducing the effect of
strategic choices. This model is able to mimic some phenomena taking place
during marketing or political campaigns. Using a cost function based on the
Ising model defined on the typical quenched interaction environments for social
systems (Erdos-Renyi graph, small-world and scale-free networks), we find, by
numerical simulations, that a stable stationary state is reached, and we
compare the final state to the one obtained with standard dynamics, by means of
total magnetization and magnetic susceptibility. Our results show that the
diffusive strategic dynamics features a critical interaction parameter strictly
lower than the standard one. We discuss the relevance of our findings in social
systems.
