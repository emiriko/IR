In Mod. Phys. Lett. A 9, 3119 (1994), one of us (R.D.S) investigated a
formulation of quantum mechanics as a generalized measure theory. Quantum
mechanics computes probabilities from the absolute squares of complex
amplitudes, and the resulting interference violates the (Kolmogorov) sum rule
expressing the additivity of probabilities of mutually exclusive events.
However, there is a higher order sum rule that quantum mechanics does obey,
involving the probabilities of three mutually exclusive possibilities. We could
imagine a yet more general theory by assuming that it violates the next higher
sum rule. In this paper, we report results from an ongoing experiment that sets
out to test the validity of this second sum rule by measuring the interference
patterns produced by three slits and all the possible combinations of those
slits being open or closed. We use attenuated laser light combined with single
photon counting to confirm the particle character of the measured light.
