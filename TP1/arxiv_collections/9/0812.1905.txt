We compare away-side hadron correlations with respect to tagged heavy quark
jets computed within a weakly coupled pQCD and a strongly coupled AdS/CFT
model. While both models feature similar far zone Mach and diffusion wakes, the
far zone stress features are shown to be too weak to survive thermal broadening
at hadron freeze-out. Observable away-side conical correlations are dominated
by the jet-induced transverse flow in near zone "Neck" region, which differs
significantly for both models. Unlike in AdS/CFT, the induced transverse flow
in the Neck zone is too weak in pQCD to produce conical correlations after
Cooper-Frye freeze-out. The observation of conical correlations violating
Mach's law would favor the strongly-coupled AdS/CFT string drag dynamics, while
their absence would favor weakly-coupled pQCD-based hydrodynamics.
