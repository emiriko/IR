In this paper we give a first attempt to define and study stable
distributions with respect to the weak generalized convolution, focusing our
attention on the symmetric weakly stable distribution. As in the case of the
classical convolution, characterization of distributions stable in the sense of
the weak generalized convolution depends on solving some functional equations
in the class of characteristic functions.
