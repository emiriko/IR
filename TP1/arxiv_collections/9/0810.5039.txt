The non-singular bouncing solution of loop quantum cosmology is reproduced by
a deformed minisuperspace Heisenberg algebra. This algebra is a realization of
the Snyder space, is almost unique and is related to the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e
one. Since the sign of the deformation parameter it is not fixed, the Friedmann
equation of braneworlds theory can also be obtained. Moreover, the sign is the
only freedom in the picture and these frameworks are the only ones which can be
reproduced by our deformed scheme. A generalized uncertainty principle for loop
quantum cosmology is also proposed.
