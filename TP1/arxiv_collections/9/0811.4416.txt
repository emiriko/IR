In this article I show why the fundamental constants obtain perturbative
corrections in higher orders, why the renormalizations work and how to
reformulate the theory in order to avoid these technical and conceptual
complications. I demonstrate that the perturbative mass and charge corrections
are caused exclusively with the kinetic nature of the interaction Lagrangian.
As soon as it is not purely quantum mechanical (or QFT) specific feature, the
problem can be demonstrated on a classical two-body problem. The latter can be
solved in different ways, one of them being correct and good for applying the
perturbation theory (if necessary) and another one being tricky and awkward.
The first one is physically and technically natural - it is a
center-of-inertia-and-relative-variable formulation. The second one - mixed
variable formulation - is unnecessarily complicated and leads to the mass and
charge corrections even in the Newtonian mechanics of two bound bodies. The
perturbation theory in QFT is factually formulated in the mixed variables -
that is why it brings corrections to the fundamental constants. This
understanding opens a way of correctly formulating the QFT equations and thus
to simplify the QFT calculations technically and conceptually. For example, in
scattering problems in QED it means accounting exactly the quantized
electromagnetic field influence in the free in and out states of charged
particles so no infrared and ultraviolet problems arise. In bound states it
means obtaining the energy corrections (the Lamb shift, the anomalous magnetic
moment) quite straightforwardly and without renormalizations.
