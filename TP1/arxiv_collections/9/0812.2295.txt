We present results on a Raman laser-system that resonantly drives a closed
two-photon transition between two levels in different hyperfine ground states
of 87Rb. The coupler is based on a novel optical design for producing two
phase-coherent optical beams to drive a Raman transition. Operated as an
outcoupler, it produces an atom laser in a single internal atomic state, with
the lower divergence and increased brightness typical of a Raman outcoupler.
Due to the optical nature of the outcoupling, the two-state outcoupler is an
ideal candidate for transferring photon correlations onto atom-laser beams. As
our laser system couples just two hyperfine ground states, it has also been
used as an internal state beamsplitter, taking the next major step towards free
space Ramsey interferometry with an atom laser.
