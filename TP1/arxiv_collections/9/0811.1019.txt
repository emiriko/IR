We present rules for determining the number of physical parameters in models
with exact flavor symmetries. In such models the total number of parameters
(physical and unphysical) needed to described a matrix is less than in a model
without the symmetries. Several toy examples are studied in order to
demonstrate the rules. The use of global symmetries in studying the minimally
supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) is examined.
