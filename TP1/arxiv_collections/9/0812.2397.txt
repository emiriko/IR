Most signatures of new physics have been studied on the transverse plane with
respect to the beam direction at the LHC where background is much reduced. In
this paper we propose the analysis of inclusive longitudinal (pseudo)rapidity
correlations among final-state (charged) particles in order to search for
(un)particles belonging to a Hidden Sector beyond the Standard Model, using a
selected sample of p-p minimum bias events (applying appropriate off-line cuts
on events based on, e.g., minijets, high-multiplicity, event shape variables,
high-pT leptons and photons, etc) collected at the early running of the LHC. To
this aim, we examine inclusive and semi-inclusive two-particle correlation
functions, forward-backward correlations, and factorial moments of the
multiplicity distribution, without resorting to any particular model but under
very general (though simplifying) assumptions. Finally, motivated by some
analysis techniques employed in the search for Quark-Gluon-Plasma in heavy-ion
collisions, we investigate the impact of such intermediate (un)particle stuff
on the (multi)fractality of parton cascades in p-p collisions, by means of a
Levy stable law description and a Ginzburg-Landau model of phase transitions.
Results from our preliminary study seem encouraging for possible dedicated
analyses at the LHC and Tevatron experiments.
