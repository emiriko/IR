We present an X-ray photoemission study of the heavy-fermion system
CeCu$_{6-x}$Au$_x$ across the magnetic quantum phase transition of this
compound at temperatures above the single-ion Kondo temperature $T_K$. In
dependence of the Au concentration $x$ we observe a sudden change of the
$f$-occupation number $n_f$ and the core-hole potential $U_{df}$ at the
critical concentration $x_c=0.1$. We interpret these findings in the framework
of the single-impurity Anderson model. Our results are in excellent agreement
with findings from earlier UPS measurements %\cite{klein08qpt} and provide
further information about the precursors of quantum criticality at elevated
temperatures.
