A statistical analysis of the geometries of particle trajectories in the
supercooled liquid state is reported. We examine two structurally different
fragile glass-forming liquids simulated by molecular dynamics. In both liquids,
the trajectories are found to exhibit a long-range localisation distinct from
the short-range localisation within the cage of nearest neighbours. This novel
diffusion anomaly is interpreted as a result of the potential-energy landscape
topography of fragile glass-formers where the local energy minima coalesce into
metabasins - compact domains with low escape probability.
