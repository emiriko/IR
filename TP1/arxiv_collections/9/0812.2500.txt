The diffractive program of the CDF Collaboration at the Fermilab Tevatron
p-pbar collider is reviewed with emphasis on recent results from Run II at a
c.m.s. energy of 1.96 TeV. Results are presented on the x-Bjorken and Q^2
dependence of the diffractive structure function obtained from di-jet
production, on the slope parameter of the t-distribution of diffractive events
as a function of Q^2 in the range 1 GeV^2<Q^2<10^4 GeV^2, and on cross sections
for exclusive di-jet, e+e-, and di-photon production. The exclusive di-jet and
di-photon production rates are used to check theoretical estimates of exclusive
Higgs boson production at the Large Hadron Collider. Other data on soft and
hard diffraction from p-ppbar collisions, and also data from diffractive deep
inelastic scattering are presented and interpreted in the RENORM
phenomenological model, in which cross sections are obtained from the
underlying inclusive parton distribution function of the nucleon and QCD color
factors.
