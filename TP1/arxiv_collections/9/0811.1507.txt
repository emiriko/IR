We have performed soft x-ray and ultrahigh-resolution laser-excited
photoemission measurements on tetragonal FeSe, which was recently identified as
a superconductor. Energy dependent study of valence band is compared to band
structure calculations and yields a reasonable assignment of partial densities
of states. However, the sharp peak near the Fermi level slightly deviates from
the calculated energy position, giving rise to the necessity of self-energy
correction. We have also performed ultrahigh-resolution laser photoemission
experiment on FeSe and observed the suppression of intensity around the Fermi
level upon cooling.
