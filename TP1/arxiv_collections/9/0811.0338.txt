We report an x-ray diffraction study on the charge-density-wave (CDW)
LaTe$_3$ and CeTe$_3$ compounds as a function of pressure. We extract the
lattice constants and the CDW modulation wave-vector, and provide direct
evidence for a pressure-induced quenching of the CDW phase. We observe subtle
differences between the chemical and mechanical compression of the lattice. We
account for these with a scenario where the effective dimensionality in these
CDW systems is dependent on the type of lattice compression and has a direct
impact on the degree of Fermi surface nesting and on the strength of
fluctuation effects.
