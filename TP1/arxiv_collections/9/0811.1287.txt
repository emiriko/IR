We prove that aligned Petrov type D perfect fluids for which the vorticity
vector is not orthogonal to the plane of repeated principal null directions and
for which the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor with respect to the fluid
velocity has vanishing divergence, are necessarily purely electric or locally
rotationally symmetric. The LRS metrics are presented explicitly.
