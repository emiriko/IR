In this paper, we present the recent progress on minimally doubled lattice
actions. In particular, we discuss the proposal of Creutz and its variations on
an orthogonal lattice. A preliminary computation of the pion mass on an SU(3)
background field shows the expected behaviour as predicted form the chiral
perturbation theory.
