We report the first electrical manipulation and detection of the mesoscopic
intrinsic spin-Hall effect (ISHE) in semiconductors through non-local
electrical measurement in nano-scale H-shaped structures built on high mobility
HgTe/HgCdTe quantum wells. By controlling the strength of the spin-orbit
splittings and the n-type to p-type transition by a top-gate, we observe a
large non-local resistance signal due to the ISHE in the p-regime, of the order
of kOhms, which is several orders of magnitude larger than in metals. In the
n-regime, as predicted by theory, the signal is at least an order of magnitude
smaller. We verify our experimental observation by quantum transport
calculations which show quantitative agreement with the experiments.
