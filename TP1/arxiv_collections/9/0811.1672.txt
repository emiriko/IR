We report on our study of the free-fall expansion of a finite-temperature
Bose-Einstein condensed cloud of 87Rb. The experiments are performed with a
variable total number of atoms while keeping constant the number of atoms in
the condensate. The results provide evidence that the BEC dynamics depends on
the interaction with thermal fraction. In particular, they provide experimental
evidence that thermal cloud compresses the condensate.
