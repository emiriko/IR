We propose a scheme to generate an Abelian gauge field in an atomic gas using
two crossed laser beams. If the internal atomic state follows adiabatically the
eigenstates of the atom-laser interaction, Berry's phase gives rise to a vector
potential that can nucleate vortices in a Bose gas. The present scheme operates
even for a large detuning with respect to the atomic resonance, making it
applicable to alkali-metal atoms without significant heating due to spontaneous
emission. We test the validity of the adiabatic approximation by integrating
the set of coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations associated with the various
internal atomic states, and we show that the steady state of the interacting
gas indeed exhibits a vortex lattice, as expected from the adiabatic gauge
field.
