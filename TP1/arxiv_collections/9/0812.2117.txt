The influence of a transverse electric field in the specific heat of
triglycine sulphate (TGS) has been studied. The specific heat of TGS has been
measured heating the sample from ferroelectric to paraelectric phase after
prolonged transverse electric field (i.e. perpendicular to the ferroelectric
axis). It is shown that the specific heat of TGS can remember the temperature
$T_s$ at which the transverse field was previously applied.
