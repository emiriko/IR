We synthesized ACu3Ru4O12 (A = Na, Na0.5Ca0.5, Ca, Ca0.5La0.5, La) and
measured their DC magnetization, AC susceptibility, specific heat, and
resistivity, in order to investigate the effects of the hetero-valent
substitution. A broad peak in the DC magnetization around 200 K was observed
only in CaCu3Ru4O12, suggesting the Kondo effect due to localized Cu2+ ions.
However, the electronic specific heat coefficients exhibit large values not
only for CaCu3Ru4O12 but also for all the other samples. Moreover, the Wilson
ratio and the Kadowaki-Woods ratio of our samples are all similar to the values
of other heavy-fermion compounds. These results question the Kondo effect as
the dominant origin of the mass enhancement, and rather indicate the importance
of correlations among itinerant Ru electrons.
