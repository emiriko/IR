The ratio of central charges in four-dimensional CFTs has been suggested by
Hofman and Maldacena to lie within an interval whose boundaries are fixed by
the number of supersymmetries. We compute this ratio for a set of interacting
N=1 superconformal field theories which arise as RG fixed points of
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories with adjoint and fundamental matter. We do
not find violations of the proposed bounds, which appear to be saturated by
free field theories.
