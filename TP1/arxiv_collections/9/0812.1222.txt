We present Backlund transformations for the noncommutative anti-self-dual
Yang-Mills equation where the gauge group is G=GL(2) and use it to generate a
series of exact solutions from a simple seed solution. The solutions generated
by this approach are represented in terms of quasideterminants. We also explain
the origins of all of the ingredients of the Backlund transformations within
the framework of noncommutative twistor theory. In particular we show that the
generated solutions belong to a noncommutative version of the Atiyah-Ward
ansatz.
