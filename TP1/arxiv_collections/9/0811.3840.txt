A 2D Fully Frustrated XY(FFXY) class of models is shown to contain a new
groundstate in addition to the checkerboard groundstates of the standard 2D
FFXY model. The spin configuration of this additional groundstate is obtained.
Associated with this groundstate there are additional phase transitions. An
order parameter accounting for these new transitions is proposed. The
transitions associated with the new order parameter are suggested to be similar
to a 2D liquid-gas transition which implies Z_2-Ising like transitions. This
suggests that the class of 2D FFXY models belongs within a U(1) x Z_2 x
Z_2-designation of possible transitions, which implies that there are seven
different possible single and combined transitions. MC-simulations for the
generalized fully frustrated XY (GFFXY) model on a square lattice are used to
investigate which of these possibilities can be realized in practice: five of
the seven are encountered. Four critical points are deduced from the
MC-simulations, three consistent with central charge c=3/2 and one with c=1.
The implications for the standard 2D FFXY-model are discussed in particular
with respect to the long standing controversy concerning the characteristics of
its phase transitions.
