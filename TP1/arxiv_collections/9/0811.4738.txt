Subdiffusive transport in tilted washboard potentials is studied within the
fractional Fokker-Planck equation approach, using the associated continuous
time random walk (CTRW) framework. The scaled subvelocity is shown to obey a
universal law, assuming the form of a stationary Levy-stable distribution. The
latter is defined by the index of subdiffusion alpha and the mean subvelocity
only, but interestingly depends neither on the bias strength nor on the
specific form of the potential. These scaled, universal subvelocity
fluctuations emerge due to the weak ergodicity breaking and are vanishing in
the limit of normal diffusion. The results of the analytical heuristic theory
are corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations of the underlying CTRW.
