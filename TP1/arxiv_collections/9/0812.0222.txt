We present evidence of cavity quantum electrodynamics from a sparse density
of strongly quantum-confined Pb-chalcogenide nanocrystals (between 1 and 10)
approaching single-dot levels on moderately high-Q mesoscopic silicon optical
cavities. Operating at important near-infrared (1500-nm) wavelengths, large
enhancements are observed from devices and strong modifications of the QD
emission are achieved. Saturation spectroscopy of coupled QDs is observed at
77K, highlighting the modified nanocrystal dynamics for quantum information
processing.
