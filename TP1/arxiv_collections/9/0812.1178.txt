Current optical interferometers are affected by unknown turbulent phases on
each telescope. In the field of radio-interferometry, the self-calibration
technique is a powerful tool to process interferometric data with missing phase
information. This paper intends to revisit the application of self-calibration
to Optical Long Baseline Interferometry (OLBI). We cast rigorously the OLBI
data processing problem into the self-calibration framework and demonstrate the
efficiency of the method on real astronomical OLBI dataset.
