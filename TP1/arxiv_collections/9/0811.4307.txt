We study the nonequilibrium Casimir-Polder force on an atom prepared in an
incoherent superposition of internal energy-eigenstates, which is placed in a
magnetoelectric environment of nonuniform temperature. After solving the
coupled atom--field dynamics within the framework of macroscopic quantum
electrodynamics, we derive a general expression for the thermal Casimir-Polder
force.
