We give a method for constructing many examples of automorphisms with
positive entropy on rational complex surfaces. The general idea is to begin
with a quadratic Cremona transformation that fixes a reduced cubic curve and
then use the group structure on the cubic to understand when the indeterminacy
and exceptional behavior of the transformation may be eliminated by repeated
blowing up.
