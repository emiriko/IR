We determine the composition of intrinsic as well as extrinsic contributions
to the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in the isoelectronic L1o FePd and FePt
alloys. We show that the AHE signal in our 30 nm thick epitaxially deposited
films of FePd is mainly due to extrinsic side-jump, while in the epitaxial FePt
films of the same thickness and degree of order the intrinsic contribution is
dominating over the extrinsic mechanisms of the AHE. We relate this crossover
to the difference in spin-orbit strength of Pt and Pd atoms and suggest that
this phenomenon can be used for tuning the origins of the AHE in complex
alloys.
