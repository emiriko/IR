The auxiliary field method is a new and efficient way to compute approximate
analytical eigenenergies and eigenvectors of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. This
method has already been successfully applied to the case of central potentials
of power-law and logarithmic forms. In the present work, we show that the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation with exponential potentials of the form $-\alpha
r^\lambda \exp(-\beta r)$ can also be analytically solved by using the
auxiliary field method. Formulae giving the critical heights and the energy
levels of these potentials are presented. Special attention is drawn on the
Yukawa potential and the pure exponential one.
