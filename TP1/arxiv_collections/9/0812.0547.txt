We transform the oscillator algebra with kappa-deformed multiplication rule,
proposed in [1],[2], into the oscillator algebra with kappa-deformed flip
operator and standard multiplication. We recall that the kappa-multiplication
of the kappa-oscillators puts them off-shell. We study the explicit forms of
modified mass-shell conditions in both formulations: with kappa-multiplication
and with kappa-flip operation. On the example of kappa-deformed 2-particle
states we study the clustered nonfactorizable form of the kappa-deformed
multiparticle states. We argue that the kappa-deformed star product of two free
fields leads in similar way to a nonfactorizable kappa-deformed bilocal field.
We conclude with general remarks concerning the kappa-deformed n-particle
clusters and kappa-deformed star product of n fields.
