We analyze a system-level model for lytic repression of lambda-phage in E.
coli using reliability theory, showing that the repressor circuit comprises 4
redundant components whose failure mode is prophage induction. Our model
reflects the specific biochemical mechanisms involved in regulation, including
long-range cooperative binding, and its detailed predictions for prophage
induction in E. coli under ultra-violet radiation are in good agreement with
experimental data.
