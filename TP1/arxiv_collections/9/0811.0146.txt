This paper presents the current state of a work in progress, whose objective
is to better understand the effects of factors that significantly influence the
performance of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). A difficult task, which consists
in answering (French) biology Multiple Choice Questions, is used to test the
semantic properties of the truncated singular space and to study the relative
influence of main parameters. A dedicated software has been designed to fine
tune the LSA semantic space for the Multiple Choice Questions task. With
optimal parameters, the performances of our simple model are quite surprisingly
equal or superior to those of 7th and 8th grades students. This indicates that
semantic spaces were quite good despite their low dimensions and the small
sizes of training data sets. Besides, we present an original entropy global
weighting of answers' terms of each question of the Multiple Choice Questions
which was necessary to achieve the model's success.
