The exponentially decreasing signal to noise ratio in multibaryon correlators
is the main obstacle to a first principles, QCD-based calculation of the
nuclear force. Recently, we have proposed an orbifold boundary condition
("restless pions") that can dramatically improve this matter. Here we develop
the idea further by proposing an explicit algorithm that can be used with
purely periodic, "off the shelf" gauge configurations. We also discuss finite
volume corrections with the new boundary conditions and the use of the "Luscher
formula'' for the phase shifts.
