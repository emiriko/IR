In this paper, we study the valuation of American type derivatives in the
stochastic volatility model of Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2001). We
characterize the value of such derivatives as the unique viscosity solution of
an integral-partial differential equation when the payoff function satisfies a
Lipschitz condition.
