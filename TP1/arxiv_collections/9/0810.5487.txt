We consider simplicial polytopes, and more general simplicial complexes,
without missing faces above a fixed dimension. Sharp analogues of McMullen's
generalized lower bounds, and of Barnette's lower bounds, are conjectured for
these families of complexes. Some partial results on these conjectures are
presented.
