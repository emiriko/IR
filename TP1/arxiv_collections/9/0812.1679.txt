Astrophysical paradoxes are the paradoxes of physics. The main motivation of
a formulated paradox is clearly recognized in the scientific environment
because the phenomenon of a paradox itself has become interesting. There is an
explanation of how and why the phenomenon of paradox started to exist, as there
is an explanation for the existence of any phenomenon. A paradox has its
structure, which defines the functional aim of creating paradoxes. According to
the structure there are different types of paradoxes in astrophysics and some
of them are going to be classified and analyzed here. Astrophysical paradoxes
have mostly been solved or else there are theoretical premises for their
solution. Their structure is recognizable in two distinct ways that lead to the
solution through changing the paradigm or through a hierarchical sequence
ending in the solution.
