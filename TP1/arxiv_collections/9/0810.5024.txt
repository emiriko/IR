We investigate the Lagrangian terms of scalar-gauge interactions in a
weakly-coupled gauge theory beyond the ultraviolet momentum cutoff of models
where the collective symmetry breaking mechanism protects the Higgs mass
squared against having quadratic divergence. We also propose a five-dimensional
model in which the gauge symmetry breaking is achieved by boundary conditions
consistent with local gauge transformations. It is shown that the scalar-gauge
operators in the two models differ in the absence of quadratic divergence.
