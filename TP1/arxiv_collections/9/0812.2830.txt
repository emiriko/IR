We study the behavior of single atoms on an infinite vicinal surface assuming
certain degree of step permeability. Assuming complete lack of re-evaporation
an ruling out nucleation the atoms will inevitably join kink sites at the steps
but can do many attempts before that. Increasing the probability of step
permeability or the kink spacing lead to increase of the number of steps
crossed before incorporation of the atoms into kink sites. The asymmetry of the
attachment-detachment kinetics (Ehrlich-Schwoebel effect) suppresses the step
permeability and completely eliminates it in the extreme case of infinite
Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier. The average number of permeability events per atom
scales with the average kink spacing. A negligibly small drift of the adatoms
in a direction perpendicular to the steps leads to a significant asymmetry of
the distribution of the permeability events the atoms thus visiting more
distant steps in the direction of the drift.
