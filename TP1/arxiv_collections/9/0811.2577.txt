We deduce the mass of the pseudoscalar glueball $G$ from an
$\eta$-$\eta'$-$G$ mixing formalism based on the anomalous Ward identity for
transition matrix elements. With the inputs from the recent KLOE experiment, we
find a solution for the pseudoscalar glueball mass around $(1.4\pm 0.1)$ GeV,
which is fairly insensitive to a range of inputs with or without
Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka-rule violating effects. This affirms that $\eta(1405)$,
having a large production rate in the radiative $J/\Psi$ decay and not seen in
$\gamma\gamma$ reactions, is indeed a leading candidate for the pseudoscalar
glueball. Other relevant quantities including the anomaly and pseudoscalar
density matrix elements are obtained. The decay widths for $G\to \gamma\gamma$,
$\ell^+\ell^-$ are also predicted.
