In this paper we calculate the Einstein cosmological constant.Following our
results presented in monograph: From quark to bulk matter, we obtain the new
formula for the time dependent cosmological constant, lambda. Following the
general formula for time dependent lambda, we can describe the history of the
cosmological constant
