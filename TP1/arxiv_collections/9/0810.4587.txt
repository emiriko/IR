Based on suitable video recordings of interactive pedestrian motion and
improved tracking software, we apply an evolutionary optimization algorithm to
determine optimal parameter specifications for the social force model. The
calibrated model is then used for large-scale pedestrian simulations of
evacuation scenarios, pilgrimage, and urban environments.
