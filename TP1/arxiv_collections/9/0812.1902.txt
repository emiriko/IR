A neutrino mass matrix is considered under conditions of a CP invariance and
a small reactor mixing $\theta_{13}$ angle. Absolute mass values for three
neutrinos are evaluated for normal and inverted hierarchy spectra on the ground
of data for oscillation mixing neutrino parameters and an effective neutrino
mass $m_{\beta\beta}$ related to a probability of neutrinoless two beta decay.
