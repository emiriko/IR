The magnetically driven superconductor-insulator transition in amorphous thin
films (e.g., InO, Ta) exhibits several mysterious phenomena, such as a putative
metallic phase and a huge magnetoresistance peak. Unfortunately, several
conflicting categories of theories, particularly quantum-vortex condensation,
and normal region percolation, explain key observations equally well. We
propose a new experimental setup, an amorphous thin-film bilayer, where a drag
resistance measurement would clarify the role quantum vortices play in the
transition, and hence decisively point to the correct picture. We provide a
thorough analysis of the device, which shows that the vortex paradigm gives
rise to a drag with an opposite sign and orders of magnitude larger than the
drag measured if competing paradigms apply.
