In this paper we establish optimal pointwise decay estimates for
non-dispersive (compact) radial solutions to non-linear wave equations in 3
dimensions, in the energy supercritical range. As an application, we show for
the full energy supercritical range, in the defocusing case, that if the scale
invariant Sobolev norm of a radial solution remains bounded in its maximal
interval of existence, then the solution must exist for all times and scatter.
