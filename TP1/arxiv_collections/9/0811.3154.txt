We study the transient statistical properties of short and long Josephson
junctions under the influence of thermal and correlated fluctuations. In
particular, we investigate the lifetime of the superconductive metastable state
finding the presence of noise induced phenomena. For short Josephson junctions
we investigate the lifetime as a function both of the frequency of the current
driving signal and the noise intensity and we find how these noise-induced
effects are modified by the presence of a correlated noise source. For long
Josephson junctions we integrate numerically the sine-Gordon equation
calculating the lifetime as a function of the length of the junction both for
inhomogeneous and homogeneous bias current distributions. We obtain a
nonmonotonic behavior of the lifetime as a function of the frequency of the
current driving signal and the correlation time of the noise. Moreover we find
two maxima in the nonmonotonic behaviour of the mean escape time as a function
of the correlated noise intensity.
