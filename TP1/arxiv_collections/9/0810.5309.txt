We investigate the propagation of temperature perturbations in an array of
coupled nonlinear oscillators at finite temperature. We evaluate the response
function at equilibrium and show how the memory effects affect the diffusion
properties. A comparison with nonequilibrium simulations reveals that the
telegraph equation provides a reliable interpretative paradigm for describing
quantitatively the propagation of a heat pulse at the macroscopic level. The
results could be of help in understanding and modeling energy transport in
individual nanotubes.
