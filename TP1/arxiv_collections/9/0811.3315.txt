The equilibrium three dimensional shape of relatively short loops of DNA is
studied using an elastic model that takes into account anisotropy in bending
rigidities. Using a reasonable estimate for the anisotropy, it is found that
cyclized DNA with lengths that are not integer multiples of the pitch take on
nontrivial shapes that involve bending out of planes and formation of kinks.
The effect of sequence inhomogeneity on the shape of DNA is addressed, and
shown to enhance the geometrical features. These findings could shed some light
on the role of DNA conformation in protein--DNA interactions.
