For Paradigm models, evolution is just-in-time specified coordination
conducted by a special reusable component McPal. Evolution can be treated
consistently and on-the-fly through Paradigm's constraint orchestration, also
for originally unforeseen evolution. UML-like diagrams visually supplement such
migration, as is illustrated for the case of a critical section solution
evolving into a pipeline architecture.
