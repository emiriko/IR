An octopus program is demonstrated to generate electron energy levels in
three-dimensional geometrical potential wells. The wells are modeled to have
shapes similar to cone, pyramid and truncated-pyramid. To simulate the electron
energy levels in quantum mechanical scheme like the ones in parabolic band
approximation scheme, the program is run initially to find a suitable electron
mass fraction that can produce ground-state energies in the wells as close to
those in quantum dots as possible and further to simulate excited-state
energies. The programs also produce wavefunctions for exploring and determining
their degeneracies and vibrational normal modes.
