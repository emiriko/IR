We show that in general a spacetime having a quantum group symmetry has also
a scale dependent fractal dimension which deviates from its classical value at
short scales, a phenomenon that resembles what observed in some approaches to
quantum gravity. In particular we analyze the cases of a quantum sphere and of
$\k$-Minkowski, the latter being relevant in the context of quantum gravity.
