This paper introduces the parallel hierarchical sampler (PHS), a Markov chain
Monte Carlo algorithm using several chains simultaneously. The connections
between PHS and the parallel tempering (PT) algorithm are illustrated,
convergence of PHS joint transition kernel is proved and and its practical
advantages are emphasized. We illustrate the inferences obtained using PHS,
parallel tempering and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for three Bayesian
model selection problems, namely Gaussian clustering, the selection of
covariates for a linear regression model and the selection of the structure of
a treed survival model.
