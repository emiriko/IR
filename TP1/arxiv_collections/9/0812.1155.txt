Simulating the evolution of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) epidemic
requires a detailed description of the population network, especially for small
populations in which individuals can be represented in detail and accuracy. In
this paper, we introduce the concept of a Complex Agent Network(CAN) to model
the HIV epidemics by combining agent-based modelling and complex networks, in
which agents represent individuals that have sexual interactions. The
applicability of CANs is demonstrated by constructing and executing a detailed
HIV epidemic model for men who have sex with men (MSM) in Amsterdam, including
a distinction between steady and casual relationships. We focus on MSM contacts
because they play an important role in HIV epidemics and have been tracked in
Amsterdam for a long time. Our experiments show good correspondence between the
historical data of the Amsterdam cohort and the simulation results.
