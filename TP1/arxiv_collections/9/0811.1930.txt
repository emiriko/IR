We investigate the least common multiple of all subdeterminants, lcmd(A x B),
of a Kronecker product of matrices, of which one is an integral matrix A with
two columns and the other is the incidence matrix of a complete graph with n
vertices. We prove that this quantity is the least common multiple of lcmd(A)
to the power n-1 and certain binomial functions of the entries of A.
