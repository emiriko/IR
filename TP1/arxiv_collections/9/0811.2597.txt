Quantum expanders are a quantum analogue of expanders, and k-tensor product
expanders are a generalisation to graphs that randomise k correlated walkers.
Here we give an efficient construction of constant-degree, constant-gap quantum
k-tensor product expanders. The key ingredients are an efficient classical
tensor product expander and the quantum Fourier transform. Our construction
works whenever k=O(n/log n), where n is the number of qubits. An immediate
corollary of this result is an efficient construction of an approximate unitary
k-design, which is a quantum analogue of an approximate k-wise independent
function, on n qubits for any k=O(n/log n). Previously, no efficient
constructions were known for k>2, while state designs, of which unitary designs
are a generalisation, were constructed efficiently in [Ambainis, Emerson 2007].
