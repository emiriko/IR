Recently there has been a lot of interest in the search for extra dimensions.
If gravity propagates in extra dimensions then gravity would become as strong
as other interactions. This could also lead to the production of mini black
holes. Here we have discussed how even without considering extra dimensions
gravitational effects of weak interactions could show up at TeV energies.
