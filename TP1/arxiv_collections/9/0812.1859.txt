In this talk we will discuss how inflation can be embedded within a minimal
extension of the Standard Model where the inflaton carries the Standard Model
charges. There is no need of an ad-hoc scalar field to be introduced in order
to explain the temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background
radiation, all the ingredients are present within a minimal supersymmetric
Standard Model. For the first time inflaton properties can be directly linked
to the particle phenomenology, dark matter, and the baryons of the Standard
Model.
