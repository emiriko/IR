Models of self-organized criticality, which can be described as singular
diffusions with or without (multiplicative) Wiener forcing term (as e.g. the
Bak/Tang/Wiesenfeld- and Zhang-models), are analyzed. Existence and uniqueness
of nonnegative strong solutions are proved. Previously numerically predicted
transition to the critical state in 1-D is confirmed by a rigorous proof that
this indeed happens in finite time with high probability.
