We characterize a pair of Cooper-pair boxes coupled with a fixed capacitor
using spectroscopy and measurements of the ground-state quantum capacitance. We
use the extracted parameters to estimate the concurrence, or degree of
entanglement between the two qubits. We also present a thorough demonstration
of a multiplexed quantum capacitance measurement technique, which is in
principle scalable to a large array of superconducting qubits.
