The paper is of a methodological character and has as a goal to give a brief
description of the concept of theory and practical application of very slow
optical plasmons. They exist on the metal-dielectric boundaries, namely, on
very thin metal films and fibers and as standing waves on metal spheres and
ellipsoids. The material presented in the paper features by widening the common
concepts of electromagnetic modes of various spaces, of the probability of
spontaneous emission, of creation of optical images, of the limits of optical
focusing, and of the photon linear momentum. All mentioned studies are
completed in recent years. The problem of the photon momentum in a dielectric
medium was the topic of irreconcilable disputes for 100 years starting in the
time of appearing of Minkowski and Abraham famous papers. Various practical
applications are surveyed: the experiments with a great intensification of an
atom spontaneous emission into a plasmonic field mode of a metal nanoparticle,
the experiments on focusing optical radiation into a spot that substantially
smaller than a diffraction limited spot, a so called near perfect Pendry lens
that produces the image with details that substantially smaller than defined by
diffraction, and lastly, the concept of hundredfold and more magnification of a
photon mechanical linear momentum in a plasmon. The work completed is supported
