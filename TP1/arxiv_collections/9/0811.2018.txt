A synopsis exemplifying the employment of Dyson-Schwinger equations in the
calculation and explanation of hadron electromagnetic form factors and related
phenomena. In particular the contribution: presents the pion form factor
computed simultaneously at spacelike and timelike momenta; reports aspects of
the evolution of the nucleon and Delta masses with current-quark mass and the
correlation of their mass difference with that between scalar and axial-vector
diquarks; describes an estimate of the s-quark content of a dressed u-quark and
its impact on the nucleon's strangeness magnetic moment; and comments upon the
domain within which a pseudoscalar meson cloud can materially contribute to
hadron form factors.
