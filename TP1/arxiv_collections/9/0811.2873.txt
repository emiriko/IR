We study in detail some aspects of duality between type IIB and M-theory. We
focus on the duality between type IIB string theory on K3 x T^2/Z_2 orientifold
and M-theory on K3 x K3, in the F-theory limit. We give the explicit map
between the fields and in particular between the moduli of compactification,
studying their behavior under the F-theory limit. Turning on fluxes generates a
potential for the moduli both in type IIB and in M-theory. We verify that the
type IIB analysis gives the same results of the F-theory analysis. In
particular, we check that the two potentials match.
