Three fast generators of direct photons in the central rapidity region of
high-energy heavy-ion collisions have been presented The generator of prompt
photons is based on a tabulation of $p+p(\bar p)$ data and binary scaling. Two
generators of thermal direct photons, for hot hadron gas (HHG) and quark-gluon
plasma (QGP) scenarios, assume the 1+1 Bjorken hydrodynamics. SPS and RHIC data
can be fitted better by scenario with QGP. Predictions for the LHC energy have
been made. The generators have been realized as macros for the ROOT analysis
package.
