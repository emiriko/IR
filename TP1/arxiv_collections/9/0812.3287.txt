We report on the observation of interspecies Feshbach resonances in an
ultracold, optically trapped mixture of Rb and Cs atoms. In a magnetic field
range up to 300 G we find 23 interspecies Feshbach resonances in the lowest
spin channel and 2 resonances in a higher channel of the mixture. The
extraordinarily rich Feshbach spectrum suggests the importance of different
partial waves in both the open and closed channels of the scattering problem
along with higher-order coupling mechanisms. Our results provide, on one hand,
fundamental experimental input to characterize the Rb-Cs scattering properties
and, on the other hand, identify possible starting points for the association
of ultracold heteronuclear RbCs molecules.
