Two well-known databases of semantic relationships between pairs of words
used in psycholinguistics, feature-based and association-based, are studied as
complex networks. We propose an algorithm to disentangle feature based
relationships from free association semantic networks. The algorithm uses the
rich topology of the free association semantic network to produce a new set of
relationships between words similar to those observed in feature production
norms.
