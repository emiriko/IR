We give explicit formulas for the coproduct and the antipode in the
Connes-Moscovici Hopf algebra $\mathcal{H}_{\tmop{CM}}$. To do so, we first
restrict ourselves to a sub-Hopf algebra $\mathcal{H}^1_{\tmop{CM}}$ containing
the nontrivial elements, namely those for which the coproduct and the antipode
are nontrivial. There are two ways to obtain explicit formulas. On one hand,
the algebra $\mathcal{H}^1_{\tmop{CM}}$ is isomorphic to the Fa\`a di Bruno
Hopf algebra of coordinates on the group of identity-tangent diffeomorphism and
computations become easy using substitution automorphisms rather than
diffeomorphisms. On the other hand, the algebra $\mathcal{H}^1_{\tmop{CM}}$ is
isomorphic to a sub-Hopf algebra of the classical shuffle Hopf algebra which
appears naturally in resummation theory, in the framework of formal and
analytic conjugacy of vector fields. Using the very simple structure of the
shuffle Hopf algebra, we derive once again explicit formulas for the coproduct
and the antipode in $\mathcal{H}^1_{\tmop{CM}}$.
