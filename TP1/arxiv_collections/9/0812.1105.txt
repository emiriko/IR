We used Nuclear Track Detectors (NTD) CR39 and Makrofol for many purposes: i)
Exposures at the SPS and at lower energy accelerator heavy ion beams for
calibration purposes and for fragmentation studies. ii) Searches for GUT and
Intermediate Mass Magnetic Monopoles (IMM), nuclearites, Q-balls and
strangelets in the cosmic radiation. The MACRO experiment in the Gran Sasso
underground lab, with ~1000 m^2 of CR39 detectors (plus scintillators and
streamer tubes), established an upper limit for superheavy GUT poles at the
level of 1.4x10^-16 cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1 for 4x10^-5 <beta<1. The SLIM experiment
at the high altitude Chacaltaya lab (5230 m a.s.l.), using 427 m^2 of CR39
detectors exposed for 4.22 y, gave an upper limit for IMMs of ~1.3x10^-15 cm^-2
s^-1 sr^-1. The experiments yielded interesting upper limits also on the fluxes
of the other mentioned exotic particles. iii) Environmental studies, radiation
monitoring, neutron dosimetry.
