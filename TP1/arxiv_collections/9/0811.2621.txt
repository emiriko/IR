We present superconducting properties of single crystalline
Ba(Fe$_{0.9}$Co$_{0.1}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ by measuring magnetization, resistivity,
upper critical field, Hall coefficient, and magneto-optical images. The
magnetization measurements reveal fish-tail hysteresis loop at high
temperatures and relatively high critical current density above $J_{c}=10^{5}$
A/cm$^{2}$ at low temperatures. Upper critical field determined by resistive
transition is anisotropic with anisotropic parameter $\sim$ 3.5. Hall effect
measurements indicate that Ba(Fe$_{0.9}$Co$_{0.1}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ is a
multiband system and the mobility of electron is dominant. The magneto-optical
imaging reveals prominent Bean-like penetration of vortices although there is a
slight inhomogeneity in a sample. Moreover, we find a distinct
superconductivity above 25 K, which leads us to speculate that higher
transition temperature can be realized by fine tuning Co-doping level.
