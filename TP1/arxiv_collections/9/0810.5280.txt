A new model of quantum mechanics, Classical Quantum Mechanics, is based on
the (nearly heretical) postulate that electrons are physical objects that obey
classical physical laws. Indeed, ionization energies, excitation energies etc.
are computed based on picturing electrons as bubbles of charge that
symmetrically surround a nucleus. Hence, for example, simple algebraic
expressions based on Newtonian force balances are used to predict ionization
energies and stable excitation states with remarkable precision. One of the
most startling predictions of the model is that there are stable sizes of the
hydrogen atom electron (bubble diameter) that are smaller (called hydrinos)
than that calculated for the standard ground state. Experimental evidence in
support of this novel physical/classical version of quantum is alleged to be
found in the existence of super heated hydrogen atoms reported by many teams in
a variety of plasmas. It is postulated that the energy required for creating
super heated H aoms comes from the shrinkage of ground state H atoms to form
hydrinos. This claim is discussed with reference to a brief review of the
published studies of line broadening.
