We explore further the classical QGP using methods from classical liquids.
The partition function of an ensemble of SU(N_c) colored charge spheres is
constructed. We analyze it using a cumulant expansion (low density) and a loop
expansion (high temperature) after resumming the Debye screening effects. The
pertinent free energies are derived in both limits and compared to recent
molecular dynamics results.
