Using a model based on two elements: the Good-Walker mechanism for low mass
diffraction and multi-pomeron interactions for high mass diffraction, we obtain
an excellent description of all aspects of soft scattering at high energy. The
parameters of the model are determined by a fit to experimental data, giving
the slope of pomeron to be $\alpha'_{IP} \approx 0.01 GeV^{-2}$. We calculate
the survival probability of diffractive Higgs production, and obtained a value
for this observable, which is smaller than 1% for the LHC energy range.
