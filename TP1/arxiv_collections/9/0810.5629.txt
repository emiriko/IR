In this paper, we use canonical transformations to collectively analytically
continue the singularities of the simultaneous binary collision solutions for
the collinear four- body problem in both the decoupled case and the coupled
case. All the solutions are found and more importantly, we describe the
relationship between the decoupled solutions and the coupled solutions.
