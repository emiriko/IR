Neutrinoless double-beta decay searches play a major role in determining the
nature of neutrinos, the existence of a lepton violating process, and the
effective Majorana neutrino mass. The Majorana Collaboration proposes to
assemble an array of HPGe detectors to search for neutrinoless double-beta
decay in Ge-76. Our proposed method uses the well-established technique of
searching for neutrinoless double-beta decay in high purity Ge-diode radiation
detectors that play both roles of source and detector. The technique is
augmented with recent improvements in signal processing and detector design,
and advances in controlling intrinsic and external backgrounds. Initially,
Majorana aims to construct a prototype module containing 60 kg of Ge detectors
to demonstrate the potential of a future 1-tonne experiment. The design and
potential reach of this prototype Demonstrator module will be presented. This
paper will also discuss detector optimization and low-background requirements,
such as material purity, background rejection, and identification of rare
backgrounds required to reach the sensitivity goals of the Majorana experiment.
