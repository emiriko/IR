We study the manifestation of antiphase synchronization in a system of n
Rossler Oscillators coupled through a dynamic environment. When the feedback
from system to environment is positive (negative) and that from environment to
system is negative (positive), the oscillators enter into a state of anti phase
synchronization both in periodic and chaotic regimes. Their phases are found to
be uniformly distributed over 2$pi$, with a phase lag of 2$pi$ /n between
neighbors as is evident from the similarity function and the phase plots. The
transition to anti phase synchronization is marked by the crossover of (n-1)
zero Lyapunov Exponents to negative values. If the systems are individually in
chaotic phase, with strong enough coupling they end up in periodic states which
are in antiphase synchronization
