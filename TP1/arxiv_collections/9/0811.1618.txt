Airport gate assignment is of great importance in airport operations. In this
paper, we study the Airport Gate Assignment Problem (AGAP), propose a new model
and implement the model with Optimization Programming language (OPL). With the
objective to minimize the number of conflicts of any two adjacent aircrafts
assigned to the same gate, we build a mathematical model with logical
constraints and the binary constraints, which can provide an efficient
evaluation criterion for the Airlines to estimate the current gate assignment.
To illustrate the feasibility of the model we construct experiments with the
data obtained from Continental Airlines, Houston Gorge Bush Intercontinental
Airport IAH, which indicate that our model is both energetic and effective.
Moreover, we interpret experimental results, which further demonstrate that our
proposed model can provide a powerful tool for airline companies to estimate
the efficiency of their current work of gate assignment.
