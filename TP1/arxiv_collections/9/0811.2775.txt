We perform a detailed study of bosonic type IIA string theory in a large
light-cone momentum / near plane wave limit of $AdS_4 \times CP_3$. In order to
attain this we derive the Hamiltonian up to cubic and quartic order in number
of fields and calculate the energies for string excitations in a $R\times S^2
\times S^2$ subspace. The computation for the string energies is performed for
arbitrary length excitations utilizing an unitary transformation which allows
us to remove the cubic terms in the Hamiltonian. We then rewrite a recent set
of proposed all loop Bethe equations in a light-cone language and compare their
predictions with the obtained string energies. We find perfect agreement.
