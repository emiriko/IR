A new independence property of univariate beta distributions, related to the
results of Kshirsagar and Tan for beta matrices, is presented. Conversely, a
characterization of univariate beta laws through this independence property is
proved. A related characterization of a family of $2\times2$ random matrices
including beta matrices is also obtained. The main technical challenge was a
problem involving the solution of a related functional equation.
