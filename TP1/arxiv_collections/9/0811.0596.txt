We achieve a quantum speed-up of fully polynomial randomized approximation
schemes (FPRAS) for estimating partition functions that combine simulated
annealing with the Monte-Carlo Markov Chain method and use non-adaptive cooling
schedules. The improvement in time complexity is twofold: a quadratic reduction
with respect to the spectral gap of the underlying Markov chains and a
quadratic reduction with respect to the parameter characterizing the desired
accuracy of the estimate output by the FPRAS. Both reductions are intimately
related and cannot be achieved separately.
  First, we use Grover's fixed point search, quantum walks and phase estimation
to efficiently prepare approximate coherent encodings of stationary
distributions of the Markov chains. The speed-up we obtain in this way is due
to the quadratic relation between the spectral and phase gaps of classical and
quantum walks. Second, we generalize the method of quantum counting, showing
how to estimate expected values of quantum observables. Using this method
instead of classical sampling, we obtain the speed-up with respect to accuracy.
