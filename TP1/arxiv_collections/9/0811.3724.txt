Short wave equations were introduced in connection with the nonlinear
reflection of weak shock waves. They also relate to the modulation of a
gas-fluid mixture. Khokhlov-Zabolotskaya equation are used to describe the
propagation of a diffraction sound beam in a nonlinear medium. We give a new
algebraic method of solving these equations by using certain finite-dimensional
stable range of the nonlinear terms and obtain large families of new explicit
exact solutions parameterized by several functions for them. These parameter
functions enable one to find the solutions of some related practical models and
boundary value problems.
