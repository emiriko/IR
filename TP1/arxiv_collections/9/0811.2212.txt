We compute moments of distribution amplitudes using gauge configurations with
two flavors of clover fermions from QCDSF/DIK and operators which are optimized
with respect to their behavior under the lattice symmetries. The knowledge of
these quantities helps in understanding the internal structure of hadrons and
in the analysis of (semi-)exclusive processes. We present results for the
nucleon distribution amplitude which suggest that the asymmetries (the
deviations from the asymptotic form) are smaller than indicated by sum rule
calculations. Using the same approach we were also able to calculate the same
quantities for the $N^\star(1535)$, the parity partner of the nucleon. These
results show a stronger deviation from the asymptotic form.
