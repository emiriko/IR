We consider a one-dimensional quantum many-body system and investigate how
the interplay between interaction and on-site disorder affects spatial
localization and quantum correlations. The hopping amplitude is kept constant.
To measure localization, we use the number of principal components (NPC), which
quantifies the spreading of the system eigenstates over vectors of a given
basis set. Quantum correlations are determined by a global entanglement measure
$Q$, which quantifies the degree of entanglement of multipartite pure states.
Our studies apply analogously to a one-dimensional system of interacting
spinless fermions, hard-core bosons, or yet to an XXZ Heisenberg spin-1/2
chain. Disorder is characterized by both: uncorrelated and long-range
correlated random on-site energies. Dilute and half-filled chains are analyzed.
In half-filled clean chains, delocalization is maximum when the particles do
not interact, whereas multi-partite entanglement is largest when they do. In
the presence of uncorrelated disorder, NPC and Q show a non-trivial behavior
with interaction, peaking in the chaotic region. The inclusion of correlated
disorder may further extend two-particle states, but the effect decreases with
the number of particles and strength of their interactions. In half-filled
chains with large interaction, correlated disorder may even enhance
localization.
