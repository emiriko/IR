Recently, Nenadi\'c et al. (2004) proposed the RSA-CEGD protocol for
certified delivery of e-goods. This is a relatively complex scheme based on
verifiable and recoverable encrypted signatures (VRES) to guarantee properties
such as strong fairness and non-repudiation, among others. In this paper, we
demonstrate how this protocol cannot achieve fairness by presenting a severe
attack and also pointing out some other weaknesses.
