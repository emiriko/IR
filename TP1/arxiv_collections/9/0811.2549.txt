Superconductivity was discovered in a Ni0:05TaS2 single crystal. A Ni0:05TaS2
single crystal was successfully grown via the NaCl/KCl flux method. The
obtained lattice constant c of Ni0:05TaS2 is 1.1999 nm, which is significantly
smaller than that of 2H-TaS2 (1.208 nm). Electrical resistivity and
magnetization measurements reveal that the superconductivity transition
temperature of Ni0:05TaS2 is enhanced from 0.8 K (2H-TaS2) to 3.9 K. The
charge-density-wave transition of the matrix compound 2H-TaS2 is suppressed in
Ni0:05TaS2. The success of Ni0:05TaS2 single crystal growth via a NaCl/KCl flux
demonstrates that NaCl/KCl flux method will be a feasible method for single
crystal growth of the layered transition metal dichalcogenides.
