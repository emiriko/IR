The internal phase dynamics of a quantum system is revealed in details.
Theoretical and experimental evidences of existence of a causal relation of the
phase of the wave function with the dynamics of the quantum system are
presented sistematically for the first time. A new, dynamics-statistical
interpretation of the quantum mechanics is introduced. A particle-wave duality
picture incorporated in the wave function through its phase and amplitude is
considered.
