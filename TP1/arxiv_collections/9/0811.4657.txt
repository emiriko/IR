We consider a wrapped supermembrane around non-trivial two cycles of a
2-torus. We examine the double dimensional reduction and the T-dual
transformation to deduce Green-Schwarz type IIB superstring action for
(p,q)-strings directly from the wrapped supermembrane on the 2-torus. The
resulting action has the couplings with both the NSNS- and the RR-background
fields and has the tension of the (p,q)-string.
