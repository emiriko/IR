The objective of the present study is to present a computational model of the
motion of a single athlete in a team and to compare the resulting trajectory
with experimental data obtained in the field during competitions by match
analysis software. To this purpose, some results related to a paths ensemble of
a single player are discussed. Between each interaction it is assumed that he
follows a straight line and his motion is characterized by viscous, pushing and
pedestrian like force. A random force is supposed to influence only the
trajectory direction after each interaction. Furthermore it is assumed that the
time step between each interaction is a random variable belonging to a Gaussian
distribution. The main criteria is a selection of a function correlated to the
strategy of the player, around which, in a necessarily randomly way, a tactic
function should be added. The strategy depends on the players role: for the
numerical simulations in this paper, a forward player was selected, with the
average target to score. So it is straightforward to assume that the line
direction joining the player position and a point related to the goal, would be
the main strategy objective function around which a random angle A rand,
expression of the tactic objective function, influencing the direction selected
by the player until a next interaction could be introduced. The comparison
between both single and multiple experimental paths and figures obtained by the
numerical methodology proposed in this paper are very interesting, showing
common Brownian path structures.
