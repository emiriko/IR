In an earlier communication we have developed a recursion based approach to
the study of phase stability and transition of binary alloys. We had combined
the recursion method introduced by Haydock, Heine and Kelly and the our
augmented space approach with the orbital peeling technique proposed by Burke
to determine the small energy differences involved in the discussion of phase
stability. We extend that methodology for the study of MnCr alloys.
