We study the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state of spin
fluctuation mediated pairing, and focus on the effect of coexisting charge
fluctuations. We find that (i) consecutive transitions from singlet pairing to
FFLO and further to $S_z=1$ triplet pairing can generally take place upon
increasing the magnetic field when strong charge fluctuations coexist with spin
fluctuations, and (ii) the enhancement of the charge fluctuations lead to a
significant increase of the parity mixing in the FFLO state, where the
triplet/singlet component ratio in the gap function can be close to unity.
  We propose that such consecutive pairing state transition and strong parity
mixing in the FFLO state may take place in a quasi-one-dimensional organic
superconductor (TMTSF)$_2X$.
