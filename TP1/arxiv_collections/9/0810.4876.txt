Heavy quarks (charm and bottom) are good probes of the hot and dense medium
created in relativistic heavy ion collisions since they are mainly generated at
the beginning of collisions and interact with the media in all collision
stages. In addition, heavy flavor quarkonia production is thought to be
uniquely sensitive to the deconfined medium of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP)
through color screening. Heavy quark production has been studied by the PHENIX
experiment at RHIC via measurements of single leptons from semi-leptonic decays
in both the electron channel at mid-rapidity and in the muon channel at
forward-rapidity. Large suppression and azimuthal anisotropy of single
electrons have been observed in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s) = 200 GeV. These
results suggest a large energy loss and flow of the heavy quarks in the hot,
dense matter. The PHENIX experiment has also measured J/psi production up to
sqrt(s) = 200 GeV in p+p, d+Au, Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions, both at mid
(|y|<0.35) and forward (1.2<|y|<2.2) rapidities. In the most energetic
collisions (central Au+Au), more suppression is observed at forward rapidity
than at central rapidity. This can be interpreted either as a sign of quark
recombination, or as a hint of additional cold nuclear matter effects. The
current status and understanding of all these measurements will be reviewed.
