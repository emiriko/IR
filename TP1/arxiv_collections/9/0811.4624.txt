We present an ab-initio calculation of the longitudinal electron scattering
response function off 4He with two- and three-nucleon forces and compare to
experimental data. The full four-body continuum dynamics is considered via the
Lorentz integral transform method. The importance of the final state
interaction is shown at various energies and momentum transfers q. The
three-nucleon force reduces the quasi-elastic peak by 10% for q between 300 and
500 MeV/c. Its effect increases significantly at lower q, up to about 40% at
q=100 MeV/c. At very low q, however, data are missing.
