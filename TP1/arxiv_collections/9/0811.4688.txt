The single-top production cross section is one third that of the top-pair
production cross section at the LHC. During a year of data-taking, assuming an
average luminosity of 10^33 cm-2 s-1 and a CMS energy of 14 TeV, the
determination of the major contributions to the total single-top cross section
should be achievable. Comparisons between the measured cross sections and the
theoretical predictions will provide a crucial test of the standard model.
These measurements should also lead to the first direct measurement of |V_tb|,
with a precision at the level of a few percent. In addition, they will probe
for new physics via the search for evidence of anomalous couplings to the top
quark and the measurements of additional bosonic contributions to single-top
production. Methods developed to optimize the selection of single-top events in
the three production channels are presented and the potential for the cross
section measurements with 1 fb-1 and 30 fb-1 of integrated luminosity is
established.
