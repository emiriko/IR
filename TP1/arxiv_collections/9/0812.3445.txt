A topological insulator and its spin analogue as a gapped spin liquid have
characteristic low energy excitations (edge states) within the gap when the
systems have boundaries. This is the bulk-edge correspondence, which implies
that the edge states themselves characterize the gapped bulk spin liquid. Based
on the general principle, we analyzed the vector chirality phase of the
spin-1/2 ladder with ring exchange by using the edge states and the
entanglement entropy.
