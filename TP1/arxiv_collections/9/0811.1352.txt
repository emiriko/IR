Two-particle femtoscopy reveals the space-time substructure of the freeze-out
configuration from heavy ion collisions. Detailed fingerprints of bulk
collectivity are evident in space-momentum correlations, which have been
systematically measured as a function of particle type, three-momentum, and
collision conditions. A clear scenario, dominated by hydrodynamic-type flow
emerges. Reproducing the strength and features of the femtoscopic signals in
models involves important physical quantities like the Equation of State, as
well as less fundamental technical details. An interesting approximate
"factorization" in the measured systematics suggests that the overall physical
freeze-out scale is set by final state chemistry, but the kinematic
substructure is largely universal. Referring to previous results from hadron
and lepton collisions, we point to the importance of determining whether these
"universal" trends persist from the largest to the smallest systems. We review
theoretical expectations for heavy ion femtoscopy at the LHC, and point to
directions needing further theory and experimental work at RHIC and the LHC.
