We demonstrate how a certain new form of the quantization condition proposed
earlier can be used outside the class of potentials for which this form ensures
exact spectra. Taking this form as a base we get an improved interpolating
condition for the potential wells with coinciding an + and - infinities
asymptotical values. Accuracy of the above conditions is discussed.
