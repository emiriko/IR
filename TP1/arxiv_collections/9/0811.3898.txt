We study the spherical to prolate-deformed shape transition in $^{144-158}$Sm
and $^{146-160}$Gd isotopes with modern calculations beyond the mean field with
the Gogny D1S force. We compare the results with the shape-phase transition
predicted by the collective hamiltonian model and with the experimental data.
Our calculations do not support the existence of a first order phase transition
in these isotopic chains in the viewpoint of the Bohr hamiltonian neither the
interpretation of the nuclei N=90 as critical points.
