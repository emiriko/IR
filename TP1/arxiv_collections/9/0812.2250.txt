We deal with randomness-quantifiers and concentrate on their ability do
discern the hallmark of chaos in time-series used in connection with pseudo
random number generators (PRNG). Workers in the field are motivated to use
chaotic maps for generating PRNGs because of the simplicity of their
implementation. Although there exist very efficient general-purpose benchmarks
for testing PRNGs, we feel that the analysis provided here sheds additional
didactic light on the importance of the main statistical characteristics of a
chaotic map, namely, i) its invariant measure and ii) the mixing constant. This
is of help in answering two questions that arise in applications, that is, (1)
which is the best PRNG among the available ones? and (2) If a given PRNG turns
out not to be good enough and a randomization procedure must still be applied
to it, which is the best applicable randomization procedure?. Our answer
provides a comparative analysis of several quantifiers advanced in the extant
literature.
