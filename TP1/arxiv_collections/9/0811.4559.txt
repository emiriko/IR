VBFNLO is a fully flexible parton level Monte Carlo program for the
simulation of vector boson fusion, double and triple vector boson production in
hadronic collisions at next-to-leading order in the strong coupling constant.
VBFNLO includes Higgs and vector boson decays with full spin correlations and
all off-shell effects. In addition, VBFNLO implements CP-even and CP-odd Higgs
boson via gluon fusion, associated with two jets, at the leading-order one-loop
level with the full top- and bottom-quark mass dependence in a generic
two-Higgs-doublet model.
  A variety of effects arising from beyond the Standard Model physics are
implemented for selected processes. This includes anomalous couplings of Higgs
and vector bosons and a Warped Higgsless extra dimension model. The program
offers the possibility to generate Les Houches Accord event files for all
processes available at leading order.
