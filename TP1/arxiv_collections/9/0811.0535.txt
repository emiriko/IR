We study exotic static 3-body potentials, utilizing generalized Wilson Loops
in SU(3) lattice QCD. For the quark-antiquark-gluon techniques we address the
angles of 0, 45, 60, 90, 120, 135 and 180 degrees, between the quark-gluon and
the antiquark-gluon segments. We calculate the form of the static potential and
discuss whether, or not, two-body interactions exist between the three
different bodies, and study the existence of repulsion between the strings. We
also perform a first study of the interactions in the system of three gluon.
