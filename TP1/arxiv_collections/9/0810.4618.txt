An obstacle to the development of direct action version of electromagnetism
was that in the end it failed to fulfill its initial promise of avoiding the
problem of infinite Coulomb self-energy in the Maxwell theory of the classical
point charge. This paper suggests a small but significant modification of the
traditional direct action theory which overcomes that obstacle. Self-action is
retained but the associated energy is rendered finite and equal to zero in the
special case of null motion.
