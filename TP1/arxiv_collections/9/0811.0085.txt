Studies of quantum computer implementations suggest cellular quantum computer
architectures. These architectures can simulate the evolution of quantum
cellular automata, which can possibly simulate both quantum and classical
physical systems and processes. It is however known that except for the trivial
case, unitary evolution of one-dimensional homogeneous quantum cellular
automata with one qubit per cell is not possible. Quantum cellular automata
that comprise two qubits per cell are defined and their evolution is studied
using a quantum computer simulator. The evolution is unitary and its linearity
manifests itself as a periodic structure in the probability distribution
patterns.
