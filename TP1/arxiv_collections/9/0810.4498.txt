We report inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the phonon
density-of-states in superconducting Sr0.6K0.4Fe2As2 (Tc=30 K) and
Ca0.6Na0.4Fe2As2 (Tc=18 K). Compared with the parent compound BaFe2As2 doping
affects mainly the lower and intermediate frequency part of the vibrations.
Mass effects and lattice contraction cannot explain these changes. A lattice
dynamical model has been used to identify the character of the various phonon
bands. Softening of phonon modes below 10 meV has been observed in both samples
on cooling from 300 K to 140 K. In the Ca doped compound the softening amounts
to about 1 meV while for the Sr doped compound the softening is about 0.5 meV.
There is no appreciable change in the phonon density of states when crossing
Tc.
