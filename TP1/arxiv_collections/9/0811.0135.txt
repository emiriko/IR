This contribution deals with identification of fractional-order dynamical
systems. System identification, which refers to estimation of process
parameters, is a necessity in control theory. Real processes are usually of
fractional order as opposed to the ideal integral order models. A simple and
elegant scheme of estimating the parameters for such a fractional order process
is proposed. This method employs fractional calculus theory to find equations
relating the parameters that are to be estimated, and then estimates the
process parameters after solving the simultaneous equations. The data used for
the calculations are intentionally corrupted to simulate real-life conditions.
Results show that the proposed scheme offers a very high degree of accuracy
even for erroneous data.
