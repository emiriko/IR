We establish a link between the dual parametrization of GPDs and a popular
parametrization based on the double distribution Ansatz, which is in prevalent
use in phenomenological applications. We compute several first forward-like
functions that express the double distribution Ansatz for GPDs in the framework
of the dual parametrization and show that these forward-like functions make the
dominant contribution into the GPD quintessence function. We also argue that
the forward-like functions $Q_{2 \nu}(x)$ with $\nu \ge 1$ contribute to the
leading singular small-$x_{Bj}$ behavior of the imaginary part of DVCS
amplitude. This makes the small-$x_{Bj}$ behavior of $\im A^{DVCS}$ independent
of the asymptotic behavior of PDFs. Assuming analyticity of Mellin moments of
GPDs in the Mellin space we are able to fix the value of the $D$-form factor in
terms of the GPD quintessence function $N(x,t)$ and the forward-like function
$Q_0(x,t)$.
