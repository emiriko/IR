We remove the need for Laplace/inverse-Laplace transformations of
experimental data, by presenting a direct and straightforward mathematical
procedure for obtaining frequency-dependent storage and loss moduli
($G'(\omega)$ and $G"(\omega)$ respectively), from time-dependent experimental
measurements. The procedure is applicable to ordinary rheological creep
(stress-step) measurements, as well as all microrheological techniques, whether
they access a Brownian mean-square displacement, or a forced compliance. Data
can be substituted directly into our simple formula, thus eliminating
traditional fitting and smoothing procedures that disguise relevant
experimental noise.
