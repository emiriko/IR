The investigation of mixing phenomena and lifetime in neutral B meson systems
provides an important testing ground for standard model flavour dynamics.
Spectroscopic parameters has been used to calculate the pseudoscalar decay
constant and predictions of mixing mass parameters and lifetimes of the B$_{d}$
and B$_{s}$ mesons.
