We investigate the calorimetric liquid-glass transition by performing
simulations of a binary Lennard-Jones mixture in one through four dimensions.
Starting at a high temperature, the systems are cooled to T=0 and heated back
to the ergodic liquid state at constant rates. Glass transitions are observed
in two, three and four dimensions as a hysteresis between the cooling and
heating curves. This hysteresis appears in the energy and pressure diagrams,
and the scanning-rate dependence of the area and height of the hysteresis can
be described by power laws. The one dimensional system does not experience a
glass transition but its specific heat curve resembles the shape of the $D\geq
2$ results in the supercooled liquid regime above the glass transition. As $D$
increases, the radial distribution functions reflect reduced geometric
constraints. Nearest-neighbor distances become smaller with increasing $D$ due
to interactions between nearest and next-nearest neighbors. Simulation data for
the glasses are compared with crystal and melting data obtained with a
Lennard-Jones system with only one type of particle and we find that with
increasing $D$ crystallization becomes increasingly more difficult.
