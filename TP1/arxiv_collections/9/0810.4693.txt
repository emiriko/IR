The India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) collaboration is planning to build
a massive 50kton magnetised Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) detector, to study
atmospheric neutrinos and to make precision measurements of the parameters
related to neutrino oscillations. Glass Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) of
about 2m X 2m in size are going to be used as active elements for the ICAL
detector. We have fabricated a large number of glass RPC prototypes of 1m X 1m
in size and have studied their performance and long term stability. In the
process, we have developed and produced a number of materials and components
required for fabrication of RPCs. We have also designed and optimised a number
of fabrication and quality control procedures for assembling the gas gaps. In
this paper we will review our activities towards development of glass RPCs for
the INO ICAL detector and will present results of the characterisation studies
of the RPCs.
