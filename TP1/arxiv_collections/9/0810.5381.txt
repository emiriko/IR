The localization of sound sources by the human brain is computationally
simulated from a neurobiological perspective. The simulation includes the
neural representation of temporal differences in acoustic signals between the
ipsilateral and contralateral ears for constant sound intensities (angular
localization), and of volumetric differences in acoustic signals for constant
azimuthal angles (radial localization). The transmission of the original
acoustic signal from the environment, through each significant stage of
intermediate neurons, to the primary auditory cortex, is also simulated. The
errors that human brains make in attempting to localize sounds in
evolutionarily uncommon environments (such as when one ear is in water and one
ear is in air) are then mathematically predicted. A basic overview of the
physiology behind sound localization in the brain is also provided.
