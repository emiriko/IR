We discuss the alpha-muon sticking coefficient in the muon-catalysed d-t
fusion in the framework of the Constrained Molecular Dynamics model. Especially
the influence of muonic chaotic dynamics on the sticking coefficient is brought
into focus. The chaotic motion of the muon affects not only the fusion cross
section but also the muon-alpha sticking coefficient. Chaotic systems lead to
lar ger enhancements with respect to regular systems because of the reduction
of the tunneling region. Moreover they give smaller sticking probabilities than
those of regular events. By utilizing a characteristic of the chaotic dynamics
one can avoid losing the muon in the muCF cycle. W e propose that the
application of the so-called microwave ionization of a Rydberg atom to the
present case could lead to the enhancement of the reactivation process by using
X-rays.
