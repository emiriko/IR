Using Landau theory of Fermi liquids we calculate the dynamic response of
both a polarized and unpolarized normal Fermi gas at zero temperature in the
strongly interacting regime of large scattering length. We show that at small
excitation energies the {\it in phase} (density) response is enhanced with
respect to the ideal gas prediction due to the increased compressibility.
Viceversa, the {\it out of phase} (spin) response is quenched as a consequence
of the tendency of the system to pair opposite spins. The long wavelength
behavior of the static structure factor is explicitly calculated. The results
are compared with the predictions in the collisional and superfluid regimes.
The emergence of a spin zero sound solution in the unpolarized normal phase is
explicitly discussed.
