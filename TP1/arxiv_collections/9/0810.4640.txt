A generalized linear sigma model is employed to study the quark structure of
low lying scalar as well as pseudoscalar states. The model allows the possible
mixing of quark anti-quark states with others made of two quarks and two
antiquarks but no a priori assumption is made about the quark contents of the
predicted physical states. Effects of SU(3) symmetry breaking are included. The
lighter conventional pseudoscalars turn out to be primarily of two quark type
whereas the lighter scalars have very large four quark admixtures.
