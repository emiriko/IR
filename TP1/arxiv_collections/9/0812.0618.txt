We clarify thermodynamics of the Chaplygin gas by introducing the
integrability condition. All thermal quantities are derived as functions of
either volume or temperature. Importantly, we find a new general equation of
state, describing the Chaplygin gas completely. We confirm that the Chaplygin
gas could show a unified picture of dark matter and energy which cools down
through the universe expansion without any critical point (phase transition).
