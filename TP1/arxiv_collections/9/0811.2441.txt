An agent-based model of population dynamics is presented. The model has as
its expected behaviour the population dynamics of the equation-based Webworld
model, within which large communities of species can be grown on evolutionary
time scales. Such communities can be used in the agent-based model without
disrupting the food web structure, and hence a unified model of evolutionary
time and individual-based dynamics can be realised. Individuals encounter
potential prey, and optimal foraging strategies are arrived at through natural
selection.
