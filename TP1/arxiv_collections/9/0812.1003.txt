In amorphous superconductors, superconducting and vortex pinning properties
are strongly linked to the absence of long range order. Consequently,
superconductivity and vortex phases can be studied to probe the underlying
microstructure and order of the material. This is done here from resistance and
local magnetization measurements in the superconducting state of
Fe$_{x}$Ni$_{1-x}$Zr$_{2}$ metallic glasses with $0\leq x \leq 0.6$. Firstly,
we present typical superconducting properties such as the critical temperature
and fields and their dependence on Fe content in these alloys. Then, the
observations of peculiar clockwise hysteresis loops, wide double-step
transitions and large magnetization fluctuations in glasses containing a large
amount of Fe are analyzed to reveal a change in short range order with Fe
content.
