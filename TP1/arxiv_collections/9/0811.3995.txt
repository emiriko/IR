Searches for physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics are about
to enter a new era with the startup of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.
Prospects for R-parity conserving supersymmetry discovery and measurements with
the ATLAS detector at the LHC are presented. Methods for determining the
parameters of the underlying supersymmetry model and the relation to dark
matter estimation are discussed.
