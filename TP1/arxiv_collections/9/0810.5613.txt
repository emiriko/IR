A method to synchronize two chaotic systems with anticipation or lag, coupled
in the drive response mode, is proposed. The coupling involves variable delay
with three time scales. The method has the advantage that synchronization is
realized with intermittant information about the driving system at intervals
fixed by a reset time. The stability of the synchronization manifold is
analyzed with the resulting discrete error dynamics. The numerical calculations
in standard systems like the Rossler and Lorenz systems are used to demonstrate
the method and the results of the analysis.
