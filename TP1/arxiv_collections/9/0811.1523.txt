A set of general constructing schemes is unveiled to predict a large family
of stable boron monoelemental, hollow fullerenes with magic numbers 32+8k
(k>=0). The remarkable stabilities of these new boron fullerenes are then
studied by intense ab initio calculations. An electron counting rule as well as
an isolated hollow rule are proposed to readily show the high stability and the
electronic bonding property, which are also revealed applicable to a number of
newly predicted boron sheets and nanotubes.
