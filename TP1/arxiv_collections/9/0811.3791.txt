The global in-time semiclassical and relaxation limits of the bipolar quantum
hydrodynamic model for semiconductors are investigated in $R^3$. We prove that
the unique strong solution converges globally in time to the strong solution of
classical bipolar hydrodynamical equation in the process of semiclassical limit
and to that of the classical Drift-Diffusion system under the combined
relaxation and semiclassical limits.
