Two particle correlation data from the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider have
provided detailed femtoscopic information describing the space-time structure
of the emission of pions. This data had avoided description with
hydrodynamic-based approaches, in contrast to the success of hydrodynamics in
reproducing other classes of observables. This failure has inspired the term
``HBT puzzle'', where HBT refers to femtoscopic studies which were originally
based on Hanbury-Brown Twiss interferometry. Here, the puzzle is shown to
originate not from a single shortcoming of hydrodynamic models, but the
combination of several effects: mainly including pre-thermalized acceleration,
using a stiffer equation of state, and adding viscous corrections.
