We present a mean field model for coagulation ($A+A\to A$) and annihilation
($A+A\to 0$) reactions on lattices of traps with a distribution of depths
reflected in a distribution of mean escape times. The escape time from each
trap is exponentially distributed about the mean for that trap, and the
distribution of mean escape times is a power law. Even in the absence of
reactions, the distribution of particles over sites changes with time as
particles are caught in ever deeper traps, that is, the distribution exhibits
aging. Our main goal is to explore whether the reactions lead to further (time
dependent) changes in this distribution.
